1) Throws ball away to avoid sack

2) Terry dropped a perfect pass

3) Bad INT after staring down Cam and throwing off his back foot

4) Receiver caught the ball with a foot out of bounds

6) To an open Logan Thomas but tipped by DeMarcus Lawrence

7) Terry was covered but he tested the narrow window of some good defense by the CB. Ball placement wasn‚Äôt where it needed to be

""In a typical team sales process, the banker, in this case, Bank of America, will gauge the market and invite prospective buyers to submit the indications of interest. There is no obligation at this stage, and the figure included is malleable. Not every group that submits an indication of interest will move forward.

The buyers are then usually screened by the respective leagues and then given access to team financials, though many of the bidders, like Harris, have already been reviewed by the NFL during the sale of the Denver Broncos. **During this period, it is not uncommon for these potential owners to take tours like Harris‚Äô.** The process then moves to binding bids, which those familiar with the sale process again said are due in the coming weeks for the Commanders.

5736,65180,65180,Garp74,"Being an NFL head coach is a specialized skill. In part it's about leadership, in part it's knowing how to effectively manage a staff of managers, it's about managing up to a GM and owner, it's about dealing with the pressures of the press and the fans, and it's about building and maintaining a winning culture.

If you think about it, the vast majority of men who become NFL head coaches fail. They lose. They don't create a winning culture and they don't succeed.  They're failures at being an NFL HC.  And it's not because they didn't have a QB, or they had a bad cap, or whatever. It's because being an NFL HC is a specialized skill, and they don't have it.  

It's why the trend of hiring the hot Coordinator is such a bad one. These guys top out at Coordinator and fail as HC's because being a Coordinator and being a HC are two totally different skill sets.

And it's why guys like Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay succeed - because their dad (Kyle) and grandad (Sean) were successful HCs, they have the gene for it, and they have 30+ years of experience watching successful HCs be successful HCs. They've worked to be a HC their whole life, whether they knew it or not.

Coach Rivera succeeds on a lot of what I'm describing. But he's still a loser HC.  So what separates a guy like Rivera from a guy like McVay or maybe a guy like Brian Daboll or Nick Sirianni (who look good so far, but have a long way to go to prove greatness)? I'm not sure. I think some of it is entrusting too many coaching slots to guys he knows, rather than finding the best and most advanced coaches. Maybe?

5749,65230,65230,Garp74," Brown‚Äôs career is accelerating at the right time. He understands  where the league is going and has been a part of shaping its current arc  even as he maintains his own individuality and uses his own voice.  Wherever he ascends, it won‚Äôt simply be because he comes from the McVay  system, or because he is now following a preordained path in a league  that still hungrily seeks the next McVay.

‚ÄúI always try to figure  out how to add different things to who I am without changing who I am,‚Äù  he said, ‚ÄúI see Sean do it. He‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve been around, by far, in  every category.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be Sean. I‚Äôm not trying to be like Sean, and Sean knows that. I couldn‚Äôt if I tried.‚Äù

Brown‚Äôs  name continues to come up in coaching and executive circles, and league  sources say that multiple team decision-makers have expressed interest  in keeping him on their radars ahead of future hiring cycles. Everybody  who meets Brown believes he‚Äôll be a head coach someday. Often, and  unprompted, they add that when he does get an opportunity, he‚Äôll be  there for a decade or longer.

Meanwhile, Brown is focused on  preparing the Rams to defend their Super Bowl title, helping to refine  their ever-evolving offense as they try to stay ahead of a league that  is hunting them.

He and Jessica still sometimes laugh in  disbelief. Only a few years ago, the two of them thought they‚Äôd be  living quietly in the country by now, away from the spotlight and  frenetic impermanence of football in which they‚Äôve lived for so long.

But  Brown can‚Äôt shut off that part of himself that dreams up roster-builds  and schematic wrinkles, that studies with and connects to others, that  wants to teach and build and grow ‚Äî and that is perhaps calling him  toward something greater in a unique time in the NFL‚Äôs schematic and  social history.

It can be a complicated feeling when a person  realizes they may be meant for more. Some run from their destiny. As  always, Brown runs directly at it.",3.0,commanders,t3_10h2slt,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T11:49:36Z,commanders,3.539697632133241e-05
5750,65231,65231,Garp74," As the McVay/Shanahan offenses continue their momentum as the  league‚Äôs dominant systems, defenses are adjusting. The Rams remain  unique in their understanding of this shift, because they were at the  center of it.

The Patriots held the Rams to 3 points in a  frustrating Super Bowl LIII loss due in large part to New England  installing concepts from the Vic Fangio defensive system after Fangio‚Äôs [Bears](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/bears/) helped outline the earliest defensive blueprint that could beat McVay and his juggernaut offense.

In 2020, [McVay hired Fangio disciple and current Chargers head coach Brandon Staley](https://theathletic.com/2767658/2021/09/09/sean-mcvay-brandon-staley-and-their-clashing-football-evolutions-that-could-shape-the-direction-of-the-nfl/?source=emp_shared_article)  in hopes he could bottle this defense for himself. Simultaneously, and  with Brown and O‚ÄôConnell assisting as two new offensive hires,  practicing against it every day allowed the Rams to troubleshoot and  eventually evolve their own offense. After the Rams won the Super Bowl  last season, the successful pairing has sparked a trend of matching the  opposing systems together under one roof, not only to catch the modern  schematic wave but also so that coaches could have a ‚Äúcontrol group‚Äù to  study both systems.

In addition to the Rams, the teams that will open the 2022 season with McVay/Fangio system pairings include the [Denver Broncos](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/broncos/), [Green Bay Packers](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/packers/), Minnesota Vikings and [perhaps even the Seattle Seahawks](https://theathletic.com/3311028/2022/05/24/vic-fangio-defense-analysis/), whose head coach, Pete Carroll, led the league‚Äôs last major defensive scheme change.

Coaches  who understand both sides of the philosophical coin could be of the  greatest interest to hiring powers moving forward. Brown, who long ago  made a habit of watching all of the Rams‚Äô offensive and defensive  cut-ups through each week of practice, is endlessly fascinated by how  both sides of the ball have changed and reacted to one another and how  those micro-reactions can create league-wide change in scheme and  philosophy.

He has opinions ‚Äî and debates ‚Äî about the NFL‚Äôs  current and future schemes, the way rosters will need to change if the  league keeps moving toward two-high defenses, how offenses can evolve to  counter the second safety in the two-high zone shell so popularized  within those defenses and how the financial structure of football itself  will only get more creative to allow for this and other major shifts, [many for which the Rams have been catalysts](https://theathletic.com/3235709/2022/04/08/rams-nfl-offseason-trades-draft/).

Brown  believes in progressive football, but he also understands how this  emerging defense can be beat. It requires egoless play calling; the  coach or coordinator must be willing to pick and pick away at the  defense in little pieces with a ball-control run game and select the  most efficient moments to pass. The coordinator who wants to beat this  defense must operate counter to the convention and comfort of the modern  explosive passing game and commit to incremental gains without fear or  hesitation ‚Äî and while giving nothing extra away in the process.

It sounds uncomfortable, but Brown believes ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt grow in places of comfort.‚Äù",2.0,commanders,t3_10h2slt,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T11:49:23Z,commanders,-0.0095327678283219
5751,65232,65232,Garp74," ‚ÄúA lot of times, people will get criticized for what they haven‚Äôt  been taught and the lack of information being given,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúUntil  you give somebody else the opportunity to learn that same knowledge and  give them the tools for problem-solving, then there‚Äôs always going to  be a lack of growth and a cap on certain people‚Äôs ability.‚Äù

So as  he and McVay mapped out his new position, Brown began to see the new  role as an opportunity to challenge himself. What excuse could hiring  powers have for not giving Brown, a McVay assistant on a Super  Bowl-contending team with his hands now directly on the passing game, a  future opportunity? ‚ÄúI felt like it (was) important for him to narrow  down the list of ‚Äòcons‚Äô working against him,‚Äù said Jessica. ‚Äú(Brown)  being in the room *with* the pass game, and mastering it, was a no-brainer.‚Äù

Brown‚Äôs  willingness to take on the new role also captured the attention of Rams  players. ‚ÄúI think that tells you a lot about who he is, and how  comfortable he is with himself as a coach and as a person,‚Äù Stafford  said. ‚ÄúIn the locker room, that resonates with us as players.‚Äù

Brown  took charge of filling his former position and found 27-year-old  Ra‚ÄôShaad Samples, a bright offensive assistant who was gaining momentum  in the college ranks. Just 15 minutes into his own conversation with  Samples, McVay was also sold ‚Äî and the Rams hired him. Brown also pushed  to add quarterbacks coach K.J. Black to the staff as a member of the  Bill Walsh minority coaching fellowship.

‚ÄúWe want to create a  positive atmosphere that is competitive, where guys are really pushing  each other to learn and understand and know more so that we can give  better clarity to our players,‚Äù said McVay, ‚Äúinclusivity, ownership,  autonomy ‚Äî all of those things help lead to the culture and connection  we‚Äôre huntin‚Äô up on the coaching staff.‚Äù

By moving into his own  new space, Brown also sought to create additional opportunities for  promising young minority coaches on the offensive side of the ball.  Further, there will be no stopping the information flowing between  run-game planning and pass-game planning now, a structural change about  which Brown is adamant. ‚ÄúThat, to me, is one of the biggest issues,‚Äù  Brown said. ‚ÄúThe lack of information that‚Äôs being able to be delivered  to everyone who wants the information.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòIf I‚Äôm in the room ‚Äî  which, I‚Äôd better be in the room ‚Äî then you‚Äôre going to have access to  whatever I know,'‚Äù he told Samples, ‚ÄúBecause if you give me access to  information, you can get out of my way, you can write a blank check. I‚Äôm  gonna get whatever I want because I understand what I‚Äôm gonna be about,  how I‚Äôm gonna go about my business work-wise.‚Äù",2.0,commanders,t3_10h2slt,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T11:49:07Z,commanders,0.0058306179537625
5752,65233,65233,Garp74," In the years after his appointment as the Rams‚Äô then-30-year-old head  coach in 2017, McVay‚Äôs highly productive and quarterback-friendly  offense ‚Äî as well as the then-similar scheme cultivated by former  colleague and current division rival Kyle Shanahan ‚Äî have been coveted  by those with hiring power across the league. Four of McVay‚Äôs former  coordinators or assistants (two OCs, one defensive coordinator and one  quarterbacks coach) are now head coaches, while many more pollinate the  sport with his system via various assistant posts across college and pro  football.

As the NFL enjoys an explosion of productive offenses,  all eyes are on the people who coach quarterbacks and coordinate the  passing game. But opportunities in those spaces have been sparse for  minority coaches.

[According to a study conducted by *The Athletic* in 2020](https://theathletic.com/2065600/2020/09/25/opening-the-valve-what-the-nfl-is-doing-about-its-coaching-diversity-problem/?source=emp_shared_article),  since 2013, of all coaching roles with ‚Äúquarterbacks‚Äù or ‚Äúoffensive  coordinator‚Äù in the title, just 8 percent were filled by minority  coaches. And while team owners and league executives have trended toward  promoting offensive-minded staff ‚Äî especially into head-coaching roles ‚Äî  the study also found that minority coaches have been disproportionately  concentrated on the defensive side of the ball.

The NFL is currently being sued by former [Dolphins](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/dolphins/) head coach Brian Flores, now a [Steelers](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/steelers/)  assistant, over allegations of discriminatory hiring practices. In  2022, nine teams had to fill their head coaching position and only two  hired minority head coaches ([Houston](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/texans/)‚Äôs  Lovie Smith, who is Black, and Miami‚Äôs Mike McDaniel, who identifies as  bi-racial). After Todd Bowles was promoted into the role in Tampa Bay  upon the recommendation of Bruce Arians, who retired in late March,  there are just six minority head coaches in the NFL in 2022.

Brown  is committed to finding solutions. He was among the Rams‚Äô  representatives at the NFL‚Äôs inaugural diversity seminar at the league‚Äôs  meetings in Atlanta earlier this summer and presented at the Ozzie  Newsome GM/QB coaching summit at the NFL offices in late June. But he  recognizes that impactful change needs to happen on a team level, too ‚Äî  not just via the NFL‚Äôs attempts at broader league-wide programming.

As  the Rams entered the playoffs in 2021, Brown had an initial interview  with the Dolphins for their head coaching vacancy, while defensive  coordinator Raheem Morris (another viable head coaching candidate on  McVay‚Äôs staff) had just one interview request through the full hiring  period. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reflection of how far we have to go,‚Äù McVay said of  Morris this spring, ‚Äúbecause he‚Äôs one of the best coaches in the world,  and the fact that he isn‚Äôt a head coach is a crime.‚Äù

Brown, who  some thought would be a top candidate for the Rams‚Äô offensive  coordinator vacancy (previous OC Kevin O‚ÄôConnell was hired as the [Vikings](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/vikings/)  head coach in the spring), was instead moved laterally into the Rams‚Äô  tight ends coach role after O‚ÄôConnell hired former assistant Wes  Phillips as his offensive coordinator in Minnesota (a position Brown  also interviewed for). McVay hired Liam Coen, a former offensive  assistant who was Kentucky‚Äôs offensive coordinator in 2021, as OC.

‚ÄúThe  more exposure that you get to different spots, the more versatile and  the better coach you‚Äôre going to become,‚Äù said McVay of moving Brown to  tight ends coach. ‚ÄúFor me, one of the most valuable things that I ever  did was coaching the tight ends.‚Äù

Like many of the twists and  turns in Brown‚Äôs coaching journey to this point, the position change was  not one he was expecting. Brown has been an offensive coordinator (at  the University of Miami from 2016-18) and called plays at the college  level ‚Äî a popular item on executives‚Äô hiring checklists, despite the  fact that that NFL head coaches usually retain the majority of  play-calling duties on their respective sides of the ball. Further, in  every college or pro organization where he has been a running backs  coach, Brown discovered that the game-planning meetings for the passing  game were largely separated from the run game.",2.0,commanders,t3_10h2slt,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T11:48:52Z,commanders,-0.0010653026508038
5753,65234,65234,Garp74," ‚ÄúWhether you‚Äôre the janitor or you‚Äôre Sean McVay, I‚Äôm going to treat  you the same,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúI respect your authority ‚Ä¶ but some people  place their value of others on their position in life, and I don‚Äôt  understand that at all.

It‚Äôs a quality especially valued by McVay,  who praised Brown prior to promoting him to assistant head coach last  year for being unafraid to tell him the truth, even if it meant taking  extra time to work through a problem.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no ego when he walks into a room, but he walks into a room with a purpose,‚Äù Rams quarterback [Matthew Stafford](https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/matthew-stafford-H0tJFcdflWXgxumn/)  said of his former Georgia teammate. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs something we all  feel when we see him and hear from him ‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt fool the locker room.  Been around people who have tried, and it doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù

‚ÄúThomas is a special guy,‚Äù added tight end [Tyler Higbee](https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/tyler-higbee-Qlj6VmlY7NgrDnoy/), ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs built to lead people.‚Äù

Third-year  running back Cam Akers said that, more than anything else, Brown is  consistent in his relationships with players. Brown recognized what  Akers needed most amid the bright lights of his rookie 2020 season and  while rehabbing through injury in 2021.

Akers wanted to be coached  hard, but where some coaches would interpret that as an increase in  shouting, discipline or harshness, Brown understood that for Akers, it  actually meant sticking to a detailed and technical regimen each day. A  rookie starter who suffered a torn Achilles ahead of what many predicted  to be a breakout season, Akers had quite a tumultuous start to his NFL  career. Brown became a fixed point, at a time when Akers most needed  one.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the same person every day,‚Äù said Akers. ‚ÄúHe tries not  to get too high or too low, tries not to get too mad or take too much  pride in things because he wouldn‚Äôt want us to come in a certain way  (either) ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs in it like we would be.‚Äù

That literally spills  over onto the field, where Brown is an active and dynamic coach. Players  believe he connects more fully to them because they feel like he is *with* them, not just talking *at* them.

Sony  Michel has been coached by Brown twice: in college at Georgia and again  with the Rams in 2021, where he was a key member of last year‚Äôs Super  Bowl-winning team, just like he was as a rookie with the [Patriots](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/patriots/) in 2018.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve  been around great coaches; I‚Äôve been coached hard throughout my career  and throughout my time playing football,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut Thomas is one  who is still *in it.* He‚Äôs still running drills. He‚Äôs not just  telling us, ‚ÄòHey, go run this drill.‚Äô He‚Äôs showing us how to run the  drill full-speed ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs one of us while also teaching. He‚Äôs not just  standing there teaching, he‚Äôs a part of it, he‚Äôs in the action. He‚Äôs  giving us the best possible look he can as a coach.

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs his way of showing us, ‚ÄòHey, I‚Äôm here for you guys.'‚Äù",2.0,commanders,t3_10h2slt,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T11:48:35Z,commanders,7.184449069130233e-05
5754,65235,65235,Garp74," Jessica greeted me at the Brown‚Äôs front door for our interview in  late May. She floated ‚Äî she is a person who floats ‚Äî through their  bright, high-ceilinged foyer and into their cozy living room, where  Brown sat ‚Äî he is a person who plants ‚Äî in a square leather and wood  chair. He watched with an amused expression as Jessica, the  people-magnet of the couple, conducted a tour of their kitchen with  Bentley, a precocious Goldendoodle prancing in tow.

They‚Äôve known  each other since they were 14 and lived a short distance from each other  in Georgia. Now they live in a spacious home just north of Los Angeles,  where Jessica, a creative, runs her own business, and they  co-homeschool their three kids (Orlando, Tyson and Judah).

As  teenagers, they used to watch Sunday night football games while on the  phone together, each cradling receivers to their cheeks. Brown still  FaceTimes Jessica before every road game as he walks a lap around the  visiting field. It is their special time to balance each other as they  often do, now that their lives have picked up such speed over the last  few years.

Brown was a quiet, introverted child, but by no means  was he shy ‚Äî he simply preferred to study and learn people before  opening up to them. Over time, and coaxed out by his roles in coaching  and by Jessica‚Äôs own personality, that developed into a unique ability  to quickly read people and connect with them in their headspace instead  of forcing them into his.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a big part of my foundation,‚Äù  said Brown, ‚Äúmy dad used to call me observant, because I was a  people-watcher. I‚Äôd sit and not talk for hours, but I‚Äôd watch everybody  in that room, watch how they‚Äôd move.

‚ÄúThrough that, I learned how  to, I would say, read people‚Äôs spirits ‚Äî how they move, if I‚Äôm going to  be able to engage with you in a productive manner. In the world I live  in, from a football standpoint, it‚Äôs supposed to be all about  communication, about connection.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs hard-headed, too,‚Äù Jessica says with a chuckle.

Indeed,  Brown is notorious for sparking animated debates in the Rams‚Äô  facilities. He is still constantly analyzing situations and people, just  like he did as a kid. Now, though, the end of that process doesn‚Äôt mean  keeping his thoughts inside. Brown has learned to say what he thinks.

‚ÄúMost  people don‚Äôt want to be called on their bullshit,‚Äù said Brown. ‚ÄúI was  very hesitant, at the beginning of my coaching career, to open my mouth  and give my opinion when my opinion was different.‚Äù

He‚Äôs gotten over that.",2.0,commanders,t3_10h2slt,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T11:48:20Z,commanders,-0.0156418936789829
5755,65236,65236,Garp74,"Thomas and Jessica Brown exchanged a knowing glance as they reminisced about their last decade.

‚ÄúBecoming an offensive coordinator, a head coach ‚Äî those were *never* my goals when I first started coaching,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true,‚Äù said Jessica, laughing.

After  a standout career at Georgia and a brief stint in the NFL, Brown‚Äôs plan  was to coach his old position, running back, for a while, then retire  and disappear with his family into the countryside.

His plans have changed.

After roles at several different colleges, and unbeknownst to Brown, he appeared on [Rams](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/rams/)  head coach Sean McVay‚Äôs radar ‚Äî and McVay‚Äôs notorious hiring list. He  hired Brown in 2020, and just one season into his tenure as the Rams‚Äô  running backs coach, Brown was promoted to assistant head coach.

In  2021, during the team‚Äôs Super Bowl run, Brown interviewed for an NFL  head coaching job and an offensive coordinator vacancy. In 2022, as the  Rams‚Äô new tight ends coach, he‚Äôll help coordinate the defending champs‚Äô  passing game while his name gains momentum in hiring circles across the  league.

As a player at Georgia from 2004-07, when he rushed for  2,646 yards and twice finished top 10 in the SEC in yards per carry,  Brown seemed to attack the position with a specific fearlessness. He  dove into the contact with a clear-eyed savviness that switched the  advantage ‚Äî how could he initiate the hit, not simply be the recipient  of it? How could he create opportunities in hard-to-maneuver places?

Now  36, Brown admits that, for much of his life, he has feared failure.  But, as in his playing days, it hasn‚Äôt stopped him from throwing himself  into every opportunity.

‚ÄúI am not who I am, or where I am,  because of any successes I‚Äôve had,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am who I am because of  my failures. That‚Äôs what made me ‚Ä¶ Human nature is to run from problems,  to run from difficult situations and to run toward safety ‚Ä¶ (But) I  never wanted to be ‚ÄòOK‚Äô at anything. Don‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm ‚ÄòOK‚Äô.‚Äù

Brown  never thought he would be in this particular moment, in the space  between what he has been and what he seems destined to become. But  during a time of changing philosophy and sociology in the [NFL](https://theathletic.com/nfl/), it‚Äôs clear he is more prepared than most to meet it.",1.0,commanders,t3_10h2slt,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T11:48:02Z,commanders,0.0386181472674234

The NFC and AFC Wests were projected to have at least two wild cards each but ended up with one wild card each and a bunch of bottom feeders.

The NFC South and West were pathetic, all you're saying is that our AFC division was weak despite the Jags defeating the Chargers and the Titans almost being playoff contenders themselves... and that only affects four games.

When your entire division is at 0.500 or above, you can't question the superiority of their teams because they didn't have the advantage of bullying inner bottom-feeders.

Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder‚Äôs expansive Potomac estate, which has been quietly on the market for years, is expected to officially hit the listing sites as soon as Monday for $49 million, what would be a record fetch for D.C.-area residential real estate.
The aptly named River House, listed by Heather Corey and Michael Rankin of TTR Sotheby‚Äôs International Realty, spans just over 15 acres and features a 30,000-square-foot French ch√¢teau-inspired home completed in 2004. Snyder bought the majority of the Potomac River-fronting lot, at 11900 River Road, in July 2000 for $8.64 million from the estate of Jordan‚Äôs King Hussein and Queen Noor, then expanded with the acquisition of six adjoining parcels.

River House

The offering comes as Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, co-owners and co-CEOs of the Commanders, weigh offers to sell the NFL franchise, though the team has yet to publicly confirm whether a full sale, or simply bringing on additional investors, is the goal of a process to ‚Äúconsider potential transactions‚Äù that started in November.¬†

The Snyders no longer live in the five-bedroom, 13.5-bath mansion, the work of architect John Ike, designer Geoffrey Bradfield and Horizon Builders. Corey said TTR has privately shown the property for a couple of prospective buyers in the last year. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2018 that the home was available, but it does not appear to have been formally listed even then.
The property is officially hitting the market now to get more eyes on what Corey described as ‚Äúundoubtedly the best-built house I‚Äôve ever been in.‚Äù The main home, per the listing language, includes custom wrought-iron doors leading to a two-story reception hall and massive limestone fireplace, four bedroom suites with en-suite baths on the second level, a master bedroom encompassing the full third level, commercial-grade kitchen and breakfast solarium, a gym, spa lounge, library, office with built-in bookcases and ""an imposing marble fireplace,"" wine cellar and ‚Äúlarge mahogany-paneled club room."" A theater was installed in 2017.
At $49 million, Snyder is seeking the same price he reportedly sought in 2018. If it sells for asking, it would be the most expensive residential real estate sale in Greater Washington history. As it stands, Snyder already holds the record.

The current ask is $1 million more than what Snyder paid in November 2021 for River View, a 16.5-acre estate between Old Town Alexandria and George Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon highlighted by a 16,000-square-foot main home, separate carriage home and unspoiled Potomac River frontage. Corey brokered that sale.
The Snyders also own a 305-foot superyacht called the Lady S, for which they reportedly paid more than $100 million.
Daniel Snyder's yacht

River House in Potomac was built from concrete and steel and clad in materials the Snyders handpicked from across the globe, the listing agents said. The house, Rankin said, is ‚Äúunbelievably solid‚Äù and soundproof with a timeless look. ‚ÄúIt is extraordinary in every turn of corner,‚Äù Rankin said.¬†
The larger property includes a basketball court painted in the Commanders' colors, a pool, walking trails, extensive river views, granite-cobbled motor court, detached 12-car collector‚Äôs garage that doubles as an event space, two-bedroom guest house with spiral staircase, a gate house, house manager‚Äôs residence with offices and conference room, grounds landscaped in the style of an English garden, and a roughly half-mile driveway from the front gate.

""The 15 acres provide privacy and space that is unrivaled and unavailable elsewhere in the Washington region,"" per the listing language.
In 2004, the Snyders had 130 mature trees removed from their Potomac property without a permit from Montgomery County, a matter later settled through the granting of a perpetual easement, a $37,000 payment and reforestation requirement. The Snyder's land sits adjacent to protected parkland on either side of the river.
Multiple outlets recently reported that several bids for the Ashburn-headquartered Commanders were received prior to a late December deadline, but none met the $7 billion asking price ‚Äî the team‚Äôs reputation has been sullied in recent years amid allegations of a toxic work culture.

So if I understand you right, you're saying that by setting a cap, that essentially guarantees that QBs get a raise whereby in the current system, a faux-QB max will inadvertently be set just by the nature of markets?

>If these calls were for example to sign at 15% of the cap over term I would say its a win win for the team and the player, but the way contracts are structured now fall more in that category.

Also, by this are you saying that you support the QB max at 15%? Cause 20% is more or less an arbitrary number. It could always be negotiated to be X-value",1.0,nfl,t3_10w4s7o,False,0.0,:Commanders: Commanders,2023-02-07T20:50:17Z,commanders,0.0047324479999999
10662,93402,93402,Kwugibo,"First off, thank you friend!

Second, why don't you think a salary % cap for QBs would work?

Say we cap at 20% so guys like Mahomes, Burrow, Hurts, etc. can max out (similar to NBA) - that would always leave 80% that you can always be sure, regardless of how cap rises, than you can pay your other 52.

These edible cookies are kicking in so work with me as I think this through

But I guess I see what you might be saying, in that even if there's a ceiling, it doesn't do much for the floor, so it doesn't necessarily help fringe roster guys

But also, now you wouldn't have to worry about QB contracts continuing to rise. Back in 2012 Peyton set the new bar with his annual salary taking up 15.92% of the cap. This upcoming year, Mahomes will command 20.82% of the cap. Collectively bargaining for a QB cap that last, idk, 10 years could lead to a few changes:

1) A clear set marker of what a QB is worth. Is this good? Idk yet. If we see that Patrick gets 20% would GM's have an easier time negotiating contracts? Does Kyler automatically get his 20% or do teams have an easier time saying ""I'm not paying you above 15% of the cap!""

2) Might make it easier to provide valuations for other positions, even if there's no set rule. If franchise QBs are 20% then what's a DPoY caliber player, like prime Donald, Watt, or Watt? Maybe 10-15% ($22-33mm in 2023)? How about just a solid starting CB, 7-9%? Makes it easier than random dollar amounts

12586,102129,102129,Low_Brass_Rumble,"couple things immediately jump out:

* OL help. This is priorty numero uno in the draft and FA. Cosmi is decent at RT but may be better served sliding in to Guard, Leno is passable as a swing tackle, but basically the entire rest of our line is a black hole. We were supposed to have center solved, but we're constantly playing our 3rd-string guy (Schweitzer - good guy, pretty solid OG, but not meant to be a C) because the first two guys on the depth chart are always hurt. The ideal scenario has us picking Skoronski, Johnson, or Jones in R1 and signing at least 1 proven, high-quality vet to anchor the line (Orlando Brown and Mike McGlinchey are potential targets; I'm also intrigued by Ben Powers out of Baltimore).
* Howell shows out. The Tendie Terminator has shown some flashes of real talent, as well as some areas to work on. The current goal is to put him in the best situation to succeed and see what he has. It'll take a fucking legendary meltdown to be worse that what we had under center this season, but he's the one guy who can raise our level the most if he surpasses expectations.
* Better offensive playcalling. Scott Turner was a great play designer, but an atrocious playcaller. The guy *refused* to take what defenses gave him. He'd get cute and try to fix what wasn't broken, killing drives in the process. He was lost in the red zone. His play sequencing was totally scuffed. He didn't have a lot to work with at QB, but by all accounts his offense was this weird combination of overly complicated and predictable that made it unfriendly to QBs. We're crossing our fingers that Ron makes a good decision for his replacement.
* Chase comes back healthy and confident and lays down the law for a full season. Sweat is a beast and the depth guys held down the left side admirably, but the equation totally changes when that Young/Sweat 1-2 punch is on the field.
* Our young guys in the defensive backfield continue to develop. Benjamin St-Juste is starting to really utilize his length and looks like a legit outside CB, Darrick Forrest showed some really encouraging flashes at FS, and Jamin Davis took huge strides his second year after a disappointing rookie campaign, even wearing the green dot for the second half of the season. If those guys can keep growing, we're in good shape.

He also, for a short time, restored some semblance of organizational integrity which was no small order considering Snyder and Allen still roamed the halls.  

As for his free agent signings most were geared towards bringing in veteran leadership on short term team friendly deals, something we have struggled to do outside of his time here. He also uncovered some guys like Ty Nsheke who was out of the league and turned out to be an extremely reliable and valuable swing tackle for a time.  

As for the Dotson pick, I think people really undersell how much his Achilles injury and the nerve damage his rookie year affected his career.

Washington's DL did a solid job keeping Hurts from running. Only one sack in the game, but it was basically the biggest play - the Eagles last offensive snap (excluding the lateral non-sense at the end) with a legitimate chance to win. 

Even in the first game - I think Philly scored 24. A field goal was setup by a Smith ""catch"" that Rivera didnt challenge fast enough, one touchdown drive started inside the 25 after Wentz fumbled and another TD was two absolutely insane Smith catches. That's 17 points that it's tough to blame the defense for.

In that light, Riveria has been a tremendous success. 

* we haven't heard squat about Snyder interfering with Football operations (beyond the cluster fuck of a re-brand)

* indeed, our biggest problem is trying to find a way to keep one of our defensive stars that seems to want to stay here (Payne). That is a big change from what happened to guys like Trent Willams who did everything he could to leave.

* the QB problems were horrible before Riveria got here. Now they are merely bad and there is a good (but not great) chance we have a QB that will prevent us from selling everyone's first child to get a higher draft pick for a QB or crush the cap to get another re-tread.

* for all the lack of success on the field we haven't heard a peep about off-field problems, cheerleaders getting pimped out, and all other things that used to crop up like dandelions.

Jimmy G isn‚Äôt worth the money he‚Äôll want. As a matter of fact, he‚Äôs worth nothing because he is always injured. Bring him in as a coaching consultant, but not a player occupying valuable space on a 53-man roster to be unavailable due to injury.

Curtis Samuel is nowhere close to Deebo Samuel in ability and performance. Deebo didn‚Äôt have that great of a season, was injured for a few games, and they also added CMC to their offense.

You don‚Äôt want that at the water cooler. Fresh start is best.

Rebrand the team. Leave Football Team and Commanders, including Major fucking Tuddy in the past as Dan‚Äôs legacy.

Donate or convert FedEx field to something for the community. Strip all history of the team/era from the facility to neutralize it. Perhaps establish it as a nonprofit organization to run it, and call it ‚ÄúOverdue, over Dan‚Äù, and the mission is to give back to the community that Dan Snyder robbed and literally shit on for over two decades.

Rebuild RFK as the state of the art facility (not just in the NFL, but in all of sports) and build larger than life monuments of the greats, celebrating the rich history and culture of the Washington Redskins. Leverage that to establish a new culture rich in traditions under the new brand.

Hire a good person (culture) and strategic savant (dynasty builder) executive to run shit (difficult to just hire someone to do as good a job as Howie Roseman, for example, because he climbed the Eagles corporate ladder for 23 years since 2000). Do not rush this hire. Check tons of references and discuss/research around the league before making your decision.

Get the fuck out of the way. The next part is the responsibility of the hire above, while you go work politics on the new stadium, ceremonies, culture, deals, exclusive rights, etc. 

Empower that hire to do their thing with building out their staff starting with GM > HC > OC > DC > STC > etc.

Empower the staff to collectively evaluate the current roster of players and support their decisions for who they keep, restructure, trade, cut, draft etc. Again, stay the fuck out of the way.

Gently suggest that you‚Äôre open to investing more into the staff to ensure the success of the players that made the final selection (specialty coaches/consultants/etc.), and bringing in culture guys/mentors such as the Jay-Zs of the world and top tier athletes, and then stay the fuck out of the way.

Continue to celebrate and reward the fan base for their incredible loyalty, recognizing the trauma deep within all of them. Show, don‚Äôt tell, them you love them. Include them in the process with transparency that doesn‚Äôt compromise the vision/strategy of the organization. Get out into the community and work your ass off with a focus on community appreciation. This will help you sell out your seats in the new stadium.

Host free/complimentary watch parties for all games at FedEx (be a masterful fundraiser for the non-profit to be a valued keystone of the community).

Any sniff of a scandal, mistreatment of any employee, player, or fan, gets immediately acted on and proactively surfaced as a demonstration of accountability and transparency. This applies to everyone top to bottom. Hire a third party audit firm to investigate the team annually to demonstrate your commitment to this. 

Host events that focus on a particular historic player, game, season, staff member, story, etc. to keep the historical culture and traditions of the Redskins rich within the fanbase and the new brand and new facility. Do exclusive giveaways at these events. 

For home games, give away a few tickets to a family in the community. Share their story at an opportune moment before, during, or after the game. 

Do not, and I repeat, do not get in the fucking way. This is not about you. This is about football and the people who make that awesome from the staff to the players to the fans.

Watson was loaded with risk and accomplished jack shit prior, but it doesn't matter because any remotely talented QB gets paid. That's how this league works.

QB is the most important position, it's hard to find one that's good enough to win it all period. It doesn't matter if they're the best QB or the 5th best QB.

Regardless of what you think about Lamar, the Ravens likely win today with him, and I highly doubt you're going to have a hard time finding at least 1 team that feels they're a QB away, because there's literally at least one of those every year. QBs tend to take lower guaranteed money for teams they want to be with, but not always. Lamar might take less just to leave Baltimore if he really wants out.

Watching Sean Taylor play is everyone‚Äôs best memories but I have a few others that stand out:

Around that time i went to my first game in person and loved the COOOOOOOLEY chants in the stadium. 

I also really loved Randle El. Dude was a character. He threw a trick play TD to Cooley and it was the best thing I‚Äôd ever seen at the time. I thought I had remembered it wrong until I found it on YouTube a couple years ago.

We should have have changed the name earlier in the 2010's when the racial slur discussion started.  If we had been ahead of the problem instead of waiting to be forced into changing it, we could have gotten away with a new name like Warriors and kept the old logo.  The old logo wasn't a racist caricature like the Cleveland one was. Fans here don't do the chop or bang a giant tom-tom before games. Aside from Coach Zee, in the last 15 years it was pretty rare to see people in the stands in headdresses.  Only the name was questionable.

It's a shame no one had the foresight to know that we needed to drop the R-word to save the rest of the brand, but that's how it goes with Snyder as the owner.
