2558,34758,34758,DaBlakMayne,"Mock draft I just did:

**R1P4: C.J. Stroud, QB (Ohio State):** He's 6'3 and 218 lbs and is our QB for the future. He's at his most comfortable in the pocket and has a great IQ along with a good touch on his passes. Downside is that he gets ansty under pressure but our OL improvements should hopefully be able to counter that for the most part. 

**R2P35: Kelee Ringo, CB (Georgia):** Considered the most athletic corner in the class, this is a Ballard pick for sure. He's 6'2, 205 lbs and allegedly runs a 4.35-4.4 forty. His ceiling is high but his floor is a bit low. He's pretty raw and is easily fooled by offenses along with having issues with changes in direction. I think having him learn behind some of our DBs (assuming Gilmore comes back) would be a huge help for him to eventually start full time. But even if Gilmore is out, Kelee is projected to be a day one starter but there will be growing pains 

**R3P79: Byron Young, EDGE (Tennessee):** Is it a Colts draft without us picking a slightly undersized but athletic DE? Standing at 6'3 and 245 lbs, he'd be added to our pass rushing corps, most likely replacing Lewis and Banogu. He has long arms, is explosive and can play a variety of spots on the line. His downside is the fact that he's a bit undersized and needs to improve his strength. He's also stiff in the hips

**R4P106: Andrew Vorhees, OG (USC):** He's 6'6, 320 lbs and hopefully the answer to our issue at RG. He can hold his own against the bigger pass rushers by himself and is especially talented in the run game, he will move you if he gets his hands on you. His flaw is that due to his size, he can get beat by speedier defenders and because he's tall, he sometimes stands too upright when getting out of his stance. But he should shore up the line and keep Stroud from panicking along with giving JT all the space he needs to punch through the LOS. 

**R5P140: Rakim Jarrett, WR (Maryland):** He's 6'0 and 200 lbs. His big selling point is his high IQ, he can play anywhere as a receiver and knows where he needs to be once the play starts. He's also good at getting yards after catching due to him being hard to bring down. He however doesn't have good separation speed so he's not the ideal person to use for vertical plays, he's more of a short to mid route guy which could be great in the redzone but he may be limited to a slot role with us. 

**R6P181: Kenny McIntosh, HB (Georgia):** He's 6'1 and 210 lbs. He's a late round pick so why not take a shot? He's a dual threat HB and can play a role in the passing game that we currently are lacking without Hines granted Jackson has done a solid job overall.  He would be a special teamer to start out for sure but he could easily start making his way into the rotations on third downs and such. This also helps us in 2024 when all our current RBs are free agents, one less player we'll have to worry about. Let it be known that I 100% think we extend JT before 2024 but the backup role will be wide open. 

**R7P223: Kei'Trel Clark, CB (Louisville):** He's a hybrid CB who can play both slot and outside and is 5'10 and 180 lbs. It wouldn't surprise me if Kenny Moore gets traded before the deadline. We will need someone to potentially fill in that spot. I'm not saying Clark will immediately start but he could be in the rotation. He can play press and cover decently enough. He's also competitive and a bit of a daredevil who sometimes plays the ball instead of the person to try and get a pick (both a pro and a con).",6.0,colts,t3_10v60yg,False,0.0,Andrew Luck,2023-02-06T13:53:29Z,colts,0.0152788747204146

I don't wanna come off as whining because that's certainly not how I feel, but based on reports and downvotes, the majority consensus is to remove ""lazy"" (for a lack of a better word) posts that add nothing new to the discussion that has been posted dozens upon dozens of times.

So instead of having discussions sprinkled across the 5 threads per day, it's more productive and efficient to have it concentrated in one mega thread.

> Since at least the 1970s, anthropologists have described gender categories in some cultures which they could not adequately explain using a two-gender framework

> For our purposes, the term ""gender"" designates the cultural categories, symbols, meanings, practices, and institutionalized arrangements bearing on at least five sets of phenomena: (1) females and femininity; (2) males and masculinity; (3) Androgynes, who are partly male and partly female in appearance or of indeterminate sex/gender, as well as intersexed individuals, also known as hermaphrodites, who to one or another degree may have both male and female sexual organs or characteristics; (4) transgender people, who engage in practices that transgress or transcend normative boundaries and are thus by definition ""transgressively gendered""; and (5) neutered or unsexed/ungendered individuals such as eunuchs. - Comment from me: this is from a book by an anthropologist

> The Indigenous māhū of Hawaii are seen as embodying an intermediate state between man and woman, or as people ""of indeterminate gender"", while some traditional Dineh of the Southwestern US recognize a spectrum of four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man. The term ""third gender"" has also been used to describe the hijras of South Asia who have gained legal identity, the fa'afafine of Polynesia, and the Albanian sworn virgins.

> In a study of people in the United States who thought themselves to be members of a third gender, Ingrid M. Sell found that they typically felt different from the age of 5.

9717,84626,84626,Luck1492,"My 5-step plan for fixing NFL reffing

1) Implement a sky judge which can call flags as they see fit, or neutralize them, or show a different camera angle of the play.

2) Make reffing a full-time job. In the summer they have classes and practice sessions and rule review to get them prepped for the season ahead.

3) Conduct thorough ref reviews at the end of the season and discuss individual calls (or lack thereof). Make it clear that no one bad call would constitute a firing, but general incompetence or repeatedly missing calls could lead to adjustments in role.

4) Encourage refs to discuss more often on the field. Yes it slows down the game somewhat, but generally discussions yield positive results, and I’d be willing to sacrifice some time if they get the call right.

5) Allow challenges and automatic reviews for penalties. Like any other review process, it has to be clear and obvious to overturn, but this will allow for any errors that slip through the cracks to hopefully be mopped up.

Bonus step: Get the rules analyst to talk more - generally they can clear many concerns the average viewer has up. For example, one big exception to holding is the rip move.

9893,84907,84907,Luck1492,"A:TLA and LOK are both amazing shows. Now that  the new Earth avatar series has been confirmed to be in the works, I think it would be a really cool idea if the new avatar was a nerd. And I think it makes a ton of sense given the way the avatar cycle is supposed to work.

MAJOR SPOILERS FOR AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER AND THE LEGEND OF KORRA AHEAD

We know that the next avatar will always fix the biggest failure of the previous one. Roku let the Fire Nation become too strong and expand its influence too much; Aang put a stop to their imperialism. Aang vanished when the Fire Nation used Sozin’s comet the first time, leading to the wiping out of the Air Nomads; Korra brought back the Air Nomads with the Harmonic Convergence. Korea’s greatest failure was (in my opinion) the loss of her connection to her past lives. While she regained the power of the Avatar State upon reuniting with Raava, all she had to rely on was her own memories and Raava’s power, without all the wisdom of all the avatars before her.

In that regard, then, I think that the primary driving force of the new Earth avatar should be to build that knowledge foundation back up. Notice how I said knowledge, rather than wisdom here. I think based on the rules shown to us regarding the Avatar State, the connection to every life before Korra is truly lost. This means that the best possible alternative must be pursued, and in my opinion that is to gain as much knowledge regarding bending and the Avatar State and everything else associated with being the avatar so that it can be passed on to every future avatar once again.

In that respect, I think a genuine nerd would be the perfect choice for a new avatar. Someone who wants to learn everything there is about bending and the world and everything else would be the perfect avatar to pass on wisdom to every avatar after them.

As for the main conflict and their own biggest failure, I think there are two parts: first, Vaatu’s growth within Raava (as per my understanding of how the grow within each other) could pose a problem within the avatar themselves for the first time. In addition, while Aang’s story revolves around him growing into the savior of a world who so desperately needs the avatar, Korra’s story revolves around pushing back on doubters who feel the avatar is no longer needed. I think the Earth avatar should fall into a third category - people believe the Avatar should act as the envoy of the people, rather than the envoy of the powerful, and there is a struggle for the control of the Avatar. I think while this struggle may be more geopolitical in nature and of a smaller scale than that of Korra’s struggles, it is very apt for a nerdy avatar who is more focused on restoring the wisdom of a line than dealing with worldly issues. As a pretty nerdy person myself, I am better with books and work than I am dealing with people. While they will ultimately grow into a more well-rounded avatar, I think their biggest failure will be the alienation of the Avatar from all people over their lifetime, which will be left up to the next avatar to solve. Note that this is a different failure than Korra’s arc because Korra was doubted from the beginning and proved that the Avatar was needed, whereas people believe in the Avatar’s necessity in the beginning here but slowly lose faith over time.

I’ve thought a lot about this and I think it would genuinely make for a good story, but if anyone would like to comment on it feel free.",6.0,nfl,t3_10rrt9o,False,0.0,:Colts: Colts,2023-02-02T10:50:20Z,colts,0.0384602894315352

I’ve started a YouTube channel, and this is easily my favorite video so far. Andrew Luck is the player who got me into football, and it was really fun going through all of his games, and watching each of his touchdowns dozens of times.

In total, this video took about 25-30 hours to create, with over 8 hours dedicated to deciding the order of the plays! I am still far from confident on this ranking, and every time I watch it, I think of things to change. So, try not to take it too seriously, and enjoy these highlights of our gone-too-soon quarterback.

19583,137962,137962,TurdWranglin,"Colts relevant part:

“The Colts’ process has been an interesting one, and, honestly, I can’t wait to hear more detail on what it was like when it’s over. The first round of interviews, which were done over Zoom, were run by Ballard, with vice chair Carlie Irsay-Gordon (Jim’s daughter), director of team development Brian Decker and PR and HR staffers involved. The second round, done in person, has brought in more people such as Dodds into the loop and incorporated the owner in a big way.

That, I think, is part of why it’s worked this way—the virtual interviews almost served as a preliminary round, with the real interviews happening with a whittled-down group of seven.

As for how those went? Well, they were long (12 hours or so) and involved (Irsay got one-on-one time with each candidate). They were also creative, with one person informed of the process calling it 30% football, 30% leadership, 40% other stuff. And so it seems like if the Colts are going to replace, rather than promote, Jeff Saturday, they’ll have done more than enough homework in getting themselves there.

The other thing that I’ve heard that’s interesting? Every candidate coming out of there, or at least the second-rounders, sincerely seem to think they absolutely crushed it. I’ve heard that Rams DC Raheem Morris, Bengals OC Brian Callahan and Lions DC Aaron Glenn did well, with Eagles OC Shane Steichen having gotten the last crack at it over the weekend.

There is background here, too, that’s worth noting. Callahan is close with Peyton Manning (he was with Manning in Denver), and Manning’s word still carries a lot of weight with the Irsays; and Callahan’s dad, Bill, was on the coaching staff at Wisconsin when Ballard was a receiver there in the early 1990s. Morris’s ties to Indy are logical ones, too—DC Gus Bradley (whom Indy’s blocked from leaving) was with Morris in Tampa from 2006 to ’08; and Ballard’s NFL upbringing in Chicago was with former Bucs people (Jerry Angelo, Lovie Smith).

So we’ll see where it goes. And, again, I’m excited to dig in to how it will have all played out in the aftermath.”",29.0,colts,t3_10vaemq,False,0.0,Big-Q,2023-02-06T11:13:50Z,colts,0.0365522829919746

1- When working at a convention hotel whose banquets department grossed about $30-35M annually, we lost our food and beverage director suddenly. Like I've never seen someone in that position just outright quit. But he quit. The company did interviews, but in the time it took them to do interviews, I think they realized nothing was operationally not happening at a high level. So a decision was made to NOT fill the position unless it became apparent that it was necessary. And literally until the day I left, the position was never filled. This $120k/year job (in a low price market) just wasn't needed.

2- Saw someone SUPER qualified get passed over for a managerial position at the hotel because they didn't know what's called ""room blocks"" (basically how to assign groups of rooms to a specific group coming into the hotel). That was the feedback on the candidate. Room blocks can be taught to someone in literally an hour. It is the simplest of tasks. The candidate that was hired instead within a year had a nervous breakdown, laid on the floor of her office and cried, and now is a stay at home mother.

3- In the grand culmination of my opinion, I started my own company! No experience in the industry or sales. And the company has been very fruitful.

23184,159452,159452,boyvsfood2,"Two reasons I'm okay with Saturday if that's who they decide:

1- Coaches are so much more the benefactor of their roster than the other way around. And we see examples all the time. As a Colts fan, Pagano was a ""defensive-minded"" head coach. Came to Indy and our defense was never better than average. Why? Well, in Baltimore, his roster was Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Haloti Ngata, Chris McAllister, Darth Sizzle, etc. In Indy, Grigson got us Laron Landry, Greg Toler, Art Jones, etc. They were all terrible pickups. Other examples would be Rex Ryan (same Baltimore roster that got him a head coaching gig) and Matt Nagy (had KC's offensive weapons and then went to Chicago where he got Trubisky to lead a lackluster squad). Coaches play a role, certainly, but not as big as people make it out to be.

2- This one is more about life than just football, but people overhype the amount of experience needed to be competent. Most jobs I've had that say ___ years experience required, when I'd think about it, you could learn all the things that job required in a week, and you could get really good at them within about a month with repetition.

Pagano was a ""defensive mastermind"" on a roster that had Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Chris McAllister, Darth Sizzle, and Haloti Ngata. 

Nagy was the offensive coordinator with the chiefs when they had Alex Smith, Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce, and a good Eric Fisher anchoring the line. He leaves and the offense gets even better and his new team is a dumpster fire.

Rex Ryan is another example (albeit with the same roster as Pagano - a roster that got two guys promoted that shouldn't have). Sean McVay, as smart as he might be, has benefited from his roster. Donald, Ramsey, Stafford, Cupp, OBJ, that 45 year old offensive tackle, etc. And this year, same coach and a lesser roster, they sucked.

Not only is everything you’re saying and arguing ridiculous, but it’s so narrowly focused that all you’re doing is showing your biases. Although your motivations for going on this crusade are unknown, I just can’t help but think you just didn’t like Reich because you blame him for everything even though not everything was his fault. So each time someone tries to make an objective argument about him as a coach, your dislike of the guy clouds your judgment and you resort to just making stuff up. 

Looking at Reich’s years in Indy and evaluating its totality, I’m led to believe it was a success overall, especially for a first time HC. The situation he was provided during his tenure was even worse than Saturday’s imo. Some of that responsibility he has to bear, to which he was ultimately judged and fired accordingly. The rest of it was a calamity of errors that starts at the top.

The ability to read a defense, go through his progressions, make the throws he needs to make, and improvise when necessary. That’s where Stroud and Young separate themselves from Levis and Richardson. They have the fundamentals. They make their reads and make the throw a vast majority of the time. Maybe Stroud can’t bomb a pass 65 yards down the field, but if he makes the right reads, most of the time he won’t have to. If we had Andy Reid, Bruce Arians, or any other elite QB whisperer, I would say let’s go for it. But the likelihood is that we’re going to end up with an HC from the opposite side of the ball.
