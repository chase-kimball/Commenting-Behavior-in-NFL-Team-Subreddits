We had one of the best linebackers in the NFL, former OSU legend Chris Spielman signed up for the team ready to spearhead the new Browns defense.

And we had owners both majority and minority that really actually cared about the city of Cleveland and were invested in the success of the Browns because of their love of the game and the city, they werent just money mercs.

But, of the 5 coaches that are last in their division, havent made the playoffs in 2 years, and also called plays at some point in the season, 3 of them were fired. (60%)

But i dont see why that's relevant. You can cherry pick any stat to make anything look good/bad, but when you start making your comparisons so convoluted, your point becomes extremely spurious.

Like i could say: *Every Michigan backup quarterback drafted in the 7 round draft era has made at least 15 pro bowls. Therefore, you should only draft backup Michigan quarterbacks.*

The point is that calling plays isnt uncommon. It used to be uncommon, but now it isnt. It is part of a philosophical shift in the thinking of NFL organizations. Whether a coach calls plays or not doesnt affect team success in any way. And if the coach calling the plays is good at calling plays, you keep him at that position. 

Some of the best teams in the league have coaches that call plays. Some of the worst teams in the league have coaches that call plays. Sometimes coaches give up play calling, it seemed to work for the Eagles this year. It didnt work for the Broncos. There isnt a conclusion to be made anywhere.

5186,34164,34164,DangoAteYourBaby,"Never once said 30 carries. 20 is the magic number and that‚Äôs not putting a dent in his longevity. And the stats disagree with you. We win when Chubb carries the ball 20 times, those are just the stats. 

‚ÄúIf a team knows you are running and you just have the ability to run, aka: Nick Chubb taking over a game, that almost never works out in the offenses favor. It‚Äôs just too easy to stop the run‚Äù

Sure, I agree with this sentiment in a vacuum, but it doesn‚Äôt apply to us. The thing is we still ran quite a bit to close out games. It‚Äôs not that we went away from the run game completely, it‚Äôs that we didn‚Äôt use Chubb. On average there are 4-6 runs at the end of every game that we lost that for whatever reason went to Hunt rather than Chubb. So if we go back to those games and run with Chubb instead of Hunt then statistically we have a better shot at winning. On average those 4-6 carries only puts him at 20-23 runs per game.

So I hear what you‚Äôre saying but it‚Äôs outside noise. They‚Äôre 2 different people. Idk why Hunt has fallen off but he has, and idk if Chubb will fall off, but if we aren‚Äôt using him enough to win games then what is the point? We need to use him while he‚Äôs effective, with the amount of touches that maximize his effectiveness. And when he inevitably falls off, we churn out the next guy.

5193,34173,34173,DangoAteYourBaby,"I see your point but that doesn‚Äôt apply to our season.

In our week 1 win against Carolina, Chubb ran the ball 12 times in the first half while the game was still a close 10 point game, score being 17-7. We aren‚Äôt running the ball to burn clock in the first half so those runs don‚Äôt apply. We go up 20-7 with 4:24 left in the 3rd quarter, and Chubb touches the ball 0 times before the Panthers make it a 20-14 game where the game becomes too close to burn clock. Chubb ran 8 times in the second half when the game became much closer, so I wouldn‚Äôt say he had more touches because of the lead seeing as we never really had an insurmountable lead in that game. Chubb ran 22 times this game. 

The Steelers week 3 game was a close game so no correlation there. The final score makes it seem like a more dominant performance then it really was. It was a one possession game with a score of 23-17 until the last 9 seconds of the fourth quarter when our defense scored on a fumble to make it 29-17. So there was never opportunity to run out the clock with Chubb in this game. If he was running, it was because we needed to score, not kill time. Chubb ran 23 times this game. 

Week 8 against the Bengals, Chubb runs 14 times to get us up 18 points halfway through the 3rd quarter. He then touches the ball only 9 times the rest of the game. Before we were up 18, we were up 11. We aren‚Äôt running to run out the clock only up 11, so I don‚Äôt count his touches before we‚Äôre up 18 as touches that would apply towards running out the clock. So we actually ran him less when we had a lead worth burning clock to protect. Chubb ran 23 times this game. 

Tampa bay game was an OT thriller and as we all remember we actually came from behind that game, so your theory doesn‚Äôt apply here either. Chubb ran 26 times this game. 

Houston game he only ran 17 times and we won 27-14. But this game is an outlier. We would have lost if we had to rely solely on our offense for points as we only generated 6 points (2 FG‚Äôs) on offense. Our three touchdowns came from a DPJ punt return for a TD, a Denzel Ward fumble return for a TD, and a Tony Fields II interception return for a TD. But still all that aside, Chubb only ran the ball 2 times after we had a 16 point lead, the first lead in the game worth burning clock for. I‚Äôm not counting any runs before we are up 2 possessions as runs designed to burned clock. He ran the ball 15 times before we reached that lead. So once again we actually ran him less when we had a lead worth burning clock to protect. Chubb ran 17 times this game. 

Week 14 vs Baltimore we won 13-3. Goes without saying this game was so close that we never had a lead worth burning clock to protect. But for the sake of the argument let‚Äôs count his runs after we go up 13-3 as clock burning runs. Chubb ran 9 times after that lead. He ran 12 times before that point. So even if you decide that those 9 runs were ran to protect the clock he once again touched the ball less when we had a lead. Chubb ran the ball 21 times this game. 

And in our last win against Washington we won 24-10, with Chubb running the ball 14 times. Chubb didn‚Äôt run the ball once when we had a lead worth burning clock to protect. All 14 of those runs came before we went up 2 possessions with a score of 24-10. 

So while I understand the point you were trying to make, it‚Äôs incorrect. It makes sense in a vacuum. But when you apply it to the season we just had it doesn‚Äôt add up.",1.0,browns,t3_10ygvx4,False,1.0,:chubbatman:,2023-02-10T04:49:31Z,browns,4.298466020342834e-09

One of the wins where he didn‚Äôt get 20 attempts but still won was the Commies game where Watson was actually cooking so we didn‚Äôt need to rely on him. And the other was the Texans game, Watsons first game back so we were giving him more reps to get him back in the groove. And we only won that game because of our defense.

That might help keep it‚Äôs quality and it should be fine assuming you bought your‚Äôs last fall, but if you bought the fall before that (or even before) I would be concerned with it‚Äôs quality. Even if it won‚Äôt kill you, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be very good.

I would imagine selling your PSL is going to be dependent on where you got it from too.

**Key notes from the 2013 season:**

They failed to improve on their 5‚Äì11 record from 2012, finishing the year at 4‚Äì12 their sixth consecutive 11+ loss season. This was the first season under head coach Rob Chudzinski (who was later fired after the season) and new general manager Michael Lombardi (who was later fired in February 2014). This also marked the first full season under owner Jimmy Haslam.

Turncoat Russell Wilson followed it up by going back to the ""traditional"" structure, which is also why not few people accused him of screwing over players.

So with the Wilson deal, teams feel justified in not guaranteeing deals again. The Burrow and Herbert extensions will be important and interesting crossroads for future contract structures.

My favorite around here is the perpetual ""should have run the ball / why didnt we pass the ball?!"" conundrum.

""Analysis"" is so focused on the outcome, that the process is completely disregarded. The past 3 years in particular ive spent as a ""baker hater"" i constantly complained about a lack of execution in many important situations, yet the more popular narrative was that Stefanski was obviously a clueless idiot. Down & distance, personnel, game script etc etc didnt matter. The play didnt work thus Stefanski was an idiot. As simple as that.

And i see a lot of this in regards to Berry as well. In hindsight, everybody wouldve drafted 10 All Pros in each of his drafts, easily.

But again, context matters and the context is that no two players develop at the same rate. Every player has his individual learning curve. 
For every Rashawn Slater, who was elite the second he stepped onto the field, is a Kolton Miller, who was labeled a bust after 2 years only to have developed into one of the premier OTs in the league in years 4 and 5.

Furthermore, because many seem to think that drafting is as easy as playing madden connected franchise, i want to stress that the real life NFL draft is a genuine crap shoot and i think many people underestimate just how much of crap shoot it really is.
A generally adapted meassurement for draft pick success is whether a player gets a second contract in the league.

https://www.dailynorseman.com/2022/4/26/23042105/nfl-draft-pick-bust-rate-remains-very-high

Take this analysis of draft picks between 2010 - 2017 for example. Out of all the 1st round picks selected in that time frame, only about 30% of the players signed a contract extension with the team that drafted them. Thats about 77 players out of 255 first round picks in that time frame. And again, thats first round picks. So you can get a sense for how difficult it is to hit on mid to late round picks.

Furrhermore i am an avid believer that you cant really judge draft picks, for the most part, until at least 3 years in the league preferably 4 years due to a developmental curve.

So that was an unneccessary long introduction, mea culpa. I just wanted to give some context to the insane difficulties that drafting a player brings.

Now regarding Andrew Berry:

2020 brought Wills, Delpit, Elliot, Phillips, Bryant, Harris and DPJ. 

We got 3 starting caliber players in Wills, Delpit and DPJ. One good depth piece in Bryant and 3 questionmarks. Especially the value for Bryant (4th) and DPJ (6th) was tremendous tho.

The difficulty with Harris is, that he was meant to sit behind Tretter and then take over. He had a great game in his start at C against GB, then blew out his knee in preseason. Again, context matters.

Overall that class is an A- to B+ in my books.

2021 had Newsome, JOK, Schwartz, Hudson, Togiai, Fields, LeCounte and Felton.

Newsome and JOK are again two very good starting players. Hudson is a promising developmental piece and Fields is a developmental player as well with ST abilities.

Schwartz (3rd) and LeCounte (5th) are clear busts at this point. Togiai appears to be heading this way as well.

Overall, i would give this draft a B- to C+. The starters we got in Newsome and JOK outweigh the bust of Schwartz imo. 

2022 is way too easy to grade, however Emerson was a terrific pick. Yes, i am biased because i was a big fan of Emerson pre draft, but i think it is save to say that he looks like a hit. The rest is too early to tell. It also has to be noted that Berry didnt have a 1st round pick, which is still the highest probability pick in the draft. So considering that we didnt pick until round 3, its still somewhat impressive that we got quite a lot of production out of the rookies per espn:

https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/insider/story/_/id/35463411/ranking-nfl-rookie-classes-2022-teams-most-production-value-star-players

Corey Coleman has actually played a down in the NFL, youre right.

Until a guy actually steps on an NFL field, there is a wide range of potential outcomes - and when hes on there, there still is a wide range of outcomes.
Ever took a moment to think why the draft is such a crap shoot and good GMs have a hit rate of around 50%?

I guarantee you, if you worked in the Browns FO and came up with ""hey, lets trade Newsome, a 2nd and another mid round pick for JSN"" they would send you packing in no time.

>I put in my points about Newsome‚Äôs play, his desire to play outside,

Which he still this year when we werent in nickel

>his desire to be paid like a top corner

He is entering year 3 out of 5, lets put off the money talk for another year or two, shall we

>This same place was begging for Garrett Wilson for Baker

That is such a false equivalency lol.

People were for Wilson, when the cost was 1 1st round pick, not Newome + 2nd + whatever

>You‚Äôre getting a great receiver. 

JSN has played exactly 0, in words zero, downs in the NFL. He is literally as likely to end up like Corey Coleman as he is likely to be as good as Olave.

So in your masterplan you are giving up a young, cheap high quality CB who has already proven to be good and is under team control for at least another 3 years, for one lottery ticket on a guy who you hope might be as good while giving up additional assets in the process. 

Thats tanking your franchise 101 right there.

And since you professed your love for football strategy, we havent even touched on the fact that in todays NFL you need at least 3 good CBs, minimum, not only as depth but also because a substantial amount of time teams play in nickel or even dime.

Oh but i forgot, finding good corners ""cant be difficult"" since the Browns traded away a 30 year old vet with 1 year left back to the place where his family was for a 5th round pick.  Youre right, silly me. I wonder why none of the nfl GMs has picked up on that yet.

Toney Clemons (2012), Justin Brown and Marcus Wheaton (2013), Martavis Bryant (2014), Sammie Coates (2015), DeMarcus Ayers (2016), JuJu (2017), James Washington (2018), Diontae (2019), Claypool (2020), Pickens and Austin (2022).

Out of those, Diontae is the only one i would comfortably call a draft hit. Pickens looks the part but has to prove he can do it again.

Claypool and Washington are meh, Bryant showed flashed but flamed out. The rest is essentially 6 guys named Fred.

Now, of course those 2 metrics alone arent enough to evaluate QB play. For reference, Justin Herbert also ranks very low in these metrics (shout out to Joe Lombardi).

Daniel Jones also ranks 11th in EPA/play and 6th in CPOE for an overall 12th in a EPA/CPOE composite. Those are very good numbers.

BOB was a confrontational, egomaniacal dick who ran two GMs out of town. He wanted that power and, with it, he anointed Jack Easterby as his right hand man. 

As a coach, his crowning achievement is a divisional game where he turned a 24-0 first half lead into a twenty point blowout. The man constantly estranged players (usually the best ones) while rewarding subpar guys who were loyal to him. By the end, he had become such a colossal prick that JJ Watt cussed him out on the practice field. 

The only thing I'll say in his favor is that the QB situation in Houston sucked for most of his time there, though I wonder how much of that was because he wanted certain guys (with Hoyer being the obvious example). Regardless, for a guy billed as a QB whisperer and offensive genius, his offenses never came close to the hype.

For example: Bitonio and Teller by AAV cost $7 million more than Trent Williams.

But we pay Chubb $4 million less than CMC by AAV. 

We pay Amari $3 million less than Deebo. 

Kittle and Njoku are the same. 

So we have more AAV contracts above $10 million in this scenario (which is probably not the best scenario), but the entire money being spent, by AAV, is even. This tweet also doesn't look at immediate future needs...the 49ers could go pay their RT McGlinchey, they could go pay Aiyuk. That puts them at 6, but I wouldn't say signing those guys are bad finance decision that sinks their team-building.

And in Bitonio's case it would be him cut/retire after the 2024 season, so the 15 million in cash owed in 2025 wouldn't exist against his AAV. We've paid all his guaranteed money already.

Mahomes got a 80.1 rating last year, also who knew that basic stats with 0 context could give a bad view, that's exactly what PFF is for.

Let's compare Gilmore's 2019 to his 2018 where he got a 90.9 rating. 11.7% missed tackles compared to 5.4, 13.1 Y/REC vs 12.7, 218 YAC compared to 94 on the same amount of receptions, 20 PBU's vs 13, 4 INTs vs 6. So I think the lower rating compared to his 2018 is fairly justified right?

The fact you think going to Antonio Brown is a good point is fucking hilarious. Find me an example in the past 3 years.

Jack ranked 50th out of 51 in Run Stops and ranked 5th highest in Pass Rating Allowed, I don't know what sort of dirty work he was doing but it wasn't anything good.

Newsome ranked 22nd out of 24 of players with at least 200 players in the slot in terms of yards per snap in slot coverage. He ranked 15th in passer rating allowed. He ranked 20th in yards allowed. What on earth were you watching lad?

Also just a sidenote, **teams literally use PFF for reports of coverages, schemes, formations etc. that other teams use**, this point is so dumb. 

Also, anyone who thinks they have a better opinion or understanding of how well a player has performed based on the TV copy while people who study film every single day and watch every single play multiple times, are so delusional. 

Maybe look at context: https://www.reddit.com/r/Browns/comments/zxs1w2/putting_cade_yorks_performance_in_context/

Yeah and if Pickens is open, he's graded positively for that but I guess you know more about how the Steelers wideout played who isn't even on the screen half the time than someone who watches every single play.

Edwards was drafted in 2018, I only looked at 2020-2022. McPhee was signed in 2019. Wolfe and Williams I literally mentioned. 

Lindebaum also gave up the 3rd most pressures in the league by Centers. 

Myles Jack cost them 8M a year, if you think a below average LB for 8M a year is a good signing than sure. I mentioned Kazee. 

Newsome ended with a lower pass rating allowed and lower Y/REC while switching roles but I guess that doesn't show up on the film you watched. 

So Rookies having a tough season but playing well in their 2nd makes them a bust?

Miami is competitive now, they might not be competitive two years from now, and you can't risk this opportunity betting everything you've got on Tua to 1) be able to play again, and 2) be able to stay on the field for a full season and postseason.

23689,176124,176124,deviden,"> It happens in soccer already. It's not a perfect system, still needs some tweaks.

I'm inclined to think it would work better in the NFL than it would in soccer. Many rules in soccer that are enforced by custom or vibes/feel rather than as written (in part because the sport can easily be made unwatchable through tactical fouls or constant stoppages for fouls, etc), and the introduction of VAR has resulted in a lot of frustration for fans as games get swung on calls which are wildly inconsistent from how the game has previously been played or understood. 

One case in point: Southampton may be relegated this season (losing hundreds of millions of $$¬£¬£) because of a goal ruled out by VAR, where a possible foul that occurred off the ball which had no effect on the goal itself was identified. In the past this never happened, the goal stands and the team is no longer in the relegation spots. 

As a fan in the stadium you genuinely don't know whether you can celebrate until a minute after a goal is scored. 

With the NFL the ""sky judge"" concept can work because every play is a discrete moment that can be called back, or have a timeout, etc. Fans are trained to look to the replays between plays, TV does that for you. Soccer at its best is a constant ebb and flow and the current implementation of VAR can be highly disruptive of that (it also takes way too long).

The danger of ""sky judge"" in the NFL is on highly subjective calls, like our old favorites: pass interference and holding. You could render an otherwise competitive NFL game unwatchable, or swing a one score game with these calls. Adding another layer of subjective human judgement isn't necessarily adding further accuracy (and this is at the heart of the problem in soccer - many of the refs don't understand the ""clear and obvious"" part of VAR). 

But again... much NFL fans like to rail against Team Zebra, compared to soccer it's very well officiated and has very clear and objective rules. A sky judge with the ability to intervene on strictly ""clear and obvious"" missed or blown calls. There's also improvements made like the fast review process that's come in this year which makes me think Sky Judge would work better, faster, than VAR's laborious, stressful and painful introduction to soccer.",1.0,browns,t3_10n6897,False,0.0,:crazy-joe:,2023-01-28T05:09:42Z,browns,0.009786218882812

Stefanski has had 3 years of having to build around QBs who need to be kept on rails, so the under centre formations out of heavy sets with run and play action has been the bread and butter for our OL.

Let‚Äôs face it, the last 6 games have been a scrimmage for Watson, a creative shotgun QB. Our efficiency in run and pass declined (not helped by having to start our third center).

Next season I‚Äôm expecting a shotgun run game to be the major emphasis for our OL. Also being able to run out of 11 personnel.

Fwiw, the Bengals didn‚Äôt tank - Zac Taylor just stunk as an offensive schemer and play caller until he landed Burrow - who appears to be the 2nd coming of Joe Montana. They had weapons.

The Bengals have got all those things. Landed ass backwards into having an elite QB and elite WR both on rookie contracts, so everything else on the salary cap side is EASY MODE because their most expensive pieces are cost controlled, but they should be credited for how they've spent that cap wisely and in such a way that their roster doesn't have any shit players. 

Everyone they have is functional/playable or above and their assistant coach group are all really good. I dont rate Zach Taylor much as a schemer or on anything other than his leadership, honestly, but with our Callahan's son as their OC and Lou Anaroumo as DC they've completely mitigated any weaknesses they have around Burrow.

I don't understand why Lou isn't getting HC offers because what he's doing with their defense - in terms of week to week gameplans, negating any weaknesses, fucking with the best QBs in the league, everyone knowing their jobs - is Bellichick tier.
