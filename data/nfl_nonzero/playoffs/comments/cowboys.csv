That‚Äôs not guaranteed. QBs bust way more often than not. And when they don‚Äôt, year 3 seems to be when they actually break out lately. Right now, Dak is the one who has led a top 3 offense for 4 years in a row when healthy. It‚Äôs not that easy to replace.

>Pollard being a top 5 running back has more to do with the scoring offense than Dak

Except Pollard played the whole season. The offense only sky rocketed in production when Dak returned. The real reason is 3rd down conversion rate and then redzone scoring rate. The Cowboys were 1st in both with Dak. 

If you want to credit Pollard with the redzone scoring rate, it‚Äôs still important to note that when you convert 3rd downs, you extend drives and are more likely to reach the redzone to score. That‚Äôs what we weren‚Äôt doing with Rush, but then were doing better than anyone else with Dak. 

And before you try to credit Pollard with the 3rd down conversion rate too, even if you just limit it to passing plays on 3rd down, the Cowboys converted them at a higher rate than any other team during the weeks he was healthy (implying it was Dak throwing the ball to convert those 3rd down).

In the game he played in, Hurts scored on 5 drives and punted 4 times, also with the help of 4 short fields. In this game, Dak scored on 8 drives and punted 1 time. Then of course the pick 6. No reason to think Minshew would match that.

> The 49ers offense flipped the moment they got CMC. 

It went from CMC getting 0 touches per game (because he wasn‚Äôt on the team) to 19 touches per game. The offense also wasn‚Äôt one of the worst. It was still good without him and became one of the best with him. 

Pollard went from 11 touches per game to 15 touches per game. While getting 11 touches, the offense was one of the worst. Then with 4 more touches per game, it became one of the best? The situations aren‚Äôt remotely comparable. Pollard has been on the team for years, used correctly or not. The Cowboys have had a top offense every one of those years, specifically when Dak is healthy. It‚Äôs not hard to figure out which player is key here.

The offense doesn‚Äôt even come close to running through Pollard.

Now here‚Äôs my favorite part. From weeks 2-6, the Cowboys were 29th in 3rd down conversion rate for passes at 26%. So Cooper Rush only. When you remove the runs, they move from 24th to 29th. So the RBs were actually helping Cooper Rush convert more 3rd downs. For Dak, the team is 1st regardless.

I‚Äôll do the work for you. From weeks 7-18, the Cowboys were 1st in the league on 3rd down, converting 54% of them. 2nd place was the Chiefs with 49.3%. 

Compare that to weeks 2-6 when Cooper Rush was in. The Cowboys were 24th, only converting 36.1%. I wonder why the RBs weren‚Äôt getting as many goal line touch downs during those weeks?

Another way to look at it: The Cowboys punted 40 times from weeks 7-18, which is 3.6 times per game. They kicked 16 field goals, which is 1.4 for game. 

They punted 23 times from weeks 2-6, which is 4.6 times per game. They also kicked 15 fields goal, which is 3 per game.

I think though, that they were at a crossroads. The FO has used the ""we like our guys"" and ""run it back again"" method a lot throughout the Garret tenure, and also with KM. 

Sometimes, you just have to shake things up and make everyone uncomfortable. Familiarity is comfort, so a new QB coach, and new OC and MM having more hands on will put good pressure on Dak and the offense to take the next step. 

So I don't see this as the blame game or anything negative towards KM. They just need to rattle some chains, and it is a lot easier to chance OC than to change a QB who just signed a huge deal fairly recently.

McVay, Shanahan, Reid, etc. Those guys run systems that do this constantly throughout games.

Not saying Dak played great, but he had no shot on this play. The game is on the line, and Kellen called a route with max protect and 3 curl routes.

I have been a supporter of Kellen, but man he has really not helped our offense out against good defenses. Last year, we had the same problem against SF. They are dropping 7 and we are running underneath routes into the teeth of their defense while still giving up too much pressure on our QB against 4 rushers. 

The way to beat a defense like that is to run the ball on them successfully enough to stay out of 3rd and long, and to attack outside the numbers and down the field.

I am a Dak fan and supporter. I can also admit when/if he plays poorly. I love the dude, but he had a rough game last weekend. He also has had some amazing games. He needs more help, and our oline and running game had just fallen off too much against a superior opponent on the road. 

To your point, sure I would seriously consider any trade that made sense for Dak. If you could get two high first round picks, and you knew that one of those could be spent on a QB of high pedigree (Burrow/Herbert/Allen) level of talent, then it is something that would have to be explored. We need to reload on the oline, WR and RB positions so it could make sense. Our defense is actually very young and coupling a cheaper QB and adding the right talent would be a strong way to retool this roster. 

That being said, I don't want to trade him for a late pick or to get a developmental QB that at best might turn out to be as good as Dak. That would be a waste of the development and experience our QB has and set us back. Fans seem to forget that it is damn hard to get a QB that is capable of overcoming roster shortcomings and knocking off the most elite QB's in the league.

I don't disagree that Dak played poorly, but having a game plan means jack shit if your QB is constantly got dudes around his feet. SF was able to get pressure on the edges and up the middle, and Dak was unable to get comfortable. TB did the same thing to Mahomes in a SB. There is a fine line between your QB sucks and the defense forced a good QB to play bad. 

Mahomes, Allen, Burrow. Doesn't matter how elite they are, we have seen these guys lose critical games in the playoffs when pressure gets to them. 

Its crazy, but both things can be true. Dak didn't play his best, but he was also going against one of the best defenses in the league at causing QB's to play poorly. I think a great piece of contextual information will be how Jalen Hurts plays. If SF pressure is able to get him off his spots, force hurried throws on the run and keep his weapons all covered up, then that is going to help alleviate the concern. Even if Hurts has more success than Dak, we have to keep in mind his oline, running game and WR's are ALL better than what we were deploying last weekend.",1.0,cowboys,t3_10lvqcu,False,0.0,None,2023-01-26T14:18:16Z,cowboys,0.0507679982256367

Both teams are really tough due to their overal design of stressing defenses in the running game, but having elite possession WR's and elite TE's who can kill you. They both also have a #2 WR who can punish your defensive scheme if you try to hard to take out their #1. 

To beat SF, we really need to do two things well to have a shot. Run the ball to keep their defense off balance (which is very hard to do against them), and get pressure on the QB and get off the field on 3rd downs.

And there is almost certainly one holding call on each team in almost every game that has ever existed. How we can go 7 weeks and not draw a single holding call against our opponent when we had the best pash rush in the league, and the player leading the league in pass rush pressures is pretty notable. It is certainly an interesting stat. 

There are other interesting stats as well, such as Connor Williams leading the league in holding penalties when in Dallas, and then goin to Miami and his penalties dropping drastically. Or coaches like McCarthy having ""disciplined, low penalty"" teams in GB, and then when he comes to Dallas all of the sudden his teams are sloppy and lack discipline? 

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and think that most of our failures are on our own shoulders, but its hard not to feel like there is some level of ref bias against us. We have just seen it for too long and too many examples like this. In my opinion, it is the result of the media constantly pushing Dallas down every ones throats, and those who were already fans of other teams (including refs, who are human) having a schadenfreude reaction to seeing us fail.

The truth, like most of reality is that it isn't that simple. Why do players make mistakes? Its because they aren't playing against air. They are trying to to athletic things and techniques against world class athletes at full speed. Each with varying degrees of experience and coaching. Its easy for Micah or Diggs to not get beat and to make plays if they are going against average college players, but alas that isn't the case. They are going against a team, who admittedly had struggles, but is also largely comprised of players who played at the highest level, who have won a super bowl and were in the divisional round over the last two seasons. Those players also work hard, have pride and get paid actual money to play football too. 

Face it. Its a coin flip tonight. Dallas had the better overall season, and played in the better division all year. We ***should*** beat a team who has had injuries and struggles this year.

Its not like a massive undertaking for someone like DQ to do this, and shouldn't impact his prep for a potential playoff game too much.

On the flip side, the NFL should should prevent this. Make it to where all coaching interviews take place after the SB ends. Or during the week between championship games and the SB.

To me, this is make or break for Kellen. Dallas has been very patient with him as he grows into an OC role, because they believe he has play design ability that is rare. His consistency on the other hand is baffling. 

We better see wr's getting schemed open tonight. We need to see a creative running attack that hits from different angles. Not just hand off into a pile of bodies. We need to see the return of motion, bootlegs, RPO's, jet sweeps, misdirection, screens, crossing routes, unexpected personnel groupings. All the things that give defenses fits. Where was this stuff against Wash? 

If we try to go out with vanilla shotgun curl routes, and handing off against a defense that knows it can shoot gaps and blow up running plays, then we are toast. 

Pitch right. Jet sweep left. Screen passes on first down when the defense is hard charging. 2/3 TE formations and pass out of them. Get Hendershot matched up on a LB. Motion Lamb into the slot and take a shot. Take a shot to TY on first down.

Also, you have to take into account what kind of defense the vikings were playing. I didn't watch that particular game, but was Vikings in a bunch of man coverage? That can create a lot of running space for a QB on pass plays where they just take off. Was there lots of designed runs? RPO's, etc. ? Just things to consider when comparing as box scores don't indicate those things. 

Overall though, as others have said, running your QB puts him in harms way, and we have had an uptick in injuries with Dak over the last few years. Ankle, calf, thumb. It is a risk. I would like to think that in the playoffs that we will see a resurgence of running from Dak, and that now that the games are win or go home, that the risk/reward is worth it.

I just feel if you look at the process, we have built through the draft, we have tried to retain our best players, we have tried to bring in the right coaches who could help. We have had franchise QB (Romo). We have surrounded him with weapons. We had a hall of fame pass rusher with Ware. Jerry didn't cause Ware or Romo to make mistakes in the playoffs. Or to fail to make the impact plays to get us one of those divisional round wins. We have had an all decade o-line and league leading rushers with Zeke/Murray. Hell even had our beast mode with Marion the Barbarian .

Its almost against all odds that we haven't been able to even make it to a NFCCG, but in no way can I look at Dallas and compare them to Commanders/Browns and Lions. Our franchise has not been held back by ineptitude from what I can see. Sure mistakes were made, and certain players/coaches didn't work out. Held on to Garrett for too long etc. But we have had multiple teams that were truly contenders that won division, got high seeds, were truly well built and talented. 

And it isn't that we solely failed in the playoffs because of bad luck. It just seems amongst the normal success or failure you would expect, that it was exacerbated by those other outlier type of things that make us feel cursed. 

Truth is the NFL is just a hard league, and there is a immeasurable balance of luck that mixes with actually running the franchise correctly. Coaching, drafting, health, culture, etc. For some reason we did the things we can control pretty well, but the lady luck has completely shunned us. Is Cincy a better franchise because they failed their way into Burrow/Chase? Are they better because they got the lucky fumble at the goal-line and ran 98 yards untouched? It is these little things that defy all odds that have setup them for success. Not some magic GM and coaching that makes them better. It just kind of happened and things turned up aces for them. Same with KC. That franchise has done nothing forever, and then just all of the sudden has the best QB in the game. Dallas just needs some breaks more than anything. 

If you are still reading this :), all of that context doesn't change my frustration. I am tired of being disappointed, and wish for nothing more than to see Dallas win another title.

With all the conjecture that Dallas fans and media create around ""X years since last title/NFCCG"" I feel like the only positive to come from a wild card or divisional win is to lift the monkey off the shoulders of the team. They probably get tired of hearing about the failures of legacy era teams and just want to look at each year as its own thing, which is the right way to do it. So hopefully for the sake of that, we can bury the blue jersey/road game/Tom Brady demons tonight and get to the next round.

3590,34679,34679,CompetitiveComputer4,"To be fair, many compare current Dallas to Dallas back in dynasty years. Back in those days, there was a handful of franchises that ruled the league, and we were fortunate enough to be one of them. 

Over the last 27 years, the league has pushed for parity and now you have much more balance across the league. 

Dallas has bubbled up very good squads quite a few times throughout, and probably on par with most franchises not named NE. But we have seemingly had an inordinate amount of bad luck in the playoffs. Whether it was just pulling the worst possible matchup in round 1 (SF), getting BS calls (Dez caught it), having unexplainable freak of nature plays (Romo bobble or Rogers throw to Cook) or just flat out not playing up to our talent (07 against NY).

When I say separation, I mean that if you have a speedy run after the catch player, you should run leading screens, slants, crossing routes to get them in space and make plays. 

If you have high point contested catch players, you run comebacks, fades, slants against linebacker mismatches, but not screens or crossers. 

Unfortunately the Dallas offenses route trees are designed for possession catches, not run after the catch. This requires the QB to make tight window throws, no matter who the QB is, that is the route and that is where ball placement is demanded.

No matter the quarterback, certain throws are demanded and this scheme is not QB friendly. Kurt Warner said it, PFF said it, Romo said it, Irvin said it. 

Yes the offensive line is on the offensive line coach which is why I said they will need to help him... if they can't agree on assignments, mismatches, time bought, etc. then obviously mistakes will happen. The OC is still ultimately responsible. Everybody knows that.

This was our last game(s) every season of Tony Romo‚Äôs career. 

06: Romo botches field goal hold in wild card. 

07: 1 seed/2nd ranked offense Cowboys score 3 second half points to a Giants team they beat by two scored twice. 

08: with two chances to clinch a playoff birth the Cowboys lose 33-24 and 44-6

(Side note but 2008 is one of the reasons I get so irritated at the revisionist history. This sub acts like Tony never played poorly or was never responsible for this team being bad.  Go look up his stats from these two games. All he had to do was not be terrible and he was God awful.)

09:  Tony wins his first playoff game. Proceeds to get mollywopped by the Vikings who were the better team in the divisional. 34-3

10: broke his collarbone with a 1-5 record. 11-7 TD/int. 

11: lost 4 of last 5 games to miss the playoffs. Cowboys scored 13, 34, 7, and 14 points in those losses. (Again remember this when they blame the defense for everything)

12: lost last 2 games to miss the playoffs. Week 16 was an all time classic between Romo and Brees. Week 17 Tony threw one of the worst interceptions you‚Äôll ever see to lose that game. (This was the point where I was done) 

13:  Tony got injured leading a comeback in week 16 just to get injured and have to watch Kyle orton suck in week 17. 

14: not going to relitigate this game or that play. I‚Äôll just say the Dez Caught it play is bad situational football.  The offense in general wasn‚Äôt crisp but it wasn‚Äôt specifically anyone. 

15-16. Tony broke a major bone 3 times in 260 snaps over two seasons.

However, if Dalton is gone we‚Äôre also going to be even more in need of another playmaker (doubly so if Pollard walks). 

An outside corner and another weapon are the two biggest needs IMO. Another weapon should likely be dealt with in the draft, especially with this piss poor free agency WR class.

Sean Payton? Nah. If the concern with Mike McCarthy is the narrative that he is just a regular season coach that can‚Äôt win in the playoffs, then Sean Payton is the same thing lol. Especially if we have to give up expensive draft capital to get Payton.

Hopefully Quinn isn‚Äôt gone but if he is, maybe Fangio is a great guy to replace.

Problem is Dak has a no-trade clause. Every Qb has it. Romo, Brady, Mahomes, even Carr. Meaning you can't really talk about shipping them off. And even if they do say ok, they  may get the last say if they want to go there (not sure on Dak's contract).

IF, and big IF, Dak wants a trade, his deal is still on our books. Romo's fat deal was getting paid out 2 or 3 years after he retired. That's the reason extending Dak is smart. You take all this big money owed in bonuses, base, pay, etc the next 2 years and you spread it even further so they pay is less but for longer so it sort of balances itself out. The QB has the final say if they agree to that tho. That 40 mill next year drops to whatever the new deal is (say 30 mill), and you can manage that a lot easier if you cut him loose (so you'd save 5-10 million a year in cap space and allows you to spread the cap hit of whatever to how many years were left on the contract).",5.0,cowboys,t3_10kl7xv,False,0.0,Roy Williams,2023-01-24T20:27:24Z,cowboys,0.0316083338572797

This comment alone negates a lot of what you are saying. Sacks are almost always **AT LEAST** 50% the QBs fault. For some QBs (Russell Wilson, for example) its significantly more no matter what OL they are behind. For others (Brady/Manning) they can read the defense, see the pressure and get rid of the ball before the rush gets there. They cover up a lot of warts on the OL.

Additionally: 

1. PBWR is the only OL measurement that has no inherent bias.
2. ""Time to throw"" stats are mostly useless as scrambling is a thing. For Dak, specifically, that includes a fair amount of rollouts. It also gets influenced by QBs who throw a lot of short/screens (9ers) vs guys who will test it deep.


You can have some warped opinion that Moore and Dak are failing, and the offense runs through Zeke/Pollard... But at the end of the day, Zeke and Pollard were healthy when Dak went down in 2020. Zeke and Pollard were healthy when Dak went down in 2022. Both times, our offense crumbled.

15432,125135,125135,Microwave1213,"[Per John Owning](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-top-offensive-coordinator-candidates-dallas-cowboys-kellen-moore) (Good follow on twitter btw) 



Even though he's one of the least exciting candidates, former Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer may also be the most likely to land the Cowboys' offensive coordinator job due to his familiarity with McCarthy and the personnel, in addition to his wealth of experience as an NFL offensive coordinator.

Before spending the 2022 season as a consultant for the Cowboys, Schottenheimer had three different stints as an offensive coordinator (New York Jets in 2006-11, Los Angeles Rams in 2012-14, Seattle Seahawks in 2018-20). While Schottenheimer truly struggled to cobble together competent offenses with the Jets and Rams, posting just one top-10 finish in points per game over those two stretches, his Seahawks offenses ranked top 10 in points per game in each of his three seasons as offensive coordinator. Over his three years in Seattle, the Seahawks' offenses ranked ninth in EPA per play (0.023) and 16th in successful play rate.

Schottenheimer loves to lean on the run and play-action passing games to create effective offense. Over his three seasons with the Seahawks, they ranked sixth in run-play rate (42%) and eighth in play-action rate (28.4%). Additionally, the Seahawks ran the ball on 51.5% of their first downs, which is surprisingly a bit less than Dallas' 57.1% rate in 2022.

Interestingly, Schottenheimer's presence as offensive coordinator could push the Cowboys to make ‚Äúinside zone‚Äù their primary run concept rather than the outside zone variation the team has leaned on heavily in the past (though Dallas employed a steadier diet of man/gap concepts in 2022 than in the past). Schottenhimer's Seahawks ranked third in inside zone rate (41.1% of called runs) during his tenure, while the Cowboys ranked 19th (20.0%) this past season.

Unfortunately, Schottenheimer's offenses were often criticized due to their predictability on account of a lack of creativity as a play caller ‚Äî those aren't the kind of critiques that will inspire Cowboys fans after the team jettisoned a boy wonder for this retread candidate. Luckily for Dallas, the predictability of Schottnehimer's play-calling shouldn't be an issue because McCarthy will be calling plays. That could allow Schottenheimer to focus on what he does best: designing an offense that intertwines the running, play-action passing and dropback passing games at a high level.

Cowboys fans will be happy to hear that hiring Schottenheimer would likely mean a move away from the hitch/curl routes that were so frequently leaned on during Moore's tenure as offensive coordinator. The Cowboys targeted hitch routes the fourth most in the NFL; however, Schottenheimer appears to favor routes where his receivers are on the move rather than a stationary target, as his offenses are littered with drive, shallow-cross, spear and ‚ÄúChina‚Äù passing game concepts ‚Äî none of which have a stop, curl or hitch route baked into the basic play.",58.0,cowboys,t3_10tqd2z,False,0.0,CeeDee Lamb,2023-02-04T14:27:24Z,cowboys,0.0084879836443595

Offensive playcalling with all the hitches and curls where a good fraction of daks int came from as well as being forced into 3rd and longs where a ton of his ints came from as well bc of kellens insistence on running on 1st and 2nd.

Something that hasn't been brought up with Dak this year either, is his record +stats vs Playoff teams prior to SF. 

Prior to SF, since he returned from injury in week7, Dallas played 5 playoffs teams (NYG, MIN, JAX, PHI, TB) *3 of which made the Div Round..

They went 4-1, with the only loss being on the road in OT to JAX, with the Noah Brown pick 6

Here are Daks stats from those 5 games:

(4-1)
34.6ppg (35.4 w/out missed XPs vs TB)

118/153 (77.1%)

JJ: 1,247 rushes, 85.6 grade, 34 sacks, 144 pressures, 11.55% pressure rate, 10.5% pass rush win rate. 

If micah kept the same rate of production with the same number of pass rushes as JJ he would have 44 sacks and *241 pressures*. Thats easily HoF trajectory.

Schultz got targeted a lot and produced great results, Gallup finally got targeted and delivered, who knew that's how it works..?!  CeeDee wide open, great concept by Moore, we will miss him when hes on a new team next year.

Defense did great let's hope these injuries are superficial. They really set the tone after the 3 and outs by Dak early on.. some sacks on Brady and an endzone INT. Great job

Dak has no right to be that mad at Maher for missing XPs. We have all seen him be ass and no one reacted like that.. he needs to be a better leader in that regard and go make sure he keeps his head up.

Great punts tonight, and that helped keep them pinned back pretty deep.

22520,185370,185370,Thanks5Cinco,"Heres my analysis for each pick

Torrence: Dallas elects to invest in the OL once again with Torrence. A Day 1 starter at LG. Dak is at his worse when under duress so protecting him is key.

Hyatt: He did have one great year of production, but that shouldn't stop Dallas from drafting Hyatt as they get a sidekick to Lamb.

Achane: A similar runner to Pollard, Dallas replaces his production but getting a Pollard prototype. Achane and Zeke provide Dallas with a nice 1-2 punch.

Moss: A physical type CB that we know DQ loves. Moss competes for the CB3 job.

Kirkland: A player with G and T flex is nice to have a bench depth player.

Gaye: He has all the tools needed to be a top edge. Let DQ work with him to help him unlock his potential and add to the rotation.

Bell: A smart savvy route runner who could help as a WR3/4. Could a sneaky good add for 4WR sets 

Young: A hardworking IDL to help along the line.

Hasselwood: A physical type WR who isn't afraid to block. Will help replace Noah Brown.

Duggan: Jerry wantrd to draft a QB and Dallas gets one in the draft

I went with the opposite of the 2020 draft. Dallas needs to invest in this offense with young talent since we're so cash strapped.",15.0,cowboys,t3_10s6miq,False,0.0,Jayron Kearse,2023-02-02T19:07:54Z,cowboys,0.0083569079441011

If you cut Zeke and Tyron you would save exactly $0 until June 1st. Yes, even if you designate them as your two post 6/1 cuts before 6/1. 

Designating a pre 6/1 cut as post only helps the players. It‚Äôs for teams who know they are going to cut someone later and don‚Äôt want to fuck them over by making them miss all of FA. 

If we cut those two we would save $10.9 (Zeke) and $13.6 (Tyron) on June 1st. June 1st is after the draft and FA, and when you have to be under the cap by. It doesn‚Äôt actually help us have more money we can use.

First of all what you have pulled up is a post 6/1 cut, which means we have to keep his money on the books until June 1st. If you notice that‚Äôs after the draft and most of FA. So we couldn‚Äôt do anything with that money even if it helped us. 

You may say well can‚Äôt you designate 2 pre 6/1 cuts as post 6/1 cuts? Yes that‚Äôs correct, but that basically only helps the player because again we have to keep the money on the books until after 6/1. 

None of that matters however because cutting him post 6/1 doesn‚Äôt even save us any money. He still has to be paid even if he gets cut. We would be paying him the same amount this year to not even be on the team. And then about $40 million next year to still not be on the team. How is that helpful? We‚Äôd be operating at about 3/4th of the cap for the next two years. 

He also has this minor thing called a no trade clause. So unless he wants to leave then we can‚Äôt even trade him.

26971,234109,234109,chezyt,"Sounds like we are the same age and have the same issues with the team. IMHO Jerry needs to give up the GM reigns. He squandered the 00s with hasty picks and the horrible QB carrousel. Since Stephen got a little control the picks have been better, but we still never see them go for big trades or FA acquisitions to make a real effort for a SB run. 

Also, the coaching staffs have been abysmal since Parcells? The Garrett years were stupid at best and although I like McCarthy and Quinn, the choice of another washed up 2nd string former QB at OC seems par for the course. 

We dropped Amari Cooper(probably top 5 receiver) for a 5th round for what? Yes, he got covid and missed games, but Jerry could have used the same hammer he used for the guys that wanted to kneel for the anthem but didn‚Äôt. TY was a help, but he was a good idea for a WR3, but our problem was that we didn‚Äôt have a viable WR2 after Gallup‚Äôs injury. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I liked Gallup before the injury, but they had to know he wasn‚Äôt up to the task after he came back. Cooper/Lamb combo with a shifty slot, or bringing in a deep threat and utilizing Lamb in the slot would have been magical. 

Also, why TF did we pay Dak and Zeke like we did? Dak wanted to set the market, but we should have let him walk if we had to. Zeke immediately fell off and we have all seen for the past few years that Pollard should be the feature back and he could be supplemented with a workhorse, but we paid Zeke too much after 4 years of the abuse of 25-30 carries a game. 

It‚Äôs absolutely frustrating knowing that you‚Äôre on the cusp of being considered great, but management keeps stepping on their own dicks.

>The team had the 3rd best passing offense in 2012 in Callahan's 1st season.

Callahan **was not the offensive play-caller** (nor pass-game coordinator) in 2012. They made a big show of taking away play-caller duties from Garrett after the disappointing end of the 2012 season.

>In 2013, his team passing and running game were not as good (both were outside of the Top 10 and the running game was bottom 10) but we were 5th in scoring. But we were still putting the O-Line together and getting them comfortable and we hadn't yet fully leaned on Murray just yet.

I beg of you, please refer to DVOA when measuring how effective a unit of the team is and how they compare to the rest of the league. It accounts for strength of opponent, situation, and is superior to using volume stats to measure their performance. Abandoning the 4th-most effective run game by DVOA to the tune of being 31st in rush attempts will depress the yardage ""ranking"" of the run game while artificially inflating how effective the pass game was in the eyes of volume-based metrics.

>Personally, we should have kept Callahan on as O-Line Coach and Run Game Coordinator and brought in someone else to develop the passing game and call plays.

We... literally did this. It pissed him off and surely fueled his desire to GTFO as soon as his contract expired.

>The offense wasn't radically better with Linehan and his lackluster playcalling in regards to the running game and passing game got exposed quickly.

Our 2014 offense was decisively better than 2013. 2016 was much better than 2013 as well. Please refer to the advanced metrics that adjust for the context and better measure true effectiveness.

30066,259288,259288,firstandfive,">Purposely defining your question narrowly so you can‚Äôt be wrong doesn‚Äôt add any semantic value to a discussion. 

Kellen Moore is an offensive coordinator. We are talking about offensive coordinators. The majority of offensive play-callers in the NFL are offensive coordinators. But even if we include play-calling head coaches, you still haven't expressed a view that Moore is outside the top 8? 10?

>If you know anything about the way the NFL operates, you know that good OCs don‚Äôt stay OC for more than a few years. Sean McVay got an HC job offer after two years of excellence at Washington. Kyle Shanahan ran the Falcons offense for two seasons before getting an offer from SF. I could go on. FOs around the league don‚Äôt need much proof a guy has figured it out to promote them.

Oh, you beautiful, naive, sophisticated newborn baby. Kyle Shanahan had **9 years** of NFL offensive coordinator experience (and 4 additional years in different coaching roles) before getting his shot at head coach. McVay had 3 years with the OC title and 8 total NFL years of NFL coaching experience  before getting a shot at HC, and even that was seen as a surprise hire. Of the offensive-minded head coaches:

* Andy Reid: 7 years total, 0 as OC
* Kyle Shanahan: 13 years, 9 as OC
* Sean McVay: 8 years, 3 as OC (play-caller for 2)
* Doug Pederson: 7 years, 3 as OC (non-play-calling)
* Brian Daboll: 21 years, 8 as OC
* Josh McDaniels: 8 years, 3 as OC for his first HC gig (with all the Patriots luster), 7 more years as OC before getting another chance which he backed out of
* Sean Payton: 9 years, 4 as OC/Pass-game coordinator
* Kliff Kingsbury: 9 years in college, 6 as HC and 3 as OC
* Kevin O'Connell: 7 years, 3 as OC (non-play-calling)
* Dan Campbell: 11 years, 0 as OC
* Matt LaFleur: 10 years, 2 as OC (play-caller for 1)
* Arthur Smith: 12 years, 2 as OC
* Mike McDaniel: 15 years, 4 as OC/run-game coordinator (non-play-caller)
* Nathaniel Hackett: 13 years, 7.5 as OC (play-caller for 4.5)
* Zac Taylor: 6 years, 1 partially as interim OC, plus 1 year of college OC experience
* Kevin Stefanski: 14 years, 1 as OC
* Frank Reich: 12 years, 4 as OC (play-caller for 2, I think)

So nobody with the mere 5 years of NFL coaching experience that Moore currently possesses, even if you cut out some of the years where people had titles like ""intern"" or ""quality control."" Additionally, not being hired as a HC is not an indictment of him as an offensive play-caller. Some people are just better cut out for coordinator roles than for being a head coach over the entire team.

&#x200B;

>Kellen Moore has been the Cowboys OC and play caller for half a decade. The fact that he hasn‚Äôt been poached yet pretty much makes my argument for me. Not every FO in the league is stupid. They can all see that there‚Äôs too much Garrett in Moore.

I think we can agree we just established that your argument is flawed.

As for your criticisms of Moore, some are valid, others are exaggerated.

>His situational playcalling is atrocious. It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt understand down and distance. Admittedly this point is partially covered by the 2nd and 10 runs point.

Is red zone not situational? An area where we had literally the best offense in the league at converting red-zone trips to touchdowns? Is third-down not situational, where we had the 6th-best conversion percentage? Is fourth-down not situational, where we had the 5th-best conversion percentage?

>He consistently runs away from success. We had the best success this season on offense with lots of pre-snap motion, no huddle tempo, and play-action passing. Why didn‚Äôt we do those things a lot more often? Smart football people like Shanahan, Reid, and McVay weaponize those aspects of play calling and use them consistently.

Our at-snap motion rate was comparable to the Chiefs this year, and we saw more of it when it mattered (in the playoffs), but I do wish we used it more so we agree on that. Our play-action rate was inside the top 10 as well, but it wouldn't hurt to use it a little more as well.

>Finally, my biggest indictment of him is that the offense performed significantly better in no-huddle tempo, when the play caller takes a back seat to the QB. Just like Garrett‚Äôs offenses with Romo.

Lol. You don't think that's something they work on specifically with Moore during the week? 

>I‚Äôll bet I can find a position coach to upgrade to OC somewhere that understands these things, and I‚Äôll bet that position coach will be a better OC than Moore.

Name names.

In all, I can agree with some of your criticisms. I do wish he was less stubborn with some of his early down runs (although I wonder how much of that comes from edicts from McCarthy or the Jones', since Moore has expressed a desire to be more pass-happy on more than one occasion). I think he should use more pre and at-snap motion, plus more play-action. We've seen more rub routes than ever during the Garrett/Linehan era, but would love to see some more. 

But just because I want him to continue doing *more* of the good stuff that he already does (and has improved at during his time here) doesn't mean he should be fired or would be easily replaced. Either you weren't a fan yet or you've already forgotten how stale the offensive approach got under Linehan. You forget how much of an improvement Linehan was over Callahan and Garrett's play-calling. Moore is a good OC, you don't just accidentally stumble into a top offense repeatedly with player personnel we've all been screaming needs to be improved.",1.0,cowboys,t3_10jsb09,False,0.0,Kellen Moore,2023-01-24T12:27:42Z,cowboys,0.0129277606031496

Because the topic wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúoffensive playcallers‚Äù in general, I quite clearly stated offensive coordinators‚Ä¶ as in the role currently held by Moore and the role we would be hiring for if he were to leave or be fired. There‚Äôs a lot more to consider when evaluating a play-calling head coach beyond someone just in charge of the offense. On that front, though, Daboll is not currently an offensive play-caller.

> Daboll developed Josh Allen and built the Bills offense. 

Daboll also has a lot of years of running bad offenses on his resume. Credit to him for Allen, sure, and so far he seems to be cut out for being a head coach in this league, but his resume as an OC was not as sparkling or ‚Äúconsistently developing QBs‚Äù as you stated it was.

> He took Daniel Jones and made the playoffs with him. He‚Äôs done more as an OC and he did it again as an HC.

Kafka runs the offense and calls the plays in New York. But surely you already know that because even I know that and I don‚Äôt know enough about football to have a fulfilling discussion with you :)

So have you thought of any **Offensive Coordinators** yet who are better than or on par with Moore? As far as play-calling head coaches go, I‚Äôll grant you Reid, McVay, Shanahan, and McDaniels as better than Moore. Moore‚Äôs better as a play-caller than half the play-calling head coaches though too. As far as OCs go, Steichen is up there with him and I could certainly see the argument for picking him over Moore. Ben Johnson is definitely right there too, and Kafka will be if he keeps it going in year 2. Other than that though, I don‚Äôt think there were any other OCs on par unless I‚Äôm forgetting someone.

30101,259334,259334,firstandfive,"Watched about 8 minutes of the video and do have some actual feedback.

## On the content

Think about how you want your show to answer the question: ""what do Cowboys fans get from your show that they don't get from the prominent podcasts or popular channels like Voch Lombardi, Jeff Cavanaugh, etc?""

* Do you want to provide in-depth analysis from watching the film? Dude on the right mentioned watching some niners games but didn't really touch on anything below surface level.
* Do you come equipped with detailed stats that we may not hear from other shows? Dude on the right said the Niners play mostly in base on defense... how often do they do that and how does that rate compare to the rest of the league? How has Dallas fared against that type of personnel group?
* Do you two have a rapport or a way of discussing these topics that people find interesting or entertaining? This video very much felt like y'all were trying this out for the first time (which is to be expected) and still working on finding the overall voice of the show. Do you want the show to be entertaining or insightful? You can certainly have shades of both, but I would think about how you want people to view your show and focus on accomplishing that.

## On the production value

If you're not going to have visual graphics on the screen, I would treat this more like a podcast (although you can still upload video to YouTube as well of course). That means trying to cut down or limit uhhs, umms, and ""do you want to talk about the Niners offense or defense first?"" A lot of that will come with more practice and getting comfortable with recording, but it also helps to have the plan for what to talk about outlined before hitting record, or editing out the decision points before uploading. For example, ask the question, then once you decide, have one of you record a lead-in to the segment y'all decided to cover, then just chop out the part where y'all decided.

Audio quality could also be better, but I think y'all need to answer the previous questions before upgrading microphones unless y'all have other uses for mics and the disposable income to spend. There are some ""getting started podcasting"" guides out there that have relatively cheap starter mics that will at least be an upgrade over those earbud mics.

For these first few episodes in particular, y'all should both be watching it back and evaluating what you and your co-host needs to work on. Back when I had a fantasy football podcast, I would always go back and listen for my ""uhh"" and ""umm"" or when I would overuse the same phrasing (""it'll be interesting to see..."") and at a certain point, I would start catching myself about to say these things while recording and could correct it right then and there. You might even consider recording the same segment a couple of times trying a few different approaches until you figure out the voice you want for it or what feels the most compelling.

&#x200B;

Overall, it's not something I would tune into yet, but if y'all think about these questions and keep working at it you can get there. Dude on the left already has a good presence for the medium (just need to cut down uhhs/umms and find a groove with the outline of the show and intros/transitions), dude on the right seems new to recording but will grow more comfortable with time.

I could imagine his agents arguing (like other people in this sub who I disagree with for many and varied reasons) that he out performed Dak and should be getting $40 million plus. Dak's contract was 21% of the cap when originally signed. The conundrum is that everybody would prefer to build around a QB on a rookie deal with very little guaranteed money, like the Eagles, and Niners, but those teams didn't *plan* to be in this position by getting rid of a serviceable qb. A qb who is just above average on a rookie deal is a big deal, and gives the team a huge advantage. If that is your philosophy the time to win with Dak (go all in) was 2017 and 2018. Players drafted outside the first round don't have 5th year options, so QBs like Dak, Brock Purdy, and Jalen Hurts who are marginal for various reasons present more risk.

42465,337054,337054,thatguy1717,"I want to start by saying that I appreciate your post here. I think you put in a lot more effort most posts I see on here. There are some things that I want to reply to, though.

>Trevon Diggs will definitely holdout for a extension. His market value is $16 million and we would be fools to let him go. That will happen around that price.

I think it's likely we extend him but two things. 1) we would absolutely not be fools to let him go. The guy cannot be counted on in the biggest moments to do what needs to be done to win games. He showed us over and over again that he'll run himself out of a play so he doesn't have to hit. That cost us dearly in the San Fran game. 2)His market value is much more than $16M. Jaire signed a $21M/year extension last year. Diggs will want more than that.

>Dak is going to get an extension of 5 years into his deal. Yep he‚Äôs getting an extension but it will help because money will be moved around to open up space this offseason. Maybe around $7,000,000.

Agreed that Dak is getting an extension. We have to at this point with him counting almost $50M against the 2023 cap. But the cap savings this year will likely be structured to open up closer to $25M, not $7M. That savings will be pushed into future years. 

>Zeke could get cut before June 1 and save over $4,000,000. He could get cut post June 1 (only get 2 per year) and save almost 11,000,000. However considering he said he‚Äôd take a cut and Dallas seems to want him back the likely case is he gets restructured for the same as pollard around $9,000,000 which still saves us roughly $7,500,000 in space.

Zeke will not be back on his current contract. You've mentioned restructure a few times and I want to make sure everyone understands what that means. It simply means the team converts base salary (the paycheck players receive every week) and turns it into a signing bonus where the player is handed one big ass check at the time of restructure. That bonus money is then spread out over future years. So, that $7M we would save on Zeke if we restructured him this year doesn't just vanish. It transfers. So, the $6M in dead money we'd have in 2024 if we cut him next year turns into $13M in dead money. That's not a viable option. If Zeke is back, we'd have to eat the dead money this year and bring him back on a brand new contract.

>Tyron Smith likely gets restructured or cut if he doesn‚Äôt take a pay cut. Currently he would account for $17,000,000 against space. Cut pre June he saves $10,500,000. Cut post June 1 he saves $14,000,000. However is he‚Äôs restructured to $12,000,000 he would save us $6,200,000 in space.

Same thing. We can't restructure Tyron. 2023 is the last year of his deal. There's a void year where we already have $4M cap hit when he's not even on the team. If we restructured him, we'd basically be paying $10M for Tyron to not be on the team. Much more likely he either agrees to a new contract or is cut/retires as you mentioned. 

>Josh ball didn‚Äôt lived up to expectations and both would save $800,000.

Something else I think is important to understand is the Top 51 Rule. That basically says that prior to the season, only the top 51 salaries count against the salary cap. So, if someone in the top 51 is cut, whoever had the 52nd highest salary moves into the top 51 and their salary counts. In the case of Josh Ball, we would remove his $815K from the roster, but then it'd be replaced by Isaac Alercon's $750K for a total savings of $65K.

>LVE will be one they bring back without question but only if he doesn‚Äôt expect a huge pay raise. Last year he resigned after two injury riddled season and lackluster play for only $2 million. After a leap back he will likely bring in around $3,000,000 or a little more but not much. If he comes back Donovan Wilson or Fowler jr may not. Personally I think Fowler is more replaceable than LVE considering the rise of Sam Williams and Armstrong.

I agree it is much more likely that LVE and Wilson are back over Fowler. With Parsons, Tank, Armostrong, and Williams along with a potential draft pick, I don't see us spending money at DE in FA. LVE will need to come back at a price, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's more than what you wrote. I'm guessing 2 years $12Mish. Players always sign for more than what we think they will.

**EDIT**

>Steele will likely be brought back on a RFA tender as a udfa for around $2,500,000 (that‚Äôs a steal!)

I wanted to add this as well. I doubt we put the Right of First Refusal RFA tender on Steele. He's a starting RT in this league so someone is going to give him an offer sheet. If he comes back to us from a team that is loaded with cap space who wants to pay him $12M/year or something, we're fucked. We lose him and don't get anything in return. It's more likely we either give him a 1st or 2nd round tender so we'd at least get a draft pick back if he leaves or we will try to leverage his ACL injury into a moderately priced long-term contract. We did something very similar with La'el Collins when we extended him early at a moderate price rather than him playing on a RFA tender.",4.0,cowboys,t3_10sq6vh,False,0.0,None,2023-02-03T12:40:14Z,cowboys,0.0029241357699364
