3885,58958,58958,Giannis__is_a__bitch,"> Am currently arguing with a Niners fan that Trey lance is a bust and wasted first round pick sighting that Brock Purdy was a plug and play NFL ready QB. He says that Purdy is just serviceable and isn’t a great starter and that Trey has a higher ceiling than Brock which seems crazy to me because Trey has really not played very spectacularly like Purdy did.

I totally agree with the whiner fan. Lance is a raw, DT QB and Purdy came from a major conference and is a pocket passer. The league is designed to be a smooth transition for guys like Purdy, guys like Lance (the mobile QB who can just hack opposing defenses by giving his WRs an extra 2-4 secs every play) are more unstoppable than great pocket passers, but take more time to become elite and sometimes dont get there at all. 


> I’ve suggested that if Purdy is t the long term solution then the Niners should trade Purdy for a first round pick because we’ll pay for him!

Dude, way too fast. 1) we arent trading for any QB, are you just done with the guy who led us on a 15 play drive to win a SB LITERALLY less than a year ago? 2) What makes a QB a ""long term solution"" isnt playing well with a loaded roster in the back half of a season playing a bunch of non or borderline playoff teams for 6 games. Once a QB puts film out and lets NFL D coordinators do their job and properly scout them, THATS where you learn if they're a long term solution, if they can positively respond to ACTUALLY getting prepared for.

And, Montana actually improved in the playoffs - his PR was better in the playoffs than during the season. Brady, for all his clutch reputation, was considerably worse in the playoffs. Montana's playoff PR is six points better than Brady's, despite playing in IMO a much tougher era to throw the ball.

Also, Montana had Rice, but Brady had Randy Moss and Gronk for chunks of his career, arguably the two most talented WR and TE ever. And Montana won a SB with maybe the worst collection of offensive talent ever, in 1981.

To me, when I look at what makes Brady the greatest, it's basically stuff he did after Montana retired. Montana was better for the first 14-15 years of their respective careers, but Brady, to his great credit of course, and thanks to improvements in nutrition and training, was able to keep going for 7 or so more years, piling up more stats and more titles.

15418,151396,151396,VastAmphibian,"gut feeling says halftime adjustments are a thing. broadcasters throw that word around all the time. the team is all together and there is this big chunk of time when the game is on pause. of course you would use it for addressing major changes that need to happen for the second half.


but if you think about it, it doesn't quite make sense. halftime starts as soon as the clock hits zero. however the teams are still on the field when this happens. they have to walk back to their locker rooms. that's a couple minutes, meaning returning to the field is also a couple minutes. they need to loosen up to play when they return for 3Q. if you account for all that, the length of time that the players are back inside the locker room is only a little over 5 minutes. to validate this point, and as you have said, former nfl players like peyton and eli say that during halftime, they use the bathroom, hydrate, maybe eat something, and next thing you know it's already time to go back out there. they simply do not have the time to have this grand half time adjustment meeting that everyone is imagining to happen.

but seriously, if you look at the context of what I said,


> if we have to hire a new DC


who would you rather hire if we have a DC vacancy? really the only name that doesn't have a job right now and would be great is fangio. he has his own complexities though such as age (if he accepts a non-HC job, that's probably his last NFL job, so does he even want a coordinator position?) and apparent ties to sean payton and where he's going. I would be open to hiring someone with a different scheme and going a different direction for some fresh air, but that's such a wide open range of possibilities that I can't come up with a specific name. staley did incredibly well with us (better than morris has been) when he was with us as DC. in fact, even after he left, we're having morris run staley's system. we all know staley is not a very good HC. so take away the HC part, have him solely focus on the DC part, and I think we're going to be fine.


also, morris had a lot of defenders this season saying the offense put the defense in such terrible positions. I think we can extend a little bit of that to staley yesterday. the difference between them is that morris is DC and has nothing to do with the offense and has zero control over that, while staley is HC and every blame of the team ultimately goes through him even if he's not an ""offensive minded"" coach. ultimately it was staley who hired his OC.

With respect to situational awareness, you see a receiver catch a contested ball and he immediately pops up screaming for his offense to hurry up to the line…that’s sus as fuck, call a time out at the very least.

Really, I don’t see how any team is supposed to survive the injuries that we had this season on offence, and our defence even with the offence was still top 10. 

Your Eagles has similar injury luck in 2020 and went 4-11-1. The Niners too in 2020 and they went 6-10. 

The Rams are still a 10+ win team who just lost a season to injury and unless there are significant changes to the roster I really don’t see how anyone can think otherwise. 

Offence: Stafford and Kupp are top 10 at their position. Kupp might be top 3. Higbee is the best TE in Rams history and they’ve got plenty of tools if people can stay healthy. 

Defence: Ramsey, Wagner and Donald. Need I say more really? All we need to do on Defence is get a competent edge rusher and stop turning the ball over every 3 downs and that unit is competing for the #1 defence in the league.

The first game obviously being in the regular season last year when they were up 10+ and Spagnuolo refused to make any adjustments whatsoever and Andy got too conservative and seemingly doesn’t know how to call a game when having a big lead. 

The 2nd game being in the AFC Championship when the Chiefs were up 21-3? (or at least I think that was the score?) going into halftime and all the sudden Patrick Mahomes magically forgets how to play the quarterback position for the first time in hIs NFL career. 

And then finally the 3rd game this season when the Chiefs were driving down to score and win the game and Travis Kelce fumbles. 

Now don’t get me wrong, the Bengals obviously won all 3 of those games, and they deserve credit for that. I’m just saying, the Chiefs were clearly the better team in all 3 of those matchups, and I believe they’re currently a much better team than the Bengals are, with or without their 3 recently injured offensive linemen.

The Rams can't sign a QB because of negative cap space but grabbing a foolishly offered first round pick is also a bad idea(tm)?

So if I'm right and Stafford retires. And your right and Donald is also done if forced to play with Baker. That leaves the Rams farther from contention rather than closer.

The gradient is stupid, even if I hardly notice it during the game it should be ditched.

The stupid patch they added, their justification was they expect the NFL to start putting ads there, but I don't care. Ditch them.

The updated horns.. Don't personally bother me as much, but there was no reason to make that change. Revert back to the older design.

That's all they really need to do. I'd say dump the bones now that they introduced the ""modern thrownback"" design, and bring in just white pants, and they can go for an all white look and change out the yellow horn stickers for white ones when we play in that combination, and we're good IMO. That gives us two new jerseys we can have. So we can have an all yellow one, probably with a yellow shell helmet and blue horns, and then something more creative I guess, I dunno, I'm not an artist/designer.",0.0,nfl,t3_10h9m8u,False,0.0,:Rams: Rams,2023-01-21T04:54:02Z,losangelesrams,0.0450926817598515

I wish the game was called correctly and fairly from the beginning, because then the awful noncall at the end probably wouldn't have happened and if it did probably wouldn't have really impacted the outcome. 

The Rams battled some insane adversity, Goff played a really good game given everything going on, and it sucks that instead of highlighting that everyone focuses on this shitty noncall.

I guess nobody remembers Darrell Henderson being mugged on the play right before that, but no penalty was called despite it being a clear and obvious defensive holding which would've led to a first down inside the Bengals 10. 

Or the TD taken off the board due to ""offsetting penalties"" of a Rams hold that didn't affect the play at all, while Cooper Kupp is smashed in the back of the end zone.

Or the free Cincy TD on the offensive pass interference in the 3rd quarter that even made the game close in the first place?

Oh, and by the way: Cooper Kupp was the WR triple crown winner. You didn't think they were going to let LB's grab him on crossing routes 5 yds deep in the red zone and just let them get away with it, did you? 

[I mean, grabbing the jersey is holding, whether it's barely holding or fully holding.](https://twitter.com/txyesboy/status/1625309601762623488?s=46&t=lhrBuhW_bRPXavd2_1ikMw)

The refs missed calls, but it didn't affect the outcome of the game. We Rams fans already heard this shit in the NFCCG against New Orleans and there was plenty of shit we took for that - and we earned it on that one. This one just screams sour grapes.

Outside of the gift 75 yard touchdown in the 3rd quarter, Cincinnati ran 31 plays for a whopping 61 yards in the rest of the second half and their defense got them their only other points by forcing a turnover deep in Rams territory leading to their only other 2nd half points (FG).

I'll repeat: outside of the clear and obvious offensive PI on the only Cincy TD in the 2nd half - good for 75 yards, Cincy averaged LESS THAN TWO YARDS PER PLAY in the 2nd half. 

They had the ball late in rhe 4th and chose to run Perrine right at Aaron Donald rather than Joe Mixon. And for all the shit AD gets on this sub (many times deservingly), the Cincy OL went after him on a clean play that even Burrow said wasn't dirty at all. All they did was woke up the beast. 

Sorry man; this pisses me off everytime I see this. I'm sorry y'all think the refs were selective about calling borderline penalties. But the best way to avoid being called for borderline penalties is...not committing them in the first place.

They should be livid after every playoff loss for their entire careers. If they weren't, that would mean the fire was extinguished, the dawg was asleep, and it's time to hang 'em up. Every professional player is some form of madman with a stupid-crazy competitive drive.
