All Pro] as a Patriot, 3x SB champ, played any position on the D-line at an elite level in a 3-4 defense, helping others get sacks and stuff the run. 2000s All Decade, Pro Football HOF)

9. Wes Welker (controversial, but redefined the slot position as a Patriot. In his five years as a Patriot, he led the league in receptions three times. 2x First Team All Pro [2x Second Team All Pro] as a Patriot. Holds franchise single season records of receptions and receiving yards. Holds franchise record of career receptions. He didn’t get the hardware, but he was very very good.)

The three of Tom, Belichick, and Kraft have denied the article multiple times. Is there some truth to it? Probably, but why would Tom not refuse to play or play the following two years like he did if he was really gonna get traded.

> Statements From Patriots, Don Yee:

The Patriots issued a joint statement from Chairman/CEO Robert Kraft, coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady after the ESPN.com story was published:

>""For the past 18 years, the three of us have enjoyed a very good and productive working relationship. In recent days, there have been multiple media reports that have speculated theories that are unsubstantiated, highly exaggerated or flat out inaccurate. The three of us share a common goal. We look forward to the enormous challenge of competing in the postseason and the opportunity to work together in the future, just as we have for the past 18 years. It is unfortunate that there is even a need for us to respond to these fallacies. As our actions have shown, we stand united.""

I’d think BB will trade back if possible, and I’m ok with it.  I actually like Mims in the mid rounds as a prospect, all the other wr’s seem to have faults , mainly size, though I still think Tank Dell would be cool af to have here.

Some of the projected top tackles are likely going to be guards in the NFL, so I’m leery of any of the mocks/draft boards right now.

This is a stacked RB and TE draft, I’m hoping we can come out with one of each.  Mo Ibrahim is an older back, he’s projected to go late, I think if he’s there in the 6th he could be a home run, Jamhyr Gibbs also in the 2nd/3rd could be awesome (I keep seeing Kamara comps for him, that excites me)

Darnell Washington is a mammoth TE I’d be excited for, also a mean blocker.  

Regarding safeties, I’d like to see one of the AL safeties Brian Branch and Jordan Battle both seem like good coverage safeties, though Branch will likely go in the 1st round. Jayir Brown also has some buzz 

CB - Emmanuel Forbes and Tyrique Stevenson are both guys I could see BB drafting.  I’d expect we go out and secure a CB in FA, but could see it going either way (draft vs FA)

BoB had success in at least 4 jobs designing offenses tailored to his players strengths.  His offenses in NE, HOU, and AL we’re great.  Penn State he did an admirable job (seriously, he took the reigns there the year after the Paterno/Sandusky bullshit)

Regarding McDaniels OC work for the Rams

In his first year as coach of Denver they averaged 20 points per game.

He had a couple clutch plays and the insane catch on the game-tying drive that everyone remembers but Edelman was the 2nd best receiver against The Falcons (5 catches for 87 yards).

Are you thinking of James White with his 14 catches 110 yards and a touchdown (2 rushing) or are you thinking of the Seahawks Superbowl where he went 9 catches 109 yards and a touchdown and 1 carry for 7 yards?

Restructuring allows teams to convert portions of a player's contract into a signing bonus. In exchange, the converted money which would have counted against the cap for the current season is instead prorated across the remaining years on the contract.

It's a win for the players because they get guaranteed money right away.

It's a short-term win for the team because they can clear up a lot of cap space instantly.

It's tough for the owners because it means they need to fork over the cash for the signing bonus rather than paying that money over the life of the contract.

It's bad long-term for a team because it reduces their available cap space in future years.

Nah I think he would’ve 100% solved the issue. He’s a true dual threat. Hines had like 6 rushes and totaled negative yardage. Teams knew when he was in it was a pass.

The next step is the hardest - managing the game and making the right (safe) play. He doesn’t take what’s given and gets greedy. Some players never learn to not do that.

11236,109735,109735,LoveToyKillJoy,"I loved the Cole Strange pick. I loved it for many reasons.  

I love that I can theorize all I want about the draft, but I realize that no matter how hard I work to understand the options I work with a limited amount of information.  I don't have access to interviews. I don't get to see what the team sees of every player and I don't know what traits are being prioritized. We never pick particularly high so we rarely have an obvious choice, and it takes some of the fun out of it if there is.  Cole Strange sent me running for info on a player who wasn't on my radar. That was great to me. 

I loved that we traded down. Trading down is more often than not, a winning decision and I'm in favor of it almost every time we do it. We traded for three picks. Strange at 29, one which turned into Jack Jones who gave us solid play in his first year,  and the 94th pick.

That 94th pick was flipped into the 137th who became Zappe who is a pretty darn good backup QB and the 76th pick this year who could be anyone.  It could be picked as is. Used to move up, traded again in some way.  Who knows.  

In total we got Strange who played pretty well as a rookie and I expect to be agood player for a while. We got a solid number 2 corner and a solid backup QB, and we still have that nice third round mystery box. I couldn't be much happier with all the entertainment that I was provided with and am still to recieve. Also, to this point I don't think any pick outside of Sauce Gardner has returned as much value as the trade of the 21 created for the Patriots in the 2022 draft.

For instance a huge part if Andrews's value is his ability to recognize defenses and share that information with the rest of the line.  How would you measure that with public knowledge and how would you incorporate that into player rankings. Seems an impossible task from our point of view. 


I can see a lot of value in trading down.  Increasing capital is pretty consistently a strong strategy. The draft capital chart values the 14th pick as being as valuable as the entire 5th round.

Given that 8 other guys at QB, DT and edge seem slated for the top ten I think the portions at 14 will be good, but a trade down may come into play. There is still a lot of time before the draft. 

I think the interior is good from a starting perspective. Not sure about backups, but depending on how the team feels later round selections there may be valuable,  specifically at Center where Andrews is on the back 9.

McDermott could be good depth. I don't think he is going to be expensive to retain on a 1 or 2 year deal.

11246,109757,109757,LoveToyKillJoy,"OT is a higher priority but I generally think you go best player available at a premium position with a good rate of return. While the first round has 32 picks or in this year's case 31, most teams only give first round grades to 18 - 24 guys.  So you can't really compare a pick like we have this year to last year's at 29 because the expectations are so different.  A IOL or RB at 14 would be ill-advised if the player isn't otherworldly, but at 29 it is less of an issue, even though there is a distinction in the 5th year option. 

From that perspective barring the need for a qb, my thoughts on a top 20 pick are to take BPA from the positions, OT, DT, Edge, CB. And if you don't have a very high grade on anyone at that point try to trade down because you'll gain capital. 

So while I'm not a professional talent evaluator,  based on the ratings from people who make that claim. If we exclude the guys who are consensus to be gone in the top 10, we should be looking to take the best of 3 Offensive Tackles, and 2 or 3 cornerbacks.

There is a ton of time and important events like the combine that will change those player rankings.

11293,109860,109860,LoveToyKillJoy,"Trade up where? With whom? If you aren't trading for a QB teams that trade up generally underperform their draft capital. Teams don't really do better at QB but position scarcity and importance at the position make it worth it.  

Trading up usually means you pay more capital than you get in return. If a player falls against all expectations it may be a good idea to trade up, but as an example of a time we did that was with Christian Barmore. Barmore has yet to provide value that would exceed the value of the draft capital traded and 3 players at his position who were chosen later have thus far exceeded his value. Time will tell if that will remain true. 

The better strategy is to trade back for more capital. More shots at the dart board and future picks will return better results over time.  The trade of the 21st pick last year has already paid off on the field by providing more value according to Football reference than all but 1 first round pick and there is still a third round pick to be redeemed 

Again they traded up for Thornton but that has yet to pan out. The small sample size of Patriots picks are meant to show examples of how the league wide trend plays out.  Of course there are examples where trading up works. They traded up for Hightower and Chandler Jones, but there are many more examples where trading back for more capital has been the better move.",6.0,patriots,t3_10enoxy,False,0.0,None,2023-01-17T16:01:37Z,patriots,0.0424429424526126

My point is that people act like Welker was a guy who choked in the playoffs and didn't give his all and significant vocal group of fans seem to hate the guy and I think that is garbage and I defend him. Most teams who have a great player who didn't get a ring have the attitude of. ""That guy was great it is a shame that we didn't win and get him a ring while he was here"". For some reason many Patriots fans have the attitude of. ""Fuck that loser. We would have won if it weren't for him"" as if the only difference between the team's success was the play these two players. I think that is a really shitty.

 Welker played his ass off and the people who say he mailed it in during the super bowls are just being disrespectful. Welker led the team in yards from scrimmage in both of those games and caught 18 of 22 targets.  But people say, ""he didn't come down with a bad throw on 2nd and 11 with 5 minutes left.

I actually have all the sports illustrateds, sporting news and boston papers from pre 2011 in my garage. There are so many story lines from that season.

12555,118065,118065,MissingInBrain,"Well, 2007 was pretty weird. 2006, the defense was starting to show its age and an injury to Rodney Harrison in the last week of the season cost them a super bowl, as they could not stop Dallas Clark across the middle of the field in the AFC Champ game and hold. 21-3 lead. Also, in 2006, the WR core was so thin, they had free agents coming in to fill out the 4th and 5th spots late in the season. To illustrate how large a hole that position was, the Pats could have iced the game in the 4th quarter but Reche Caldwell dropped a first down pass that hit him in the chest. Phil Simms saw him as the play started and was shocked at how open he was.

So, offseason, you acquire Welker (who killed us the year before in Miami) and Randy Moss. At this point, Randy was an absolute burnout and no one knew what to expect. On the defensive side, they acquired Junior Seau, had guys like Colvin and Thomas to get after the QB, but that core of Vrabel, Bruschi, Seymour, Wilfork, Harrison, etc., was still there.

Season starts off with a beat down so bad in the Meadowlands that their coach, former Pats assistant with three Pats SB rings Eric Magini, called the league to tell how the Pats taped signals.

If someone has a history of injuring players (being a “dirty”) player, then a fine or penalty is not going to be enough of a deterrent.

Remember when TJ Ward took out Gronk by basically submarining his knee? I felt that was a dirty play. He could have made a tackle and wrap up, but he basically just torpedoed him at his ACL joint. That’s disgusting.

Now whether TJ Ward had intent to injure or not, it’s reckless and shows lack of sportsmanship. I’m sure he got fined by the league or whatever. But it was far different from other injuries like when Brady tore his ACL. That one felt like a football play and he got hit by a falling lineman and was unlucky, but TJ Ward’s hit felt dirty and targeting.

So, hypothetically speaking, if Ward did that earlier in the year, and then does this *again* to Gronk, don’t you think he should be forced to sit out as long as Gronk is out of commission? I mean, these guys tackle with immunity. This rule change would get them to rethink their habits and perhaps wrap up more than go for knees. Gronk is far too valuable to lose for the year, and someone can take him out with virtually no repercussions??

It’s not a perfect rule; nothing is. But I’m trying to think of a way that would offer some accountability to the defensive player that actually creates a more equal sense of responsibility to play the game the right way without any injury-prone type hits.

15611,139146,139146,Perswayable,"Normally I would agree with you, but I am reading they're in relatively unique circumstances somewhat limiting restructure ability. As an example, Dolphins are $14 million over the cap, but a few adjustments can position [them $25 million under](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/barry-jackson/article271255047.html).   


The Bills? Extremely limited. One route could put them [$11 million over the cap](https://www.profootballnetwork.com/buffalo-bills-offseason-preview-2023-free-agents-cut-candidates-team-needs/), but this would require straight cuts. Between the amount of free agents they have, it is going to put them in a difficult position -- not to mention the holes this creates and the money needed to sign their draft picks. Also, the $11 million theoretical would include cutting Hines, except Singletary is hitting free agency off a $2 million contract. 

[They have 2 big stars entering free agency this year, as well as losing their ""starting"" RB, possibly their punter, and backup QB.](https://www.profootballnetwork.com/buffalo-bills-offseason-preview-2023-free-agents-cut-candidates-team-needs/) Their RT is *awful*, they have a hole at LG with free agency, and they're losing DE depth if Shaq Lawson walks -- which, he played on the veteran minimum.   


Again, I 100% normally would agree with you. But, they are not in a normal circumstances unless the sources I've provided are all wrong or missing critical information (could be the case, I just can't find it). Often I roll my eyes at the cap space dilemma but really, their GM did not do a good job restructuring contracts. He barely got them to the $2.5 million mark in week 1.

15621,139160,139160,Perswayable,"I think the general consensus is to see what Patriots do in the offseason, first. Free agency is in March and the draft is in April. For example, there is a top OT in free agency available (Orlando Brown Jr) but no true WR1's available (some will be for trades though). Do we acquire an OT in free agency and use our draft picks to pick a WR or CB?  Do we trade draft stock for one of the top WR1s available for trade, and draft OTs in the later rounds? We have good success drafting OL outside of the first round. It all comes down to which direction Pats decide to go. 

BUT, to answer your question, **and you should totally look into it because it's cool and will provide rich draft info,** there is a draft chart that provides values for their picks and how much it *would usually* cost to trade up:  
([Source](https://walterfootball.com/draftchart.php))  


Round 1, Pick 14 overall  
Round 2, Pick 46 overall  
Round 3, Pick 76 overall (From CAR)  
Round 4, Pick 104 overall (from LAR)  
Round 4, Pick 114 overall  
Round 6, Pick 170 overall (From LV)  
Round 6, Pick 173 overall (From CAR)  
Round 6, Pick 178 overall

Say if Paris is projected to go 9th overall, that would cost 1,350 points. The 14th pick is worth 1,100 points. Therefore, we would need to add 250 points worth of picks. We would most likely have to trade our 1st round (1,100), 3rd round (210),  and a combination of picks to reach the last 40 points. Sometimes this is why teams will also add picks to offset the points (ex: Raiders trading their 1st and 6th round for Patriots 1, 3, and 4th) if there is a slight point discrepancy.

I really hope they make the proper adjustments to tackle. Also, thanks for giving insight into Wynn's draft projection -- I did not know he was projected to be a guard.

15629,139171,139171,Perswayable,"I am so thankful for this comment because I just had this conversation with a colleague.   
(This is based on 2 weeks ago): A lot of the focus on prospect OTs was Paris Johnson Jr and Peter Skoronski. There will be debates as to whether Skoronski is more of a guard than a tackle due to the limitations of his size profile, but 2 studs stood out in top 14 and potentially 4 OTs overall in the first draft.   


So, with rank 14, due to the early draft thought to be dominated by QB, DI, and Edge, a lot of top players could trickle down to us. This means there is a chance the top CB remains, top RB remains, top TE remains, etc.  My hypothesis is, if a top positional player does not remain in either OT or CB, Patriots have trade down leverage for teams looking to get one of them.  I have 0 faith in the Patriots WR drafting ability. TE could be selected as it's a super heavy TE draft, and Mayer is being compared to the next Witten, but we do have Smith and Henry this upcoming year.   


**If you wanted my honest solution:** Hire Brown Jr for $20 million, trade a top pick for a solid  WR, and now you enter the draft with 2 big holes fixed; select a CB with whatever round we can and get rid of Mills, freeing up $5 million with $1.2 million dead cap. Cut Parker, since we have a true WR 1, and free up an additional $6 million.  I wouldn't want to overspend on Meyers since the market will be hot for him.

Well, in a weird way I am not sure we need him as a starter. During the off-season of 2021, we lost Karras and Shaq - both being guards (Karras was more utility). We patched the guard positions by flexing Onwenu to the RG position and drafting Cole Strange at the LG position. Shaq Mason I believe is a RG. Onwenu belongs in that RG position -- he played all of college there. Patriots were just using him in other areas. 

Theoretically, we could hire Shaq Mason and flex Onwenu back to the tackle position, but I am not sure that would be the right decision. 

I just feel their approach specifically to the tackle position was not good. They hired Trent Brown one month before the draft (good move), had Cajuste and Wynn (both injury prone), and drafted one tackle in the 7th round who slid there because of injuries. It required them to sign Marcus Cannon in October to the practice squad because they had no real T depth...who was released by Houston because he only started four games in 2021 due to injuries.

15638,139180,139180,Perswayable,"Fair opinion for sure.  


Trent Brown has played RT for the majority of his career (especially the past 2 years). Wynn played LT his career. The swap happened during voluntary workouts and they never looked back -- in fact, Patricia made the decision before Wynn even practiced. I am surprised we didn't see attempts to switch Brown to the right side. Other than the 2 sacks Trent Brown allowed week 1, his first 5 weeks were solid. I guess that is why Patricia was trying to be patient, but it also lead to Hoyer's head injury (that was on Wynn's blown coverage -- he was benched by the second half). And, Marcus Cannon was only elevated to the roster at that point not because of coaching adapting to Wynn's performance, but because Cajuste was put on IR.

I mean, I have no idea how Trent Brown plays for weeks and weeks absolutely sick and looking like death. He supposedly lost 12lbs. His stats took a huge nose dive and that was a coaching problem -- he had absolutely no back up because the entire tackle position was built on bubblegum and shoe strings.

According to the article, pretty much the entire team appreciated McDaniels' approach of holding everyone accountable.

According to one player: ""I think Derek became more concerned about Josh's criticism than he did anything else. The guy was trying, but he had to have a little Josh McDaniels devil on his shoulder. While other guys liked that McDaniels held staff and players to one standard, I think Derek was like a cat in your headlights.""

I’m saying he should do both. With our cap situation we can sign a good FA tackle, and then we can trade some of our top 100 picks to either get a another late first or early second so we can draft a blue chip tackle and Zay Flowers. 

Or draft a blue chip tackle and trade draft cap to bring in a dog wr via trade.

Speaking of the Bills, I think we should address LB by going after Edmunds. We’ve got the cap space and the dudes a dog. I feel like OT is the choice at 14 but I’d be ok with JSN, or one of the top corners as there are 2…maybe 3 that I think are top 20 talents.

Thanks! That's all I wanted really. In most threads I find talking about stuff like this becomes less a discussion and more of a negative place to put down others ideas.

I agree on Peppers being a perfect Patriot and a guy I want next to Dugger for the foreseeable future, especially post Phillips. I am just considering what I think his market would look like, while giving him one last shot for a contract before being over 30 where contracts tend to move toward year-to-year for players like him.

$12.5 mil AAV for a bona fide WR2 is a great price IMO, with where the league is going. Its still unfortunate that he's basically our WR1 though, after everything is said and done here. Its just hard to imagine the right move to get THE guy for our group. We may have to wait another offseason when, for example, a guy like Higgins is a FA and the Bengals are paying Burrow. They have little benefit to trading him now when he's such an important part of them contending.

Honestly, that's my ideal situation in a year. Using my mock draft, Higgins-Meyers-Thornton-Washington-Perry is a damn nice WR core, IMO. We currently are looking at $157 mil in cap space next year so we hopefully will have both the cap space and green light to go spend. This year is a foundation solidifying season.

For Mills, you're right, he's not expensive and keeping him doesn't really hinder any of the moves I've lined out anyway. As for leadership, I can see that, we're losing McCourty, so that's definitely going to be needed. If the team makes the right moves though, Mills would likely be left off the field. I just don't personally see him as a positive on the field asset and I think he'd expect to be a starter.",2.0,patriots,t3_10pi75z,False,0.0,None,2023-01-31T10:42:04Z,patriots,0.0382720751644238
27333,276110,276110,mdmcnally1213,"Thank you, appreciate the detail on your response as well. I considered moving on from most of the same players you noted too, but I kept finding the roster coming out bare at those positions. I honestly don’t see those RTs in free agency as massive enough upgrades over TB to justify price but see O. Brown as worth it. That’s just my eval though.

I was rather impressed with McDermott down the stretch, and seems like a guy who can play in a pinch. Then in the mid rounds there are some really nice developmental guys. Dawand Jones is a mountain mover on the right and Jaelyn Duncan would be a first round talent had he played for a better college team. He has the measurables and athletic profile and will likely shoot up boards as the draft approaches. There’s also guys like Blake Freeland, Cody Mauch, Matt Bergeron (love the name), and Darnell Wright. All guys who I think can play right away but should they spend some time developing, they could be studs.

Ellis and Sutton are great shouts to fill in those holes, would definitely be on board to add them.

Hurst over Henry definitely makes sense if we get cap savings off it, but Henry has had one of the better connections with Mac so I’m weary of moving on. Smith unfortunately isn’t going anywhere with his contract.

My overall goal on D is to get younger and faster, I think Bates is the best guy to replace McCourty and hold down that position for 6-7 years.

Edmonds would be fantastic but I think he’s the Bills biggest priority and won’t hit the market. A true zero tech NT would be great for run downs, so Tomlinson and Rankins are definitely on my list there.

I honestly think I'm more under-valuing Jakobi, but I see the first wave of ""free agent WRs"" of being moved via trade, a la Eagles and AJ Brown, and Jakobi, Juju and co, being a quazi-second wave, where teams spending won't be as high.

I get undervaluing Jones, but his lack of size ended up getting exposed late in the season, putting more into pigeon holing him into the slot. I don't see a team putting out much more than that for a slot guy.

Peppers played just 35% of defensive snaps for us this year, mostly when either Dugger of Phillips were out. Comparing him to the contract Adrian Phillips got with us (AAV of $4.250 million) after being a full-time starter and part of the safety/LB core for the Chargers that set the blueprint for defending Lamar Jackson. Peppers' 2 year deal gives him one last shot at a bigger contract at 30, but I don't think that contract is there for him this year.

I could be wrong on all of this of course, not trying to pretend to be an expert.

The way I see it, is we want to create additional cap space this year to help retain some of our FAs and still have cap to attack outside FAs. Our most pressing need, LT, is one of the most expensive positions and I'd rather secure that spot with a known value.

Phillips was a full-time starter for the Chargers at that time and was a part of the safety/LB group that created the blueprint to stopping Lamar Jackson. His value that FA is higher than Pepper's is now, who played just 35% of defensive snaps for us, mostly as a reserve for when Dugger or Phillips were out.

>Will the Patriots bring back free agent corner Jonathan Jones? That could determine what Bill Belichick & Co. do here, because this is a strong cornerback class in the back half of Round 1. There could be a run on defensive backs in the 20s. Witherspoon is my top-ranked corner, a long and physical player who shut down an entire side of the field for the Fighting Illini. He also is not afraid to stick his head in and make a tackle.

>Outside of corner, New England could target offensive line or wide receiver with this pick to try to support quarterback Mac Jones, who struggled in Year 2.

I am a big fan of the move to go corner in the first in this draft. The talent at the top of the board at the position is immense, and while I know Devon is a dog and plays hard, I think I'd prefer Christian Gonzalez or Joey Porter Jr. as the pick.

> If your solution is really ""just build a super team and then maybe we'll know if Mac is good"" then you already think he sucks.

Not saying super team, more so saying we should stay the course with Mac. Continue drafting well, adding the right FA pieces. He's a very cheap QB right now and we need to take advantage of it. I do not think he sucks, but he's more than capable of leading a complete team on a deep run.
