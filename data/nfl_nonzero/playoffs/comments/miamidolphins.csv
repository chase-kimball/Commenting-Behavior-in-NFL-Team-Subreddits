- Extend Christian Wilkins. Bring his base salary down from $10.753m to his vet minimum of $1.08m. Have no idea what the signing bonus and other structure would look like, but if we use Vita Vea's recent extension as the benchmark then it should be around $3m. So $6.673m saved.

49er fans can help me out, but blocking is a big need for the TE‚Äôs.

6255,45892,45892,Cidolfus,"I know I'm more down on Gesicki than most, but I really think that this is a case of buyer beware. Gesicki's career best receiving season was 2021 when he was force fed the ball (a whopping 112 targets) and even then he still only had 780 receiving yards. His career high touchdowns is six, which is good but not great. For a guy who should be a size mismatch and a nightmare to defend especially in the red zone, his production never matches expectation, even when we've made him a primary target in the passing game.

Gesicki has all the physical tools and he's by all reports a great teammate, but he's never lived up to his potential and I'm not convinced that a change in scenery helps him. He's not just an underwhelming blocker, he's among the worst blockers of all the tight ends in the league. He's not a great route runner and his in-game speed doesn't live up to his great combine performance. He gets absolutely terrible separation (consistently among the worst in the entire league), and despite his size he's not that dominant on contested catches (47.0% across his career and only 20% this past season).

If a team can get away with paying him $7- or $8 million per year, they'll probably be happy with what he brings to the table, but for a guy who's so one dimensional he needs to be in a very specific role (big slot in a spread offense) to excel, he's putting up numbers that don't pop for a number two receiver and not worth the big bucks at TE.",57.0,nfl,t3_10tmzgf,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-02-04T13:11:33Z,miamidolphins,0.0468574742313125

6260,45920,45920,Cidolfus,"I know rushing quarterbacks like Jackson are really exciting, but until somebody proves that they can do it and stay healthy for a long time, it feels like organizational malpractice to build your team around that skillset long term. In the past two seasons, Jackson has missed ten total games and in two of the games he did play he had only four attempts before leaving due to injury. Since his string of injuries beginning with his week 10 absence in 2021, Jackson has been on a worrying trajectory.

Even ignoring the two games in which he had a combined eight attempts before injury since week 10 of last year, Jackson has passed for 2649 yards, 19 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and a completion percentage of 62.1% on 391 attempts in 13 games. He's added 878 yards and three touchdowns on the ground during that stretch on 136 attempts as well, but also eight fumbles (two lost).

On a per-game basis, he's still putting up the yards (271.3 yards per game). That's right up there alongside his pace during his MVP season (270.8 yards per game), but his scoring has fallen off a damn cliff and his turnovers are way up. In 2019 Jackson had 43 total touchdowns and only 8 total turnovers, a phenomenal 5.375 : 1 ratio, but over this stretch since injuries started piling on, he's down to only 22 touchdowns to 14 turnovers, an absolutely dismal 1.57 : 1 ratio.

Obviously there are a lot of factors that the numbers don't account for here, but I don't understand how this dramatic drop in production gets so easily dismissed when people talk about Jackson's contract negotiations. The Ravens aren't suddenly going to be able to afford putting better weapons around him by paying a massive contract with huge guarantees. Maybe you hope things improve with a new offensive coordinator, but Jackson's health and production have to be worrying, and I think anyone, whether it's the Ravens or another team in a tag-and-trade, who gives Jackson the type of guarantees he's interested in is taking on an absolutely massive risk based on his current trends.",5.0,nfl,t3_10k8xwr,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-01-24T13:54:41Z,miamidolphins,-0.0137173525080666

Blaming Tua's injuries (concussion) for not able to play somewhat equating to his actual QB abilities takes the biggest fucking cake SMH. I can't tell you how fucking BRAINDEAD this logic actually is.

Let me give you an example, think about it hard cuz this fucking argument is the FUCKING dumbest as fuck one...


Say for instance, if Tua this year lead the Dolphins to Super Bowl and WINS the Super Bowl but around 5 minutes left in the game Tua is badly injured and at that time Dolphins lead 35-34, and ends up winning with Skylar Thompson closing that game. Tua scored 5 TDs, Skylar 0 Defense gave up 34 points. Tua retires next season no longer play for the Dolphins.  Oh you won't give Tua any credit, just credit Skylar cuz he closed the deal at 0:00 on the clock and still play for Fins next season? Dolphins didn't win yet (just a lead), when Tua got hurt..
 
What? By your stupid logic, **Tua automatically sucks just because he is injured and couldn't play the next game**?! The fact that we win the Super Bowl is moot? Tua is injured, can't play anymore he is still not good QB even though he win Super Bowl the only QB put up all the TDs?

Because, this is exactly the stupid fucking logic you are telling me despite Tua winning all these games this season enough wins to even put the Dolphins into the position of Playoffs, despite this, just due to him got concussion, he automatically sucks and isn't a good QB...that's the shit I am seeing!",2.0,miamidolphins,t3_10cah4o,False,0.0,None,2023-01-15T03:05:46Z,miamidolphins,-0.0705329120457015

15832,135584,135584,NudeCeleryMan,"I promise it's not in bad faith. And I think I do understand the differences in risk. Or as well as any non-medical professional can. I've learned a LOT about concussions this season.

In both cases, we have players with some sort (now) existing or pre-existing condition.

>Even if resuscitated rapidly and making a full recovery, some after-effects can include reduced ventricular ejection fraction, which would make it almost impossible to return to being an elite athlete as the blood pumped with each heartbeat is reduced.

Damar would be playing with potential risk to his health and life going forward.

There is a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about Tua.

Tua has had two diagnosed concussions. Possibly three but ataxia is not proof of a concussion and that was his one and only temporary symptom. He went back into the game, ran a complex offense, relayed 15 phrase plays to his teammates, beat the Bills, and appeared publicly in a press conference after the game. He passed every concussion screening every day between Sunday and Thursday. Neither Tua or any teammate, friend, spouse, parent, coach, trainer, or doctor observed or reported any concussion symptoms during or after the game. Not on any day during the week following. Ryan Fitzpatrick interviewed him the day before the game and they aired the interview. Not a person on Earth mentioned anything strange about Tua and his quarterback room teammate of 2 years didn't notice any signs of concussion. He showed no signs of concussion while playing before the hit.

Is it possible he had a concussion? Yes. Is it also possible he did not? Yes. But no one knows. The best guess of the only people examining Tua at the time (doctors) was that he did not.

The Cincinnati concussion (Sep 29) was likely a grade 2 Moderate concussion as he lost consciousness but seemingly not long enough to qualify as a grade 3 severe concussion. It looked very bad but I believe that is because fencing is scary to look at. If he had been just knocked out and didn't fence, I believe it wouldn't have looked so scary to non-medical professionals. But fencing posture is not an indicator for concussion grade severity.

The 2nd diagnosed concussion (Dec 25) was not his first or second game back. It was his 9th game back plus a bye week. It took place 88 days after the first diagnosed concussion. This was a Grade 1 Mild concussion. He DEFINITELY showed signs of concussion with his play day-of and inability to remember plays the next day.

So Tua has been diagnosed with one moderate concussion and one mild concussion.

It's *possible* he's had one one moderate concussion and two mild concussions.

Definitely scary and I personally have no idea if he should come back but you can find medical professionals who say as long as you have time to recover, you can come back. For what it's worth, the Dolphins GM said Monday he's been told by medical professionals and the players union that Tua would not be considered any more prone to concussions than any other player if he comes back next year.

So they both carry risk to health in returning.

Was I being silly because you had Bills flair? Yes. Does it seem like the vast majority of Reddit fans calling for him to retire are Bills fans? Oh yes. Did I unfairly lump you in with other Bills fans? Also yes. To my knowledge, you are not one of them.

The biggest rule change was in 1978 when defenders were no longer allowed to chug receivers beyond five yards. So, in a sense, from then on, it's been a similar game.

The evolution, as measured statistically, has been caused by the immense improvement in play-primarily by passers and receivers-and as a by product, adjustments to scheme. As more QBs exhibited consistent accuracy and velocity, more and more coaches went to pass heavy offenses. The best analogy I can give is baseball pitchers. A generation ago, only a few pitchers could throw 95mph fastballs. Today, hardly anyone *can't*. Likewise, circa 1982, half the quarterbacks truly sucked.

Consequently, teams would rather run the ball than miss on half their passes, which meant not only running backs, but blocking backs (fullbacks) so teams could rarely ""flood the zone"" with multiple targets because everyone was blocking and most offenses only played three WRs in obvious, long yardage situations.

But, first there was the West Coast offense when Bill Walsh was an assistant to Paul Brown, Air Coryell, then when Shula drafted Marino the Dolphins did a complete 180...all the way to present. And receivers constantly get faster and possess better hands.

""Then there‚Äôs the reason that Ross felt compelled to spend $500 million refreshing Hard Rock Stadium: He ponied up only after failing to land public subsidies for the upgrades. Ross took over the Dolphins in 2009, and he repeatedly tried to persuade state lawmakers to use tax money for renovations. One proposal for funding the improvements involved asking Miami-Dade County voters to approve an increase to the hotel bed tax.""

""Ross began lobbying for public support of stadium upgrades as the mood in Tallahassee had soured on hefty payments to benefit the private sector.  
Defying the wishes of then-Gov. Rick Scott, Republican lawmakers pushed back on state-paid job incentives through Enterprise Florida and taxpayer-funded tourism marketing through Visit Florida. Meanwhile, the NFL‚Äôs optimistic ‚Äî and hard-to-verify ‚Äî claims about the economic impact of the Super Bowl in host communities created skepticism.  
During the 2013 legislative session, the NFL‚Äôs Goodell went to Tallahassee to make a pitch on Ross‚Äô behalf. Lawmakers were unswayed. State Sen. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, was among those who argued against the subsidy, panning a plan that encouraged ""millionaires and billionaires to tap into taxpayer dollars.""  
The subsidy for Ross died on the last day of the legislative session, when then-House Speaker Will Weatherford declined to call the matter for a vote. Ross responded bitterly.

The second safest, which Tua wears, is the Riddell Speedflex (NFL ‚Äústandard‚Äù).

The axiom is designed specifically to reduce concussions. In fact, the players head is scanned. After being scanned, it‚Äôs custom tailored for the players head.

It has cutting edge pad technology, and is basically Riddells new flagship helmet. It‚Äôs what they‚Äôll be basing new designs on in the future.

After his second concussion, kenny Pickett started wearing it.

Many players say it‚Äôs the most comfortable helmet they‚Äôve ever worn, while improving vision.

The downside: the visor is not optional. The Speedflex has a bar across the middle. To increase vision, The Axiom removes the bar, which means the visor is non-negotiable.

With that being said, Patrick Mahomes has started wearing a visor, and according to him ‚Äúit increases color and contrast‚Äù and he loves it.

Why the fuck isn‚Äôt Tua wearing this thing? 

Kenny pickett said ‚Äúit was recommended by Doctors. I want to be safe‚Äù

You would think this option was shared with Tua. I can‚Äôt know that, but he has to be aware it‚Äôs an option.

32630,244370,244370,finsnfeathers,"Pete Caroll has been evolving his system the past few seasons to be more multiple with his coverages and add disguise. They still base out of their cover 3 but it is much more intricate with man/match principles unlike Boyer and Flores Cover 3 they coach that we based out of this past season and a half. Ours is way more simple and more old school spot drop. Their corners actually press in their cover 3 while reading the other receivers routes instead of last year when our corners would show press then bail to their 1/3 while watching the QB. 

Front wise they aren‚Äôt as multiple or blitz heavy like weve been, but they use way more different 4 man stunts where Boyer mostly used 5 man stunts. And when they walk guys to the line it‚Äôs to usually just rush 4 or 5 and disguise who‚Äôs coming and who isn‚Äôt.


Things that will change:

Bye bye Boyers cover 0

No more weird prevent formations that give up easy 15 yard completions

Requiring our corners to be incredible man coverage defenders

Things that won‚Äôt change:

Requiring our corners to be big and physical press defenders

Exotic blitzes that send DBs and drop DLinemen

I think it‚Äôs a great fit for our personnel because we already ran a lot of different fronts especially odd fronts. Despite this scheme being a 4-3 scheme there‚Äôs still 5 men on the LoS, just some will be in different gaps.  Baker will do fine as one of the off ball LBs but the rest of the room might be gone aside from Tindall

Our secondary will require big/long corners so guys like Kader and Needham will not be ideal for the outside, but should be fine in the slot and even FS. So CB2 opposite Howard would be a big need. Holland would fill the Earl Thomas role and Brandon Jones the Kam Chancellor/Jamal Adams.

TL:DR
Scheme is Zone heavy but with man principles which should lead to tighter coverage without having to have two 20 some million dollar CBs. Less all out blitzing and more disguise. Our defensive front should fit well aside from some retooling in the LB room",16.0,miamidolphins,t3_10ijj97,False,0.0,17,2023-01-22T11:25:39Z,miamidolphins,0.03923423498391

33176,245351,245351,fortas,"I think our team is low key in a terrible position. 

Firstly, we have very little draft capital so we aren‚Äôt going to improve at all in the offseason. 

Second, I‚Äôm not convinced that Mike McDaniel is a good football coach. I think he‚Äôs very smart, likable and funny. He does great things on offense and his press conferences are amazing but he also has HORRENDOUS clock management skills, penalties killed us all season and the defense has regressed a lot. He needs a good DC to help him out with that side of the ball. Some people are head coaches and some people are just coordinators and I‚Äôm starting to think that McDaniel is the latter.

Lastly, we have a terrible situation at QB. We will NEVER win a Super Bowl with Tua. He can‚Äôt play a full season and he arguably should retire after the concussions. He‚Äôs played 3 seasons and we all know who he is now which is a good QB that‚Äôs injured a lot. Teddy Bridgewater is a bum and Skylar Thompson, while he played admirably and has improved, isn‚Äôt a franchise QB. 

I feel like we are going to have 2-3 seasons where we are 7-10, 9-8, 8-9 and we won‚Äôt be able to get a good QB and by then all of our good players will be gone and we are going to have to start all over.

34623,255851,255851,imsobubblicious,"With the Super Bowl 57 coming to an end, Vic Fangio has concluded his time as a consultant for the Philadelphia Eagles and is soon expected to join the Dolphins as their new defensive coordinator.  


The longtime coordinator‚Äôs arrival means new philosophies, principles and potentially different roles for Miami defenders who have played in a much different system in recent years. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been a huge help,‚Äù Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon told the Miami Herald at the Super Bowl‚Äôs Opening Night last Monday. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a fantastic mastermind and a really good friend. ...  


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just extremely well-coached,‚Äù Gannon added about Fangio‚Äôs defenses. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs coming from the top down. I think more so anything that‚Äôs scheme or coverages or anything, his guys are in the right spot a lot. If you‚Äôre watching tape and you know what ball looks like, his defenses look like good ball.‚Äù  
 

Here is what Fangio‚Äôs system could mean for several Dolphins defenders.  
  
XAVIEN HOWARD   
Since entering the NFL as a second-round pick in 2016, Howard has been one of the best cornerbacks in the league. He‚Äôs been one of the most indispensable players on Miami‚Äôs defense because of his ability to shadow top wide receivers and use his football intelligence to intercept passes.   


But Howard admittedly had a season that was below his standard in 2022. His 15.6 yards per completion allowed was a career-worst, according to Pro Football Reference, and he dealt with a groin injury in the first half of the season.  


In Fangio‚Äôs scheme, which uses high rates of zone coverage, Howard, who turns 30 in July, won‚Äôt be asked to follow opposing wideouts as much but cover a particular spot on the field.  
Howard has great recognition of route concepts and with more snaps in zone coverage and with his eyes on the quarterback, Fangio could unlock Howard‚Äôs IQ in a different way to impact games.  
  
 JEVON HOLLAND  
Holland has put together two seasons that have established himself as one of the up-and-coming safeties in the league.  


But a bigger role could await Holland in Fangio‚Äôs scheme, which often disguises looks pre- and post-snap.   


In 2020, safety Justin Simmons led the Fangio-led Broncos with five interceptions and was named to his sole Pro Bowl. Simmons patrolled the back end of Denver‚Äôs secondary but also played close to the line of scrimmage, logging 319 snaps in the box, according to Pro Football Focus.   


Holland has shown the ability to blitz the quarterback ‚Äî he only trailed teammate Brandon Jones in pass rush snaps among safeties in 2021 ‚Äî and with fewer responsibilities as a deep safety, he could return to a more versatile role.  


KADER KOHOU   
Kohou became the latest undrafted gem for the Dolphins, starting 15 games as a rookie. Though he played significant snaps at outside corner, most of his snaps came from the slot, and that where‚Äôs his long-term projection is.   


If the Dolphins have better health at cornerback in 2023 and Kohou can return to nickel back on an every-down basis, it‚Äôs a position could he thrive in as a second-year player. Part of Fangio‚Äôs principles in run defense is funneling the ball carrier to the outside, so players can come from depth and make stops.   


Kohou is not only sticky in coverage but one of the defense‚Äôs most reliable tacklers. With a role closer to the box, Fangio could use Kohou not only in coverage and run defense but maybe as a blitzer, too.  


BRANDON JONES   
Jones began the 2022 season as Holland‚Äôs running mate at safety but his season ended in Week 7 because of a torn ACL. Before his injury, he was again taking on a role as one of the best blitzing safeties in the NFL and a trusted defensive back in the box.   


Fangio‚Äôs scheme uses two-high shells often, placing both safeties deep in coverage. In his early career, Jones has struggled at times in coverage.   


Once Jones returns to the field, one of the most intriguing questions is how Fangio uses the talented safety. Does Miami target another coverage safety in free agency? If so, the Dolphins could play more three-safety packages with Jones effectively playing a nickel cornerback or dime linebacker position.  


BRADLEY CHUBB/ JAELAN PHILLIPS   


Over the years, Fangio‚Äôs defense has brought out the best of many pass rushers, including Chubb, who had 7.5 sacks in 2020 and was named to the Pro Bowl as a member of the Broncos.   


While there‚Äôs a lot of focus on what Fangio does in the secondary, he‚Äôs also able to manufacture pressures with exotic schemes and isolate his edge rushers with favorable matchups.  


Similar to their previous defense, Chubb and Phillips will have to be stout against the run and drop into coverage at times. But their pass-rush production should also be the beneficiaries of Fangio‚Äôs presence.   


‚ÄúThe edge players are very important in this 3-4 defense Vic and I have been running these for the last eight years,‚Äù former Broncos Ed Donatell, who was Fangio‚Äôs defensive coordinator in Denver, said in 2019. ‚ÄúYou need guys that can compress the edge and then you need somebody who can rush the passer.‚Äù",65.0,miamidolphins,t3_11195o4,False,0.0,None,2023-02-13T08:14:41Z,miamidolphins,0.0002877896175588

34628,255862,255862,imsobubblicious,"So where can a team with limited cap space and needs on defense turn for upgrades on offense?   


Exploring Dolphins options at need positions offensively, knowing that Miami assuredly will need to release players and restructure contracts to clear out significant cap space:   


‚ñ™ Running back: The best options might be resigning Raheem Mostert (who ran for a career high 891 yards, which was 21st in the league) and Jeff Wilson Jr. (who was 24th with 860 combined yards for the 49ers and Dolphins).  
  
Mostert and Wilson tied for 11th in the league in per carry average, at 4.9.  
  
The most expensive unrestricted free agent options include the Giants‚Äô Saquon Barkley (295 for 1,312, 4.4 average), Detroit‚Äôs Jamaal Williams (262 for 1,066, 4.1 average and NFL-high 17 touchdowns), Las Vegas‚Äô Josh Jacobs (340 for a league-1,653 yards rushing, 4.9 per carry) and Philadelphia‚Äôs Miles Sanders (259, 1,269, 4.9).  
  
Dallas‚Äô Tony Pollard (193 or 1,007, 5.2) sustained a fractured left tibia in the Cowboys‚Äô playoff loss, leaving his market price in question.   


The Dolphins attempting to land any of those players with big-money offers would be surprising, though nothing can be ruled out after Miami signed Tyreek Hill.  
 The next tier of unrestricted free agents ‚Äî from a price and performance standpoint ‚Äî includes Carolina‚Äôs D‚ÄôOnta Foreman (4.5 average on 203 carries for 914 yards), Buffalo‚Äôs Devin Singletary (177-819, 4.6 per carry), Chicago‚Äôs David Montgomery (201-801, 4.0) and Jerick McKinnon (4.0 on 72 carries for Kansas City and 56 for 512 yards and 9 TDs as a receiver).   
Those four would be worth considering if Miami decides to keep only Mostert but not Wilson.  
More reasonably priced free agent options include Kareem Hunt (123 carries, 3.8 average), Latavius Murray (171, 4.4 average for Denver and New Orleans), Damien Harris (who averaged 4.4 yards on 106 carries behind Rhamondre Stevenson in New England), Cincinnati‚Äôs Samaje Perine (4.1 on 95 categories) and James Robinson (3.9 on 110 carries for Jacksonville and the Giants).   


Of that group, none of the five would be a clear upgrade ‚Äî or an upgrade at all ‚Äî over the 2022 versions of Mostert and Wilson.  
  
  
It will be interesting to see the market for Seattle‚Äôs Rashaad Penny, who led the league in per carry average at 6.3 in 2021 and was averaging 6.1 in five games this past season before a season-ending fibula injury in October.   
The Dolphins like Mostert and Wilson and figure to tender restricted free agent Salvon Ahmed.   


But I would by no means rule out a pursuit of outside options. The Dolphins finished last in the league in rushing attempts and 22nd in yards per carry (4.3).  
  
‚ñ™ Receiver: This could be as simple as re-signing Trent Sherfield and River Cracraft to low money deals as backups to Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. This is the position that needs the least attention on the team.   
A veteran could be added if Cedrick Wilson Jr. is traded. Miami must create opportunities for Erik Ezukanma and the staff likes practice squad receiver Braylon Sanders.   


‚ñ™ Offensive line: With money tight, the Dolphins could go without any significant addition, though backup left tackle must be addressed because of Terron Armstead‚Äôs durability issues.  
  
General Chris Grier has said that Liam Eichenberg (left guard) and Austin Jackson (right tackle) again will be given a chance to win starting jobs, suggesting that Miami won‚Äôt spend big on clear-cut veteran starters at those positions.  


One pricey pickup who could be tempting is 49ers free agent right tackle Mike McGlinchey; McDaniel‚Äôs time in San Francisco intersected with McGlinchey‚Äôs. PFF rated him the 34th best tackle this past season, but he earned $10.9 million in 2022 and would be expensive.  


The Dolphins are clearly hesitant to give up on the idea of Jackson starting, and spending big on a free agent right tackle likely would signify giving up on Jackson as a starter.  


This could be as simple as re-signing Kendall Lamm and Brandon Shell as backup tackles, and having them compete with Jackson at right tackle, and then having Rob Jones compete with Eichenberg at left guard.   


But the Dolphins would need at least one more interior lineman, including a backup center, in that scenario. Michael Deiter will be a free agent and didn‚Äôt play a snap this past season.   
If the Dolphins keep both Shell and Lamm, that raises questions about whether the line has enough position versatility. Armstead, Shell and Lamm are all tackles; Jackson can play tackle or guard.  


‚ñ™ Tight end: Mike Gesicki will assuredly move on, and the Dolphins are left with this question:   
Do they want to spend $6 million or more a year on a legitimate starter to share time with Durham Smythe, or do they commit to Smythe, Hunter Long and Tanner Conner and merely add a cheap veteran who wouldn‚Äôt necessarily start?   


Dallas‚Äô Dalton Schultz (57 catches, 577 yards) and Jacksonville‚Äôs Evan Engram (73-766) and potentially Gesicki are the three tight ends best positioned for sizable deals. Schultz is the best blocker of those three. Keep an eye on Las Vegas‚Äô Foster Moreau, who had 33 catches for 420 yards in 14 starts last season. Dolphins offensive coordinator Frank Smith coached him in Las Vegas in 2019 and 2020. But PFF rated him as the sixth-worst run blocker among tight ends; Gesicki was seventh.  


And like previous Dolphins staffs, this coaching staff has displayed an affinity for players they‚Äôve coached before, including Sherfield, Cracraft, Mostert, Wilson and Alec Ingold.   
Also keep an eye on Baltimore‚Äôs Josh Oliver, PFF‚Äôs second-best run-blocking tight end this season. He would be reasonably priced and has receiving skills, too; he caught 14 for 149 and two touchdowns this past season.  
  
Beyond Moreau and Oliver, reasonable unrestricted free agent options ‚Äî to supplement Smythe, Long and Conner, if the Dolphins choose ‚Äî include Tennessee‚Äôs Austin Hooper (41 catches for 444 yards, two starters in 2022), Green Bay‚Äôs Robert Tonyan Jr. (53 for 470, three starts), the Bengals‚Äô Hayden Hurst (52 for 414 in 13 starts), Minnesota‚Äôs Irv Smith Jr. (25 for 182 in eight games; he made seven starts in 2020 and 202), the 49ers‚Äô Tyler Kroft (four for 57, four starts), Houston‚Äôs Jordan Akins (37 for 495, three starts) and Texans teammate O.J. Howard (10 for 145, 10 starts).   


Among that group, Pro Football Focus rated Akins 12th, Oliver 14th, Hooper 18th, Hurst 30th, Moreau 39th, Tonyan 52nd, Smith 56th and Howard 57th among 74 tight ends.   
As run blockers, Hurst was the highest rated of that group, at 32nd. Hurst would stand to be perhaps the most expensive on that list; the Bengals likely will try to keep him.  
  
As perspective, Smythe was rated 33rd and Gesicki 41st of 74 tight ends.  


‚ñ™ Backup quarterback: Teddy Bridgewater proved too injury prone to warrant returning. And the Dolphins need to take the role seriously because of Tua Tagovailoa‚Äôs concussion and durability issues.   


So the Dolphins likely need to sign either Jimmy Garoppolo or a backup such as Philadelphia‚Äôs Gardner Minshew or the Saints‚Äô Andy Dalton. Here‚Äôs more on this topic.",16.0,miamidolphins,t3_10qvoyv,False,0.0,None,2023-02-01T08:14:39Z,miamidolphins,-1.799871753914693e-06

34630,255864,255864,imsobubblicious,"The Dolphins infused veteran additions to stabilize an inexperienced offensive line and it produced positive returns. But injuries afflicted the position group and stunted the development of a pair of young starters. In the fourth of a series of position reviews, the Miami Herald will examine the team‚Äôs offensive line situation. Next up is tight end.   
2022 REVIEW   


The Dolphins added left tackle Terron Armstead and Connor Williams, who was moved from guard to center, inserting a pair of reliable starters to an offensive line that struggled in 2021. Williams developed into one of the league‚Äôs better centers and Armstead was named to the Pro Bowl but he played through a litany of injuries and missed four games.  
Miami expressed confidence that left guard Liam Eichenberg and right tackle Austin Jackson would thrive in the new offensive scheme but they both missed significant portions of the season with injuries. The Dolphins used nine different starting offensive line combinations, one more than the previous season.  


DEPTH CHART   


TERRON ARMSTEAD   
Skinny: Armstead was named to his fourth Pro Bowl and made it despite playing with injuries to his toe, pec, knee and hip.  


Contract: Armstead, who turns 32 in July, is entering the second year of a five-year contract. He has a cap hit of $21,114,706, the third-largest on the team.  


LIAM EICHENBERG  
 Skinny: Eichenberg struggled in the first half of the season in his move to left guard and then sprained his knee in Week 8, just as coaches said he was playing his best ball. He appeared in 10 games.   


Contract: Eichenberg, 25, is entering the third year of a four-year rookie contract. He has a cap hit of $2,185,768.  


CONNOR WILLIAMS   
Skinny: Williams signed with the Dolphins last offseason and moved from guard to center, a position he hadn‚Äôt played in a regular-season game. Snaps were a problem at times, but Williams emerged as one of Miami‚Äôs top linemen and was the sole player to appear in every offensive snap.   


Contract: Williams, who turns 26 in May, is entering the final year of a two-year contract. He has a cap hit of $8,375,000, the 10th-largest on the team.   


ROBERT HUNT Skinny: Hunt continued his development at right guard, appearing in all 17 games and finishing the season as one of the highest-graded players at his position., according to Pro Football Focus.  


Contract: Hunt, who turns 27 in August, is entering the final year of a four-year rookie contract. He has a cap hit of $3,851,498.  


 AUSTIN JACKSON  
Skinny: Jackson began the season as the starting right tackle but sustained an ankle sprain that sidelined him until Week 12 He re-injured his ankle and was placed on injured reserve again, which sidelined him for the remainder of the season.   


Contract: Jackson, who turns 24 in August, is entering the fourth year of a five-year rookie contract, with a team option for the fifth season. He has a cap hit of $4,340,112.  


BRANDON SHELL   
Skinny: Shell signed to the team‚Äôs practice squad last September and then was promoted to the 53-man roster in October. The veteran lineman started 11 games, primarily at right tackle.  


Contract: Shell, who turns 31 in February, is headed for unrestricted free agency.

ROBERT JONES Skinny: Jones made eight starts at both guard spots.  
Contract: Jones, 24, is entering the final year of a three-year contract he signed as an undrafted free agent. He has a cap hit of $950,000.  


GREG LITTLE   
Skinny: Little made seven starts, primarily at right tackle for the injured Jackson.  
Contract: Little, who turns 26 in November, is headed for unrestricted free agency.  


KENDALL LAMM   
Skinny: Lamm signed to the team‚Äôs practice squad in late November and made one start in Week 17 but injured his ankle and did not play in the final two games of the season.   
Contract: Lamm, who turns 31 in June, is headed for unrestricted free agency.   


MICHAEL DEITER   
Skinny: Deiter, who started 23 games in his first four seasons, did not log an offensive snap in 2022.  
Contract: Deiter, who turns 27 in September, is headed for unrestricted free agency.  


GERON CHRISTIAN  
Skinny: The Dolphins claimed Christian off waivers from the Chiefs in January but he did not appear in a game.   
Contract: Christian, who turns 27 in September, is headed for unrestricted free agency.  


ERIC FISHER Skinny:   
Fisher signed with the Dolphins in December but he did not appear in a game and was placed on injured reserve a month later with a calf injury.  
 Contract: Fisher, 32, has a voidable year for the 2023 season.  
  
OFFSEASON QUESTIONS 1. What is next for Eichenberg and Jackson?  
 Injuries slowed the development of the two recent high draft picks, but general manager Chris Grier said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre both part of the plan, and we‚Äôll give them opportunities to grow and compete here.‚Äù  


While Grier has praised their play, their backups were often just as effective. Neither player was given legitimate competition for their starting roles last summer but will that change in 2023?  


2. Are the Dolphins primed to target another veteran lineman in free agency?   
Prior to last offseason, Miami had attempted to build its offensive line through the draft, as opposed to splurging in free agency. But given the success of Armstead and Williams, and the lingering questions at left guard and right tackle, targeting another veteran could further solidify a line that made strides, despite myriad injuries.  


3. What does the offensive line look like in Year 2 of McDaniel‚Äôs scheme?  
 Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel and assistants such as offensive coordinator Frank Smith and offensive line coach Matt Applebaum emphasized early on that it would take time for the offensive line to jell within the new zone running scheme.   
And between their coaching and the veterans added, the unit did make improvements. But the Dolphins‚Äô run blocking was inconsistent times and so was pass blocking, especially when Armstead was out of the lineup. With another year of continuity, possible upgrades and better injury luck, the Dolphins‚Äô offensive line could develop into one of the league‚Äôs better units in 2023.  


POTENTIAL ADDITIONS It wouldn‚Äôt come cheap, but if the Dolphins seek a proven starter, tight tackle Mike McGlinchey is a scheme fit who overlapped with McDaniel in San Francisco. The Dolphins could also bring one or two of the veterans, like Brandon Shell, as depth.  


BYU‚Äôs Blake Freeland, an offensive tackle, and Ohio State‚Äôs Luke Wypler, an interior lineman, are players who could be targeted in the draft.",15.0,miamidolphins,t3_10q2rw8,False,0.0,None,2023-01-31T10:05:15Z,miamidolphins,-0.0078003589038396
34631,255868,255868,imsobubblicious,"Fourth in a four-part series on the Dolphins‚Äô quarterback situation It‚Äôs bad enough when your starting quarterback has durability issues. But when your backup can‚Äôt stay healthy, either, then you find yourself in an untenable position like the Dolphins were in Buffalo, when they were forced to play a rookie seventh-round pick (Skylar Thompson).  
With the Dolphins committed to Tua Tagovailoa as their starter next season, they must find a backup who‚Äôs less injury prone than Teddy Bridgewater, who had two concussions in 2021 and knee and pinkie injuries that sidelined him for a combined seven games in 2022. Examining realistic backup quarterback options who are impending unrestricted free agents:  
‚ñ™ Jimmy Garoppolo. This one is complicated, because some team likely will be willing to essentially hand him the starting job ‚Äî something the Dolphins will not do. He‚Äôs also the most expensive ‚Äúbackup‚Äù quarterback option on the market; Miami likely would need to allocate at least $12 million in cap space to sign him, and that‚Äôs several million more than most other backups would cost. Keep in mind that while Garoppolo has been good in recent years (16 TDs, 4 interceptions, 100.3 rating this season), he hasn‚Äôt been quite as good as Tagovailoa was this season. He would need to accept coming in as a backup, and that‚Äôs difficult to envision.  
  
Also worrisome: He tore his ACL in 2018, missed time with an ankle injury in 2020, missed two games in 2021 (a calf injury was a problem), and then saw this past regular season end with a foot injury in Week 13 against the Dolphins. So Garoppolo isn‚Äôt exactly the model of durability. ‚ñ™ Andy Dalton. If the Saints want him back to compete to be their starter again, this wouldn‚Äôt be realistic. Otherwise, Dalton would make some sense. He had 18 touchdowns, 9 interceptions and a 95.2 rating in 14 starts this season. There would be competence at the position if Tagovailoa were injured again.  
  
Dalton, 35, was a starter for the first nine years of his career with Cincinnati, then started nine games for Dallas in 2020 (87.3 rating) and six for Chicago in 2021 (76.9 passer rating). He was 6-8 as a starter for the Saints this past season and 83-77-2 as a starter in his career. ‚ñ™ Philadelphia‚Äôs Gardner Minshew. Though he won only 8 of 24 starts in his career ‚Äî most of those for a bad Jacksonville team ‚Äî he has a solid 93.1 passer rating with 44 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. As Philadelphia‚Äôs backup the past two seasons, he went 1-3 with seven touchdowns, four interceptions and a 92.8 rating. He‚Äôs a clear step up from Thompson, more durable than Bridgewater and likely will be affordable.  
  
He missed some time with a thumb injury in 2020 but otherwise has been healthy. He could be the best value signing of this group. ‚ñ™ The Rams‚Äô Baker Mayfield. After Mayfield and the Browns parted ways, he didn‚Äôt impress in a six-start stint for Carolina, throwing six touchdowns and six interceptions with a 74.4 passer rating; the Panthers went 1-5 in those games. But after the Panthers released him, he had somewhat better success with the Rams, with four touchdowns, two interceptions and an 86.4 rating in five games and four starts. But he went 1-3 as a Rams starter this season and is 31-38 in his career.  
  
‚ñ™ Washington‚Äôs Taylor Heinicke. He could return as a backup with the Commanders or be given another chance to start. If not, he‚Äôs worth considering. He went 5-3-1 with 12 touchdowns, six interceptions and an 89.6 passer rating this past season. He‚Äôs 12-12-1 with 34 touchdowns and 24 interceptions in his career as a starter. ‚ñ™ The Cowboys‚Äô Cooper Rush. He was decent filling in for Dak Prescott this season, going 4-1 with five touchdowns, three interceptions and an 80 passer rating. He‚Äôs 5-1 in six career starts.  
‚ñ™ The Jets‚Äô Mike White. He has looked good at times, poor at others. But in both instances, he has had trouble winning, with a 2-5 record. For his career, the graduate of Davie University School has eight touchdowns, 12 interceptions and a 75.4 rating. He might end up no better than Thompson. ‚ñ™ Carolina‚Äôs Sam Darnold. The former Jets first-round bust had perhaps his best stretch with the Panthers this season, going 4-2 with seven touchdowns, three interceptions and a 92.6 rating late in the season before an ugly finale at New Orleans, when he had a 2.8 passer rating.  
  
Overall, he had nine TDs, 13 picks and a 71.9 rating in 11 starts for Carolina last season. So he cannot really be trusted. ‚ñ™ Jacksonville‚Äôs C.J. Beathard. He has experience with Mike McDaniel in San Francisco, where he went 2-10 as a starter with 18 TDs, 13 picks and an 81.1 rating. He threw 13 passes as Jacksonville‚Äôs backup the past two years, completing nine of them. ‚ñ™ Minnesota‚Äôs Nick Mullens. Like Beathard, he has experience with McDaniel, going 5-11, with 25 TDs, 22 interceptions and an 87.2 rating over three seasons with the 49ers, before starting one game in Cleveland in 2021 (89.2 rating).  
  
He completed 21 of 25 passes for 224 yards, with 1 TD and 1 INT, all in a backup role in Minnesota this season. ‚ñ™ Seattle‚Äôs Drew Lock: Geno Smith beat him out for the starter‚Äôs job and Lock didn‚Äôt play a snap this season. He went 8-13 as a starter for Denver, with 25 touchdowns, 20 interceptions and a 79.3 passer rating. ‚ñ™ Case Keenum: He was competent as a Browns backup in 2021, going 2-0 with a 91.3 passer rating. He completed 2 of 7 passes for Buffalo this season. He‚Äôs 29-35 as a starter, with an 85.2 rating. The 34-year-old has a 2-8 record but a 91.3 rating in his last 10 starts, dating to 2019. ‚ñ™ Other options: Among the other impending unrestricted free agents, none are particularly appealing: Bridgwater and Cleveland‚Äôs Jacoby Brissett (been there, done that), Kyle Allen (60.6 rating in two starts for Houston this season), Mason Rudolph, Joe Flacco, Blaine Gabbert, Chase Daniel, Chad Henne, Brandon Allen, Nate Sudfield, Jeff Driskel, Trace McSorley and Jarrett Stidham. Brett Rypien and Tyler Huntler are restricted free agents. For the Dolphins, Tagovailoa and Thompson are under contract, and Bridgewater is an unrestricted free agent. Going into camp with Thompson as the No. 2 doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea; though he had some good moments in the finale against the Jets and playoff game at Buffalo, he generally struggled. His final numbers, including playoffs: 78 for 150 for 754 yards, two touchdowns, five interceptions and a 56.9 rating. The view here: See if Garoppolo is willing to come as a backup, making more than an average backup but less than most veteran starters do. (I sense he will find a starting job elsewhere). If not, explore Minshew. Because the Dolphins say they are committed to Tagovailoa as their starter, we aren‚Äôt listing unrestricted free agent starters Tom Brady, Daniel Jones and Geno Smith, restricted free agent Lamar Jackson and the Raiders‚Äô Derek Carr, who is likely to be traded or released.

Little nuggets that stuck out to me
-McDaniel references how the Vegas spread changed by four points once tua was out. Coaches usually pretend to be unaware of spreads so that was interesting.
-When asked what he learned from his first season as HC, McDaniel says how rewarding the good things would be and how much missed opportunities keep him up at night. 
-He knows how starved the fanbase and organization is for a playoff win and regrets that he couldn‚Äôt get it done. This is a guy that wants to win badly.
-Wilkins has an incredible work ethic. He‚Äôs definitely the heart and soul of the defense.
-Grier said high rate of team injuries will not affect future personnel decisions. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt play scared. It‚Äôs football, injuries happen‚Äù.
