Poles chose the Bears over the Vikings. There are reports that one of the big reasons the Bears gave him more control was over the roster:

What is known is that since Poles took over, he’s pushed the Bears franchise in a completely different direction than Adofo-Mensah has with the Vikings



Poles choosing Chi over MN only adds to **THE MANDATE** theory. Meanwhile Kwesi in the same link:



> “I think when people look at teams, they sometimes do it in a very binary way,” he said. “They ask, ‘Are you either all-in or tearing down and rebuilding?’ And I don’t really look at the world that way. The way we look at it is we’re trying to navigate both worlds, we’re trying to live in today and tomorrow — or the competitive rebuild

2635,7445,7445,Ajax_Malone,"# THE MANDATE



Ownership has a macro mandate to be as competitive as possible every year. Always trying to win as many games as possible without a longer outlook beyond the current year. Not even a soft rebuild allowed. **THE MANDATE** drives the GM’s decision making. Which is why Rick and Kwesi so far look like they have a very similar GM style. Also why there was so much talk about having a “collaborative” front office. 


This theory is backed up by pretty much every professional reporter who’s followed the team and you saw it with Mark Wilf’s comments before they hired a new GM. 


And example of a horrific move caused by **THE MANDATE** is the Ngakoue trade. The GM knew Hunter was out for the year. He knew we didn’t have a contending team yet he still traded a 2nd round pick in a desperate move to keep the team more competitive. All made worse by the cap situation of the team because they needed all the high draft picks possible to find good players on cheap rookie deals. 



So while they’re not meddling in today to today decisions they are meddling in the direction the GM takes and it keeps us in the current cycle of mostly mediocre, occasional good but never close great. 



If you accept in the reality of the theory our outlook looks pretty capped while **THE MANDATE** still exists. Which might be why there is an angry opposition on this board to ever acknowledging **The MANDATE**. It forces the board to defend moves like the Ngakoue trade (to this day) or the Bradford trade.

4087,31379,31379,DaFuxxDick,"One of my off-season theories is that Kwesi is going to trade for Texans QB Davis Mills. The Texans are most likely drafting a QB this year with their top pick. 
Facts:
1. Davis Mills is a 24 year old QB, 6’ 4”, 225lbs
2. Spent first two years under Lovie Smith and David Culley
3. Only offensive weapons: Brandon Cooks & Dameon Pierce
4. Behind a bottom 5 offensive line first two years
5. Kwesi has already established that he seeks out young athletes (under 27) from teams that don’t want them (Blacklock, Hockenson, Reagor, Tonga, Shelley).
6. Low Risk: Would most likely cost a conditional 5th round pick that could turn into a 4th

This gives KOC and Kirk the opportunity to groom a young talent who may have underperformed as a starter due to a bad franchise who gave him absolutely no help. This would also occur without trading premium picks and allow kwesi to keep our premium picks to draft defensive talent",6.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10h5p5e,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T13:34:08Z,minnesotavikings,0.0489871475008861

Given our limited resources of FA money and draft picks, it is going to take multiple years to accomplish. I’ll name a few players and operate under the assumption that the Wilfs do not want to take a step back competitively…

Hicks - Easy release. He is slow and can’t keep up in coverage. 

Kendricks - I would release him, but I think the Wilfs push back on that. Given that he’s a long time leader on the team. Final verdict is ride out the last year of the contract. 

Pat Peterson - I’m letting him find a new team to win a championship. If he’s still unsigned in June, he can come back on a very cheap 1 year deal. 

Chandon Sullivan - Goodbye. Slot corners are inexpensive and plentiful. 

ZaDarius Smith - Attempt to trade him for a mid round pick. If no one bites, he’s a cap casualty. Too many lingering injuries over the years. 

Harry the Hitman - Restructure his deal. I think he can contribute positively for the next 2 years before it all hits the fan. 

Cam Dantzler - Attempt to trade for a mid round pick. Very strange for him to be out for the wild card game. 

Danielle Hunter - Extension. He will 100% hold out if nothing is done about his 2023 salary. This was a prove your healthy season and he did it. 

Dalvin Tomlinson - Attempt to sign him since we have void year dead money anyway. But don’t go overboard trying to retain him. 

Just focusing on defense here… All in all, need a new EDGE to replace Z Smith, a slot CB, maybe a MLB if Kendricks is released, and hope for good health from Cine/Booth Jr. As much as I’d like to do more, I don’t believe we’ll totally blow it up.",1.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10ggmbq,False,0.0,Fat Pat Williams,2023-01-19T18:39:24Z,minnesotavikings,0.0346042928977375

As long as we can't win big playoff games, let alone a HOME playoff game against a wild card team like tonight with a full crowd of Vikings fans there, we will continue to be considered ""non-threats"" and will be mocked and disrespected. I think a healthy dose of knowing that we WILL be disrespected and brushed off indefinitely isn't bad, but until the day we finally get back to a SuperBowl *at a minimum*, the narrative will persist. Winning the division or winning a wild card game won't ever be nearly enough to position us as legit contenders in the public view.  

Life goes on, and we'll have a new chance  to try and find a way to overcome the years of letdown and turn this into a culture of finally winning the biggest games. Vikes for life though man, I'm fine with being disrespected as long as we continue to strive for excellence in the championship. Skol.

They they made a playoff run to the NFC Championship game only to get blown out in Philadelphia.

However, the crucial difference is that Kirk was dropped into a team with a defensive head coach who hated his guts from the beginning. The 49ers have the dominant defense AND an offensive genius for a head coach who will actually make an effort to maximize Kirk",6.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10r10qw,False,0.0,None,2023-02-01T13:59:08Z,minnesotavikings,-0.099216
12793,80648,80648,Lobi-Wan,"First of all, I'm not convinced SF would even want to trade for Kirk at this point in his career. He'll be 35 to start next season and any player in their mid-late 30's carries a risk of falling off a cliff physically. But let's pretend they do want to trade for them. 

There is a MASSIVE difference in the how the Vikings and 49er's roster are constructed. 

The 49er's have one of the best defenses in the NFL already. They have insane weapons on offense, a top 10 oline in both the pass and run, and an offensive mastermind running the show. Any mediocre QB can look decent in that offense. So the appeal of trading for Kirk would be to see what an actual good quarterback could do with that infrastructure. They also have one of the best defenses in the NFL. Kirk would fit incredibly well there because he doesn't need to be great, he just needs to be good. 

The Vikings have an incredible weapon in JJ, a really good weapon in Hock, franchise offensive tackles, and EVERYONE else is either washed, replaceable, or just flat out bad. The only redeeming quality about the defense is Danielle Hunter. The DB's are either aging, mediocre, or have injury concerns. Both starting LB's are completely cooked and we have no idea what the defensive line will look like next season. To make matters worse, a lot of the washed players are also signed to bloated contracts that will be difficult to move off of. 

There is absolutely zero comparison between these two teams from a roster standpoint. Plus, the 49ers currently have $17 million in cap space while the Vikings are about $24 million OVER the cap. Yes, we can restructure some contracts to free up some space for next season, but the 49ers can also restructure to free up even more space than what they already have. 

TLDR: The 49ers have a stacked roster, cap space, and run probably the most QB friendly offense in the league. The Vikings have holes to fill on offense, need to completely rebuild the defense, and have negative cap space to work with. Our window is closed.

Kirk is under contract through next season. That gives you this offseason AND next offseason to plan for his replacement.

I would argue that it would be far worse to go into Jefferson's prime with Kirk. We know Kirk isn't going to sign a team friendly contract. Plus, by the time JJ hits his prime Kirk will be in his late 30's. How happy will JJ be if Kirk signs another big extension and then his arm wilts away like Matt Ryan's? With JJ's inevitable massive deal we can't afford to pay a washed QB top dollar. Let's not forget, Darrisaw is also due for a big extension soon. 

The best way to capitalize on JJ's prime would be to identify a young QB who's rookie contract somewhat coincides with JJ's next contract.

The deadline to get under the cap is 3/15, so we’ve got a month to get these deals done and create space for free agency. 

My bet on the first official move is a restructure for Brian O’Neill, converting salary to signing bonus and freeing up cap space. O’Neill is a surefire starter for years to come, and will gladly take guaranteed money now, making this move a slam dunk.

The next moves will be the easy ones - cutting players with minimal dead cap. I’d put Jordan Hicks and C.J. Ham firmly in this category, and maybe some defensive depth players like Troy Dye, Ross Blacklock, etc. 

After that, I’d focus on the players that are giving the least value on large contracts, which in my opinion is Thielen and Cook. I’d love to have Thielen retire a Viking, but reading between the lines it’s seeming a bit unlikely either player takes a pay cut, so we may have to bite the bullet and cut them, eating the dead cap hits in 2023.

I agree with everything you're saying here, and the volume of good RB options on the market has convinced me that Mattison probably isn't getting a great contract. I do still think he and his agent will be pushing for one - it's likely his best and only shot at maximizing his value while he's still in his prime. But if his market never materializes, I do hope it's the Vikings who give him a good offer and opportunity. Who knows, he may even take a one-year prove-it deal here and try to hit free agency again next offseason if there's a less loaded RB market. 

I also agree I'd rather be taking shots at defense with our draft picks, I think I'd only use a round 3-5 pick on RB if a real game-changer were available, one of the upper-tier prospects you mentioned. Spears has gotten a lot of buzz of late, so he could also be an option. I think my best-case scenario would be Mattison on something like $3M / 1 year with bonuses based on production, paired with a 6th or 7th round pick who complements his skillset. My personal favorite is Deuce Vaughn, I think he'd be better in such a role than Nwangwu, and Chandler would be the backup to Mattison.",2.0,minnesotavikings,t3_110h32y,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2023-02-12T12:00:01Z,minnesotavikings,0.0879261233432081

I just want to avoid paying over ~$6M AAV for an RB unless they’re really, really good, because at the middle tier of RB you’re much better off spending your money elsewhere.

This FA class is also stacked, so I think we may be able to find a bargain deal after all of the top names.

Cousins’ problem is that he refuses to go off-script. He’s a master of getting through the designed reads in a play, but if anything doesn’t go according to plan (pressure in his face, unexpected coverage scheme, etc.) the play is all but doomed. He can’t buy extra time, he refuses to throw into coverage, so he either takes the sack, throws it away, or checks it down.

15079,101883,101883,Nijo32,"Dual threat is too vague, I agree. I meant a QB who is a threat to run, or at the very least use his athleticism to escape the pass rush and extend plays. Your examples would fall under this category (at least the younger/prime versions of those players). Not necessarily reliant on scrambling, but a threat that the defense must account for. 

Of course I’d love to have Brady, but there’s only one Brady. Cousins plays in that same mold, just without the postseason success - I won’t get into the full Kirk Cousins debate that’s been had 1000+ times on here, but pro- or anti-Kirk the playoff results have not come and it’s looking like that window has just about closed. 

The reason I say I’d prefer mobility is what it opens up for the offense. Cousins looks great when the offense is working around him and he’s able to cleanly operate - his reads are quick and his passes are accurate. But when something goes wrong (i.e. Dexter Lawrence bowls over our weak interior offensive linemen) there’s nothing Kirk can really do but checkdown or eat a sack. It puts a limit on the chunk plays the offense can achieve over the course of a season, whereas I think a QB with better mobility can escape pressure and extend plays, or even slow down a pass rush by forcing the defense to be more mindful of rushing lanes and contain. It’s likely more of an issue for teams like the Vikings with mediocre to bad pass blocking, but I don’t think it’s a coincidence that so many of the top offenses have mobile QBs.

15101,101905,101905,Nijo32,"The best way for a fan to estimate an upcoming free agent’s contract is to look at similar players’ contracts in the most recent free agent period. So for K.J., I’d look at what WR2/WR3’s signed for in the 2022 offseason. Obviously it depends how K.J. plays in 2023, but a few players I’d put in K.J.’s range of outcomes are:

Marquez Valdez-Scantling: $30M / 3 years

Russell Gage: $30M / 3 years

Zay Jones: $24M / 3 years

Cedrick Wilson: $22.5M / 3 years

Braxton Berrios: $12M / 2 years

Josh Reynolds: $6M / 2 years


These WRs offer a variety of skillsets and production leading into their free agent deals, but I would guess if K.J. continues building on his recent success, that $30M / 3 year deal will be what his agent kicks off negotiations with. If the Vikings cut/trade Thielen and K.J. is the 2023 WR2, his demands could be much higher. Conversely, if the Vikings retain Thielen, or draft/sign a WR who jumps ahead of K.J., he may slide all the way down to the Berrios contract (Berrios was a WR4 with special teams contributions).

15111,101916,101916,Nijo32,"In one word? Aggression. Flores may run a base 3-4, but he’s a polar opposite from Donatell in how he deploys his unit. Flores LOVES to blitz, or at minimum present a blitz to create confusion in the opposing OL. His final year in Miami, he used either Cover 0 or Cover 1 about 50% of the time, and he loves to disguise blitzes by showing more potential rushers than the offense has as blockers (think Zimmer’s double-A-gap looks). Contrast this with how rarely Minnesota blitzed in 2022, and it’s already looking like a big shift in ideology. Players who jump out for this scheme are Asamoah and Harrison Smith as blitzers, and the Vikings will likely look to add athleticism at the slot to threaten blitzes from there as well. 

While this may sound great after watching the “Donashell” for a season, the potential downside is the risk it creates in the secondary. Flores relies heavily on his CBs, and even asks safeties to play some man coverage on particularly aggressive blitzes. Corners are put on an island with much less safety help, and if the blitz doesn’t get home it can result in chunk plays. Do the Vikings have a secondary that can be trusted with this? Hiring Flores could signal heavy investment in the CB room in the upcoming offseason. Again, slot is a glaring need for improvement, but it’s yet to be seen how Flores feels about players like Booth, Dantzler, and Evans, or the possible returns of Peterson and Shelley. 

In my opinion, it’s a great calculated risk in scheme change. The Vikings simply don’t have the talent to sit back in a bend-don’t-break defense - they’re almost always worse than the opposing offense, and can’t rely on getting key stops consistently.

When it become apparent his neck injury was significant, and that he’d miss most if not all of the season, they had to look for ways to replace their star edge rusher. This was a team coming off a playoff win in 2019, looking to build not tear down. With a tandem of rookies at CB in Jeff Gladney and Cam Dantzler, Zimmer was counting on reliable pass rush to aid their early development. Faced with a sudden void at the edge and lackluster backups of Odenigbo, Wonnum, and Holmes paired with only run stuffers at DT, Zimmer and Spielman turned their search external. Yannick Ngakoue had been franchise tagged by Jacksonville and was holding out, but no buyer had met Jacksonville’s demands. With one week to go until the regular season and a massive need that had not been planned for, Spielman negotiated a salary decrease for Ngakoue to facilitate the trade to try to save the Vikings’ defense before the season started. Instead, Ngakoue was a poor fit in Andre Patterson and Mike Zimmer’s scheme, accumulating sacks as a speed rusher but abandoning his assignments as a run defender. By the time it was clear he was not the solution and the defense was far worse than imagined, Ngakoue was only under contract for roughly half a season, and Spielman was forced to sell him for less than he bought him for, a huge red flag that he and Zimmer’s time in Minnesota may be short-lived.",1.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10q3ens,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2023-01-31T23:04:17Z,minnesotavikings,-0.0489870369571496

On the other end of the spectrum would be the Marvin Lewis Bengals years - constantly making the playoffs but never even winning a playoff game. This philosophy typically gets fanbase buy-in year after year, which is appealing to owners as you pointed out. 

Conversely, some teams go the tank/rebuild route, sacrificing years to reset and stockpile resources at the cost of fan support and revenue. Only the most patient (or disinterested) owners tend to green light this approach. The gamble here is trusting the GM/HC to be the right decision makers with these resources - using them poorly could set a franchise back for over a decade.

Here are some of my unpopular Vikings opinions. Downvote away:

As much as it pains me to admit it because Moss is my all-time favorite player; Jerry Rice is the 🐐. Moss is arguably the greatest deep threat and athletic specimen of a WR (Moss vs Megatron is a debate), but what Rice continued to do in his 30s - 12,274 yards and 91 TDs *after* he turned 30 - and 40s - 2,509 and 10 TDs - is insane. 

The '98 team would have been beaten in the SB by Denver. The injuries and porous run defense would have been torn apart by TD. '09 is the year we *should* and *would* have won the SB. 

AT does not belong in the Ring of Honor. Incredible story, but his peak was so short. Two 1k yard seasons doesn't scream Vikings legend. 

Numbers shouldn't be retired. At some point, if the NFL continues long enough, you'll run out of them.

PFF estimates the top FAs (Saquon, Jacobs/Pollard) to be up in that $12M range.

2) the leverage Rodgers had was that he could threaten to retire if he didn't like the trade or to just spite the Packers. This would hit them for $15M in 2023 and $25M in 2024 of dead cap, and no draft compensation for a rebuild.

 1) stability in the front office

 2) a good head coach

3) a strong defense

4) a franchise QB

Tanking may increase your odds in the lotto for 4) if you don't have one and may help you get capital towards 3), but in the process you will lose 1+2. KOC and KAM are getting fired if we tank and don't immediately improve.

 If I had to predict which franchise will win the most super bowls in the next decade, I'm putting my money on it being Kansas City. They had 1+2 in place and were a playoff team in 2016. They had pick 27 in the 2017 draft-- they didn't tank to move up to 12 for Mahomes. They had the right front office and the right coaches to identify their guy, make the move to get him and then develop him in to who he is today.

We won’t be able to fix all positions of need but I firmly believe if we can either get a RG who’s at least Ezra Cleveland level (Ingram stepping up would be huge. I liked some of his tape. He has the physical gifts. Needs the smarts) and get our MLBs cookin with chicken grease (whether we ditch Kendricks and Hicks or try to fix em/play Asahmoah) I’ll feel really good going into next season. We can’t fix everything. No team can (except the fucking Eagles apparently) if our offensive personnel is pretty much the same with upgraded RG play and our LB core and IDL improve that would be I think a huge win personnel wise.

Not to mention often lip syncing isn't actual lip syncing, she likely sang behind that mic with the power cut to make it more authentic.

One thing I wish I would see get more credit is the absolutely PHENOMENAL arrangement behind her on that song by John Clayton. So many things going on at a music theory level that obviously your average Joe wouldn't know about (why would they) that creates so much more power and emotion that your average Joe can still feel, then with one of the most powerful and emotional voices of all time singing it. Everything about that rendition was musically elite. I am not a very patriotic person and everything about that rendition makes me want to fly on a bald eagle and drop American flags across the globe while chanting ""USA"" at the top of my lungs.

Lip syncing does not take away from her still singing that song nor that rendition. It is frequently the top ranked Super Bowl anthem performance for a reason.

* When JJ goes deep, he gets triple teamed because we don't have anyone threatening on the other side of the field. 
* Our QB has no pass protection. 
* Our QB, when stressed, forgets where the defense is and can't read open players.

Without skilled veterans, we start losing, which hurts short term, but pulls us higher up the draft ladder. The more cheap, young, unproven talent we have on this roster, the better long term because if they do have a breakout season, they're another asset in the making. We build their stock and flip it for more. Justine Jefferson is already giving vague, ""Let's see how much they *really* want me"" answers, because he figured out the business and knows he's got the leverage. He'll take the money, and we want him to earlier than later because the salary cap should go up over time. If we play our cards right, after a few years, early in his big contract, all that young talent we'd been hording/flipping will turn into a couple of irreplaceable position players and a couple of *extra* draft picks that we turn into supporting players around a new core. JJ will be in his prime, and our roster will start to look like it's coming together for long term success. When that happens, despite JJ's contract, we'll still be on so many young contracts that we'll have enough money to make a few big signings and fill the missing pieces. 

Keeping good players in lost years is a recipe for disaster. Look at how the Patriots operated for 20 years. Forget the fact they had Brady and Bill for a second. They sold high and bought low -- always leveraging their value in order to sustain the ability to acquire new talent and make big acquisitions.

It seemed like Purdy was going to be the guy moving forward over Lance from how he played until last week, but with all the injuries to Purdy/Lance I wonder if San Fran would say F it and go all in on a QB who is no question better than each (right now at least) in Kirk to maximize their chances of winning with this window.  No one knows how confident they actually feel about either Lance or Purdy, it would seem smart to just roll with one of the young cheap guys but I wonder where the 49ers brass' heads are at with all the injuries now.",0.0,nfl,t3_10r51zz,False,0.0,:Vikings: Vikings,2023-02-01T14:54:36Z,minnesotavikings,0.12775

25530,158470,158470,WetAppleFruit,"Okay I'll try to apply some nuance here. On the surface 49ers gave up more than a 3rd rounder for Lance and i understand the confusion in that why would they give him up for less than what they traded for. 

Things havent worked out for Lance and his value has dropped quite alot since hes been drafted by compounding these factors. His behind the scenes leadership which was in question upon his arrival there hasnt met the niners expectations, him not being on the field also hurts value and the fact hes already played less than the amount of games people would be otherwise comfortable with. The injury he has is one that can alter his mobility which is his probably his biggest strength and close second being his arm strength. Theres more that is escaping me at the moment. 

Now all of that isnt at all ruling out the Niners just saying no to everyone who is interested in him for less than a second rounder. With what we know from Mike Silver teams GMs around the league just dont value the guy as high as the niners presumably do. 

So if the Niners are actively trying to recoup some of the value theyve given up for him they'd have to just play along.

25532,158473,158473,WetAppleFruit,"Thats an entirely different scenario all together though, we're talking about his value in the eyes of the league it doesnt matter what the 49ers value him as. if they simply dont want to give him up then thats another scenario.

They were one of the most successful tackling defenses in the league by tackle percentage but it took forever for contact to happen because recievers were wide open when they caught it.

And if we cant afford both we should at least get draft capital in the follow-up. Pat p clearly has another year in him at least, although no one can guess past that. I wouldnt be surprised if he signed a 2 or 3 year deal and just stopped covering wr1's once he does take that step back. Harrison smith has slowed down but isnt playing bad and might step right back into form with a dc that gives him any chance at all to do what hes good at. Linebacker room is tough and the cb room is tough but both have young talent thats developing.   Safety depends a bit on lewis cine being able to recover from his injury but is at least solid.

Obviously theres a huge possibility for him to improve and develop on the offseason and preseason now. But until that happens he shouldnt be looked at as a starting option. Hes never played at starter quality and rg free agents will be available.      
      
We have one 1st and no 2nd. So if we want to draft a center prospect early than it has to be our biggest move in the draft. I think thats a tough pill to swallow this year and bad process for center in general. Kirk prefers centers helping a alot with protections and a veteran makes a big difference there. Rookie lineman take more time to develop than a lot of positions and its common for them to start being good right as contracts expire. Centers are also the lowest paid lineman. The upside of signing a free agent center who should still be a snaller cap hit among the team but already know whay hes doing and have nfl size and traits to scheme around seem like an easy pick over the risk reward of drafting a center if bradbury leaves. I wouldnt mind drafting a backup developmental center since they can be found later in the draft though at 3rd rd+. Having someone to learn behind helps lineman a lot too.      
      
Super happy with darrisaw cleveland and o'neill and I would love to see how they play with more proven players between them. I think our tackle depth is in a pretty good spot right now too.

We don't have a great defense, so getting a qb like Keenum isn't going to work for us anymore. We can't just go back to a bridge qb and it equal success.

Anything Daniel Jones did has to be placed in the context of our terrible defense. None of his passes went deeper than 20 yards. Not saying he didn't play well, but our defense made it very easy for him.

  
As for Kirk, the only reasons we won 13 games this year were 1) Jefferson is amazing. 2) Kirk balled out with 8 huge comebacks.

* The data shows that more-running QBs are not injured more often than less-running QBs.
* Even if it were true that mobile QBs are injured at a higher rate, you'd still have to analyze the data. Wouldn't you assume that a QB running means someone else is not running or receiving, and therefore that person (RB/WR/TE) is less likely to be injured? So you'd expect this to even out.

You can read more about why mobile quarterbacks are not injured more often here:

Run frequency is not an adequate predictor. A quarterback who stands in the pocket and is sacked could easily have a serious injury, while a mobile quarterback could escape that pressure and contact.

35979,233954,233954,mrmpls,"Are your numbers correct?

Also, using the individual's cap hit in the year they win the Super Bowl but ignoring prorated bonuses, dead cap, etc is an incomplete evaluation of the total cost of that QB's true cost.

Tom Brady had a 2020 cap hit of $25MM, not $28MM, and $25MM for 2021. But he restructured and spread out this amount after the Super Bowl win, so his cap hits were only around $10.5MM and $11.9MM in 2021 and 2022. This leaves dead cap of $35.1MM next year which he isn't even under contract.

Using your ""cap hit"" analysis, if Tom Brady had won a Super Bowl in 2021, you would say he was inexpensive/low contract, while completely ignoring the $35.1MM dead cap in 2023. I'm not suggesting you factor in QB cost that occurs *after* a win, I am just providing an example of how selecting a single year's hit is misleading.

Also, why look at the cost of the individual QB instead of the team's spending on QB? I'm having a tough time finding what it was at the time, but it looks like the Eagles spent $14MM on Wentz and Foles combined in the 2017 season when they won SB 52 in Feb 2018.

You say QB contract numbers are ""debilitating"" but don't seem to understand why that would be: a team who is paying a high amount for a quarterback has likely failed to obtain one in the draft (and has to pay in free agency), and such a team is likely already not very successful.

Cutting him does save over 6 million this year (more than double that if we do a post June 1 cut designation, but that's a different conversation). However next year it saves over 21 million, not 14. 

You're adding dead cap numbers together. If we cut him before June 1st of this year, we eat dead cap for '23, '24 and '25 signing bonuses, and his '23, '24 restructure bonuses. That total dead cap is 13.55 million. With his cap hit for 2023 set to be just under 20 million, that would save a little over 6.4 million this year. 

But that's it. His dead cap is all gone after 2023 and his cap hit for 2024 becomes 0.

Then we can use the draft after that to maybe draft a QB like you described (as well as continuing to draft defense). That QB can sit behind Kirk for a year and then when it's time we can move on.

Ideally, that new QB will have a solid offensive line with two great tackles in Darrisaw and O'Neill. Great recievers in Jefferson and Hockenson, hopefully a better RB and a solid defense.
