The Bengals were playing for three things in that game: 

1) A potential chance at the #1 seed, however this was entirely dependent on the Chiefs losing in week 18, which was obviously unlikely. Nobody is really angry about losing out on it. 

2) Control the #2 seed going into week 18, meaning that the game yesterday would have been in Cincinnati. While moot now because the Bills played so bad (and the Bengals played so well) the cold and snow should have been a major homefield advantage for the Bills. 

3) To win the division outright. 

The Bengals lost out on all those with the scenario put in place by the NFL, while simultaneously coddling to both the Bills and Ravens. Bills get the #2 seed and a potential neutral site championship game, and the Ravens had the potential of hosting a playoff game on a coin flip, even though the Bengals won the division on a no contest.

Like you said, Collins wasn’t good at pass pro but was good at run blocking. You say Williams was “much better” in pass pro, yet he tied the league lead with 12 sacks allowed. When Joe escapes the pocket, he most often looks to escape right, working off the LE/ RT matchup and sliding out a bit backwards if the end is coming inside, or ducking up an under most typically if the end is pressuring to the outside and has left a window underneath for the QB to step up and slide to the right. He also has a traditional shotgun stance. Point being, his left side really is his “blind side” a much higher % of the time. 

In order to get a long term solution at Left Tackle, you need to draft one early and probably have him sit for a year behind Jonah. They can add another mid tier RT in FA and have him compete with Collins, when Collins is ready to come back. The loser can be the swing tackle. I just don’t see how $6 million savings from cutting Collins is worth losing the run blocking upside when Collins returns. The Bengals hate dead cap hits anyway, rightfully so.

7968,56222,56222,DireFox1,"The biggest thing about this case that doesn't make sense to me is the timeline. First off, the specific time of this alleged incident has, to my knowledge, not been publicly revealed but the date has (1/21/23, the day before the Divisional Round game at Buffalo). But to me it seems like there's one of three options for a general time. 

It may have occured early in the morning after midnight, which would be odd due to the fact he would probably be wanting to sleep well before the trip to Buffalo that day, though it's not entirely implausible. 

It may have happened before they leaved for Buffalo in the afternoon, which seems like the most likely to me but that also would have occured in broad daylight with witnesses more than likely around. 

And the final option is that it would have occured after they departed, meaning either A. It wouldn't have happened at all or B. It happened but it wasn't Joe Mixon. 

All of these possible situations have questions that haven't been answered, and the time also has yet to be answered. 

I also want to say while I know everyone wants to rush to condemn him for this because of his assault of that woman while playing for Oklahoma, he hasn't had character issues since that point (at least not within public knowledge) and apologized for the incident. So while I won't affirmatively say he didn't do this crime, I don't think using behavior from over 5 years ago that he hasn't repeated since is a good basis to build a case. 

Since this was the prosecutor who dropped the case and they've said they'll need additional investigation, I doubt this will be the last we hear of this case, and hopefully that reveals some light on the situation and justice will be delivered either way: Either his name cleared or, if he did do this, the victim gets the justice she deserves.",7.0,nfl,t3_10spbbu,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2023-02-03T17:25:23Z,bengals,0.0595567134031868

All I'll say is I don't expect any moves on the oline and while I hope we take an OL in rd 1 of the draft I think it'll be for depth and a starter in 2024. This upcoming season will be Jonahs last of his rookie deal and Collins year 2/2 coming off injury. Cappa and karras will be year 2/3 and volson will be year 2 of rookie deal so no worries there. Unless Carman proves to be a capable every down starter after next year we'll need both LT and RT so we need to begin to address that this off-season because I don't think we re sign Jonah or Collins next year and we're not gonna spend big on two FA starting tackles. Personally I'd try to re sign bates and Pratt but not overpay and get backups in the draft. We need either bates or bell for at least one more year with Dax stepping in to start next year for whichever is gone. Sad but I see why it might be best to cut Mixon or restructure somehow.

I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm Burrows biggest fan.   
I even got a LSU Chase jersey.    
I got a room full of Bengal posters and your pictures.

The question spots are the tackles. Jonah had a bad year, no 2 ways about it, and Collins can't be reasonably expected to return until week 6, likely more like 8-9.

Collins we can probably treat as a ""it'll be nice to have him, but we can't expect him"" kinda guy, but since we're kinda stuck with Jonah (since we already have his 5th year picked up), we may as well see what he's got. There's reason to believe that he can be better this year, since he proved serviceable before his 2020 injury and also by playing pretty well in 2021 before his drop-off in play this year. He's still technically sound, but he's prone to getting overpowered, as most of his bad reps were bull rushes. Maybe putting on some weight could do him some good, and we may expect somewhere between his 2022 and 2021, which you can live with.

Buddy, what sub did you think you walked into? This isn't r/nfl, we're allowed to vent about our team losing. This post was made the morning after the game

>The chiefs had a touchdown taken away.

On a holding call that was obvious

>the chiefs had an interception taken away.

On a very obvious PI that's called 100/100 times

>The bengals got a free challenge when the refs broke the rules, saw the replay on the screen and overturned the call and didn't charge you.

This is quite literally within their rights, New York can review any play they want to without a coach's challenge. Only way you didn't know this is if you didn't watch any games this year. 


>Chris Jones was held maaany times throughout the entire game and not once did you see the game stopped so that Andy Reid could cry to the refs but yet Zac Taylor did on 4 or 5 occasions

They were really bad with holding calls all day on both sides, I'm glad you agree

>but the truth is, they are not responsible for the loss and to pretend that the game was fixed is just corny.

Look, most rational fans knew this, but it wouldve been nice if that 4th quarter didn't have more than it's fair share of bad calls/no calls.

Yeah, the OL played bad and made the job hard. The Chiefs did what they couldn't do in last years AFCCG and took advantage of a bad OL. Defense had a good pick from that pressure and a lucky bounce pick later, but it was 2TDs, not 1

Refs didn't decide the game, that's naive and takes blame away from an offense that didn't have a good gameplan, especially in the first half.

11678,80752,80752,Goodburger123,I am not gonna attack you and explain it simply. The NFL seems to have a bias when it comes to teams like yours. Now that’s not to say they are gonna make sure your team wins but if it comes down to it and there is a call that could give you guys a very good shot at winning the game they are going to call it every time. Now the other team still has a shot because the eagles had complet control of that game and then you guys took it from them and that’s on them. But the call is still bad and I think you know it’s bad because you seem to be trying to convince a lot of people in this sun that it’s not a bad call,1.0,bengals,t3_110yjxp,False,0.0,None,2023-02-13T09:56:55Z,bengals,-0.120089312

12256,82555,82555,GooseontheLoose03,"Love that his “reasoning” is using data from games in the 70’s 80’s and 90’s. Most recent game that a blow out happened in a conference championship with a close point spread was 12 years ago. In 12 years the skill and general talent of the NFL has significantly increased. The Colts where the worst team in the AFC and out of 14 losses only 4 were one score games. They lost a game 62-7, in that season.  Houston the worst team in the AFC this year 3-13-1. Lost 7 games by a TD or less including a OT game against a completely healthy Chiefs. So point I’m making is we aren’t in the 2011 league where the difference in 1st and Last is undeniably great. We’re in 2023, one or two players, the right coach, and a little hard work and any team can be competitive and considered a threat. Now you take that with the fact that we played a bills team averaging 2.5 sacks per game with our back ups and they allowed 1 sack, and Joe had like 3 seconds of pocket time on average per drop back, and your going to tell me the offensive line is the issue?

12716,85325,85325,Heyitsfanman,"1. I suppose it’s not 0 if it’s a very very mild high ankle. But a true high ankle sprain is not playable bc of instability. It’s not just a pain tolerance issue. 

2. A high grade medial sprain can take quite a while too. And they are more painful in general than a lateral just bc the ligament is more robust and your weight comes down more on the medial side. But that would be playable and is something way more realistic in terms of taping it up, hitting him with toradol, and having a tough dude gut it out. 

3. Good question. I think it’s vague enough that they’re probably not lying per se. If any of the trainers or docs said based on their exam it was a “high ankle sprain” you can probably go with that. It would be pretty hard to get down in the nitty griddy of high vs medial and call them liars. Moreso I think it’s just leaving it vague so the bengals have more to think about.

I won’t go so far as to say that the NFL is rigged, or that the refs favored one team over the other. 

However, if an error made by the officials throws both teams into disarray, and then creates a fifth-down situation like it did tonight, then the higher ups at the NFL need to start addressing officiant errors more seriously, or they will continue to lose the faith of many who watch the NFL.

Regardless, congratulations to the Chiefs and the Eagles.

Over the last two years him and chase are second in 10+ yard TDs behind Allen and Diggs.

Burrow is currently the most accurate passer in NFL history. (Albeit we see how that turn out after many years)

Most 400 yard games in first three season.

Defensive players rarely get it because the Super Bowl MVP is the most idiotically decided award. I genuinely feel like they decide either before the game or in the first quarter who’s going to win the MVP for each team. 

1. Like last year, they probably said if the Bengals win it goes to Burrow and if the Rams win it goes to Stafford. They only change their plans if said player has a terrible game or if someone else has an amazing game. In the case of Super Bowl 56, Stafford threw 2 INTs and Kupp went off so they called an audible and gave it to Kupp. Probably should’ve been Aaron Donald. Donald had 2 sacks, 2 TFLs, and 3 QB hits including the game winning hit. You can probably argue they don’t win that game without Aaron Donald.

2. Same story the year before. You had a defense that held Patrick Mahomes to ZERO TOUCHDOWNS and yet they gave the MVP to Tom Brady who had a mid game. Meanwhile, Devin White had 12 god damn tackles and a pick. Devin White 1000000% got robbed here.

3. Same story again the year before. Mahomes turned the ball over twice. MVP should’ve gone to either Damien Williams who had 100 yards rushing. Tyreek Hill did have 100 yards receiving but he had 16 targets. If it must go to a receiver, Sammy Watkins had 98 yards on just 6 targets.

4. The year before that, Julian Edelman, an offensive player, got the SB MVP despite being on an offense that only scored 13, and the Patriots defense held the most potent offense in the league to 3 points. That year absolutely should’ve been a defensive MVP.

5. I will not argue against Nick Foles winning Super Bowl MVP the year before that though. He actually did ball out that game. Almost 400 yards, three touchdowns, and a touchdown reception that he called to himself. That shit is what makes you a Super Bowl MVP in my eyes. Not simply being the QB of the winning team.

I genuinely don’t think they put any thought into this award. They need to either stop considering it when deciding whether or not to make a player a Hall of Famer, or they need to start actually awarding it properly. Right now we live in a backwards ass universe where the award is clearly not taken seriously by those that award it, but it is by those at the Hall of Fame.",18.0,nfl,t3_110y09r,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2023-02-13T08:05:23Z,bengals,0.0237732077645342

19840,139801,139801,PeeeCoffee,"Yes, Chase is otherworldly, but this is a team sport. The Bengals not only got Chase with a high draft choice, but we also filled out depth and other positions with other smart draft choices.

Burrow was 1st overall in 2020, we also got:

* 2nd: Tee Higgins
* 3rd: Logan Wilson
* 4th: Akeem Davis-Gaither
* 6th: Hakeem Adeniji

Chase was 5th overall in 2021, we also got:

* 2nd: Jackson Carman
* 3rd: Joseph Ossai
* 4th: Cameron Sample
* 5th: Evan McPherson

Heck, this past draft we got:

* 1st: Dax Hill
* 2nd: Cam Taylor-Britt
* 3rd: Zach Carter
* 4th: Cordell Volson

We even got Scharping from waivers and Irwin and Chrisman as UDFAs. 

All those guys have contributed in big parts of this playoff run. Not to mention the solid depth we have from other guys drafted and players before the last 3 drafts.

Looking back through their last 3 draft classes, I found maybe 4 or 5 names I even recognize (one being Hamlin) through Gameday Final highlights and whatnot. Obviously, I do not know their team very well, but it seems like they are more so built on expensive free agents and trading away draft picks than developing within.   


This past season they signed Von Miller to a big deal. Sucks that he got hurt, but that also hampers your team's options and depth. They also traded up to get Allen, so lost some draft picks there. Then they also traded draft picks to get Diggs (one of them turned out to be Justin Jefferson btw).   


So it's hard to say, ""Yeah, he's right"", when he also is leveraging the future and depth of their team to try to get immediate success. When that doesn't pan out, you end up with middle-of-the-road draft picks. Which can still work out, but you have to be smart with the draft picks too. He has no one to blame, but himself.

""Bengals will have Super Bowl hangover. They will regress this year."" - Vegas had Denver and even Cleveland at better odds than us to win SB at the start of the season. Most national analysts viewed our SB run as a fluke and didn't even expect us to make it back to the playoffs.  


Start of the season:

""0-2 teams rarely make it back to the playoffs""  


Middle of the season:  
""This team is lucky, they play only one good half of games and eek out wins. No way they can replicate that in January""  


End of the season:  
Whole MNF debacle - crowned AFCN champs before week 18 (having to play first-place schedule next year and a lower draft pick), but not guaranteed the benefit of home-field advantage in the WC round. So have to play starters in the final week to ensure that and lose our best OL in the process. NFL sets up contingencies for BUF vs KC AFCC because Buffalo could have won the MNF and retained 1 seed. But nothing was put in place in case the Bengals won the MNF game where we would have been the 2 seed and could have hosted the Divisional round.  


Playoffs:  
Lose another OL. Vegas has us as 6-point underdogs on the road. ""No way can Burrow do anything when he has no time to throw."" ""Buffalo has the 6th ranked defense and will smother the Bengals offense."" There is even a graphic where all the analysts at the desk took Buffalo to win and only Boomer (former Bengal) took us.   


Say what you will, but we've been doubted pretty much all season. The MNF debacle is what really sent the team and the fanbase into an us vs the world mentality.

Marvin returned the Bengals to respectability. There was certainly that stigma about not winning in the post season but people tend to forget the previous 12 years where we went 55-137 (1991-2002) with zero post season appearances and zero division titles

Under Marvin we went  132-122-3

However, the Rams did not earn the win and neither did the Chiefs. If fans would just remember that and make it a thing to refuse to respect fake champions, the league will be less likely to let it happen. Unfortunately, people are easily led into narratives and the narrative that Mahomes is the goat after getting carried by his team and the refs is the new story designed to make people forget and pretend he earned something.

21528,154556,154556,Razzberry42069,"I feel like the rational view is always lost in these situations. The past two Superbowls were undeniably influenced by one-sided reffing that served the bottom line of the NFL. However, this is not a scripted sport and biased refs are not impossible to overcome because they have to be selective in what they do and have to avoid pushing it too far. At most, biased refs are gonna swing a game by one score. This is not an impossible hurdle. They've certainly gotten a lot better at picking the right time to get involved, but that's kind of the issue here. You can't let a game get to the point where it CAN be influenced by bullshittery. If it's not bad reffing it's injuries, fluke luck, weird weather, anything. Anything can happen at any moment. Play to prevent those situations from occurring.

The Bengals and the Eagles do not deserve to be retroactively crowned champions, they didn't earn a win. However, neither did the Rams or the Chiefs. They didn't deserve to win either and only got it because the refs were in their pocket. Bandwagon casual fans will make that win their identity and flaunt it without shame, but no fanbase wants a gifted championship because it comes with no respect and only makes you the villain. It's worse than a loss. As a Bengals fan, I'm actually worried that the NFL is now gonna try to create a narrative about Cincinnati vs Kansas City and the illusion of a rivalry and start giving us that type of protection next season. If I see us start winning close games because of controversial calls next season, I'm not watching anymore. 

I'm worried that there's too much conversation about this team now and the NFL is gonna wanna seize that opportunity. I'd much rather go back to the classic days of the Bungles than be paper champion. All we need to do is maintain a healthy o-line and even bad reffing won't be enough to keep us from winning it all.

Of course, the Cowboys fanbase in the 90s was doing more trash talking and ridiculing than anyone, but they've been one of the most mocked teams in the NFL since.

Ravens fans have just always been bitter assholes compensating for being the original Cleveland Browns. I also have a grudging respect for their level of success in the past and all time. Being tied for the most Superbowl wins and a coach that refuses to have a season below .500? I gotta respect it. 

I've also felt like the AFC North has been disrespected as a whole the past few years. The Bengals were the dominant team, so the narrative became that the rest of the division sucked, meanwhile, without injuries, all three teams would've been playoff teams with great records, and arguably, Cleveland isn't far behind. This is the toughest division in the NFL and I'm sick of people forgetting that. So many of these top dog teams would sink into obscurity in this division. You think Mahomes would survive the onslaught of those three defenses every season? Fuck no. I respect this division because it represents just how good the Bengals truly are to be the undisputed kings of the North, and fuck anyone that tries to dismiss that. 

Morally, gotta hate the Browns the most, fuck Deshaun Watson. Besides that, the fanbase and team with the least class that I despise more than any is Baltimore. Scumbags, all of them.

I think part of it comes from Brady and younger football fans not understanding why him winning 7 Superbowls is impressive. He's not the goat just because he won 7 Superbowls, he's the goat because he was always the driving force behind said Superbowl wins. Mahomes is a system QB, and as perverted as that term has become over the years, it's true. So was Brady, but he transcended that over time. Mahomes hasn't, and neither had Brady at this point in his career. Mahomes has had a great start, but he has the advantage of having an elite coaching staff, system, and team around him. People intentionally underplay the Chiefs offense to give extra credit to Mahomes and I don't get it. 

What his offensive line and receivers have done is incredible this season, and Travis Kelce has been transcendent. Part of Kelce's success has been due to the absence of Tyreek Hill, but he has also been consistently incredible all season. He has been top 5 in YAC most of the season and he has been making catches and plays very, very few people could pull off. If he hadn't been superhuman this season, Mahomes would've had the worst season of his career. There were so many terrible throws turned into positives by Kelce, and if anyone deserves to be MVP, it's Travis Kelce, but unfortunately, no one cares unless you're a QB.

When it comes to accuracy, reading defenses, and coming in clutch when it matters, Burrow is clearly better. He had a lot of interceptions himself, but the vast majority were the result of balls being batted at the line because the line has been terrible at keeping defenders out of the pocket.

However, the after effects of that tampering (NFL forcing Cincy to play the Ravens twice while they were free to headhunt without repercussion) combined with the NFL intentionally picking the same dude that cost Cincy the Superbowl to ref this game when there were so many other options, and had him make the Superbowl look fairly called just takes me out. 

No matter how good this team is, what are they supposed to do when the NFL itself is willing to directly fuck the team? The Chiefs will continue to get gifts and our division is one of the worst in the NFL for injuring opposing players. I mean, maybe after seeing how much support Cincinnati continues to receive and the crushing defeat of Buffalo will inspire the league to push for the Burrow vs Mahomes narrative and Cincy will replace the Bills, but I don't want to be a fan of a team that gets carried by the refs. I also kinda doubt it after Katie, Zak, Burrow, Mixon, and Apple so vocally trashed Gooddell and the NFL for their bullshit. I have a feeling the real punishment starts next season.

We also failed to achieve the same success as last year, so our season was ultimately a regression. It's fucking hard to feel as hopeful as I did last season. Of course, my health suggests I won't be around for another season, so it is what it is. Hopefully this isn't the end and we get our revenge next season, but I don't see much room for improvement at this point.",27.0,bengals,t3_10ounjd,False,0.0,None,2023-01-30T00:39:27Z,bengals,0.031438673866302

21633,154676,154676,Razzberry42069,"The NFL isn't scripted, but there is absolutely tampering. You couldn't possibly pay enough to silence an entire league of players, but you can pay refs to maintain various interests. Many retired refs have talked about biases and so on. It's not as simple as ""I hate this team, I love this team"", there are a ton of interests at play here. Draftkings and sports gambling are the newest interests, but viewership, narratives, and profits are far too important to just totally leave up to chance. You can't completely control the outcome, but you can attempt to influence it. 

I mean, one of the biggest reasons that officiating in general is pretty incompetent is because outrage gets you publicity. People complaining about refs or controversies go very viral, and get people talking about the NFL. Creating dynasties is also a major part of that, and they go together. Every sport is hopping on this concept, even the WWE has seen the value of a powerhouse that can't be beaten by anyone. The Tom Brady Patriots were incredible for bringing in new viewers looking to hop onto an easy bandwagon. If you're new to a sport and have no connection to any team, it's easy to root for the team with a lot of success, you're less likely to get your heart broken. 

With Draftkings and betting becoming such a massive thing, the new big focus is either matching or beating the spread. Definitely far harder to pull that one off, but it is pretty important nowadays. 

I do agree that teams still have to play good enough to overcome these odds. The NFL has never been fair for a billion reasons, but you still have to overcome it. Good teams beat adversity. However, it still really sucks when your team has never fit that narrative and keeps getting fucked by refs in the most important moments, and when there's a stupid narrative trying to make the bailed out team look like the underdog heroes, it's really fucking frustrating. 

At least when the Patriots had some shady shit going on, they were still monsters that just beat down a lot of good teams fairly, too. They earned most of their success, but a season like the Chiefs have had, that isn't remotely earned.

The middle of that game was getting dangerous, because we couldn't stop them from running and they were controlling the clock. They closed the gap and even took a lead, but Reid abandoned what was working and just started passing because he got anxious and nervous. He does it every time. It's all about outlasting Andy Reid and forcing him to fall into his usual habits. That's why I fear an injured Mahomes.

That's the key thing people keep ignoring to pretend the Bengals don't have a reason to be mad. The Bengals were AFC North champs with a win or a tie that game, they clinched with both of those. Instead, Cincinnati had to beat Baltimore or they'd face a coin flip for home field advantage because Baltimore would have the tie breaker, but no chance to get a tie because the Bengals played less games. Meanwhile, the Bengals had a tie breaker with the Chiefs and would be the AFC Champions by winning in Buffalo and KC losing to the Raiders, but the tie was no longer possible because the Bengals played less games.

21792,154849,154849,Razzberry42069,"I can't tell if this is just an attempt to be facetious or not, but I'll take the high road and explain it for the billionth time: 

The Bengals were about to go up 14-3 and that game was playing out identically to the final product. Tragedy strikes, teams agree to postpone. The NFL then declared that an AFC Championship game between the Bills and Chiefs should be played at a neutral site because neither team got what they needed to win the 1 seed. Bills needed to win out, Chiefs needed to win out and have the Bills lose a game, Bengals had to win out and have the Chiefs win the game. 

The result of the first matchup was going to decide whether or not Cincy or Buffalo would rank higher. The NFL only gave consideration to the Chiefs and Bills. Considering that game would've decided who got home field advantage in the playoffs, and they made considerations for the Chiefs/Bills, the right thing to do would be to do the same for Bills vs Bengals. If anything, it made more sense for Bills vs Bengals to be on a neutral site than the Chiefs. The NFL essentially decided it wouldn't be worth the effort and cost to have two neutral site games. 

The Bengals went from having a shot at the 1 seed to being locked into the 3 seed. The real kicker here is that the NFL also threw in an extra stipulation that since a Cincinnati loss would've given the Ravens a shot to win the division by beating the Bengals week 18, the Bengals would have to flip a coin in the case of a Ravens win. At first glance, this doesn't seem that crazy. However, the difference between the Bengals and Ravens was identical to the difference between the Chiefs and Bengals. The Bengals needed to win and the Chiefs to lose a game. Ravens needed the Bengals to lose twice and win the final game. There was no coin flip on the table for the Bengals vs Chiefs.

So we already see how bizarrely one-sided it is. Essentially, the NFL gave the Bills a tie by the way they settled things. However, if the Bengals and Bills tied, the Bengals would've still clinched the division. Instead, the Bengals were handed a loss, because they had to win that last game or possibly be handed an even worse fate than losing the AFC North: the NFL declared them winners, but they could've been the champs and have to play on the road. That would be the same as becoming the wildcard team, yet having a first place schedule and so on. 

Every aspect of the ruling was a jab at the Bengals. They've been ignored downplayed, and insulted all season as the reigning AFC Champs. They had the NFL try to screw them for choosing human life over rating. They have every right to be pissed. On top of all of this, when the Bengals should've been free to sit the starters week 18 after the Chiefs beat the Raiders, they had to play their starters while the Ravens got to sit their offense. Ravens did not sit their defense, and they were completely ignored by the refs as they blatantly headhunted Bengals players. They took Tyler Boyd out for a short time, injured Tee Higgins who was limited in both games. They ended the season of two offensive linemen. All of this in a game they shouldn't have had to play.

The problem our fanbase has is that the Bills were the favorites all throughout the off-season and the Bengals weren't even favorites to win our division. The constant narrative was that the two wins against the Chiefs were flukes and the entire season was just luck and that the Bengals were frauds because they lost the Superbowl by 3 after really bad officiating calls inside the 2 minute warning, and we're STILL one second, or a better line, away from winning through all the BS. We never stood a chance against the Rams, they dominated us. 

Once the season began, I don't have any issue with people questioning this team the first 8 games of the season. However, when they started a win streak missing so many players that everyone said Burrow used as a crutch, perception should have started to change. This team got back on track and they were the reigning AFC Champs. Meanwhile, they were constantly considered underdogs. Even after proving that the wins against the Chiefs weren't flukes. I will say that even though a lot of Chiefs fans have been very toxic towards Cincy, they at least respected us. Guys like Nick Wright refused to pick against this team. However, everyone else slept on the Bengals. 

That's all there is to it. It's not that big of a deal in the end, Cincy just used it as fuel and let their games do the talking. This team was absolutely disrespected two years in a row, and now after 30+ years without a playoff win, Joe Burrow has given the Bengals 5 in his first two full years.

By under, it means the spread. The Bills are -6.0 favorites, therefore they're the under. These refs are nearly perfect in the playoffs for the team favored by Vegas. Of course, this isn't definitive proof, it's merely circumstantial evidence, but it's definitely pretty fucking sus considering how the NFL has treated Cincinnati the past two seasons and the way they've been pushing for a KC vs Buffalo AFC Championship well before the season started. 

The NFL isn't rigged or scripted, but referees do have interests and biases, not all of which are conscious, but it has always been the case and the NFL's chosen favorites always have an advantage with the refs. Every team knows and accepts this because sports are not perfect. Every team plays with the mindset that they might be playing against the other team AND the refs. They have to play good enough to make it irrelevant.

Oh, and if the Bengals do manage to win the Superbowl this season, I believe there is a very strong chance that the NFL starts doing the same for us.

1. Interesting how in a span of 24 hours we went from a lot of Reddit love to a lot of Reddit hate. I sincerely try to avoid other fanbase a subreddits but it seems the ravens chiefs and bills collectively have labeled us as whiny, new winners what have you oh and can’t forget cocky. My take is pretty simple. Clearly Eli didn’t learn that trolling on Twitter means nothing if you can’t back it up with solid play(SB last year). Hopefully he’s putting I. The work this week. If Hardman is back we still have to grapple with a fantastic pocket passer who has a lot of weapons, and fast weapons at his disposal. 

2. Hope flowers starts practicing again, he seemed to do great against kelce

3. Hope we do exactly what we did scheming the OL with our RBs to get them room to run. Joe didn’t look like he once needed to find the go route to ensure Tee or Jamar would outman their respective CB and my hope is a great offensive scheme can continue to prioritize chess here over one to one contested matchups

4. I hope McPherson is on his A game. This very well could come down to a last second field goal just like last year

I would suggest if you wanna make similar post in the future, you would have to preface that you are just blowing off steam and maybe spitballing your ideas. Not coming off as an authoritarian.

I get where the the hate is coming from although I personally don't see how one tweet was a dig at DeMar Hamlin (especially since [he made a follow up](https://twitter.com/EliApple/status/1617944718444490753?t=ajl-5ZNOUwiBawxu-PZFtg&s=19) to clarify that it was not), but I do see how it could be seen that way. Obviously the loss in Buffalo didn't help smooth things over either. 

I have no doubt that Coach Taylor wrung him out out after those tweets, which is probably why he's so quiet now.

But after all the shit both our teams and cities have been through, I'm asking, don't let a known shit talker convince you that his opinions represent those of the city, organization, players and fans.

In a separate incident involving another female producer, one who’d been out to dinner with Mike Tirico and his fiancee (and future wife), Tirico sent her an e-mail telling her that he wanted to sleep with her. The two were later part of a group of staff members that went to a bar following ESPN’s coverage of the NCAA Tournament, at which point Tirico approached the woman and said, “I wish I was single. If I were, I’d throw you on the table right here and f— your brains out.”


The woman tried to dismiss him as just being drunk but things got even worse. As she was driving home, a car came speeding up next to hers on the interstate and it was Mike Tirico, who was waving his hand out the window as if to tell her to pull over.

If that's the thought process, the time to trade Higgins to maximize value is 100% this offseason. We literally just saw this exact scenario play out a year ago with AJ Brown.

AJ Brown got picks 18 and 101 and he was in a similar situation to Higgins (going into the final year of his rookie deal). Production is similar between Brown (69.7 yards per game, 4.3 receptions per game, 25 total TDs) and Higgins (65.8 yards per game, 4.7 receptions per game, 19 total TDs) during their first 3 seasons with the caveat being Higgins played as a #2 and Brown as a #1

I think if we got a mid first and a late 2nd/early 3rd, AND the FO knew it wasn't paying Higgins after year 4, it could be worth it. Or a combo of picks and an established OL player. I said it on here the other day. Burrow with a great OL throwing to Chase/Boyd/rookie could very well be a better offense than Burrow with a bad OL throwing to Chase/Boyd/Higgins. 

That said, I'm sure the FO is going to see if they can retain all 3 of those guys and there's a real chance that they keep Higgins for 2023 even if they can't pay them all just to give the band another run at the Super Bowl. In that scenario, we would likely get a 3rd round comp pick after walking so it wouldn't be a complete waste.

Two, he will be extremely limited with mobility. So much of the Mahomes magic is how he runs around crazy and makes wild throws. If the Bengals pass rush holds contain, he will be a statue. Even if they don't, he may not be able to escape very well.

We only have Wilcox under contract right now and baring the same thing happening again, they very likely will draft one this year. IMO Washington or Mayer would be a tremendous help blocking (I loved Hurst, but he wasn't much of a blocker) and would be an awesome addition. I'm always about giving Burrow as many weapons as possible.

Outside of that (I'd obviously be ok picking TE later, depending on how the draft falls)  We need at minimum T depth, agree with you, and if a really T or G falls to us, grab them. And take the other position you don't get at oline in the first, and get more talent in the draft. Just add talent.

42386,323218,323218,moochee22,"Let's talk about the players, then the coach. 

LT-Jonah Williams, drafted in the first round by the Bengals, seems to have regressed. I'm not exactly sure why he regressed. He's never been that good of a LT to begin with. A lot of scouts were saying that he doesn't have the size to be a lock down tackle. He's more of a guard.

C & LG- Karras and Cappa are the only solid starters that the Bengals have. They were drafted and developed by other offensive line coaches/teams.

RT-Lael Collins seemed to be injured the entire season. Collins was probably the weakest link on the line for passing downs. He was much better at run blocking. No one is sure if Collins played as bad as he did because he was injured, coaching, will, or some other reason.

LG-Volson a 4th rounder (drafted by the Bengals who are notoriously bad at drafting linemen). Volson played about as good as you would expect from a 4th round rookie on a revamped oline.

The backup linemen, shouldn't be on any other NFL roster, maybe some desperate team like the Texans, Bears or Falcons. Actually the Texans cut Max Scharping, and the Bengals claimed him. The only backup that may appear to have some upside is Jackson Carmen, he didn't play much worse than Jonah Williams at LT.

That brings us to the offensive line coach Frank Pollack. Pollack has coached offensive line for the Texans (as an assistant offensive line coach), Cowboys, Raiders, Jets and Bengals. The only one of those teams that had a noteworthy offensive line was the Cowboys. Those Cowboys teams had all-pros, and pro-bowlers on the line. It's hard to say how much of that was based off the coaching or the talent of the linemen. Those Cowboys lines the best of the best in the NFL while he was the coach. Another thing to note, is that Pollack is better at coaching run blocking than pass-blocking, based the teams he's coached being known for having 1000+ yard rushers. We can further assume this based on the Bengals linemen being better at run blocking than pass-blocking (if you go by PFF grades).

So should we criticize Pollack? If they draft linemen this year, and they turn out to be subpar over the next 2-3 years, yes. Pollack hasn't been that involved in drafting the guys we have, (aside from Volson), so this year he will get another chance to get a guy he likes. Hopefully there is a lineman higher than a 4th rounder that they can get. If we see no further development from Volson, Carmen, backups, and draftees, yes.

The QB position is THE premium position in sports. You get the glory but you also get the hate. If you don’t win the big one, it’s because you failed. That’s the perception and how these guys are viewed, treated, and talked about. That’s also why they get the fat ass contracts.

Apple and Perine are definitely about the money. Apple would be CB3 behind Awuzie and CTB with Hilton as the slot. So if we can sign him at the price of coming off the bench, not bad depth to have. Perine also depends on cost.

For all the bullshit these other fan bases talk, they’re much softer than we could ever be. Ravens fans have been running to other teams subs all week crying about us. Rent free. Those losers are kissing so much Steelers and Chiefs ass because they can’t deal with the fact that they aren’t running the AFCN like they thought they would with Lamar.

Steelers fans are just pathetic. Who the hell cares about Browns fans. Chiefs fans and their typical arrogance is showing. However, at the least the Chiefs have recent success to brag about.

Both get tackled by the turf more than any TEs I’ve ever seen. 

We can improve on Chrisman and it’s not an expensive position. We need to improve on Jonah but that is an expensive position. Most likely have to replace Pratt and Bates. Hopefully Hill played well but drafting S and CB will be for sure. Apple and Flowers are both free agents. I’d like Flowers back. Apple depends on cost. 

We need more OLine help but Jonah is the only one to replace really. We’re tied up from C to RT. I think those 3 spots will be better next year. I like Volson and he did well for a rookie. So LT is the big question and an expensive question. 

Awuzie will be back next year and he and CTB are the starters and Hilton in the slot. So Apple could be expendable but at the same time depth at CB is huge. Already mentioned can’t lose both safeties. 

So I expect we draft OLine, CB, S, and LB. We should stick to BPA but hopefully some of those positions will be BPA when we pick. It’s cheap but we will have to decide between Adomitis and Harris. I love Harris but a younger long snapper isn’t a bad thing.

I’ve been a fan long enough to have watched every Super Bowl loss and to have suffered through the 90s. It’s been a long road and Mike Brown really hurt the franchise for a long time. We’re doing something that older fans have never seen before. Back-to-back division titles, back-to-back years with playoff wins, and back-to-back AFCCG appearances. This is something Steelers and Ravens fans have enjoyed and have came to expect. 

It’s a different atmosphere among fans now. I’ve ran into horrible Steelers fan (in real life, before social media). When I was growing up, a lot of people in the area rooted for the Browns or Steelers because they were better. We’re attracting young fans and bandwagon fans. It’s not something I ever expected.

We’re in a place that the franchise has never been. Unfortunately some people don’t know how to handle it. When we had a brief taste of success before with Marvin Lewis, we lost 5 consecutive wild card games lol.

I worded it poorly, but the gist was don’t complain about being screwed by the league, just support the team and move forward. I had mentioned how well we handled the Hamlin situation and I worded poorly where people thought I was saying handling it different was a shot against Hamlin. Totally not want I meant.

Anyway, my point being I fell for the trap. There was no other way for this to go. The league quickly made playoff changes for the Bills again. Having to play and beat Buffalo had us set up to be the bad guys no matter what. Everything the coaches, players, fans say is scrutinized and put under a microscope so it can be twisted against Buffalo, against Hamlin, against Kansas City, and whoever else. The coaches and players have a chip against the league. No one else.

Bills game cancelled. League makes knee jerk reaction and changes rules in season. Everyone agrees Bengals were screwed except Ravens fans. They get mad we got the North. Saltiness ensues. 

We play the Ravens. They cry before game about injuries beforehand. Makes jokes we should win. We do win. It’s close because they have a solid defense. They brag about said defense but also cry they would have won but injuries. Rest of everyone still behind us because we won the North outright with that win. Feel bad we had to play our starters to get the home playoff game we should have had anyway. 

Wild Card. We beat the Ravens. Said defense played great again. Our defense forces a fumble and scores to take the lead. Ravens fan act like that was the end of the game. Reality was there was still 11 minutes left and they didn’t do anything. Typical Ravens cry injuries, Lamar, they should’ve won, they wouldn’t made AFCCG, they hated on Huntley but now he’s outplayed Burrow. The list goes on. 

Bills are big favorites in Buffalo. Bills fans still on our side wishing good game and so on. Then the game happens. It’s never in doubt. They get dog walked. Bills fans turn during the game. They begin complaining quickly. Ravens fans join in. Burrow’s quote gets the gold medal because of the mental gymnastics it caused idiots to use to make it a shot at the Bills instead of the league. Apple is Apple. Many tears shed. Ravens and Bills fans lead the charge of butthurt bitches. Multiple threads daily in each sub. 

Mahomes is injured so people think we may win. Get butthurt. Bills and Ravens fans have successfully turned a ton of people with their whining. These fans raked Allen and his “hero ball” but are calling for Mahomes to play “hero ball” and beat us like we dog walked the Bills. The Bengals lean into it. The swag that everyone loved about them is now “cringe” because they don’t want us to win.

Every year, the writers/talking heads crown the Browns the “on paper” best team in the north. Which is funny considering the Browns have never won the North. They spend some big money, bring in a big name or four, and every draft is always an A or B. However, they still can’t win the division and have made the playoffs once or twice (I don’t remember how many times since the North was formed because it happens so rarely). There are more no hitters in baseball in a season than Browns playoff appearances since the AFCN was formed. 

The Steelers. Fuck. The. Steelers. I respect Tomlin because no matter the odds he never has a losing season. That fan base is spoiled going from Cowher to Tomlin. I’m not saying they don’t deserve some of what they get. That fan base expects to be in the playoff hunt every year and they are almost every damn year. It’s sickening. That’s a fan base that deserves some years of humble pie. There’s are 2 truths about the Steelers that will never die; 1. Go Steelers! is the most common phrase shouted after incestuous sexual relations. 2. The only thing a Bengals and Steelers fan can enjoy together is a Steelers fan’s sister.

43018,325801,325801,muskiesfan1,"Here’s the real story. A team that has suffered unlike most. Has who was/is considered the worst owner in professional sports. An owner that used to charge players to rent televisions during training camp, that provided towels that were too small for the players, and was criticized for still driving his Chevy Lumina. A team that was constantly an easy win and the butt of a lot of jokes. Then they got somewhat relevant with Marvin Lewis and actually contended until the first round of the playoffs. 

Then Mike Brown finally starts releasing the reins. Zac Taylor gets hired and starts getting rid of players who don’t get on board. Get the number one pick and drafts Joe Burrow. Starts building a culture and bringing in his guys. Now the team is achieving success they’ve never had. Back-to-back division champs, back-to-back years with playoff wins, back-to-back AFC Championship games. Look, I get that our reputation sucks because people hate our owner. I understand that people loved to hate us and pick on us when we sucked and now love to hate on us and make excuses when we win. Of all teams, the Bengals suddenly have bandwagon fans. Who would’ve thought?

This was an ignorant question to ask Zac and he answered sarcastically. I get that people love to hate us, but the players use that as fuel. I can’t blame them. Over 30 years of being the punchline and they are finally successful and respectable. Who knows how long this will last.

Below is the official nfl rule book for the process of completing a catch. 

https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/nfl-video-rulebook/completing-a-catch/

Chase clearly satisfied parts a and b. So the ruling comes down to part c. Did he make a football move or get a third foot down before Matt Milano forced a lose of possession? If not, then notes section 2 comes into play which states that if you regain possession out of bounds that it makes it an incomplete pass. 

The refs clearly decided the answer was yes, and you can see the ball move a bit before he gets his third foot down. 

However the controversial part to me is that in the notes section movement of the ball does not automatically count as lack of control. Additionally you can satisfy part c by trying to ward off a defender which I’d argue he did. 

All in all,  I can understand why it wasn’t ruled a catch even if I think it should have stood since it was the ruling on the field. Glad it didn’t matter in the end though. Who dey baby!",1.0,bengals,t3_10j6sf4,False,0.0,None,2023-01-23T01:34:40Z,bengals,0.0039541717194344

And if by some divine intervention they did, you then think they’re going to beat a 15-1 Panthers team with MVP Cam Newton? The fan base was just starving for a playoff win at that point. Anything after that was just gravy. But there was no chance of it happening.


This team was obviously a legitimate contender that I believe the majority of (at least before the Eagles game yesterday) media and sharp gamblers were picking to win the whole thing. Ossai’s play took that away immediately, as well as being able to say we’re 4-0 against Mahomes with Burrow, back to back Super Bowls. Those are historic achievements and just asserts our dominance over KC even further. Not to mention some of these guys are going to be gone soon due to contacts coming up, so this definitely was one of their best chances to win it all, and it was taken away in a second. 


I will admit I had forgotten that the Burfict play immediately put the Steelers in FG range. I was thinking it happened earlier in the game for some reason. I still don’t think the two plays are even remotely close to being comparable given the circumstance and the fact this team was an actual contender. Being tied in an AFC Title game against Patrick Mahomes with 8 seconds left and then basically handing them the win with a stupid play is 1000x worse than blowing a lead in the Wild Card round on a stupid play. And if you really want to get in the weeds, you can at least try and defend Burfict by saying Brown was in the middle of the field, he tried to hit him in the shoulder etc (I’m not doing that, just some of the excuses I’ve heard). Ossai’s play was just flat out inexcusable, even if it was much less violent and Mahomes might have sold it a bit. Mahomes was running out of bounds, everyone in the stadium, on the field, watching it on TV knew it. I have no clue what was running through his head in that moment, but everyone knows that’s something that is going to get a flag, and there’s no excuses you can really make to try and justify it. The more you talk and think about it, the bigger the difference in each plays importance and complete stupidity and lack of self awareness becomes. 


To sum it up- one blew a Wild Card game for a team with 0 shot of making let alone winning a Super Bowl. One blew an AFC Title Game for a true contender and sent our biggest rival to the Super Bowl, validating all the annoying Chief fans shit they spewed for a week, while making our own team and city look like jackasses, and possibly adding to Mahomes legacy.

You had all of that, every advantage imaginable, and it still took the bonehead play by Assai, questionable play calling, and a below average Burrow game to get you in FG range for you to win on a walkoff FG.

Change just the officiating aspect and let’s say it’s called like a normal game. The Bengals win that game. So no, I’m not saying the Bengals were the worse team. You were incredibly fortunate in every aspect of the game, all the way down to a ball bouncing off of Chases head and right into the safety’s hands.

48176,363188,363188,type6_birdbrain,"Hi Eagles, fan, this is honestly a fun question and letting us express our opinions either way is kinda cool.

Overall I like parity and want all teams to get a ring.  I love that the Chiefs and Bengals are good these days, as we were bad (both teams honestly) for so long. 

Rooted for you guys HUGE against Pats; you had a good story, fun QB story and the Pats have won enough for awhile.  ha.  (I live in Boston area)

So to next weekend:  I don't hate KC, lots of respect.  Mahomes is incredible, love Kelce as a Cinci college guy and honestly tons of class.  He had good things to say about our coach & the poor kid Joseph Ossai who had the roughing penalty on Mahomes to set up the field goal.  I like your team as well, tons of skill players and I tend to root for the younger QBs to do well as people crap on those guys over every INT or OT loss.  I'm rooting for the Eagles, but only in a 60/40 kinda way.  I want to see a good game, great plays, and no injuries or refs blowing calls!

As emotional as I could get--you guys win by 3 TDs validating the NFC was better this year and we would have lost to you guys too :)

48220,363239,363239,type6_birdbrain,"Hi Steelers fan!  Thanks for coming here with a good set of things to discuss.  You'll get lots of speculation because (as noted below) the team is quiet about a lot of things.  My slightly unpopular take is Joe gets a huge contract but intentionally not the hugest in order to try to keep other folks around.  O line will be an issue and not sure what to do there.  We keep Vonn Bell and most of the secondary outside of Bates.  I even think we keep Apple as he'll play for not much money and was ok this year.  We have a couple more rookies that will play secondary (Hill & Andersen) and I suspect we surprise people and draft a speed running back.  I really get the feeling the team wants Burrow, Chase and Higgins, and if there was any way to keep Boyd they'd do it.  As a side note (and I'll get downvoted to oblivion for this) you guys should make a pitch for Boyd because he's a hometown guy and I think he fits in the slot with your big-ass TE Freiermuth and Pickens (who I think is already a star).  

I think part of why we have nearly 50 million in cap space left right now is you see a bunch of this gone in the offseason preserving as many of our guys as we have.  The team has a SB and AFC championship game loss in the last 2 years; they don't need much more and front office knows this.
