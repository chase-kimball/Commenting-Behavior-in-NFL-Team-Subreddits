He got a TON of heat from Bucs fans for his awful play calling this year, and having watched some of their games I don't really disagree with them. Far too often they just did things that didn't really make sense and they didn't really do anything that put their best players in position to make plays. They abandoned the running game completely for large streches at a time despite re-signing Leonard Fournette and spending a 3rd round pick on a RB, and far too often their offense was just ""fuck it, Mike Evans is over there somewhere"". But with all that said, for as much flack as he got this year last year he was rated as one of the BEST play callers, so who knows where he really stands. Maybe this was just a bad year with a flawed roster and he'll be right back in the conversation after next season, but it's always tough to tell with these things, which is why if you have an opportunity to take one of those HC jobs it's always really tough for me to act like a guy should turn down that opportunity",1.0,nygiants,t3_10ld4u4,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2023-01-26T02:35:21Z,nygiants,0.1319533586248285

1)Once we cut Golladay and a couple of other guys we'll have somewhere between $60-65 million in cap space. 
2)DJ gets a deal that averages $35 million next year with a cap hit at $20 million because of signing bonus and such
3) Barkley gets a deal at $15 million a year with a cap hit at $10 million
4) We hold Hodgins rights, so I don't think we lose him. Not sure what his deal would like for next year and beyond though
5) Lower Leonard Williams $32 million cap hit (either by restructuring it or signing him to an extension). Estimated cap hit lowered to $20 million
6) Put another $10-15 million off the side for draft picks and in-season wiggle room 

After all of that, we should have approximately $25-30 million that we can spend. Given that there's no true #1 WRs available in free agency this year, I think our most likely outcome for our WR depth chart heading into next year is 

WR1: OBJ or 1st round Pick (It's one or the other for me, my guess is OBJ given his connection to Barkley and Sheppard)
WR2: Hodgins 
WR3: Wan'Dale (He was playing well his last few games before going down, so it's by setting having him at this spot)

4611,48594,48594,DoABarrowRoll,"to start, I'm going to say I think it's pretty unlikely that Devon Witherspoon, Christian Gonzalez, and Joey Porter Jr are available at 25. In that order of unlikely (Witherspoon the least likely, Porter there's maybe a chance but odds are against it I think).

The back of the 1st round corners are really interesting because the class has really started to rise more recently; [Kiper](https://archive.ph/0tj0D) and [Jeremiah's](https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jeremiah-2023-nfl-mock-draft-1-0-texans-ravens-among-four-teams-selecting) mocks the last couple of weeks have had pretty significant risers/names we haven't really talked that much about.

Between those two mocks, add in Emmanuel Forbes (Mississippi State), Deonte Banks (Maryland), and Tyrique Stevenson (Miami FL) to your watchlist as guys that you might need to spend your 1st round pick on (listed in order of my personal preference and in the order they are on [Jeremiah's top 50](https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jeremiah-s-top-50-2023-nfl-draft-prospect-rankings-1-0)).

All 3 are long press body type corners by nature. I'm a VERY big fan of Forbes; very thin but he plays the run hard anyways, and he's an elite cover guy in my opinion, who holds the FBS record for pick-sixes.

After that you get into more guys you are hoping would be day 2 picks for you. Kelee Ringo (Georgia) really fell off especially at the end of the year to the point where you are not seeing him in R1 mocks. Same with Cam Smith (South Carolina), who was a CB1 contender coming into the year who just didn't wow this year. Eli Ricks (Alabama) was another guy like that who didn't get on the field consistently enough this year for Alabama after being a really hyped transfer from LSU.

Clark Phillips is a really good player but at his size, he's probably more of a nickel defender than a boundary corner; that's something we definitely need anyways because Darnay Holmes just doesn't cut it, but it's important to note. Tre'Vius Hodges-Tomlinson (TCU) is in a similar boat but a worse player in my opinion.

There are definitely fans of DJ Turner (Michigan) out there; another smallish guy (but not as small as Phillips I believe), good athlete, needs some beefing up and wasn't super productive in college.

The Senior Bowl had a really nice cluster of day 2 type CBs; Kyu Blu Kelly (Stanford), Julius Brents (Kansas State), and Riley Moss (Iowa) all reportedly had pretty good weeks and are probably in that sort of like 60-100 type range.

There are some other guys that you might see in mocks/rankings like Jaylon Jones (Texas A&M) or Garrett Williams (Syracuse); day 2 guys who in my opinion don't really fit the man heavy style we played this year.

For me, CB is a position that I always want to spend premium capital on; I don't really like the idea of full on bargain bin shopping at that spot, so depending on how good the other talent is on the board, I'd be really happy taking Forbes at 25. I think he's a good fit with Wink's system, he's good in coverage, aggressive, and has ball skills and ball production. Not a 1:1 comp but he gives me sort of like Marcus Peters playstyle vibes, and Peters had great success with Wink in Baltimore.

As always, I highly recommend just watching them play a bit and deciding who you like the way they play. You don't have to be a film grinder or football savant to have opinions.

4612,48599,48599,DoABarrowRoll,"imo this comment does not say what you think it does

first of all, 12.5% of the 2023 cap ceiling of 225m is 28m. less than all these other guys. less than the tag will cost. 28m would be the 15th highest paid QB in the NFL this past year by AAV, and the lowest of the ""having a QB"" tier besides Brady's 1yr 25m pact. the whole point of my post is to demonstrate that it's probably not going to be that cheap.

the ""top 3-12"" do not account for 10-12.5% on AAV. Kyler and Watson are 3rd and 4th at 46m AAV, which on the 208.2m salary cap ceiling for 2022 equals 22.1% of the cap. Carson Wentz is 12th in AAV with a 32m AAV contract, which on the 208.2m salary cap for 2022 equals 15.4%. If you count it against the year it was signed (2019, when the cap was 188.2m) it was 17% of the cap ceiling.

second of all, highlighting the teams that ""overpaid just to avoid that hell"" reinforces the concerns that people have about paying Jones; the Giants putting themselves in the same bucket as those teams, plus the Wentz Eagles, Goff Rams, late Ryan Falcons, etc.

third of all, labeling the Bills, Bengals, Chargers, and Chiefs as the ideals is hilarious considering 2 of those QBs are still on rookie contracts and there was no doubt about any of them this late into their careers. then going on to mention the Packers as an ideal after they dumped a 50m AAV deal for Rodgers that was very not good this year.

If anything, all that just explains why people are worried; it's going to cost more than they think Jones is worth, overpaying for those guys has hurt a lot of teams, and the teams that are super super successful did so by drafting QBs and maximizing the roster *while they're cheap* so those guys can develop and become no doubt superstars worthy of getting paid so much.",0.0,nygiants,t3_10k7ng9,False,0.0,None,2023-01-25T16:49:12Z,nygiants,0.0693718394665447

4618,48605,48605,DoABarrowRoll,"This is absolutely a fair critique and this is really what complicates the conversation. That's also why I put the disclaimer at the beginning saying that I'm not advocating for or against this kind of deal.

To me, this was just an important exercise to see what the ""tier 2"" QB contracts look like and kind of be aware of what a market rate would be, mostly because in my opinion a lot of the general asks that people have floated have probably been too team-friendly compared to the deals that are actually getting signed. I've seen a lot of ""yeah give him a 3 year deal worth 30m and you can cut him before the last year"" type stuff and based on this I just don't think that's an offer that gets the job done.

You'd have to go back probably to Blake Bortles to find a contract that doesn't fit in something close to this bucket. Maybe Jimmy G's deal with the 9ers? I think that was more frontloaded and was cuttable early on despite a 5 year term. But in general it's hard to find a comparable that fits the bill.

My personal take here is just that the Giants might unfortunately be in QB purgatory. Like all the QBs you listed for example. The guy is too good to let go but not good enough where you're really excited about it. This is just what those guys sign for, typically.

Whether it's worth it or not, that's really where the hard conversation starts, and that to me is more of an ""agree to disagree"" thing; I'm not going to convince anyone that's it really not worth it, and no one is going to convince me that he's going to break into the top tier of QBs.

if they think his ceiling is higher and want to surround him with weapons, then they should just pay him now and bet on that. You probably get a lower cap hit in 2023 by virtue of a signing bonus and all the contract structures, and you get more money in the future because the ask is lower now.

There's always risk involved, it's not completely impossible he regresses and struggles next year, but if that's really a sizeable worry, you're not even really considering committing a longer term contract to him.

""Tag him and draft a QB next year with the stacked class"" is basically what they were going to do this year. Then the team won 9 games plus a playoff game and are picking 25th. Unless you really think that the team, including Jones being back, is going to regress pretty significantly (this year there are 7-10 teams picking from 8-13), that's probably not really an option. What happens when you win 8+ games, you pick 15th or later, and all the QBs in ""the stacked class"" are going in the top 8-10 picks? Did that really work out?

If the goal is to have a new QB anyways, don't bother tagging him. It's just a waste of a year, and probably improves your draft pick. Just let him go, maybe draft a QB in the middle of the draft for shits and giggles, and see how bad your team can be to get a QB.

I agree with the overall eval of Jones, that this is the tier of QB he belongs in, but that comes with the general statement that he's not going to be that much worse than what he was this year, nor will he be that much better. Chances are you're really not feeling that much differently next year than you did this year.",1.0,nygiants,t3_10k7ng9,False,0.0,None,2023-01-24T12:43:22Z,nygiants,0.0031269085579777
4621,48608,48608,DoABarrowRoll,"it's mostly just I get my draft discussion fixes elsewhere, on discord, on twitter, etc.

my recommendation is always just to watch the players play and see who you like, see who you think is fun to watch, see who you think might fit with what the team likes to do.

you don't have to do the ins and outs of technique and everything, I pretty much only do that for OL nowadays and watch more for vibes at other positions. Just pick players you think are fun, watch them play a few games, see if you like what you see or not. I also like to just think about NFL players I like and I think are good and pick out things I like from their games and look for that stuff.

That's kind of the super basic ""intro to scouting"" stuff I'd say. In terms of like people who have rankings to follow it's harder for me because I come up with my own and discuss with my friends on discord and stuff so I have disagreements with everyone kind of. 

I'm a big fan of Dane Brugler's work, he put out his top 15 at each position today.

I think NFL Stock Exchange (Trevor Sikkema and Connor Rogers), is probably the best draft podcast in the game right now. And obviously as we get closer to the draft, the Giants pods will do their Giants-focused draft previews, Talkin' Giants and Big Blue Banter being the main two.

I think the best site to just get names to go look at right now is [nflmockdraftdatabase.com](https://nflmockdraftdatabase.com), they have ""consensus big boards/mock drafts"" which basically are just aggregating boards from everywhere. I wouldn't take them as explicit rankings, especially because I think it's important to know why, but it's a good place to get a list of names to go watch.

Everyone kind of finds their own favorite analysts to swipe rankings from. Draft content isn't in the best place right now in my opinion, in terms of being able to find scouting reports and stuff this early, so it's definitely important to just come to your own conclusions.

I run [the official tape tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kq8FT8PEeGFxT3UeI7dnT6KepgI8LNyQ9HAkizw0_vM/edit?usp=sharing) which just has a bunch of links to cut up broadcasts of CFB games for people to watch; they're not perfect for WRs obviously because there are times they're offscreen, but it's all free and publicly available for anyone who wants to watch.

I don't think his play is likely to fluctuate by that much, which kind of means there's not that much to learn about him. By tagging him, you're kind of implicitly saying ""I hope he removes any doubt remaining"" and if we've learned anything the last 4 years with him, it's probably that that kind of thing doesn't really happen.

The odds that his play dictates a significant enough change in your stance from now to this time next year are probably pretty slim.

Everybody else got a guaranteed 3rd year.

on frontloading: I generally agree, it gets dicey with other deals that are due and how much they want to save to make other improvements; how fast do they want to accelerate it, etc. But I agree, frontloaded and being able to get out of it in case of emergency would be better in my opinion.",2.0,nygiants,t3_10k7ng9,False,0.0,None,2023-01-24T10:51:47Z,nygiants,0.147377824
4626,48613,48613,DoABarrowRoll,"the only concern with that is that there's a very real world where he does the same stuff again, right?

we all like to assume that he'll give us an easy answer, either he's great and worth paying him more, or he's bad and was a one year wonder and we cut the cord, but the reality is he'll probably end up within a confidence interval of what he was this year.

Then you run the risk of going 10-7 or so again with pretty close to this type of production, efficient but not explosive offense, etc, picking in the early to mid 20s, and still feeling like you have a guy you can't let go but you can't drop an even bigger bag on; with the tag value increasing on a second tag and the cap inflation increasing the contract ask.

like how good does he have to be for you to say ""yup I'll pay him 45m next year""? is it just doing what he did this year? is it a lot more? what is the likelihood of that happening? the tag is kind of a can kicking measure; it's not a bad one, but unless things change pretty drastically from this year, are we sure it really helps?",4.0,nygiants,t3_10k7ng9,False,0.0,None,2023-01-24T10:17:03Z,nygiants,0.1148725768089294
4627,48614,48614,DoABarrowRoll,"That's definitely part of the concern and part of the potential benefit of getting something done this year; just to lock him in at a rate for now.

Of course that also comes with some risk factors about his performance regressing and ""QB Purgatory"" and all that. It's a really hard situation to figure out.

These market values are probably pretty close to what the player is worth, and a lot of it comes down to how you project him moving forward, how good you think he can/will be, and how you feel about the position philosophically.",13.0,nygiants,t3_10k7ng9,False,0.0,None,2023-01-24T10:12:02Z,nygiants,0.2038734375
4628,48615,48615,DoABarrowRoll,"The AAV is definitely the most variable part of it, I wouldn't be stunned if the number crept up or down. I think the team in particular still wants to put him in that tier 2 bucket. I personally tend to balk once you get to 40m, though as you and others have pointed out, stranger things have happened in this league.

I will say that the 36m vs the 225m cap is 16%, whereas Goff's 33.5m AAV deal signed in 2019 was 17.8% of the cap; it's not a huge difference. Where you get into some trouble is when you have to start really comparing him to Dak and Stafford, but I think the team has good arguments as to why he should come in lower than those players regardless.

The main reason why Kyler is not in the tier 2 QBs is because the tiers are specifically based on the contracts. In general, Kyler's contract might be an outlier among Tier 1 contracts, but the contract still puts him in the bucket with guys like Allen and Mahomes, and I really do not think there's a world where Jones gets into that conversation this year; Allen's 43m is an absolute hard ceiling to me, like no team is going to go that high. Even if you want to point to Kyler, just by the production there's a very significant difference.

I agree with most of the rest of what you said personally; I'm scared to pay him that much, it's definitely not a guaranteed good idea, all that. If he balls out again next year I'd be happy to pay him more. The one thing I would highlight is that the tag might just be a can kicking measure; the most likely outcome is probably Jones playing within a confidence interval around his play this year. I don't think he's going to ascend to top QB in the league heights, I also tend to think he's not going to become complete ass again. So by tagging him, you do run some risk of ""what happens if you go 10-7 again next year, picking in the early-mid 20s with similar production/performance?"" That might feel like a worse position, because now you don't have the fallback of the tag and Jones' camp will demand more money, doing it another year, cap going up again, etc.

Just food for thought; it cuts both ways in a nasty way.",5.0,nygiants,t3_10k7ng9,False,0.0,None,2023-01-24T10:09:58Z,nygiants,-0.0479886306843384
4629,48616,48616,DoABarrowRoll,"yeah the numbers are definitely the most variable part of it. The 36m number I came up with is based primarily on keeping it somewhere between the Wentz/Goff tier and the Dak/Stafford tier. Where exactly it falls could definitely vary in that range and I won't split hairs on that. I definitely think that the 43m for Josh Allen is still a hard ceiling, and while I personally doubt the team will breach the 40m line, it's not outside the realm of possibility.

I think the structure is by far the most important part of the analysis; closing the gap on the dollars is a lot easier than closing the gap on the structure. And considering that almost every deal on the list has 3 guaranteed years, and 5/8 have the same 4 year term + rolling guarantee structure, I think we have a good starting point to expect, with a little variance in the actual numbers.

I have heard rumors that Saquon would sit out if tagged anyways, so maybe we don't care much on that front. Definitely something that the team needs to figure out.",8.0,nygiants,t3_10k7ng9,False,0.0,None,2023-01-24T09:39:28Z,nygiants,0.0454996403336524
4630,48617,48617,DoABarrowRoll,"that's really what I mean lol. we most certainly do not have to hand it to dave gettleman. pick the worst GMs/HCs in the league and you will still find some successes. it took his entire regime being broken down, from the horrible HCs he hired to the coaching staffs he greenlit, to the bottom half of the roster that this regime churned over and found playable depth, for any of this to be possible.

I do not have to give him credit for being a secret genius and knowing these players would all turn out good (not that that's directly what you're saying). the fact of the matter is that coming into this year, Jones was a bad QB, Saquon's long term future was highly in question between his injury history and whether or not he could come back from his injuries strong, and Dex was a good but not great 3 down DL (he was never a pure 2 down run stuffer like other people tried to say but he obv wasn't a superstar). Then along came this coaching staff, and now the discussion has changed entirely.

my point is just that it took this regime to accomplish this. Gettleman wasn't ""proven right."" Someone else managed to clean up the mess he made. It's like if you were dating a drug addict, telling all of your family and friends ""I can change them, you'll see, everything will be amazing!"" Then they break up with you, go get clean, and have a fantastic life without you. The takeaway is not ""see I was right, I should have had more time."" It's not like if Gettleman was still with the team any of this would have happened. 

The takeaway is just that Daboll/Kafka/Tierney in particular (with assists from Schoen on roster building and Wink with the defense) managed to figure out a way to help Jones (and the rest of the team) improve and become good players.

* 3rd and 7, incomplete pass so they have to settle for a FG instead of 1st down from the 11.
* Eagles driving, but D holds them to 3, tied up again.

* Penalty on Flowers, 2nd and 8
* Penalty on Flowers, 2nd and 18
* 3 yard play... in bounds... in a hurry up offense.. from their own 17... with :32 to go? Thanks McAdoo.
* 3rd and 15, Engram catches it for 14 but doesn't extend for the yard.
* 4th and 1, Brad Wing punts... for 28 yards out of bounds. 
* 13 seconds to go.
* 1 incomplete pass, 19 yards to Alshon Jeffery who gets out of bounds, 0:01 - 61 yard FG.

* Extend 3 years to 2026 (32YO) with an out after 2024 
* Convert $18M 2023 base salary to bonus, new base salary for next year on extension of $1.1M
* 2023 ($19.8M cap hit): cap hit drops from $32.2M to $18.7M + new base salary of $1.1M in new deal, take home pay for the year gets that little $1.1M increase.
* 2024 ($10.5M + base salary cap hit): dead money at this point would be $19M if they absolutely have to move on after 2023, so this is the big question about giving him an extension - do they trust him enough to keep him for at least two more years in exchange for major cap relief in 2023. Cap hit starts at $10.5M + whatever base salary and bonuses they negotiate for his current level of play. They have an insane estimated $236M (maybe even a bit more if they move on from Glowinski after next year which seems likely) to spend (#2) so even with all the extensions and everything due, they could give him a nice enough base salary to keep him happy, but everything else around him completely manageable.
* 2025 ($4.5M + base salary cap hit): Now he's pretty cut-able if needed with $9M in dead money to move on (possibly more if they use NLTBE incentives in 2024 to lower cap hit and he manages to hit them), with a cap hit of that $4.5M + base salary and bonuses if they keep him.
* 2026 ($4.5M + base salary cap hit): $4.5M in dead money now, just gravy at this point if they want to keep him, no sweat if not.

So, no pay-cut next year, sticks around for at least 1 additional year with a workable dead money number after that, but could also stay up to 3. Obviously what his camp feels is a fair base salary is a major question mark, and if the two sides can find middle ground. The 2023 cap this offseason gets an additional $13.5M in space which would go a long way in the Jones/Dex/Barkley/Love negotiations, prior to the wide open 2024 and an estimated $236+M in cap room where we will really see just how good Schoen is at structuring contracts and how he builds a roster truly his own.

Ojulari worked his way onto the field in 2019 and recorded 36 tackles, 5.5 sacks and a forced fumble. He was more consistent as a pass rusher in 2020 despite his sack total - 5.5 - failing to increase. He also recorded 27 tackles, two forced fumbles and two passes batted in 2020. Ojulari (6-2, 240) played really well, plus showed a non-stop motor and an ability to make plays in the clutch. Thus, it was a surprise to some when he slipped to the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft.

>  there’s mountains of evidence that says paying a RB doesn’t lead to big time winning and they usually don’t live up to the contract.

...literally every team that has won the Superbowl in the past 20 years has either had an elite QB, a QB on a rookie contract or both. The only exceptions are Stafford depending on whether or not you consider him elite and Eli in 2011, who played like an elite QB that season. 

For the teams who had non-elite rookie contract QBs (not counting guys like Brady, Mahomes & Roethlisberger who were already studs in their first few years in the league), they all had very good bell-cow RBs. This list includes Marshawn Lynch, Ray Rice and Brandon Jacobs (was in more of a lead back role in 2007 than 2008 and averaged 92 ypg rushing). All of these guys got second contracts and all of them lived up to it besides Rice, who if he didn't drag his fiancee out of an elevator probably would've had a longer career in the NFL.

The clear best way to win in the NFL is to either have an elite QB or build a team around a good rookie QB, but if we plan on resigning Jones then we can't do either of those. Saying ""don't pay a RB"" only works when you have a Mahomes/Brady/Roethlisberger/Manning level QB, but if you have a Flacco/early career Russell Wilson/Eli Manning level QB then by all means you can't win a Superbowl without a stud RB.

Edit: also if you expand this list to teams that have _made_ the Superbowl in the last 20 years instead of just won it, there are a ton of examples of teams with mediocre QBs led by very good bell-cow RBs, with many of them on second contracts. This list includes Mixon, Gurley, Devonta Freeman, Jonathan Stewart, Marshawn (already mentioned above), Frank Gore, Thomas Jones, Shawn Alexander and Brian Westbrook. It does hammer home the simple fact that great QB play almost always beats a mediocre QB with a good team, so there is definitely an argument to be made that resigning Jones is a mistake, but if the move is to build around Jones then I don't see how we do that while letting Saquon walk.",2.0,nygiants,t3_111e0jw,False,0.0,:Jason_Garrett: Jason Garrett :Jason_Garrett:,2023-02-13T14:59:22Z,nygiants,0.0455550813893967

Unless you're talking about making two diamond-in-the-rough signings, odds are we aren't finding two quality starters for under $13M that would have the same or greater impact on our team as Saquon. For reference, Mark Glowinski has a cap hit of over $8M next season, and was one of the worst players on our team this past season.

> Paying jones and saquon together would pretty much lock in the giants ceiling so I think the only way you can justify paying Saquon is if they’re drafting another QB and letting jones walk.

I mean yea, of course it locks in our ceiling, but not because of a measly ~$13M contract, but because of the $40M+ we'll probably give Jones. Signing Jones ties this coaching staff and FO to their QB for however long the contract is, so in that time we need to give Jones every weapon possible to succeed or else it's wasted money.

Sometimes I think this sub gets too wrapped up in the ""don't pay a running back"" mantra so much so that they ignore the literal results from this season. Without Saquon our offense would have been bottom 3 in the league and there's no way we make the playoffs. Letting Saquon walk not only takes our offense backwards, but it also deprives Jones of any semblance of a running game and almost guarantees that whatever contract we sign him to will wind up looking foolish.

> And if you don't understand how having a HOF TE opens things up deep (Safety help forcing a lot of cover 1 and sucking up defenses) then of course the logic does not make sense.

But then who is going deep for KC? I'd argue that having Saquon opens up things over the middle with linebackers and safeties creeping up. We saw this happen a bunch last year and is one of the reasons Richie James got open so often vs zone blitz.

> Also, your logic is flawed. Most offenses throw short high completion throws but when Jones does it, it is an issue?

I never said it was an issue, the issue with Jones is that he locks into reads and the coaching staff doesn't trust letting him throw it 35+ times per game. He's a game manager who can throw it 20-25 times for 1 TD and not turn the ball over. I think that can work but it will be hard to fill out the roster with a guy like that making $40M/year. I see him as Tannehill but a better runner and worse passer.

Back to the receivers though, we could definitely do worse. Teams like GB and Baltimore still saw more offensive success than us with worse supporting casts. Some of that has to fall on the QB.

It's tough to say because there isn't a player in that tier making that much money who has won a Superbowl in recent memory.

Because you're not going to believe me when I tell you this, here's Ralph Vacchiano saying the same thing:

> Their ""business"" issue is that quarterbacks are expensive. Considering the contract Ryan Tannehill signed in 2020 pays him an average of $29.5 million, and Derek Carr makes an average of $40.5 million on the deal he signed in April, the idea of Jones getting $40 million per season isn't crazy. It might even be likely, considering there are multiple teams hoping a quarterback like him hits free agency and that the franchise tag is expected to be $32.5 million.

> The Giants would rather sign him than use the tag on him, according to a source, but it depends on whether they can get him at something close to a reasonable price.

Every successful team in the NFL today has either a top 5 QB or a strong running game.

New York will be searching high and low for upgrades to their offensive weapons and JuJu Smith-Schuster would be a good target. He fits the mold as the kind of big-bodied, physical receiver that should thrive in Daboll’s system.

That APY would be close to the estimated $32.45M non-exclusive franchise tag number for Jones, which gives Schoen some leverage. If Schoen is forced to something closer to $35M APY to get a three-year deal, he might agree to it if the details are favorable. That means a low 2023 cap hit and an out after Year 2 that makes the guaranteed amount only 60% or so of the total, so that the inflated salary of Year 3 only happens if the Giants have risen to the elite tier of teams by then.

If they are feeling generous when they sign him, they can go over, but in that case, the actual cap hit this season will below 32MM since a new contract will likely come with a signing bonus, which gets spread across the entirety of the contract length, usually combined with a low(er) first year salary.

Put another way, if the most I'm willing to pay SB is 12-13MM, then another back in the FA crop isn't likely to get that amount from me as well. I'd rather spend less at RB and more at WR, for example. 

It's not just FA either. There are several teams that are over the cap and have to make tough decisions. Decisions such as parting ways with their pricey WR for little in return via trade, or for nothing if cut outright. Here's an example (I'm not saying we should or will do this):

Chargers are way over the cap. Mike Williams, has a cap hit of $19MM this year for them. IF they are willing to trade him to unload his cap hit, then perhaps we can get him and restructure his deal to something more reasonable, assuming he's healthy.

From a pure production standpoint, that means finding a WR that can be a true #1, which likely can only be found via trade, unless some WR gets cut. There are a few cap strapped teams that will have to make tough decisions.

*Will they draft a center or an interior offensive lineman with a premium pick? Will they look for established help on the free agent market?*

*The Giants had a mish-mash at these spots in 2022, both because of injury and performance. How will they stabilize, and improve, that part of their line in 2023?*

Herbert is an elite QB because of his ability to play the position and his statistical excellence. He also does have 13 GWD since the start of his career, which is tied for 3rd-most in the league.

Also let’s also remember last year’s “gotta-have-it” game saw one of the most insane fourth quarter appearances of all time with Herbert vs the Raiders. If his coach wasn’t a moron, they would’ve been in the playoffs. 

But it’s probably for the better actually because now they will fire Staley and Lombardi and (hopefully) give Herbert some competent coaching. 

The one “flaw” in Herbert’s game is that he plays within the system he is given. He is not a big-time
freelancer like an Allen or Mahomes or a Roethlisberger. He reads the field like Tom Brady (the way he pings through his progressions) except with a better arm. So when you have a mediocre OC like Lombardi calling your plays you are screwed. 

This is the same problem Stafford had in Detroit. He had Lombardi as his OC and it was not good. I still remember at the beginning of the season all the Detroit fans saying to watch out for this guy.  Herbert is more talented to the point where he has broken into that elite tier, but with him he needs/wants structure and therefore needs to be provided with a really good OC/offensive-minded HC to maximize his talents to an even greater level.",1.0,nfl,t3_10cmrt5,False,1.0,:Giants: Giants,2023-01-15T10:28:28Z,nygiants,0.0702155888170496

This was an incredibly difficult throw, while down in the 4th quarter of the Super Bowl, with 320lbs of Wilfork in his face so he couldn't put his body into the throw . . . 40 yards into the air right into Manningham's arms for a catch that, while a great catch, was one you'd expect any NFL player to be able to make (as opposed to ones like the Julio catch which there are only a handful of people in history who can make that catch)

Not upset with Hodgins/Wandale/(Slayton OR FA signing)/Rookie WR being the main group. Obvious they bring Hodgins back, but Slayton depending on price vs FA WRs. Parris Cambell is a guy im looking at that can take Slayton's role for cheaper. He's a speedy guy with a injury history but had a breakout year last year fully healthy. I think he can be a cheaper option using injuries as leverage if they believe Slayton is asking for too much. 

Others guys like Chark, Jakobi, JuJu are WRs Giants can afford and would probably be better but, too expensive for their potential production imo.

The first point I mean, he's a free agent right now. I'd don't see any problem with him making a spectacle out of it. I don't take it personally and other fans shouldn't too. 

The interview with Lil Wayne is just him calling out the NYG organization. I don't think he threw Eli under the bus. This is when they drafted Saquon and he questioned why they drafted him if Eli needs help. He stated that Eli wasn't a guy to get out of the pocket and it was a time issue they can't even throw the ball enough and all he's getting is short routes/slants. 

The whole interview he was calling out the energy of the NYG org and questioning the direction they want to head in and asking them if they even wanted to win. Valid points imo, again, org was ran like shit. He never was a locker room issue as far as we know. 

The rest is just him being a diva playing it up for the media and the media eating it up. If that's the worst he is, a douche and a diva at times, Daboll could easily work with that. That is not much different than other big name NFL players, the difference is OBJ has a bigger social media following. 

If he can still play and the money's right I don't see why some fans are clamoring to not sign him.

The worst thing he's done is be a jerk on a plane. Feel like he gets more backlash than some nfl players who have committed acutal crimes because of his social media celebrity status. 

His time as a Giant he was extremely vocal and critical on how bad the Giants org was run and he was right, Giants were so poorly ran. He wanted to call out all the NYG BS and that got him in trouble. 

I also don't recall him having any issues in the locker room with players. He even currently tweets supporting the Giants this season.

As others have said, the league is devoid of QB talent and there are tons of teams who’ve been cycling through garbage QBs for years who would gladly take a quality-but-not-elite starter.

Anyways, he had a great season, and he deserves to be rewarded for it. The contract is definitely a gamble that he keeps up on a steady path of consistency and improvement—but honestly, having watched him since he was drafted, the signs were always there that he was making gradual, but steady progress. Daboll has definitely done wonders for him, but the flashes and subtle year-to-year improvement was definitely present in DJ before him.

All in all, an up to $40 million per year deal for hopefully around 3 years is a gamble i’m willing to take as a Giants fan. DJ has earned it and we really don’t have any other options. Without him, we don’t win shit this year.

If we hit a diamond in the rough, we could cut Barkley in 2 years (which is why I want to front load it) and still have another 2-
3 years of a cheap rookie RB. 

My fear is that we draft a WR who needs time to develop, and Jones is in the same predicament he's in this year, but without Barkley to shoulder the load and lead the offense.

Staffords pretty good, cant tell much because hes injured.

Goff is definitely better, Goff played lights out in Detroit. Although he has a stacked offense there, he elevated it even more, compared to Dak Chokescott being elevated by the team. 

Cousins is okay, but dimes is better and more versatile. Having a dual threat qb makes the offense so much harder to stop. D

Kyler is so shit, definitely worse.

Geno has shown some promise, probably the hardest one to compare, it'd say DJ is slightly better. 

Purdy is good, but hes played on a stacked team and hasn't shown enough to decide to see if hes better than jones, right now I doubt it.

I don't think we get to see that leadership as much as fans.

I'll put it to you this way; at least he clearly isn't in the Russ Wilson/Aaron Rodgers conversation of QBs the players openly dislike.

I like that he didn't turn the ball over.  I like that he put together some game-winning drives.  Shoot, if it weren't for some crucial drops (like that Slayton ball that *almost* cost us the game) I think DJ could have been even better.

The Jets have [TWO rookie of the year candidates](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-honors-finalists-announced-for-select-awards-from-2022-season), one on each side of the ball and one of them is a WR.  Breece Hall had that OROY on lock before his injury.

You are right about the NFCN being an easier division.  No question.  And GB had a losing record (only 1 more win than the Wilson/White led Jets).  Also remember, Rodgers is driven by ego.  You think he wouldn't LOVE the chance to beat Josh Allen and Tua twice a year to prove he's the best?

With that said, I'm obviously with you in that I recognize that there is a possibility (likelihood?) that this *doesn't* go our way and we do have to let him walk due to salary.

Keeps people from teeing off on DJ like when Barkley was injured in 2020 and 2021.

Hear me out...  The salary cap for 2023 is $220M.  Say $225M for 2024 and $230M for 2025?  You can't spend 15% of your salary cap on one player, you just *can't*.  I have looked at every single Super Bowl team since the salary cap was implemented (1994).  The biggest hit in history was Steve Young that first year at 13.7%.

Patrick Mahomes is currently 17% against the cap.  In theory, he *could be* the exception that proves the rule. But I wouldn't bet on it.

We need receivers.  We need linebackers.  We need defensive backs.  We need linemen on both sides of the ball.  And it's not like we have a bunch of 1st and 2nd round picks to ride out rookie contracts.

You have to be a Philadelphia fan right? That’s the only explanation lmao. 

But seriously though, I mean this as nice as possible, do you not get what I’m saying? It’s pretty audacious to say I’m “arguing with myself”, then make the point that the fact that they had such a small chance to win w/ is what made them underdogs, as if that’s some checkmate, given the fact that (a) that’s my whole point, and (b) that’s why I don’t care that they were “underdogs” by the book, I care about them pretending like they were this slept on great team, when the only reason they were underdogs by the book was bc they had a shitty QB that played well.

**If you’re going to respond to this message, I’d ask that you make an intelligent response to this point right here:** what I’m saying is, **the whole “nobody believe in us, we’re underdogs, why not us” thing that Philly was doing that year is a descriptor of scrappy teams with a lack of talent that overcome a lot of objective deficiencies (e.g., general lack of skill, young players starting, key injuries, coaching changes mid season, etc. things of that nature). In other words, the classic “underdog” defies all the odds and SOMEHOW plays WELL above where they should have, to the point where it almost isn’t explainable. “How was X team so good?” That’s an underdog. Philly was not that. They were the 1 seed, they had a great team, nothing went wrong for them until they had 1 single injury. The backup stepped in and was just as good as the starter. The rest of the team remained great. It’s easy to explain what happened—that is, we know why they weren’t favoured in the playoffs, and we know why that was wrong and why they ended up winning. That is not a reason for the players to go around acting like they aren’t getting respect. “Nobody believed in you” on a technicality—your QB sucked until he didn’t.

They were underdogs bc their starting QB got hurt and their back up had absolutely no reason to play well. They didn’t win bc they were this underrated roster that no one was giving respect to and people were just being slept on—they were the fucking 1 seed in the NFC—they won bc their backup QB happened to play elite football out of nowhere. You replay that run 100 times, and if Nick Foles plays like his usual self instead 99 times, then they’d lose all 99 times. It’s simple as that. I think it’s lame as hell they aligned their identity with being “underdogs” when they were only “underdogs” because of 1 small, technical, easily explainable reason that had absolutely fucking nothing to do with the typical “underdog” narrative.

Personally I think WR should be one of, if not our top, priority for next year so we give DJ a chance to show what he can do with a quality receiving core to make sure he’s the guy.

He does have 3 years as an OC compared to 1 for Kafka, and those teams'' offenses have out performed the Giants this year.  So it would seem like a no brainer, but McVay called the plays and designed the offense for his year as OC with the Rams. So that year isn't going to mean much to teams.  Which is probably why he left to have more opportunity to put his stamp on an offense.  So that leaves his 2 years as OC in Philly.  Siriani was coming from an OC position himself.  It's impossible to say how much of their offense was Siriani vs Steichen, but Siriani retained play calling duty to start.  He took over mid season and has obviously done well with it, but it does heavily suggest that the offense was mostly a product of Siriani and aside from doing well calling Nick's offense what else does he bring to the table.  

Now my point is really that neither have strong resumes, even though Steichen's is better .  So then it comes down to the interview.  If it were Sean Payton he was getting more consideration than I would agree that his resume alone should suffice.  In the case of Steichen it's not as clear cut as 3 vs 1 and a better team.

For 3 years that is 97.5 million and So Jones getting 114 million over those 3 is a reasonable number.  Lets say in this example they give him 100 million at signing and give his salary is 2, 5, 7. Jones gets his 38 per but his cap hits are 22, 25, 27 for those same years.  If you hold to that 38 you have to pay him 76 million the last 2 if you keep him.
