If say MO can turnaround the Oline with picks like Skoronski, Acuila, and Schimdt (with the Carolina’s trade) would you take it?

Purdy is looking amazing for the 49ers and the 49ers are the division rival—why would they want to give us their QB that is doing well for them? Kind of seems dumb, right? 

Also, if Purdy was this “good” beforehand, why didn’t anyone draft him until the last pick? Shanahan is one of the best coaches in the league, and the 49ers are well stacked in their defense and offensive weapons and line. That is why coaching is so important in this game. Even so, Purdy was only a 3rd stringer until Jimmy G and Lance got injured.

I was not making an excuse for Kyler. I am just pointing out he has been to only one playoff game in his entire career while your comment reads like he was Dak Prescott or Kirk Cousins in the playoffs. In that game, you cannot put the only blame on Kyler either. The offense could not move at all, the Oline was non existent, and the defense could not stay off the field long enough to catch their breath or to stop the Rams’ killer offense. Our coaching staff never adjusted successfully, which was a consistent pattern through the Kingsbury Era. Everyone likes to circle jerk hate on Kyler, but this is a team sport and our coaching staff always seem underprepared against most teams in the NFL where we just fucking collapse terribly at points.

Also, I suggest you look at Kyler’s contract, there is no realistic way of moving off of his contract until 2025. Even then, the team still incurs dead cap. The team should just build the team up and have it ready for Kyler/or whoever to be the QB in the future.",6.0,azcardinals,t3_10j1eaz,False,0.0,:cardinals: Cardinals,2023-01-23T13:39:40Z,azcardinals,0.0189311745989671

**Overall Regular Season Record**: 169-100-2

Probably my best year of picking games ever, which is funny because I feel like I know less about these teams than you in years past but have instead mostly gone with what felt most likely. Anyway, for the last game I'll give a prediction for how the game goes in addition to the final score. Hope everyone has a blast and enjoys the game! 


__**Super Bowl LVII ~~Script~~ Prediction**__

**1st Quarter**

Chiefs get the ball first and drive all the way down the field only to end up settling for a field goal. Eagles also have a long opening drive that extends into the early 2nd quarter, but after 15 minutes the Eagles are threatening in the red zone. 


*Score 3-0 Chiefs*


**2nd Quarter**

Jalen Hurts finds Devonta Smith in the end zone to give the Eagles the lead a minute into the quarter. The teams trade 3-and-outs but when the Eagles punt back to the Chiefs, the infamous KC special teams that has been an issue all season rears its ugly head as they fumble the return back to the Eagles. Hurts leads them to a quick score as he throws a TD to Goedert. With time winding down in the half Mahomes leads the Chiefs down the field and finds MVS with mere seconds left in the half to cut into the deficit. 


*Score: 14-10 Eagles*


**Halftime**

Everyone will either comment that this is the best or the worst halftime show in years, maybe even both takes will come in at the same time. Also for the game there won't be many memorable commercials (just a few that get a chuckle or get a sigh) except Burger King will reveal that their jingle was in fact a mind control experiment that passed with flying colors. ""You rule"" is a lie; ""they rule (the world)""  


**3rd Quarter**

Eagles start hot in the second half with a TD drive that includes a 4th-and-1 where they line up for the Hurts sneak but reveal the long con and Hurts completes a jump pass to AJ Brown. Gainwell continues his impressive postseason run as he's the one to score the rushing TD. Chiefs have a promising drive but the Eagles pass rush comes in clutch and forces the punt. After getting the ball back, the Chiefs score a quick TD when McKinnon catches a shovel pass from Mahomes. However the Eagles stop the 2-point conversation attempt. 


*Score: 21-16 Eagles*


**4th Quarter**

Eagles offense continues to stall as Chris Jones comes up with a huge 3rd down stop to force a punt. Mahomes and Kelce work their magic and they connect several times en route to the go ahead TD with 6 minutes left. This time they do get the 2-point conversion as Toney scores on an end-around. Hurts then has his legacy drive, including a clutch 4th down scramble and completion to AJ Brown. Elliott hits the 34 yard field goal with 1:10 left to tie it and the Chiefs out of timeouts. However Mahomes calmly leads the Chiefs into FG range as Butker hits the game-winner from 49 yards as time expires.

3823,41162,41162,DiddledByDad,"Look man I’m gonna shoot you straight. Arizona sports is cursed. The last time any of our big four teams won a championship was over 20 years ago and that’s the only one across the history of all our teams. So if you want a winning culture or any kind of consistent success, the Cardinals probably aren’t for you. 

That being said, we are perpetual underdogs. When we win, it’s the best feeling in the world because no one ever expects us to do anything noteworthy. You won’t find many bandwagon or fair weather fans here either because you have to have at least some level of sustained success to get those. 

As for the roster, it’s just okay for the most part. Budda Baker is one of the best safeties in the league and is the heart and soul of this team. We will defend him fiercely. Kyler Murray is going to be coming off an ACL injury and still has a to prove that he can elevate the team beyond just using his talent to pull some crazy shit out of his ass a few times a season. How good he is and if he’s the franchise QB of the future is consistently a hot topic of debate. Our other “elite” player is DeAndre Hopkins who is one of the premier receivers of the league even if he’s getting up there in age. There’s been some trade rumors with him but we’ll see how that shakes out. 

You also have some up and comers in the form of Zach Allen, Zaven Collins, Isaiah Simmons, Rondale Moore, and Trey McBride who are all from the last handful of draft classes or so. All of them have the potential to be great but haven’t reached that status yet. 

We’re expecting to hire a HC here in the next couple days and it’ll be interesting to see how that shakes out as well. Expect excitement or a riot depending on who it is.

15141,135623,135623,TJeffersonsBlackKid,"Kylers contract was negotiated by Steve Keim and Erik Burkhardt who are both drunken idiots and the laughingstock of the league at their positions. Rumor in the Cardinals headquarters is that Kylers camp out in the clause to squeeze out extra money though this has never been proven. Still, it’s not like coherent minds are putting these items together.

Regarding the Cardinals, Keim consistently put together decent free agents, shit draft, and no depth. Every team has injuries but not every team was having to start who the Cardinals were having to start.

Here’s a list of the Cardinals offensive starters who missed significant time due to injuries/suspension:

Kyler Murray

Zach Ertz

DeAndre Hopkins

James Connor

Hollywood Brown

TJ Humphries

Rodney Hudson

Justin Pugh

In addition to these injuries, we started 10 different o-line combinations and 14 different players on that o-line. Kelvin Beachum started every game so effectively the 4 other positions were filled by 13 different starters. We went down to our FIFTH string guard at one point, starting Rasheed fucking Coward for three games. Coward was a defensive tackle who became an offensive tackle who filled in at guard for us due to our situation.

Every team has injuries but not every team has Steve Keim dealing with depth. Keim does not believe that line depth matters and believes it is not something to budget for.

The remains of this squad and bringing a new system to a QB who can’t walk practice until the seasons already started is the challenge. Also Nuk understandably wants to leave.

Even still, the idea of anyone shying away from a head coaching job anywhere is pure horseshit. Maybe Bidwell is being too apprehensive or not offering enough or both.

16032,147323,147323,UserInAtl,"Realistically the Cardinals will go where Murray does. If he goes back to the MVP levels of last season we are probably fine. Otherwise the roster is pretty much terrible, especially if Hop leaves. Probably not as bad as r/nfl makes it out to be but way worse than this sub, who tends to massively overrate players, especially if they are from ASU or white.

If we draft #3 we are probably fine with Allen, and whoever we pick in the DLine. Not top 10 but good. CB is pretty weak. Wilson could keep developing but Murphy is a slot guy and we have a gaping CB1 hole. The rest of our secondary is good though. Unfortunately Safety is more of a luxury position though. Simmons is inconsistent and Collins is fine but pretty overrated by this sub. Hes definitely a stater but your not even thinking about him when talking top LBs, but I also disagree that he is behind schedule.

Our Oline is pretty poor. Hump is expensive but probably our best lineman. When Pugh isn't busy being injured he is total garbage. Hudson retired unofficially last year and Jones has potential but he is best at Humps position. Beechum is a starting quality guy though. The rest aren't even worth mentioning. Probaly depth at best but you don't want any of them actually playing 

Ertz is fine but aging. He is probably hitting the wall sooner or later and McBride did fine. Trending in the right direction but I dont think you build your offense off of him next year. Maybe in 2 or 3 though. Connor is good but our line can't open holes so it doesn't really matter tbh. Our WR group outside of Hop is probably bottom 10. We wildly over rate Wesley. Great depth but he isnt a starter. Dortch isn't a WR 1 either.

Really, if Murray comes back strong were probably 1 or 2 good drafts from competing (especiallyif he can get outside of the pocket and take pressure off of our terrible OLine which will take a bit to fix).

The remaining term (time frame) of the contract is in place, and during that time, the employing team may seek compensation from any other team wishing to hire the retired coach. Once that term is up (the time frame covered by the contract has expired), then the coach is free to seek employment from any team free from any obligation to the original team.

In other words, the contract does not toll, and the time frame covered by the contract runs as normal. If the contract tolls, then it would never expire.

Edit: For further clarification, this came up during the Arians contract. Arians was under contract with the Cardinals until 2018, and they had a team option to extend his contract for the 2019 season. Arians retired and sat out the 2018 season and then came back to coach the Buccaneers in 2019. The NFL originally stated that the Buccaneers didn't owe any compensation because Arians' contract originally only ran through 2018; the Cardinals disagreed believing that they had the ability to exercise the team option to keep him under contract for 2019 as well.

This is another dumb argument that undercuts your own supposed point. You're saying his stats don't matter unless he's producing at near-MVP level like he did in 2021.

I'll explain it to you again:

You said Hurts' stats prove he's better.

I showed that the last time (2021) Kyler was healthy for most of the year (like Hurts in 2022) and had a good team around him (yet still worse than the 2022 Eagles), he actually **outperformed** Hurts.

And now you wanna compare 2022 Kyler, who only played little over half the season with one of the worst OLs and teams in football, picking third overall to a guy who played 15 games with the best roster in football, hands-down the best OL, and whose team will likely be Super Bowl champs to one another?

Hurts: 15 games started, 61% completion, 3144 yards, 16 TD, 9 INT

Murray: 14 GS, 69.2% completion, 3,787 yards, 24 TD, 10 INT

You're not making the point you think you're making. Yes, Jalen had a better 2022, but Murray is the more talented player overall, and anyone can use stats to make it seem like one QB is definitively better than the other. Kyler had the better team and injury luck in 2021, and his stats were much better than Hurts. I'm saying Kyler is more TALENTED, not that he had better stats in 2022. They're not the same thing, precisely because things like roster talent outside of QB and playcalling make an outsized impact on a QB's output.

Now let's take a look at Hurts in 2022, with an Eagles roster that's much better than even the 2021 Cardinals:

15 GS, 66% completion, 22 TD, 6 INT, 3,701 yards.

So as a the likely MVP this year, Hurts, having played 1 more game than 2021 Kyler had a worse completion %, less TDs, and slightly fewer yards. To his credit, he had 4 less INT.

So it's pretty reasonable to assume that Kyler is more talented than the very talented Jalen Hurts, considering that Hurts' stats are still comparable or worse than Kyler's on an even better 2022 Eagles roster than the 2021 Cardinals roster. That's using your own  passing statistics argument.

2. Only two teams from the NFC West went to playoffs, and they were the only two teams even close to going (not three, the Rams finished 5-12)
3. The Rams are going to be a mess going forward with an old Matt Stafford at QB, McVay and Donald getting ready to bolt into retirement, a lack of high draft picks the last few years, and Cooper Kupp about to be on the wrong side of thirty coming off of a serious knee injury, plus a not-so-great cap situation.

Anquan absolutely was. I remember insiders back then talking about it. You could see it on everyone’s faces after Boldin would make and big grab and truck a few guys to get the offense going.

The Cardinals swapped a 6th and Arians for the Bucs' 7th rounder.
Payton's a better coach, sure, but if Arians is going for a 7th rounder, I don't know how you convince a team that Payton, who WANTS to leave New Orleans is worth a #3 overall pick. 

If I'm Michael Bidwill and Monti Ossenfort, that's how I approach this negotiation. Arians trade as a starting point, and hope you can get Loomis to agree to something like one of our third-round compensatory picks. Maybe our actual early 3rd round pick at worst.

Don't forget that in addition to his other leverage, the Saints are not only negotiating with other teams FOR Payton, but WITH Payton himself. Wanna get the #3 overall pick for Sean? Guess what? Sean's not gonna like that, either, because if he's going there, that's HIS #3 overall draft pick.
