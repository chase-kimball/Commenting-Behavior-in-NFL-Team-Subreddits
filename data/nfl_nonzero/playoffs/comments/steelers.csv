1563,8823,8823,ASuperGyro,"I think the Ravens run game is so good because their OC, well that’s all he was good for really, so it was easier to plug and play RBs. I think Dobbins pre-injury was great and is looking good on the back half of the year however. Plus having Lamar as QB makes the run game much harder for defenders since the threat of him keeping is obviously a big factor in how they pursue. I think the Bills could have a better run game but they don’t seem to scheme a good run game, but I think Singletary is a good back and would produce well with the Ravens versus I expect Dobbins to take a hit producing for the Bills. 

Won’t argue about the TE disparity because that’s a given, although I think Knox is an excellent red zone guy versus Mandrews being a full field effective TE that demands attention. But because they lack in other receiving options he isn’t able to have as big an impact as Goedert or Kelce (Kelce obviously being next level). If they had better receiving options elsewhere, like last year, he really shines. Point being I think having Diggs-Knox elevates the offense more than having Mandrews-Robinson(Bateman still kind of unknown because of injuries, but first few weeks looked good tbf) Watkins has just had a disappointing career relative to his expectations, I believe Buffalo even drafted him so interesting that he’s on the opposite side of the comparison. I also believe he’s on his fourth team, which says a couple things both positive and negative. I don’t know that Davis would last long enough to hit four teams but I also think he’d be valued enough to stay with an individual team longer.

Really curious how the new offense looks with an OC that can expand the passing offense and get them some better receiving options. 

Long and short is I think I agree with the sentiment but value individual pieces and outside impacts a bit differently.

I’d lean closer to 1:1 than one being better or worse offensive pieces, but that WR1 in this kind of league pushes it for me.

The Chargers with their defensive HC had both a bad offensive second half and bad defensive second half, partly in due to their uninspiring OC and having a defensive minded HC. 

Tomlin and Bill B are certainly great coaches, but without an offensive guru in the building, whether that be an OC or HoF QB, their offenses look very lack luster. 

So my question is why are any defensive HCs in hot demand when it just doesn’t seem like that is a recipe for success in the league currently. If you get a top level offensive guy they’re probably going to be the target of teams who fired their HC previously.

I don’t mean this to take away from Ryan at all, great guy and great coach and the defense is impressive, but is that a recipe for success in the current league?

>Why do they need a larger staff?

They need a larger staff - both scouting and coaching - because those departments, even on the largest staffs in the league, are tasked with such a massive amount of work that they are inevitably leaving work on the table. There's more advanced scouting and self-scouting that coaches could be doing if they had more time available to them by spreading the workload more. More teaching at practice that could be done with individual players during drills and practice. 

On the scouting and player acquisition side, there are 249 FBS and FCS schools that produce draft-eligible players each year, not to mention D2 and D3 schools or pro-scouting on the 32 NFL teams, plus CFL and USFL players that could be available. Again, even the largest staffs are leaving potential evaluations on the table just because of the sheer volume of work.

>The data points are indeed facts but a shit ton of assumptions are being applied to create meaning where there is none. The sun rises every day but is it because of physics or because we sacrificed a goat to the sun god last week so they wouldn't forget to have the sun rise for us?

Its crazy. Leftwich, HC candidate to fired. Hackett, saving the Broncos to fired. Joe Brady, gonna light the league up to fired. Kliff Kingsbury, gonna revolutionize the NFL to fired. All of Andy Reids OCs. Josh McDaniels.

You have to match the team and its skills to the OC and the playcalling. If everyone involved, from ownership to Kenny, feel they have a better chance to develop together than to bring in a new guy I cant fault it. 

If the offense looked the same at the end of the season as it did at the beginning I would be pretty skeptical of the move. But they got better every week. 

Why is the idea of a Coordinator and QB continuing to develop together dismissed but magic new OC theory accepted?

We need to get better in pass protection. Kenny needs to get better at stepping up in the pocket and giving deep routes more time to develop. We need another receiver.

 We'll know by year 3 if KP8 is the guy.  In the meantime, I'd MUCH rather see the Steelers win games and get into the playoffs than go 3-14 and secure the #2 pick.",3.0,steelers,t3_10q461y,False,0.0,None,2023-01-31T15:29:35Z,steelers,0.1076447243191915

But I also understand that switching OC's in year 2 of KP8's career could really set him back.  Additionally I can see where we improved after we traded Claypool, and the O-line and run game started performing like we hoped they would.  When the team performs better as the year progresses that is a statement that our coaches are good, in my opinion.  You might not agree with the schemes or game plan, but steady demonstrable improvement means the coach is having a positive impact.  We averaged 15.5 points per game before we traded Claypool, 20.8 ppg after.  It's not an unreasonable take to suggest Canada earned another year.  Plus if 40+ years of fandom have taught me anything it's that our front office gets it right at a significantly highly rate than the other teams, so I'm not losing my mind with bringing him back.",5.0,steelers,t3_10q461y,False,0.0,None,2023-01-31T15:11:31Z,steelers,0.03510317237376

Would I rather be the Steelers or the Bucs?  Steelers.  Bucs are on the verge of being irrelevant for the next decade.

Would I rather be the Steelers or the Patriots?  Steelers.  I hope I don't need to explain that one.

Would I rather be the Steelers or the Chiefs?  Well at least this one makes you think for a minute.  Not surprisingly, the Chiefs ALSO haven't had a losing season in 10 years.

I didnt say it was... but I disagree with everything else you said and explained why in my previous comment. Its just my opinion. There is no other team in the NFL with as many holes as the Bears roster and the Lions have a much better roster than many give credit for IMO. I think an elite prospect at a position that is difficult to find at a position of need is absolutely worth the trade up. Jalen Carter is the consensus best player among most scouts and while the Bears would love to have him he projects better as a 4-3 IDL rather than a NT in their 3-4 defense and they would be better suited to get a LT and WR for their young franchise QB to help his development.",1.0,nfl,t3_10sppix,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2023-02-04T17:17:42Z,steelers,0.1676348058127572

8012,48057,48057,D0ctorMantisToboggan,"They would secure the clear best player in the draft.

There are some very good options at Edge/CB who will fall to the late 2nd-3rd round but a true 3-down DT who can create pressure as a pass rusher from the interior is rare. 

They don't need help on the OL or at RB currently or a QB considering Goff has looked pretty good. WR is pretty good and TE is very deep in this draft I think they could get a guy in the 4th to develop.

1.01 DT Carter
2.18 CB Cam Smith/Antonio Johnson
2.24 DE Zach Harrison/Mike Morris

I like the way the board falls for them if this is their approach rather than him-hawing over whether Myles Murphy will be able to translate his physical gifts into production on the field (if he is even there when they pick) or if Tyree Wilson has enough physical talent to be viewed as a top 10 pick.

Maybe they go CB and take a guy like Witherspoon which would probably be the most likely pick at that spot but Dan Campbell seems to be the type of guy who would prefer that 1st pick be used in the trenches which is also a more highly valued position group.

Bears get Paris Johnson at #6 and JSN at #18 and have an OSU reunion and get Fields some help on offense, finally. Fast-tracking his development by getting him the best pure LT and former teammate along with JSN for the same reason.

8014,48059,48059,D0ctorMantisToboggan,"Outside opinion from a wandering Steeler fan

The Browns may be willing to offer the most for Hopkins given his relationship with Watson. I would sign Jacoby Brissett as QB2 and see him start what is likely to be the better half of the 2023 season and trade Hopkins for Amari Cooper and a mid round pick (4th?). Brissett would be reunited with Cooper who is a slightly younger player who could have a few more seasons left in him.

I dont think anyone is offering more than a 3rd for Hopkins who is now 30 and has a big contract along with a big personality. Absorbing another WR contract isn't ideal but some sort of continuity on offense would be nice. I might also add a RB such as Jahmyr Gibbs to help the offense continue to develop while Kyler is on IR. RT is a draft need as well. I'd take one in the 3rd-4th such as a Jaelyn Duncan or Darnell Wright.

Defense needs to be the main focus 1st round pick needs to be defense (Anderson or Carter) to replace Watts impact and a 3rd or 4th should be spent on a nickel corner such as Riley Moss or Clark Phillips). As a Steeler fan I dont want to lose Brian Flores but hes probably the best option at HC in Arizona.

CB and DT are the current biggest needs IMO.

As much as I'd like them to get someone like Siaka Ika to just clog the middle and eat double teams it hasnt been the recipe for over a decade. They also like their DT to be under 6'5"" for the appropriate leverage and also able to rush the QB from the interior. They dont seem to like the 330+lbs NT types anymore, either. I feel like they may try to re-sign Larry Ogunjobi and play him at DT rather than DE if they can find someone to fill his role. 

Bryan Breese feels like a top guy who could fall the same way Karlaftis did... but maybe not as far. If he is available at 17 it would be hard to pass up on a guy who fits as a 3-4 power rushing DE.

If hes not available I'd really like them to yake Jordan Addison. I know WR isnt really a need but if they have offers or interest on Diontae Johnson it would be nice to get his contract off the books to they can pay Highsmith and begin working on his extension early. If they got a 3rd round pick for him i think that would be on the low end but maybe they wait until the trade deadline and get as a 2nd to a playoff team with injury at the position.

Im really starting to like CB outside of the 1st round if a top guy falls but there are some interesting prospects who could be taken in the late 2nd or even 3rd round. If Addison isnt taken I would use one of those 2nd round picks on an Edge rusher but Deonte Banks from Maryland could be a nice pick at 49 if available.

The last guy I'll mention is Cameron Latu at TE. Hes a willing blocker who just needs some polish and is a great athlete.

WR is a premium position and after the dead cash paid out DJ would only be due $10m to another team if he were to be traded and could also be franchise tagged the following year (he would be 29 years old). I feel like they could easily get a 3rd round pick for him depending on the WR market.

So... regardless of how I feel or anyone outside of the organization feels/thinks, the Steelers LOVE Dan Moore Jr. I dint see them moving on from him in any way in the forthcoming season. I was extremely low on him entering 2022 and not only did they keep him as a starter with little to no backup plan in terms of veteran support, they kept him on an island against top pass rushers with rare Te support for chip blocking and keeping the edge.

As for Addison i think its underrated to have a guy who can play both the slot and outside as well as he does. Also DJ is very good at that but considering they dont have someone who can play outside to allow him to move across the formation as Tomlin likes to do in the offense... It limits his availability in terms of production and targets. I think DJ gets a couple TDs this year if hes playing the slot on the goal line while a guy like Addison draws coverage on the outside, or vice versa.

9279,54598,54598,Dang026,">Pickens is a legit top 5 talent

This is the delusion I'm talking about. Every fan thinks the player on their team is better than they are. Pickens was a rookie entering the season. Off the top of my head there are at least 20 receivers who should be ranked above him. Sure he has the POTENTIAL to be a top 5, as does Najee who also isn't there yet although he is probably top 10. Freiermuth im actually pretty high on and I'd say hes about 6 or 7th best TE.

...but we had zero depth at WR outside of DJ and GP and the offense was masking the fact the left side of the OL was so bad to start the season Trubisky was getting rid of the ball in 2.3s on average which was among the fastest in the league just the same as Ben the past few seasons. Not much changed there due to awful OL play. 

If i were to put a grade in that group they are outside the 20s for their overall performance this season mainly due to Dotsons complete inability to pick up a blitz, Dan Moore Jrs proneness to give up the edge to a speed rush and the lack of push in the run game by the entire group up until the final few games of the season

Recievers/TEs id have to rank around 10 or 11. RB at 8.
Say QB/OL each at 20/24 and that puts the offensive ranking in terms if talent somewhere around 17-19 imo

Overall id say the offense did underperform a bit but the QB carousel and Najee being MIA for 2/3 of the season as well as having no WR3 (since week 6) in an offense that relies on movement from such players based on college film, I'd say it could have went so much worse than what the fans are currently losing their minds over.",4.0,steelers,t3_10ffdcc,False,0.0,:primantis:Primanti Bro's,2023-01-18T22:38:25Z,steelers,-0.0853754544665568

I keep hearing this repeated but where do you think they rank in terms of immediate available talent, not projection based on youth or how they will grow together as a unit?

Were they honestly a top 15 group in terms of talent, entering the season, with that OL being thrown together and Mitch Trubisky as QB1? I could agree maybe top 20 but considering the team ended up around 25th or 26th in offensive production thats not terrible especially considering thier featured back in Najee Harris wasnt healthy for 2/3 of the season and Kenny had multiple concussions.

I think Steeler fans overestimate the actual talent level as compared to the rest of the league. 

The Broncos, Bucs or the Cardinals are clearly more talented but didn't separate themselves much from the Steelers despite huge disparities in offensive spending and a more veteran group.",2.0,steelers,t3_10ffdcc,False,0.0,:primantis:Primanti Bro's,2023-01-18T21:51:02Z,steelers,-0.086381664
9281,54600,54600,Dang026,"Lets have a conversation about the offensive production since 2018, following LBell refusing to play, the entire OL aging out, AB going nuts, Bens arm falling off and the offense being the lowest paid of any team in 2022 with a rookie QB who got multiple concussions and Mitch Trubisky who clearly isnt a starting QB splitting reps. Also a rookie WR was the teams #1 with no clear #3 in an offense that has always played the 11 set. Claypool was traded by week 7 and Gunner Olszewski/Steven Sims was our #3 which was somehow worse than Ray-ray McDonald lol.

Not saying Matt Canada deserves an endless pass but lets say Kenny is 'The Guy' and give him another weapon or LG early in the draft if they're going to have the lowest paid offense. CA3 isnt a guarantee rather a gadget player and likely a return specialist.

I would genuinely like to see them take Jordan Addison in the 1st and give Kenny a Chris Godwin type of player to consistently target in the slot while Diontae plays the outside as a pure separator and Pickens is the 50/50 guy.

If the play calling remains problematic or the scheme doesnt allow stars to shine then clearly the fault will be on MC but lets not act like Najee wasnt hurt all season and a shaky QB room who was relying on him to be the soul of that entire offense wasnt crippled by his absence. Also the O-Line took until the final 4-5 games to look like a cohesive group.

He gets one more year without a doubt and could possibly change some opinions if he learns from this season and gets some more talent on the offensive side of the ball.",7.0,steelers,t3_10ffdcc,False,0.0,:primantis:Primanti Bro's,2023-01-18T18:39:40Z,steelers,0.0418029197633266

All this talk about how various players and coaches deserve to be in the Hall of Fame for the way they ""revolutionized"" the game of football, but no consideration whatsoever for the way Lynn Swann revolutionized the WR position.

You know all the crazy acrobatics we take for granted in WRs today? Guess who it all started with? I'll give you a hint: His opponents called him ""soft"" for taking ballet lessons in the off-season, even though those ballet lessons are what helped him develop the elite body control and concentration in contested-catch situations that put him on so many NFL highlight reels in the 1970s.

Bottom line, Lynn Swann raised the bar for how WRs were expected to play and prepare for the game, and, in fact, he inspired other great WRs in doing so. Go ahead and ask Jerry Rice and Cris Carter exactly who inspired them to become WRs in the first place. While you're at it, ask them whether or not they believe Lynn Swann belongs in the Hall of Fame.

The First-Team All-Pro selection, the two Second-Team All-Pro selections and the Super Bowl X MVP award are just the icing on the cake for Lynn Swann, who revolutionized the WR position in the NFL in just 116 games.",-2.0,nfl,t3_10zf1ui,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2023-02-11T13:03:29Z,steelers,0.0779450510874528

12959,72730,72730,EnjoyMoreBeef,"The Civic Arena was the albatross around the Penguins' necks. It was the oldest arena in the NHL by the mid-1990s, and it was never intended for hockey in the first place. It was built in 1961 for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, who occupied it for two years before the piss-poor acoustics made them move back to Heinz Hall. It was an utter failure of urban planning, and the reason why the Penguins almost relocated in the first place.

The franchise itself was driven into bankruptcy by dumb ownership decisons. When Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was forced to sell the Penguins to save his real estate business, the new ownership group, led by Howard Baldwin, bought the team with very little of their own money, and gave away the rights to all the arena's vital revenue streams (parking, concessions, luxury boxes) to SMG Entertainment, the company that managed the Civic Arena. In addition, he stupidly agreed to the most expensive arena lease in the NHL on what was already the oldest arena in the NHL, which further reduced his financial flexibility. Meanwhile, the star-studded roster was becoming more expensive, so with no other way to cover the payroll, and a stupidly expensive arena lease, all it took was a minor decline in attendance to force the team into bankruptcy.

When Mario Lemieux was awarded the Penguins post-bankruptcy, he promised to repay the franchise's creditors in full. He renegotiated terms with SMG Entertainment for a less expensive lease on the Civic Arena, a significantly larger percentage of the vital revenue from the arena, and full takeover of arena management in 2004 instead of 2012.

As the creditors were being repaid, expenses had to be cut, which included the payroll. The roster was gutted of pretty much all talent, and the Penguins were a *de facto* AHL team by the 2003-2004 season, which was the one season when attendance *actually* collapsed. Even in the non-playoff seasons of 2001-2002 and 2002-2003, attendance at Penguins games as a percentage of arena capacity was just over 90% and just under 90%, respectively, which is perfectly normal for an NHL market with less than 3,000,000 people to draw from. But it collapsed to 70% in 2003-2004, because nobody wanted to pay NHL prices for an AHL-caliber product. Local TV ratings remained high in spite of this, which belied the notion of a ""disinterested"" hockey market.

Mario Lemieux didn't threaten relocation until 2007, right after his plans for a fully-privately-funded arena were shot down by a state government agency at the end of 2006. By that time, attendance was comfortably above 90% capacity again. Here's the text of an official statement released by Lemieux to the press on [December 17, 2006](https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/mario-lemieux-statement-on-penguins-ownership/c-494981):

>As you know, **the long-term future of the Penguins in Pittsburgh is dependent on a new arena.** That has been our stance since we purchased the team out of bankruptcy in 1999. When our group **bought the team more than seven years ago,** I never could have imagined that we would be **standing here today, still without a new arena.** But that is the reality.

>We were told repeatedly during the first six years of our ownership that there would be **no public money available to pay for an arena.** We were told repeatedly that we would have to somehow **come up with private funding for a project that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.** Against all odds, and thanks to Isle of Capri Casinos, we did that. We brought the Isle of Capri to the table with an offer to **privately fund construction of a $290 million arena** as part of a $1 billion-plus development plan in the Lower Hill.

Note that the word ""fans"" does not appear anywhere in the text of the press statement, because fan support had nothing to do with the Penguins' troubles. Other NHL teams in markets with less than 3,000,000 population have had similar fluctuations in attendance based on the performance of the team (Blues, Predators, Avalanche, etc.), but those teams weathered those downturns with no problem, because they never cut themselves off from vital arena revenue like Howard Baldwin did when he bought the Penguins.

Super Bowl XXXVI: Rams versus Steelers or Raiders  
(The Steelers had the better defense, but the Raiders had the better QB. Regardless, I don't see either of these teams beating the ""Greatest Show on Turf."")

Super Bowl XXXVIII: Panthers versus Colts  
(The Chiefs would have had home-field advantage in the AFC, but their defense was too weak for them to advance to the Super Bowl, and as much of a Jake Delhomme fan as I was, I don't think he would have outdueled Peyton Manning.)

Super Bowl XXXIX: Eagles versus Colts
(I honestly don't think the Steelers would have advanced, because Ben Roethlisberger hit the rookie wall in the post-season. Peyton Manning was a better QB than Donovan McNabb, but the Eagles had a much better defense than the Colts, so I think the Eagles would have pulled it off.)

Super Bowl XLI: Bears versus Chargers
(The Chargers were stacked, and they had the Colts' number in the post-season, so the Super Bowl was theirs, especially against a Rex Grossman-QBed Bears team.)

Super Bowl XLII: Giants versus Chargers
(Eli Manning versus Philip Rivers would have been interesting, and the teams themselves seem evenly matched. I still think the Giants would have won, especially with Rivers' gimpy knee.)

Super Bowl XLVI: Giants versus Ravens
(The Ravens were a scary team that season. I don't see how the Giants could have beaten them.)

Super Bowl XLIX: Seahawks versus Colts or Ravens
(Neither one of these teams would have a chance against the ""Legion of Boom."")

Super Bowl LI: Falcons versus Steelers
(As hot as the Falcons offense was that season, I don't see how a team with a starting secondary of William Gay, Ross Cockrell, Sean Davis and Mike Mitchell was going to stop them.)

Super Bowl LII: Eagles versus Jaguars
(The Steelers lost a lot of run-stopping ability when Ryan Shazier was injured, so they'd still be vulnerable to the Jaguars, just a round later. The Eagles would have made quick work of the Jaguars, though.)

Super Bowl LIII: Rams versus Chiefs
(As great as Patrick Mahomes played that season, the Rams were still a more complete team, so I think they would have won.)

Super Bowl LV: Chiefs versus Packers
(This is tough to call, but my gut tells me that the Chiefs would have won two in a row.)

Of course. Why do you think I mentioned that one of them was lucky enough to have Kyle Shanahan calling plays for him, while the best the other one could get was Todd Haley? In fact, there are other variables too, such as the quality of the divisions each QB played in. For example, the AFC North has sent more teams to the playoffs than any other division in the NFL since the division realignment in 2002, and has had some of the toughest defenses in the NFL too, even factoring out the Steelers defense. Playing QB in the AFC North is tough.

Furthermore, every team in the AFC North plays outdoors, and often in poor weather conditions late in the season. Something tells me Matt Ryan wouldn't look as pretty if he was getting his brains bashed in by the Ravens defense behind a bad offensive line on a muddy field in the cold rain. Conversely, I'm pretty sure Ben Roethlisberger would look prettier if he got to throw to Roddy White, Julio Jones and Tony Gonzalez inside a climate-controlled dome against a bunch of mediocre-to-bad NFC South defenses during the early part of his career.

It should also be noted that Matt Ryan had [consistently more offensive support](https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/peyton-manning-had-the-best-offensive-teammates-among-top-quarterbacks-in-2000-s-donovan-mcnabb-had-the-worst-01dxesjm101k) from 2008-2013 than Ben Roethlisberger did from 2004-2013.

The starting offensive linemen for the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII were, from left to right, Max Starks, Chris Kemoeatu, Justin Hartwig, Darnell Stapleton, and Willie Colon. The three interior offensive linemen all ended up out of the NFL involuntarily by the start of the 2012 league year, and then, in 2013, when Max Starks tried out for the Chargers, he didn't even make their final roster, much less win the starting LT job.

It's also worth noting that the Steelers had the most penalized offensive line in the NFL in 2010, and two of their three turnovers in Super Bowl XLV were the direct result of poor blocking.

As for the running game, here's how the Steelers ranked from 2008-2013...

---|---|---|---|
December 18, 1982 | ""Maneater"" - Daryl Hall & John Oates | 4 weeks | Included the first two weeks of 1983 | 
January 15, 1983 | ""Down Under"" - Men At Work | 4 weeks | Three consecutive weeks and a fourth non-consecutive week | 
February 5, 1983 | ""Africa"" - Toto | 1 week |  |

May 28, 1983 | ""Flashdance...What A Feeling"" - Irene Cara | 6 weeks |  | 
July 9, 1983 | ""Every Breath You Take"" - The Police | 8 weeks | The #1 song of 1983 | 
September 3, 1983 | ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)"" - Eurythmics | 1 week |  |

November 12, 1983 | ""All Night Long (All Night)"" - Lionel Richie | 4 weeks |  | 
December 10, 1983 | ""Say Say Say"" - Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson | 6 weeks | Included the first two weeks of 1984; the #1 song of 1984 | 

Note that Billboard ""chart years"" run from December-November, which is how ""Say Say Say"" ended up being the #1 song of 1984 even though four of its six weeks at #1 occurred in December 1983.

Also note that some songs with short durations at #1 spent several weeks at #2, waiting for a long-duration #1 above it to fall. ""Let's Dance"" climbed to #2 when ""Beat It"" was in its final week at #1, then spent a week at #1 before getting pushed back down to #2 for three more weeks by ""Flashdance...What A Feeling."" ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)"" spent four weeks at #2 behind ""Every Breath You Take,"" then spent a week at #1 before getting pushed back down to #2 for another week by ""Maniac.""

Some big hits never made it to #1 because of the dominance at the top. ""Electric Avenue"" by Eddy Grant climbed to #2 when ""Flashdance...What A Feeling"" was in its final week at #1, but got stuck at #2 for five weeks when ""Every Breath You Take"" jumped from #3 to #1. ""Shame On The Moon"" by Bob Seger climbed to #2 when ""Baby, Come To Me"" was in its final week at #1, but got stuck at #2 for four weeks when ""Billie Jean"" jumped from #4 to #1. ""The Girl Is Mine"" by Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson climbed to #2 when ""Maneater"" was in its final week at #1, but got stuck at #2 for three weeks when ""Down Under"" jumped from #4 to #1. ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"" by Culture Club spent three weeks at #2 behind ""Billie Jean."" ""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All"" by Air Supply spent three weeks at #2 behind ""Total Eclipse Of The Heart.""

Other big hits got stuck at #3. ""Uptown Girl"" by Billy Joel spent five weeks at #3 behind ""All Night Long (All Night)"" and ""Say Say Say."" ""Hungry Like The Wolf"" by Duran Duran spent three weeks at #3 behind ""Billie Jean"" and ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me."" ""She Works Hard For The Money"" by Donna Summer spent three weeks at #3 behind ""Every Breath You Take"" and ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)."" ""Union Of The Snake"" by Duran Duran spent three weeks at #3 behind ""Say Say Say"" and ""Say It Isn't So.""

Alualu was not a decent run stopper in 2019 and 2020. He was one of the best. Look at the Steelers defense YPC allowed with and without him during those years.

When he was healthy in 2020, the Steelers only allowed 3.8 YPC on each run play which was the third best run defense in the league. 

When he got hurt in 2021, coincidentally the Steelers run defense was ranked 31st, giving up 4.8 YPC. 

That doesn't scream ""decent run stopper"" to me. 

> DL that don't get 10+ sacks literally don't exist

Well I literally gave you an example of one, so try to get in reality. The Steelers chose to keep Tuitt and it paid off. He had 45 tackles, 11 sacks, and 25 QB hits. Which for a defensive end is a very solid stat line. In 2020 did anyone predict Tuitt would lose his brother, get injured and retire? 

So with these three as your starters, and Javon Hargrave only getting around 45% of defebsive snaps when the other three were healthy, how the hell do you justify paying him a starting deal when he doesn't even play half the snaps on defense?

There's not a chance in the world that if he and Tomlin disagreed on whether or not Matt Canada should be retained that Tomlin would get his way.

He didn't get his way with Bruce Arians right after they won a Super Bowl. He's not getting his way now.

The officials didn't have anything to do with that. Burrow failed to even get 3 points on the most important drive of the game.

>Every Steelers fan loves Hines ward, James Harrison, Joey porter.

I don't. Hines was a whiner and a bad teammate. But he wasn't a dirty player. His hit on Keith Rivers was clean and legal at the time. He wasn't trying to hurt Rivers. 

Harrison sucks as a person too. But he wasn't trying to hurt people either. The two hits in the Browns game that lead to the rules changes were both 100% legal and clean. In fact, both hits would have been hard hits to the chest if the opposing players were standing still. Is Harrison supposed to stop in mid-air to avoid contacting a player whose momentum is taking his helmet into a direct path with his own?

Your listing of Joey Porter proves that you're insincere and simply naming players you don't like. Porter wasn't a dirty player nor was he ever accused of being one. He was a mouthy asshole on the field and he once tried to fight the entire Ravens team on their bus, but he wasn't a dirty player.

Kimo was a clean player too, by the way. You can literally see how upset he was that he hurt Carson Palmer immediately after he realizes what happened.

The guy finished 6th in sacks and tied for 1st in forced fumbles. That’s really good. But I know many of you remember the lack of production the defensive line had once TJ was out. That was obviously expected, but what it demonstrates is Highsmith is a wonderful #2, but a quiet #1. You need a #2 on the team, there is nothing wrong with that. You also can’t afford to overpay a #2. I saw some on here calling for him to get defensive player of the year. Not even close.

There are three CB’s I’d be delighted for us to draft at 17 (Porter Jr, Witherspoon, Gonzalez) and three or four more we can consider at 32/49 (Ringo, Phillips III, Banks, Forbes) 

ILB there’s no one in the draft worthy of 17 imo- and there’s a handful of interesting prospects who should be available later.

DT I touched on a little in a previous comment- we either trade up for Bresee or it’s tough to see value at 17 at that position. 

All of this is to say that I think there is a strong chance that we are faced with a situation at 17 where there may be a talent “too good to pass up” at a position of less urgent need like WR or EDGE, in part because of how the rest of the talent in the draft shakes out and we have an extra pick so we shouldn’t be under any pressure to reach to fill a hole.",3.0,steelers,t3_10iua6z,False,0.0,None,2023-01-23T06:54:51Z,steelers,0.2996796875

In an ideal world a blue chip player is there at 17 in a position of urgent need (ILB, LT, CB, DT) However we do have an extra pick thanks to the Claypool trade so there’s no need to reach (especially for NT and ILB) we can play the board and take the best players available to us at positions of relative need.",0.0,steelers,t3_10iua6z,False,0.0,None,2023-01-23T04:14:43Z,steelers,0.2076882239999999

* Blake Freeland is massive at 6'8. Could be a solid choice to help out up front.

There are so many wild factors that influence a season nowadays it's difficult to have that ""perfect"" run or be dominant.

1. Random injuries that can devastate teams and ruin any chance of winning.
2. Years where a team does amazing in the regular season and not in the playoffs - Steelers 2017-18 (13-3) and 2020-2021 (12-4).
3.

His seemingly top status is being heavily propped up by some of the best WRs in the game. Give me Marv, Dalton, AJ Green, with the rest of this roster, and we beat the Rams and would be fighting for another against Philly this very weekend. No question.

We are gonna spend everything for a QB who drives golf carts and sits out when his tummy hurts. We are gonna mortgage our future for a QB who turns the ball over 5 times versus the Pittsburgh Stillerz. We are gonna put ourselves in ruin for a QB who spends more time picking out his clothes and planning his post game tweets than he does actually prepping.

I’m scared guys. Our city is in trouble. The mayor talks more shit than a poop plant. Our owners are blinded by Burrow, not much unlike a 5 year old that stares at the sun for minutes straight. We won’t be able to afford the system for our quarterback that has taken him to where he is.

Enough doom and gloom! I’m an optimist. To answer your question my fellow Redditor, I think Carr and Winston would be good targets as QBs. They can take us to the next level with their leadership and plus-level arm AND will put us at a price point to be able to spend and potentially earn more draft capital to chase another ring. I’d also demote Taylor and bring back Marv. Marv will bring back discipline and honor to a franchise that can’t find its way. I want physicality back on defense!

My main issue is that Canada was bad with Ben, bad with Mitch, and bad with KP. And it’s not like any of those three were consistently missing open guys. Every analyst that has studied the Steelers has said it’s a very vanilla predictable scheme with limited routes and concepts. And any fan can see the same. 

Now, maybe part of that is an organizational thing…but that shouldn’t prohibit running well designed plays that free guys up. Heck, the Steelers defense was great this year but they still give up a few wide open looks each game. The Steelers offense generates almost no easy open looks and that’s on the scheme. 

The last point is one I raised earlier - the entire offense was healthy for every game (minus KP for one). That is insanely lucky. Yet they managed only 12 passing TDs and only 4 to WRs over 17 games.

I AM a Tomlin guy, but I'll admit after the past few years I've started to wonder if a re-boot wouldn't be best for the franchise..

But I always thought, if not him, then who? And never really came up with a great answer. Sean Payton would've intrigued me somewhat but I always thought; look around the league. Look how many just awful coaches there are. It could be *so* much worse.

This year when the Ravens lost I started seeing people ripping Harbaugh pretty badly too. Started talking about his lack of playoff wins recently. It was sort of eye opening..

What coach lasts 15+ years and DOESNT have lulls like we've seen with Tomlin? It's happening to Harbaugh, Carroll, Belichick right now too. McDemott might be on his way. Andy Reid looked pretty pedestrian with Alex Smith. Bill Cowher went through it. Honestly, Tomlin's non-losing streak is part of what's held him back. It's harder to rebuild when you're riding the middle every year. Zac Taylor gets a lot of credit, and kudos to him for picking the right guys but I think if you gave most coaches Joe Burrow and Jamar Chase in back to back drafts they'd fare pretty well.
