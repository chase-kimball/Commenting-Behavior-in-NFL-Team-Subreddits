780,5744,5744,32BitWhore,"Ranked choice voting means you are significantly less likely to have an extremely vocal minority win. Imagine you have 100 voters. You have 41 that believe really strongly in one guy, candidate A, but everybody else hates him. You have 39 that believe really strongly in another candidate, and 20 who would prefer candidate C, but would much rather candidate B over candidate A. In a vote with the old system (majority 1st place votes), votes would be: 41 for A, 39 for B, and 20 for C, so A wins even though the majority (59/100) of the voters hate him. In a ranked choice vote, the votes would be, A: 41 1st place votes, 0 2nd, 59 3rd; B: 39 1st place votes, 20 2nd, 41 3rd. C is irrelevant because his 1st place votes are a huge minority.

Wentz was regressing and wasn't willing to be coached. Poor drafting by Howie and other FO decisions trying to prolong the SB window had backfired. 
Laurie had gotten a bit too hands-on by the end where He would critique the game in a weekly meeting with Howie and Doug.

 The main tipping point at the end was the clusterfuck that was the coaching staff since most of Doug's circle was Andy Reid's tree (most of the SB year coaches were from Chip Kelly's time or who were brought on by Howie/Jeff). Initially, Pederson was going to return but in the exit interview, He wanted to promote from within but with how stagnant the offense had become Jeff vetoed it once and asked him come back with other choices.

[Right after the 2020 Draft](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/eagles/2020-nfl-draft-jalen-hurts-russell-wilson-howie-roseman):

> ""In 2012, we had a vision,” Roseman said. “We had a vision that we would draft a quarterback who’s been extremely successful, and I don’t want tampering charges on me but I think we can understand who that was, and then come back in the fourth round and draft a quarterback who won a world championship for us and go back-to-back. And I feel like we got a little cute. And I don’t know that there’s a big difference between taking the 53rd pick in the draft and taking a pick in the third round if you feel strongly about a guy.""

> When Roseman talks about getting cute back in 2012, this is what he means: The Eagles thought Russell Wilson was going to be there with the 88th overall pick.

Arrived nearly 30 minutes late to the deposition.

Acted “belligerent and pugnacious, refusing to answer the most routine of questions, despite there being no objection to the questioning coming from his counsel.

“[C]hanted, over and over, as if a mantra, a narrative of his own warped concept of the proceeding.”

“Acting as if he was above the rule of law, [Brown] proceeded to make a mockery of the deposition process. [Brown’s] antics were so unreasonable that barely twenty [20] minutes into the deposition, his counsel asked for a break [so] he could speak with [Brown] about his demeanor.”

“When the deposition resumed, [Brown] began texting on his cell phone. Regardless of multiple requests from his own counsel, and from the undersigned, [Brown] continued texting.”

""After approximately 20-30 minutes, [Brown] required another break. When the deposition resumed [Brown] increased his level of obstructive behavior. At one point, [Brown] refused to answer any questions, instead saying ‘next question’ no less than 10 times.”

“Soon thereafter, [Brown] started announcing a countdown, starting at ‘five [5] minutes,’ and counting down the minutes thereafter. Before noon [Brown] left the conference room.”",11.0,nfl,t3_10u2oy7,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-02-05T05:39:52Z,eagles,-0.0049941503846

5177,46738,46738,Domestic_AA_Battery,"The good news is that Hurts was 2nd in the MVP. So **arguably** we have the second best QB this year. So despite QB being the most important position and Mahomes being the best in the NFL, we can be competitive in that area still with Hurts. Their major issues will be CB. That's where the Eagles really distinguish themselves. That and the overall D-line.

If Defense really does win championships, we should win. IIRC, this is the third time the best Offense has met the best Defense in the Super Bowl. And best Defense is 2-0 in those games.

Statistically, we should win. We have the better D. We have the better talent across the board (like this post says). Their WRs (while rested) are banged up. Their QB is more recently banged up.

The biggest concern is coaching and experience imo. Reid is very very experienced. Mahomes has been to two Super Bowls already. Travis Kelce has been there with him too. They may have issues with their WRs being ill experienced but Kelce will be his security blanket. And Reid probably has thought about that. Expect Kelce to be targeted a lot. And Gannon's job has to be eliminating that security.

The Chiefs are human though. They almost lost to the Broncos. Lost to the Colts. I think they struggled with the Raiders too. Bottom tier teams and they had problems. We lost once to Washington with Hurts, and that was due to freak turnovers.

We have a good shot of winning. I'm just concerned nerves will get to our guys. And we can't afford to be sloppy to start.",3.0,eagles,t3_10zw86q,False,0.0,Santa isn't real ,2023-02-11T19:57:42Z,eagles,-8.760640313553148e-05

Granted, it does suck to get cheated on and it does suck to have your partner not be stoked to do something on your birthday and it does suck to experience drifting away in a relationship.

But what I’m also picking up in what you’ve shared is a resentment on your part that’s built over a while. I’m also picking up blaming her for your unhappiness. In a situation like you’re in, it’s tough not to fall into victimhood, but I’m reading you blaming her for your actions (or inaction in this case).

If getting ramen on your bday was important, go and get ramen. If she doesn’t want to go, that’s not stopping you from enjoying your own company and a meal you know you like. But to then sit at home and complain about missing out because of her, when it’s you who chose to stay home isn’t healthy imo.

The ramen meal is also a fair metaphor for the relationship. It may not be easy, but it is simple: if you are unhappy in the relationship, you can make the decision to leave or stay. But it’s selfish to blame your partner for your decision.

It takes two to make a relationship work, but your emotional well-being is your responsibility.",2.0,nfl,t3_10zpjof,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-02-11T20:17:32Z,eagles,0.0128843514376069

7624,70681,70681,IFoundHimInTheSea,"I’m down with this take and you’re totally on point. I’m attributing it to social media culture.

Anecdotally, concerts have changed a lot in similar fashion. Take a big festival like Coachella. Before Insta became as big as it is, that fest used to have a wide breadth of different genres represented and usually some big legacy rock acts and reunions. With the rise of influencer culture, the fest’s music became more homogenized to mirror Tik Tok hits and it became a fest to be seen at and go celeb spotting. I’m sure it’s still fun if you’re into the lineup, but it’s way more streamlined than it used to be.

Similar deal with the movie industry and larger chain theaters. They’re trying to make stuff that appeals to eeeeveryone in order to make more dough, but in turn it gets watered down and your handful of local theaters are now just all showing the same few movies with a zillion showing times for each. Hell, look how much of a film gets spoiled in trailers compared to a decade or two ago. Or the teaser of a teaser trailer.

Thankfully indie filmmaking and music are still as good as they’ve ever been, but it’s wild to me seeing how unabashedly cookie-cutter the mainstream stuff is.

The SB ads used to be more clever and better written, but now it’s just strings of cameos essentially pulling the *Idocricy* bit of, “Fuck you, buy this!” No, I don’t think I will.",1.0,nfl,t3_10zpjof,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-02-11T13:33:54Z,eagles,0.0442714818107084

7631,70732,70732,IFoundHimInTheSea,"I played defensive line in high school. Junior year, I went out for the season due to a spiral fracture in my leg as a result of making a tackle that required surgery to put in a plate and screws. That entire experience sucked from start to finish and still gives me trouble almost twenty years later. I heard the break when it happened which messed with me mentally. Required a bunch of physical therapy at the time. I still have to stretch it daily until it cracks multiple times (not severe crack, but like a knuckle/neck/back crack) so I can get full range of motion. It noticeably tightens up during colder weather.

Then Senior year I was excited to come back aaand then went out for the season again due to an MCL tear. My knee still acts up here and there, but not nearly as much as my leg. That one actually happened at practice and I recall my teammates giving me shit for being soft bc it wasn’t a big hit or anything..just the oline dude catching my knee coincidentally at the exact wrong spot. But as soon as I got up, I knew there was something serious, could barely hobble off the field. 

I don’t regret playing because it was an incredible experience and nothing beat the feeling of putting an opponent on their back. Fwiw I’m also trans, so football, especially defense, was a really great outlet for relieving some of the weight of my depression/anxiety/gender dysphoria. I could just get lost in the moment while on that line.

I just wasn’t really expecting to have to deal with the results of an injury on the daily for the rest of my life. And that knowing… Like, knowing that I’m still young, but still going to be dealing with this through old age… Yeah it does fuck with me mentally.

This ain't one body's story. It's the story of us all. We got it mouth-to-mouth. You got to listen it and 'member. 'Cause what you hears today you got to tell the birthed tomorrow.              

I'm looking behind us now. . .              

. . .across the count of time. . .               

. . .down the long haul,

into history back.            

I sees the end what were the start. It's seasons with no post seasons, full of pain! And out of it were birthed crackling dust and fearsome time. It were full-on winter. . .  and Mr. Tomba-Raydee chasing them all.               

But one he couldn't catch. That were Jordan Mailata.               

He gathers up a gang of Eagles, takes to the air, and flies to the sky!               

So they left their homes, said bidey-bye to the high-scrapers and cheesy stakes. . .               

. . .and what were left of the knowing, they left behind.               

Some say the wind just stoppered.               

Others reckon it were a gang called Chiefs.               

And after the game, some had been jumped by Mr. Mahomes, but some had got the luck, and it leads them here.               

One look and they's got the hots for it.

They word it “Super Bowl Fifty Sevens.” And they says, ""We don't need the pundit nay-sayings. We can live here. ""                           

Time counts and keeps counting.               

They gets takings to the end zones what they had.               

They get so lonely for the high-scrapers and the cheesy stakes.             

And they does the pictures so they'd 'member all the knowing that they lost.               

'Member this?               

SECOND PHILLY SPECIAL!             

'Member this?               

ON THE ROAD TO VICTORY!            

'Member this?               

NICK SIRIANNI!             

'Member this?

'Member this?               

MRS JORDAN MAILATA!               

Then Sirianni picked them of an age and good for a long haul.               

They counted eleven at a time, and that were them. The great First Downing Ten.                            

They said bidey-bye to them what they'd birthed. And from the regular season they looked back. . .               

. . .and Jordan Mailata hollered,

""Wait, mate, one of us will come. ""               

""Wait, mate, one of us will come. ""

Don't ask me how I'm dealing with this Super Bowl. I've been at times conflicted. But eventually landed on the fact I've had to abandon the Chiefs Kingdom cause I'm raising my kids to be Eagles fans since we live near Philly. But I digress...

Honestly, Philly and KC are very similar. Both cities had a very rough 1970s and 1980s financially. In terms of sports the last 40 years have only brought a few championships across the cities' major sports.  Meanwhile, having to watch the neighboring teams have success over and over in that time frame has led the fan base to become insanely entrenched.  I'll be honest, Arrowhead is loud as hell. BUT Eagles fans take fandom to a place it was never intended to go and it's beautiful. Eagles fandom is like watching Picasso paint a masterpiece with children's watercolors.  Just ask Joey Bosa.  

So if there needs to be any reason for two blue collar cities, with similar pedigrees, have some level of respect for each other in the Super Bowl, then let it be for these reasons.

Here is my take : even if we were equally skilled in every position the QB vs QB comparaison is the huge tie breaker.

Sorry for Purdy but he is still a green QB that has literally only played 2 away games in the west coast. Both tight games against two poor Seahawks and Raiders teams.

Just show Ndamukong Suh the fine print in his contract. The one about a SB bonus and ask him to show Purdy around Sackville.

We won that game by getting to both of your QBs. That is what we did. It's what we did all year. We had 70 sacks; the Chiefs were second with 55. We had the 3rd most all time and the most since the turn of the century (66 is second most).

Second of all, we didn't need to pass you dumb dumb. Why would we risk throwing the ball when the game was effectively over with 7 minutes left in the first quarter? We only passed 25 times. We rushed 44 times. If you can do math, which I suspect you can't, that's 63.8% rush. Conversely, the 49ers with their injuries to the QBs, rushed 57.1% of the time.

It's amazing morons like you can't acknowledge that we knocked their QB out because our DL was very good. We had 70 sacks this season; the Chiefs were second and had 55. The team's previous record was 62. 70 sacks is the third most in NFL history and only the 2006 San Diego Chargers, with 61.0, and the 2000 New Orleans Saints, with 66, have had more than 60 sacks in a season since the turn of the century. There is a reason we ended the season for not one but two 49er QBs.

We went 7-1 against postseason teams. 10-2 against teams .500 or better. 

Coming off the Vikings win, everyone was saying how Daboll was the COTY and Jones had turned into a good QB. Then we ass blasted them and we got ""lucky"".

Shanahan is also in the COTY running. This fantastic scheme he has put together led him to put a TE against our Pro Bowl DE coming off a great year that led to their QB getting hurt.

His goal is to not only get after the QB, but to move them off their spot to a weaker position.

*""understanding of a situation or event only after it has happened or developed.""*

The Eagles in 2018 were on a hot streak but the Bears were 12-4 and had dominated the Rams on SNF a few weeks before. The Eagles running back corps consisted of Josh Adams and Wendell Smallwood. The Eagles were literally 9-7 the following season of the Super Bowl. The Eagles in 2018 against the Bears for that playoff game were a 6.5 UNDERDOG according to literally everyone in the media at the time of the game. Also, the Bears were a literal double doink away from winning the game.

>There’s no hindsight. The Eagles were so much better. The Vikings fluked a win and then had to play a team that was better than them at every level.

There is hindsight unless you can show me 5 years ago you said ""Keenum is not good and the Eagles should not be underdogs""

Other than that, everything you're saying goes against what the narratives were in January of 2018. The Eagles were literally anointed as the biggest 1st seed underdogs.

13893,117671,117671,No_Arm_6781,">but that the team had obviously moved on from Wentz before even started 

I disagree, they had signed him to an extension the year before and he was still playing at a top 10-15 QB to that point. It’s moreso about how the Eagles value the QB position. The organization’s philosophy is essentially that if you don’t have a Mahomes/Burrow/Allen, you should be constantly investing in QB since getting a good one on a rookie contract is astronomically more valuable than any other asset in the sport. It’s why they traded a solid QB in Bradford to go up for Wentz, and it’s why they drafted Hurts, who they liked as a prospect and wasn’t going to let having a good-not-great QB keep them from getting.

So many NFL teams fall into the trap of thinking they no longer have to invest in QB once they have a top 15 guy. But once you have to pay that guy, it’s no longer a particularly valuable asset, and it’s probably a good idea to start taking swings at rookies. But teams are afraid to get it wrong and look “bad” if they move on from their average QB too early. But as Roseman says, he’d rather take a smart risk and be wrong than end up stuck in the middle like most of the league.",1.0,nfl,t3_10ysz3l,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-02-10T09:00:27Z,eagles,-0.053401732635498

14370,121498,121498,NotLordVader,"Very torn.

Our defense helped contribute to a 16-4 record this year.  Nearly an all-time sack record.  Interceptions were plentiful.  We were truly dominant.  I can't ignore the success the team had with big years from Slay, CJGJ, Sweat and, of course, Reddick.

On the other hand, that performance yesterday was just *abysmal*.  He got outcoached.  Badly.   
 I don't know if the shitty turf neutralized our defense and made it ordinary and beatable or it was all his scheme.  Either way, the L was on the defense and he was the one calling the shots.

I think the fans are going to have a very hard time trusting him again.  If Nick trusts him and he can learn from this, I'll give him another chance too.  But I think he's padded his stats against the likes of the bad QBs in the league and when against elite opposition, the story isn't a positive one.",1.0,eagles,t3_111s2zg,False,0.0,The Wolverine - Brian Dawkins,2023-02-13T22:38:48Z,eagles,-0.0475966958986699
14371,121499,121499,NotLordVader,"No, the holding call wasn't helpful.  Eagles could have had a shot to tie the game up with 1:40 to go and a TO.  Would have been cool to see if Jalen could have pulled it out.

But that's not why the Eagles.  They lost because the defense couldn't get a single bloody stop in the 2nd half. 

3 TDs, 1 FG, 0 punts.

I'm really not sure why Gannon didn't put more pressure on a QB with a bad ankle, but alas.

The turf condition, btw, was a joke.  *Shame* on the NFL for rolling that shit out on Super Bowl Sunday.  It affected both teams, but KC seemed to have a sense of it beforehand and didn't seem to need to change their cleats midgame like the Eagles did.  And, feel free to disagree, but I feel like the turf could have impacted Philly more as their defense was more considered to be the better unit (Gannon's play calling aside).

Nevertheless, props to KC for gutting out a win.

14372,121500,121500,NotLordVader,"Tough loss for sure.  

What sucks is that this was sooooo close.  If we make literally one stop in the 2nd half or even reduce a TD to FG we probably win.  

The Hurts fumble and botched punt return were unfortunate, but just single bad plays.  Our defense, however, was toothless the entire 2nd half.  Literally one stop and we very likely win.

Yeah, the holding penalty sucked.  It was accurate but given that zero defensive holding was called prior to that, and the players adapt their play to how the game is being called, and of course it effectively gave the Chiefs the game, it was very questionable.  BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE LOST.  We lost because our defense couldn't get the job done.

35-35 tie with 4 minutes left and we let them get into FG range and run out the clock.  Two walk-in touchdowns.  Zero pressure on Mahomes.

I'm not AS devastated as I was in 2004 because we were still winless then.  We have a championship now which is a huge plus and takes some of the sting away.

But, it still hurts because this championship was here for the taking.  We had a win just 30 minutes away.  We were leading by 10 at the half.  We just needed a liiiittttle defense and didn't get it.  Sucks but that's the way it goes.

14373,121501,121501,NotLordVader,"It was a foul.  Even Bradberry said he tugged the jersey.

It also didn't need to be called because no defensive PI calls were made previously and the light tug didn't affect the play was the ball was uncatchable.  Not to mention that the call effectively decided the game, robbing the Eagles (and the fans) the chance of an exciting finish.  Down 3 with 1:45 to go and a timeout, the Eagles could have very easily forced OT or maybe won.  Down 3 with :08, bit different story.

All that said, Philly's defense played poorly for much of the game.  Zero sacks.

14889,126654,126654,One_Hall_8290,"I just want to vent for a minute.

My girlfriend hasn't been treating me very well lately.  It's my birthday today, and I told her in advance that she didn't have to buy me anything because I really wanted the following two things:

1. Her to have sex with me (we haven't had sex since November, and one of my new year's resolutions was to stop masturbating, so I haven't had an orgasm since December 31, and I'm so horny it's driving me crazy).

2. Us to go out to eat ramen (one of my favorite foods).

So far #1 has not happened, and I highly doubt that it's going to because she's made no mention of it (I specifically asked her to initiate because I've gotten so discouraged by trying to initiate and constantly getting shot down that I don't even want to try anymore).

I asked her about #2, and she just kept saying that she doesn't want to go but will do it if I really want to.  I tried explaining to her that it takes the fun out of it if I feel like I'm forcing her to go to the restaurant and she's just going to be miserable the entire time, but she refused to get up and genuinely say, ""Okay let's go.""  She's now taking a nap, and they close in less than three hours.

I'm sick and tired of being in a completely sexless relationship when I'm still young (in my 30s).  Honestly at this point I feel like I'd be justified to cheat on her because if she is making literally zero attempt to satisfy my needs, then she shouldn't get upset if I take care of them elsewhere.  She actually had the nerve to get pissy when she saw me looking at another woman in public the other day.  So hypocritical.  It's like, ""Bitch, I want **you**, but you won't let me have that.""  Having sex with another woman isn't a realistic option though because we live together, so I can't spend the night somewhere else (or even be gone for an extended period of time without a valid excuse) without her knowing.

So yeah, my birthday is going to consist of making myself some bison and a salad at home and then trying to resist the urge to masturbate.  Hooray.

I'm sure a lot of people are going to ask why I'm still with her, and the answer is: 1) I do love her, and I didn't talk about any of her positive qualities in this post, and 2) I don't think I can get any better, and I **strongly** disagree with the conventional wisdom that it's better to be alone than in a mediocre relationship (based on personal experience).

This Super Bowl is kind of a ""perfect storm"" for me and my girlfriend for the following reasons:

- The Eagles are playing and are probably going to win.

- The game is in Glendale.  We live in Los Angeles and could easily drive to the stadium (saving money on a flight).  We could potentially even wake up early that morning and drive instead of spending the night (saving money on a hotel).

- We're actively packing to move back to Pennsylvania later this month, so we wouldn't have to take time off work.

All things considered, this feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity.  There's no guarantee the Eagles will get back to the Super Bowl any time soon (let alone as the favorites), and even if they do, we'll be living in the northeast where we'd have to fly to the game.

So we're thinking about going.  The only problem is that we don't have the money, but we've talked it over and are considering just putting it on a credit card since it's such a unique situation.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel uncomfortable about being so financially irresponsible, but it's going to be so deflating if they win and we're stuck watching at home six hours away.

My question, particularly for people who've actually purchased Super Bowl tickets, is what is the best way to get the absolute cheapest tickets (without getting scammed by fakes)?  We don't mind if we're all the way in the top back row behind one of the endzones; we just want to get into the stadium and have two seats somewhere.

Where would you guys suggest buying the tickets?  Ticketmaster is the ""obvious"" choice, but we all know the fees are ridiculous.  Then there are a bunch of random sites that advertise having no additional fees.  And there's always the option of just falling back on eBay.

Also, when would you guys suggest buying the tickets?  I assume later is better since the sellers will drop the prices the closer we get to the game.  I could definitely wait until Saturday to make the purchase, and honestly I even thought about driving to Glendale Sunday morning and trying to purchase the tickets on my phone that afternoon (just a few hours before kickoff) to get the absolute best price.

If you guys ever get the opportunity to take a young woman's virginity, I highly recommend it.

When I was 25, I met this sexy 18-year-old girl at work. She had the trifecta of fire red hair, electric blue eyes, and beautiful pale skin, plus a pretty face and a gorgeous, very slightly chubby body (which was a plus for me because I'm not really into thin/fit women). I couldn't stop thinking about her, so I started flirting, and luckily she reciprocated.

A few weeks and a handful of dates later, and I'm balls deep inside her and taking her virginity. She was nice and tight, and it was truly a transcendent experience to watch her plump breasts undulate with every thrust and to hear her gentle moaning as I sunk my fingers into her soft hips while opening up a whole new world of pleasure for her. She also had one of the top two best tasting vaginas I've ever tasted.

Like most good things in life, however, there was a catch. A few days after we had sex, she says to me, ""You know...I thought about it, and I don't think I'd be willing to get an abortion if you got me pregnant."" And I'm like the fuck? She was a horny little thing after her first time and kept asking me to do it again, but I'm vehemently childfree and just couldn't bring myself to do it. She was persistent and eventually started saying, ""I thought about it some more, and I might be willing to go through with an abortion,"" but I knew better than to trust a hormonal 18-year-old, especially when she ""might"" have an abortion. So we stopped seeing each other.

I still think about her sometimes and wonder what she's up to now and who currently has the good fortune of fucking that snug, delicious vagina. I also wonder if my life would have turned out differently if I had continued dating her despite the abortion disagreement. She was actually a really sweet girl, and at one point I did see potential for something longer term. And I have to admit that it took a decent amount of maturity to be open and honest with me about her feelings on abortion despite knowing that it would make me lose interest. But I suppose there's not much benefit to pondering these things now.

Anyway, this is the only time I've ever taken a woman's virginity and the only time I ever had sex with anyone below the age of 20 (I personally lost my virginity when I was 20 to a very experienced 23-year-old woman). But I just wanted to say that if you ever get this opportunity, absolutely go for it. 10/10 experience.

Glad to see someone finally getting upvotes for this accurate take. People have been salty over this, but I'll say it again (and take the downvotes with glee).

Shanahan is a great coach who had a really bad day with some questionable calls. Even if he thought that was a catch, he should still challenge it as it was 4th down AND the Eagles were going hurry up close to the endzone. Best case, you get a turnover on downs and prevent the score entirely. Worst case you can substitute your defense, slow the offense, and hold to a field goal, negating the touchdown. He froze.

As for the blocking, it wasn't just one play. Occasionally you put a weak blocker on a top rusher because you're going the other direction and need your best blockers for where the play is going. That happens. We did it too. But Shanahan had friggin Tyler Croft (3rd string TE) blocking Hassan Reddick (#2 in the NFL in sacks) on the majority of snaps and all passing plays that I could find. This resulted in 2 sacks, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery (different play, so 2 turnovers), an injured quarterback, and contributed to the second injury, in less than 2 complete quarters.

On the Smith ""catch"" he should have thrown the challenge flag. Yes, everyone (even the guy covering Smith) thought it was a catch.

You lose a timeout that should have been used anyway so you could substitute your defense for an effective red zone stand.

Not throwing the challenge flag was a boneheaded call on Shanahan's part.

The second one? Not scheming to block Hassan Reddick. He's an elite edge rusher who was 2nd in the NFL in sacks. And the 49ers repeatedly set their backup TE one-on-one with him. The result? Through one and a half quarters, he had 2 sacks (both knocking out a QB from the game), a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.

Why didn’t he? Let’s be honest - it wasn’t a catch but from every initial angle it appeared to be. So I don’t blame the refs for seeing what everyone else saw. Even the player covering Smith initially thought it was a catch.

Shanahan again. If we had chosen to block Bosa with a backup tight end, Jalen Hurts would have taken some hits. Obviously, our coaches wouldn’t do that. 

Hassan Reddick was #2 in sacks. And for some reason Shanahan thought it was a good idea to block him 1-on-1 with a backup tight end. It didn’t work, and Purdy got hurt.

With the average draft age at 22, these guys don't get their first year of a big contract until age 27. As a result, they want to cash in (current trend is $40M-$50M annually for 5 years). That puts them up to age 32 where Veterans who haven't won a SB suddenly become more agreeable to pay restructures to allow for additional FA help.

The current big contract craze following their rookie deal is a direct response to the lack of a big contract coming out of college. It's an over-correction, essentially.

As an Eagles fan, I look at Jalen Hurts as an example. He was taken in the second round so, luckily for him, no 5th year option. However, his first 4 years with all earned incentives will put him at just shy of $9M earned. And nearly half of that comes in year 4. Through 3 years he's earned $2,576,616 (base salary) + $1,941,944 (signing bonus, paid up front) + $75,000 (workout bonus) = $4,593,560.

That makes him arguably the second best value in the entire NFL (see [Brock Purdy](https://overthecap.com/player/brock-purdy/10307)). He's going to expect a mega deal for years 5-9, most likely.

If the Eagles win the SB this year, Hurts is getting the mega deal to the tune of ~$50M annually. However, if they do not, I suspect that Howie will try to convince him to shave off some of that to allow for more room for free agents to help him. I see a floor of $38M annually, but more likely $44M-$45M annually and HEAVILY backloaded.",2.0,nfl,t3_10nklp6,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-01-28T14:15:01Z,eagles,0.0027361345757095

> It still irks me that every coach since has had flashes of the same ""abandon the run when it's working"" vibes.

Doug would do it occasionally but most of the time he'd settle down. Nick has me worried though. He was forcing the pass last year during our horrendous start, then realized we were a running team and leaned in. We made the playoffs.

During our 8-0 stretch we had a pretty balanced (leaning pass, which is typical and expected) attack. But he's gone pass happy since and we've been hurting for it. Hurts didn't need to get hurt against Chicago, and our first designed run by a halfback was late in the 2nd quarter!

I'm hoping that Nick took this week to realize, ""My QB's throwing shoulder is hurting, we have a road-grader O-line, our RBs are pretty good, and the Giants defense sucks against the run. I think I'll go ball control against the Giants and save the flashy stuff for later.""",6.0,eagles,t3_10dklmg,False,0.0,None,2023-01-16T14:33:09Z,eagles,0.0451486977493257
15412,130672,130672,OverlyOptimisticNerd,"> All these years later, I still can’t believe we lost that one.

I can. It was playoff Andy at his peak. ""Run game's working? Passing game isn't? Aight, ima gonna throw the ball every play!""

We had 49 pass attempts, 2 sacks, and 3 scrambles by Donovan (Andy didn't like designed runs unless it was a sneak or a kneel down). So that's 54 pass plays. We had 18 runs by halfbacks (13 for Staley, 3 for Levens, 2 for a pre-breakout Westbrook).

We had a 75/25 pass/run ratio in a close game where Duce Staley was doing well (4.5 YPC against a tough defense).

And then we did it again the next fucking year. We were better than the Panthers. It was a close game. Donovan gets hurt and we're relying on Koy Detmer. We're going to run the ball, right? RIGHT!? Nope!

Between Donovan and Koy we had 36 pass attempts, 5 sacks, and 2 scrambles (43 pass plays). We had 24 called running plays (13 for Staley, 11 for Buckhalter). That's a 64/36 pass/run ratio. Staley was averaging 6.1 YPC! He was destroying Carolina! Buckhalter wasn't bad either going 11/48.

This is why I have such an irrational hatred for Andy Reid. He would abandon the run game even when it was working and the passing game was not. He would rather lose his way than win any other way. And it's what prevented him from getting over the hump here.

...because on Saturday my kid got hit by a fucking car. My sweet, sensitive 4 year old. He was holding his dad's hand crossing the street, and some old lady ""couldn't see because of the sun glare"" and turned left and FUCKING HIT HIM WITH HER FUCKING CAR.

Amazingly, he is physically OK. He has a tiny fracture, but no broken bones, no concussion and no spinal injuries. 

But that was the worst moment I've ever had as a parent. Like by far.

And today, the responding officer called me and he sounded all awkward. (we live in a small town so he happens to be someone I work with.) and he was like: ""well, the lady that hit him, she feels really badly and has some presents she wants to give him.""

And I'm irrationally angry about it. Like I'm sorry YOU feel badly right now, but I don't really care how you feel or what gesture you want to do to make yourself feel better. YOU were being careless. YOU could have literally killed my kid and frankly, no, I don't want your apology gift.

Besides that, my husband and I are not sure what we're going to do, legally speaking, because the impacts of an injury like this can have long-term ramifications and we may need to sue. We haven't completely decided yet.

I can tell my friend is at her breaking point. She told me last night ""I'm mad at my kid, even though I know she can't help it."" At this point she's considering an alternative school, because she just doesn't feel like her daughter can have success in a mainstream classroom.

NFL is littered with some very sad careers. Wentz played well enough to get 2 teams into the playoffs, and many of us who were big Wentz fans believe that that dirty hit actually did damage his brain to where he no longer could function at the highest level needed to be an NFL QB.

There was a play late in the 2020 season, where the design of the play was absolutely masterful. Play action to the left with a bootleg to the right, and a WR crossing the middle of the field right in front of the QB's face. On the play, the WR, Greg Ward, was more wide open than I have ever seen an NFL WR on a crossing pattern. The defense was completely fooled, it was maybe the easiest read ever.

Wentz stops his feet, then looks completely across the opposite way across the field, throws to a very tightly covered WR, almost gets picked, falls for an incomplete.

Right there I knew he was done. That isn't just someone who can't make a read, or who can't throw the ball, or who has lost a step. That's someone who has completely and totally forgotten how to play football. Most 7 year olds could have made that throw.

I feel for the guy because he was so good as a rookie, and head injuries are just shitty. But that's what it is. Honestly I hope he retires because I am convinced his brain is scrambled and I don't want him or his family to have to suffer through greater amounts of CTE than he already likely has.",2.0,nfl,t3_10ntadv,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-01-29T06:51:47Z,eagles,0.0499440713005414

QB1 inks an unprecedented deal and WIP melts down at Howie because he's a fool and we'll lose all our players. Super Bowl glory is taken for granted by draft day.

Then, all the other QBs coming due sign deals in a more traditional structure and the world laughs at Howie. Jon Richie keeps mumbling, ""Howfrey, Howfrey.""  He's been duct taped to a hand cart next to Joe Decamara's bathtub.  Angelo Cataldi begins tweeting like the Donald Trump of Philly sports from his la-z-boy, threatening his return.

17317,151356,151356,RepresentativeAir735,"For me, a win Sunday achieves what I dreamt of when I was a kid and spent my time drawing Randall Cunningham with crayons.  I wanted him to be our Joe Montana and I wanted our guys to be the ones in the TV booths and on the pregame shows.  I wanted the kids in Dallas to buy kelly green Joyner 59's and wear them to their schools on Monday after we beat their ass. I wanted the one, no doubt about it, no one can say anything cause this team '85 Bears good, team.  The one we could say with no doubt, no asterisk was as badass as any Cowboys or Giants or WFT team.

I became an adult and went to law school and Donovan and crew were on the rise, but January 19, 2003, against the Bucs was the last dance of my remaining innocence.

Players came and went and I cheered,  but I was working 80-hour weeks, cheating on my ex-wife, and becoming an alcoholic. The Phillies had their greatest era and that was rad, but it's still not the Eagles.

By 2017, I was a full-blown,  movie of the week alchie, divorced and remarried and (not really) holding it together with gum and scotch tape.  So, it was magical for me but didn't hit the way it should have.  It didn't hit me the way I thought it would if Roger Mason had pitched another inning or if Ronde hall-of-arfing-fame Barber never split cells from Tiki.

Here, it's 1 AM on Saturday before and the Birds are back in the Super Bowl with their greatest-ever squad. They have the matinee star young QB, the franchise legends, and with one more win are the team that gives me my personal and permanent FU card to any fan of any other team and anyone who says that Philly teams are losers or flukes.  Jalen Hurts is Joe Montana. Jason Kelce is going to have more commercials than Shaq.  Jeff Lurie is the best owner of any sporting club on the face of the planet (write that article in the offseason Roob!).  Howie Roseman's got us. And, the head coach is as geeky about it as we are.  So henceforth, all the Dallas cockroaches can get fuct sideways with a proverbial chainsaw because we will have a team that (no matter what happens ever after) could roll it out with all comers: the Lombardi Packers, Gibbs Hogs, and give them a game.  I will never again have to push up my glasses and have to explain that, if you read the collected works of Ray Didinger, then you would have already known that the '48-'49 Eagles are one of the NFL's early greats.  Nope. Now, I will have it all on tape and can bring it up on my phone.

I'm California-sober and happily married.   Even my dogs like me more.  Enjoying the run this year has made me feel like the kid who mailed Reggie White his Starting Lineup football card with a self-addressed stamped envelope and got it back from the Minister himself inscribed 1 Corinthians 13.  Love is patient, love is kind...I'll tell anyone that reads this goofy post that love is my Higher Power. Young me did not know the wisdom that passage would reveal to me in time.  Yeah, winning Sunday would be amazing and in a whole new way.

That, and we have an actual star QB, and he's everything we've waited for our whole lives.  We've been scribbling his name in our notebooks since before he was born because one day, our football prince would come.

It's weird for us to be feeling such confidence, and we're scared.  Now we have a Super Bowl ring and that monkey is off our backs, but the last time we were this confident it ended it the most awful way(s) possible on Jan 19, 2003, against Tampa Bay.  

In other words, we're riding high,  but beware Icarus, for our Eagle wings have melted before.

Follow your friends' cues.  Everyone has their own style in watching, but we're all super intense.

Pederson the following year didn't want to bring anyone in, so Howie/Lurie hired a bunch of guys who were in there are senior advisors which seemed to clash with Pederson and not work. Then instead of bringing an outside guy Pederson wanted he wanted to go with Press who which is just more internal guys and no outside voice again which is a problem.

19765,178887,178887,TheKingInTheNorth,"I’ll argue it as an Eagles fan coming in peace. The game had 95% slipped away already by that call.  But here goes….

That was a hold in the way that “there’s holding on every play if you inspect all the linemen.”

The bump and tug during the break in the route happens literally any time a receiver breaks back into a DB.

The grip on his jersey after that probably effected his route and speed by like a few inches. The ball was overthrown by ten yards.

You can’t look at all those things as a ref and decide “this is the moment I’m going to literally decide the (currently tied) Super Bowl.” I get they need to call the penalties that they see, but “let them play” is what everyone agrees should be the default stance of a ref in any big moments. Call the penalties that affect the game. Don’t affect the game by calling penalties.

Just such a devastating way for the tie to be broken. The Chiefs may have won anyways without the call, but instead of earning the last little bit of that already colossal comeback… they were handed it.

It doesn’t take away all the things in the comeback that got the game tied. Eagles D was lost out there. It’s a game that would have gone down as one of the greatest SBs in history.

20548,193677,193677,Vladimir_Putting,">but from what I can tell based on my humble reading ability, Eriksen's cardiac arrest was probably caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

I'd really like to know what article you're getting that from. Care to share the source?

>The fact that he wasn't *diagnosed* with a heart condition beforehand doesn't mean it wasn't preexisting, unless you're actually suggesting that he developed it mid-game. As a super fancy heart surgeon, I'm sure you're a lot more knowledgeable on people developing heart conditions during the middle of a sporting event, but I digress.

No. It's possible he had a pre-existing condition. But he was checked yearly by ""super fancy heart doctors"" and they all found nothing. And even after going back and double checked with a fine toothed comb after his cardiac arrest they still found nothing.

Now does multiple of the best cardiac doctors in the world who can't find a shred of evidence of a heart condition mean you 100% don't have one? No.

But you're acting like you have evidence. And, that's obviously false.


>Assuming he did not, in fact, develop a heart condition mid-game, we're left with the conclusion that he had a preexisting heart condition (meaning a heart condition that existed before the game, in case this was unclear) and that this could have caused cardiac arrest at some other point, for instance during another game of football (which footballers have been known to engage in from time to time).

No. We're not left with that conclusion. You can get sudden cardiac arrest from exertion while having a simple common  virus.

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352539

But you saying ""we're left with one conclusion"" must mean you already explored all the other possible options right?

>
>This is vastly different from Damar Hamlin being hit in just the wrong spot at just the wrong hundredth of a second, and even then my point still stands. Damar's injury was, to the extent of our knowledge, directly caused by him getting hit. 

And what doctor told you that?

Did they tell you they were certain there were no other factors?

>Football players get injured from getting hit every week, yet the NFL doesn't stop them from playing after sustaining an injury. When injured players do not play, it's generally because their injury prevents them from playing, not because the league doesn't allow them.

No. When the NFL stops you from playing it's usually because the risk of playing is judged to be greater than the league is willing to bear.

It doesn't mean you can't physically run, jump, tackle.
It means the league doctors have decided that the risk is above whatever threshold is deemed as acceptable by their insurance standards.

This is exactly how the Concussion protocol is drawn up. You aren't allowed to play, even if you are fully physically fit and pass the tests, until the doctors say risks are low enough.
https://www.nfl.com/playerhealthandsafety/health-and-wellness/player-care/concussion-protocol-return-to-participation-protocol

>Each player and each concussion is unique, and there is no set time-frame for return to participation. Team medical staff consider the player's current concussive injury, **as well as past exposures and medical history, family history and future risk in managing a player's care.**

>After a player has progressed through the five-step process, and is cleared for full participation by his club physician, he must be seen and separately cleared by an Independent Neurological Consultant (INC), jointly approved by the NFL and NFLPA, who is not affiliated with any NFL club. **Until cleared by this independent physician, a player may not return to contact practice or play in an NFL game.**


Which if you really understand WHY they do this it makes your original comment plainly stupid:

>there's no reason to think the NFL would ban him from playing any less than they would ban someone who tears their ACL. 

And so...

>Eriksen isn't allowed to play in Italy because of his not-a-pacemaker. He is still evidently fit enough to actually play, seeing as he is actually playing, albeit not in Italy.

That's exactly my point. He's not able to play in Italy simply because they will not entertain the risk. It has nothing to do with if he's able to physically sustain himself during a match. It's about the league not wanting someone to die on the pitch.

Lurie feels the QB position is the most valuable in sports, and therefore he always wants resources devoted to that position. If you have a starter, then you find and/or develop a second one.

This philosophy won us a Superbowl and it's generated massive value on trades and having backups win huge games multiple times.

This goes back to the bedrock economic concept of scarcity. When you identify a high demand extremely limited supply asset you want to aquire it for cheap whenever possible. Those assets don't lose value. The price of a quality QB is always high and they always bring value.

That's how the Eagles operate. Unlike most of the league, they don't see their QB position is ""set"" once they have a franchise guy. They keep trying to find a second starter.

One individual who has worked with Romo to help him prepare for games told The Read Optional that the former QB once turned up to a marquee regular season game with no knowledge of one of the team’s defenses. Thirty minutes before the game, Romo asked for a quick cheat sheet/scouting report on the team’s starters. As soon as the game kicked off, he info dumped what he had cribbed to an unsuspecting viewership. The pretense of homework out of the way, he could kick back and just be good ‘ol Tony. I can’t believe it, Jim!

Manning, on the other hand, dominated Brady in terms of stats and won multiple MVPs before he managed to win a Super Bowl. Manning-Brady was kind of just a proxy for discussing what made someone a better quarterback: Super Bowls or Stats?

But is there legitimately any QB who can match up to Mahomes right now? He's won a Super Bowl and been to two more. He has one (soon to be two) MVP. Three All-Pros. He is *the guy*. Allen has an All-Pro but he's never even *been* to a Super Bowl. Burrow's been to one, but in terms of accolades all he has is one Pro Bowl. Herbert has never even won a playoff game. Who the hell even knows what's going on with Jackson and whether or not he'll be able to return to MVP form. Really the only guys who deserve to be in the same conversation as Mahomes are Brady and Rodgers, but they're both pretty damn old so there's no way that's going to become any sort of rivalry. 

Honestly, the closest QB I'd compare to Mahomes is Hurts. He has an All-Pro, and made it to the Super Bowl, which is far more than guys like Allen, Burrow, Jackson, and Herbert can say.

> Hurts is every aspect of being a qb is better than Wentz

Nowhere have I said he isn't.  I'll say it again... Hurts has done far more with his talent than the other guys did, but a 600lb squat =/= transcendent god given talent, which is what Vick, McNabb, Wentz (though not at the insane heights of Vick or Randall, but few in the history of the sport have been) were all picked top 2 for in their respective drafts, while Hurts was 53rd.",2.0,eagles,t3_10yssim,False,0.0,always open,2023-02-10T12:55:18Z,eagles,0.1773767359999999
26460,245592,245592,devonta_smith,"Hurts is easily the better QB than Vick ever was. But more naturally gifted, not a chance. 

A 600lb squat is insanely impressive but that's not the same as being able to flick your wrist and launch a perfect spiral 75 yards or run a 4.33 40. Wentz, ofc, didn't have the 40 time but the bazooka arm was similar to McNabb (which, while elite for any era of football, is well below that of Randall/Vick but still ahead of Hurts). Counting stats in different eras, with more games in a season, don't change that. Not to downplay what Jalen has done but Vick in the early 2000s was a supernova in a way that few people ever have been, in any sport. All while not giving a fuuuck about football or improving his craft as a QB.

I'm using draft position to illustrate perceived upside, which is heavily influenced by natural ability. Hurts is a top top athlete, better than Wentz at most things... except for pure arm talent and off-platform throws, which is a key reason why there was a 50+ pick discrepancy between where their careers started. The height was another. All in all, Wentz was seen as having the higher ceiling. The most extreme case of height + big arm was Jamarcus Russell. But Kyle Boller, Paxton Lynch etc were all overdrafted in the first round for the same reason. There have been less than a handful of top-5 pick FCS QBs in the modern era - Steve McNair, Wentz, Trey Lance - all 3 were picked that high purely for their absurd arm talent (and the high ceiling inherent in that assessment of 'special' arm talent).


Hurts OTOH was seen at the time as being overdrafted even at pick 53, and was introduced publicly as a budget Taysom Hill (his pro comp was Tim Tebow). If anything, his throwing mechanics early on hurt the way he was perceived, because as we've seen this year, he can sling it. But ""AJ McCarron with wheels"" was the label on him for multiple years before he took the steps we've seen him take. Obviously couldn't be happier he proved everyone wrong, but that doesn't change the facts of how these guys were seen in the beginning of their careers.",0.0,eagles,t3_10yssim,False,0.0,always open,2023-02-10T12:52:19Z,eagles,-0.0249555369267713

26563,245736,245736,devonta_smith,"> Lamar Jackson had a passer rating of 113.3 with 3,127 yards, 36 touchdowns and 6 interceptions in 15 games in 2019.

And Carson Wentz had a passer rating of 101.9 with 3,296 yards, 33 touchdowns and 7 interceptions in 13 games in 2017. 

(Since we're recapping stats from guys who peaked in year 2, numbers that have zero bearing on the current NFL in January 2023... )

Wentz topped the 100 mark (102.2) again the next year after breaking out, 2020 Lamar almost did too (99.3). Neither has come particularly close since (Lamar 87.0, 91.1 - Wentz 93.1, 72.8 [lmao], 94.6, 80.2).


Wentz in Indy had a 94.6 rating and was memed to death as a washed-up has-been (which he is). He was singled out as THE reason Indy missed the playoffs and is, to this day, a punchline. But we're supposed to just assume that a guy fresh off a worse passer rating than that is on the same level as Hurts, who just took the biggest developmental leap any of us had ever seen outside of Josh Allen... ?

My question: 

With that context, why is it so controversial to say that Lamar isn't as good a passer as the [guy that's been doing stuff like this all season? ](https://redd.it/10pix3t)

ETA - I'm not here to defend Wentz or trash Lamar. But I predict this sub is going to do a 180 on LJ over the next 12-18 months...

If nothing else, it's disrespectful to Jalen to just outright assume that LJ can do what he's done, which I'll remind everyone was considered ""impossible"" until he went out and followed in Allen's footsteps of nearly-unprecedented development as a passer. Lamar has more arm talent, no question.

27015,246577,246577,dextersdad,">Jason Kelce, drafted in 2011, is the only offensive lineman that Stoutland inherited from a different regime—no matter. Kelce’s been a first-team All-Pro in five of his last six seasons under Stout. Lane Johnson was the first pick of the Kelly era in Philadelphia, selected fourth overall in 2013 behind other offensive tackles in Eric Fisher and Luke Joeckel. Kelly told me this week that Johnson was first on Stoutland’s board for the entire process—now, he’s a four-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro.

>How about guard Brandon Brooks? No Pro Bowls in four seasons before Stout, three in four healthy seasons with Stout. Evan Mathis, a 32-year-old veteran in 2013, made his first All-Pro list in his first season with Stoutland in Philadelphia. Stoutland is one of five offensive line coaches since the merger [to coach a Pro Bowl offensive lineman in nine consecutive seasons](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/eagles/jeff-stoutland-eagles-hall-of-fame-jason-kelce). And this doesn’t even get into Jordan Mailata, the rugby star who had never played a down of football in his life and now proudly announces his alma mater as “Jeff Stoutland University” on Sunday Night Football.

Keep every single other thing EXACTLY the same over Andy Reid's entire Eagles career EXCEPT the NFC Championship losses (and then subsequent additional superbowls).  How many additional NFC Championship wins and Superbowl wins would it have taken for him to not get fired in 2012?  How many to still be the Eagles coach today (of course everything from 2012-today would be speculative though)?
 
My own thought on it is additional NFC championship wins with more superbowl losses only makes things worse.  One ring out of the 5 probably isn't enough to keep in after 2012 (things were really BAD).  Two rings probably gets him a few more seasons but with a short leash.  3 is close but 4 is probably enough for coach-for-life status with the Eagles.",6.0,nfl,t3_10k2z78,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-01-24T11:51:22Z,eagles,-0.0022005554051215

I’m mixed. I’m sad for the players, especially the vets who might have just played their last game. I’m sad that the game ended on a call that will be talked about forever. I always wondered if a Super Bowl could end on one of the many terrible calls we’ve seen in our lifetimes, well, here we are. The 2022 Eagles will have that legacy until the end of time, as the team that got jobbed on the biggest stage.
