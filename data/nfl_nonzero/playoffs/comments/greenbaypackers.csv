Don Hutson Poem Legend


Timothy Lund
Tell me a poem about packers legend Don Hutson 


2 / 2

Don Hutson, a Packer legend true,
A receiver like none other, he knew
How to make the ball fly,
His hands were quick, his moves sly.

With speed and grace, he'd run the field,
His opponents, he'd always yield.
He'd catch the ball with ease,
A touchdown, he'd always please.

Through storms and sunshine, he'd play on,
His passion for the game, never gone.
He'd make the crowd roar and cheer,
His name, forever etched in Packer's gear.

Don Hutson, the first of his kind,
His legacy, forever in our mind.
A Packer legend, he will always be,
A true football hero, for all to see.

D) Rodgers is currently more concerned with the Pebble Beach pro-am than making a decision at this moment. And, like he said, you would think reporters would wait until the off-week between the conference championship and superbowl to start fabricating headlines for clicks.

One major difference was the Packers didn’t really ever do too much in FA, and they squandered a little of early draft picks. Ted Thompson, at the time of this ESPN article (2015) apparently signed 12 UFAs since 2005. 4 of which never played a regular season snap. He only hit with 2, maybe 3 of them, being Charles Woodson (100 games played for Packers), Ryan Pickett (110 games played for Packers), and Brandon Chiller (34 games played for Packers). Outside of that, all the other 5 UFA pickups played 16 games or less for the Packers. The article does mention Julius Peppers and Letroy Guion coming on in 2014, but says they were “street” FAs since they had been cut by their previous teams. Honestly kind of difficult to find FA signings from the past via google, if someone could help me confirm that 12 number, it would be appreciated. Regardless, the Chiefs last offseason alone signed MVS, JuJu, and Justin Reid to help their situation.

12255,74056,74056,ForearmDeep,"Honestly I think he’s a bad head coach but a great OC. He’s had some interesting offenses and he’s seen a lot of success, but it’s kinda clear by this point that he has 0 desire to make the “mean” decisions to move on from nice guys who aren’t good at their jobs. 

Dudes mentioned in the earlier comment like Barry, Pettine, Menenga, Mo Drayton are all great examples, but there’s also guys like: 

- Amari Rodgers who returned punts too long even though Kesean Nixon clearly was a far more dynamic and fantastic returner
- WR’s who sat behind Sammy Watkins like Toure and Doubs even though Watkins was terrible all season and younger guys clearly gave more spark in the offense 
- Ford beating out Savage took until late in the season even though Ford immediately showed he was better until Savage got that wake-up call being benched
- Guys on the D line rotation who were clearly outperforming some of the vets like Wyatt and Slayton, but never saw significant snaps until Lowry went down and the season was basically over

He’s got a little bit of that McVay in him where he likes to set it and forget it at the beginning of the season and then just go with it no matter what. There’s also a little bit to be said about how his slow to give up on people can be a good thing, like how Mike McDaniel said that LaFleur not giving up on him was one of the best things another person had ever done for him and his career. Some guys work out over time but I don’t know that Matt ever is willing to accept that sometimes it just doesn’t work out.

Guys like Hacket and Pettine weren’t particularly great coordinators, but they both have HC experience and I think they probably alleviated and guided Matt more as he grew into the role and it made the team run more efficiently, but now that they’re gone Matt needs to sink or swim and right now he’s floundering without having some older guidance, which isn’t what you want in a head coach",32.0,nfl,t3_10ttd4x,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers,2023-02-04T19:10:20Z,greenbaypackers,0.1585490097736625

Most fans in general (rightfully) criticized Gute for wasting the 1st-rounder in 2020, and gave Love flak in 2021 for his inconsistency (while lauding him here and there). But the haters are so reluctant to give him even an ounce of praise. 

Every improvement Love has shown in 2022, and every good play he's made, is immediately dismissed. We criticized him for making dumb decisions and holding it for too long in '21; suddenly it's ""garbage time,"" ""prevent defense,"" ""it's just checkdowns"" now that Love appears to be going through his reads & getting the ball out a lot more quickly. A few also still seem to be doubting his arm talent/mechanics, as if that Cover 2 hole shot to Jones isn't proof otherwise, but I digress. 

I don't know if it's them letting Gute's draft decision cloud their judgement, or what, but again: you can highlight Gute's draft failure while also recognizing Love's talent and improvement from Years 1-3 at the same time.

Well said. I honestly think the best thing for our team would be to move on from Rodgers at this point. He's better in a McCarthy/Heroball type setup and LaFleur wants to run a system that isn't dependent on this type of QB. When we had the O, we had no defense. If we're not paying a super star QB, we can spend money on a designated kick returner... FA defensive players.. 

Mahomes has a top 5 defense. It definitely stings having MVS go over 100 in the championship round, but that's not the whole story. The Chiefs are the team we always wanted the Packers to be.

Let's just go at the emotional perspective which is all Scott is talking about... this is the guy who has demanded contract extensions twice in the last 3 yrs. This is the guy that hasn't shown up until mandatory camp to help our rookie receivers. This is the guy who repeatedly says he's not interested in being here through a rebuild and has publicly let it be known he'd like to play for a team closer to Cali. He teases us with retirement and fights with the GM publicly.

I don't blame him for ANY of that. Really, that's his decision and he's earned the right. To turn around and then say that we owe him something because of the feels is completely missing the point. This is a business relationship. When it's time to move on, good businesses move on. We cut Jordy, let Randall walk, Clay finished in another city, Woodson left, Davante got traded... why is Aaron different?

But he’s regressed to doing to same things he was doing then. Checking out of plays early in the game, deep bombs to covered receivers, ignoring short passes and the middle of the field, and throwing off the game plan. IMO Rodgers need either a strong coach that can force him to follow the plan or needs outside influence to force him to follow the plan. If those things aren’t present, he does what he wants at the time and ignores the overall effects. I’m sure he doesn’t want to be known as a game manager late in his career, but if he would have done more short plays and eaten up what teams would give him instead of going deep and allowed the run plays to happen as called, the team would absolutely have more wins.",1.0,greenbaypackers,t3_1110ili,False,1.0,:80:,2023-02-13T09:27:54Z,greenbaypackers,0.1117089776039123

Games are not won and lost with one single play. The Packers defense that day got 4 turnovers and ST 1

GB - Possession 1 : Rodgers intercepted

Seattle Possession 1 : Wilson intercepted

GB Possession 2 : Ball on the seattle 19yd line ends in a FG

Seattle Possession 2 : GB ST forces and recovers a fumble 

GB Possession 3 : Ball on the seattle 23yd line  ends in a FG

Seattle Possession 4 : Seattle punt

GB Possession 5 : Big return by ST. Ball on Seattle 33yd line ends in a FG

Seattle Possession 5 : Wilson intercepted

GB Possession 6 : Ball on GB 44yd line. Rodgers interception 

Seattle Possession 6 : Wilson red zone interception (touchback)

GB Possession 7 : Punt

Seattle Possession 7 :  end of half (score GB 16 -0 Seattle)

Seattle Possession 8 : 3&out punt

GB Possession 8 : 3&out punt

Seattle Possession 9 : Touchdown seattle

GB Possession 9 : 3&out punt

Seattle possession 10 : 3&out punt

GB Possession 10 : ball on GB 13. ends in field goal (first real sustained drive)

Seattle Possession 11 : Punt

GB Possession 11 : 3&out punt

Seattle possession 12 : Wilson intercepted

GB Possession 12 : 3&out punt

Seattle possession 13 : Ball on seattle's own 31yd line. Touchdown

GB Possession 13 : Muffed onside kick

Seattle possession 14 : ball on the 50. Touchdown

GB Possession 14 : Field goal

Seattle possession 15 : end of regulation. OT

Seattle possession 16 : Touchdown end of game.

Rodgers putting up 178yds 1td 2 picks.

Wilson putting up 209yds 1td 4 picks.

A quarterback who needs that much work is NOT the best player available. ffs.

Then, the Packers put themselves in a position where they had to rework a deal with a QB that was already under contract until 2024 for fewer years and more money because their pick wasn’t ready and they didn’t want to get fired.

Switched his focus over to football instead of the 2000 Olympics and got drafted by the Packers in the 7th round of the 1999 draft. Obviously put together a [pretty fantastic career](https://streamable.com/1dzfn) and [won himself a SB](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/73/e0/7e73e013d5c7bc375b49b2ee32d80438.jpg) as well as winning the [14th season of Dancing with the Stars](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/10/article-2127553-1287DD13000005DC-259_306x381.jpg).

23412,159327,159327,RustyKarma076,"Davante Adams was not the WR he is today until about 2019. I’m not too young to forget the time when everyone thought Tae was literally the worst WR in the NFL. 

Cobb was awesome and a fan favorite, but he is not in the same tier as those other WRs. 

Jennings was only with Rodgers for a few seasons and they were in the twilight of his career. 

Jordy was elite for a while, but it was usually just him and Cobb. You need more than just a elite QB and an elite WR to win a SB. 

>Whether it be his coaching or his defense…

Yeah that’s about it. Having a great WR or two is now where near enough to make let alone win a super bowl. 

After 2010, the Packers defense was religiously underwhelming or straight up awful. Look at the DC’s in the Rodgers era; Dom Capers-Mike Pettine-Joe Barry. Outside of 2021, and maybe 2014, could you argue the Packers have ever had a championship caliber defense following the 2010 championship season? 

I’ll always love Mike Mccarthy for his longtime commitment to the team but he should’ve been fired way before he did. I’m not gonna say he “wasted” Rodgers’ career, but he certainly didn’t optimize it. Does Mike Mccarthy belong in the same conversations as Bill Bellicheck, Bruce Arians, Andy Reid, Pete Caroll, and Sean Payton? As for Lafluer, as much as I loved him in 2019-2021, I have always had questions about his decision making in clutch scenarios. He has had a lot of question marks in the playoffs. And with this most recent season, he made mind boggling decisions at times because he couldn’t rely on Rodgers/Tae to supplement the entire offense. 

So for a vast majority of Rodgers’ career, he’s had underwhelming coaching, defenses that range from average to awful, suspect running games outside of these recent seasons of Aaron Jones, very few TE’s to compliment the passing game, etc.

edit: and I completely forgot to mention the special teams. Brandon Bostick is the most obvious example of the Packers’ awful ST, but a lot of people forget that the Packers would’ve won the 2021 game against the 49ers if not for the ST",7.0,nfl,t3_10mltg3,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers,2023-01-27T10:17:23Z,greenbaypackers,0.0210853593967202

The back to back MVPs, the idea that Rodgers has not been given the same help as other HOF QBs of this generation, and the Jordan Love draft has given a lot of people much more appreciation for Rodgers.

- we are in rebuilding mode without Rodgers. Just bite the bullet and get rid of the contract, and Preston Smith and probably Bahk as well, unless they can rework something (because he gives stability that a young starter like Love needs)


The benefits for doing this post June 1st are solid for us. We actually can better use 1st round picks in later years. Give Love his shot. If he sucks, we have an extra first to use for trading up next season and the season after that. Feasible that we could even be in line to get the first pick if we so desired and it was available.

First, professional referees.  This is all they do.  I am ok with a minimum of 2 per game.  At least the umpire and referee.  You would only need 32 full time officials.  In weeks where there are byes and not 16 games, distribute the full time refs accordingly.  They need to do something to bring consistency to the games.

Second, a sky official at every game using all technology available to the nfl to make the correct calls.  I am talking computer chips in the football, sensors in the stadium calibrated to the field, computer algorithms calculating what is physically possible levels of technology.  I want replays to view like the World Cup had available.  The sky judge can make any call at any time, or reverse any call at any time.

Third, revamp the review process.  If coaches want the sky judge to have more time, they call a time out.  If a call is changed during the timeout, they get their timeout back.  As long as they have timeouts, they can use them.  Also, personal fouls should be reviewable.  It is easy to see if a defender grabbed a facemask or avoided landing with his weight on the quarterback, or was blocked into a punter.

However, we would be Saints level screwed for a few years and not be able to sign anyone for 2-3 years with the additional Rodgers cap hit coming due and now Godwin.

After White, Sean Jones, Santana Dotson, Don Beebe, Andre Rison, and Desmond Howard signed in the following years, all of which were closer and closer to the Super Bowl Runs in the 90s.  I would argue that it was a championship caliber team and Ron Wolf's ability to sell that vision more than Green Bay becoming a Free Agent destination.

After those signings, Green Bay wouldn't see another significant signing until Charles Woodson, and that was more about money and position than anything else as he was seen as an aging corner that couldn't keep up with the new wave of receivers coming through.  They caught lightning in a bottle.

Since then, there have been big names that have signed, but all had needed to show they were still worthy of playing in the NFL.  The Packers hoped to duplicate the success they had with Woodson.

46530,333951,333951,sonofabutch,"Sports agents. 

Red Grange had an agent in the 1920s, but Grange -- one of the most famous and popular men in America as a huge college football star -- was sort of a cottage industry unto himself, with a movie deal, a barnstorming tour, a candy bar, and even a [Red Grange doll](http://sep12.hugginsandscott.com/cgi-bin/showitem.pl?lotno=363). Most athletes didn't have an agent until the 1960s, and would negotiate deals with the teams themselves... and as you can imagine, often not getting the best terms.

By the early 1960s, some players began to get agents. Supposedly it started after the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, and agents who were representing actors started looking at athletes. Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley told *Sports Illustrated*: 

> ""We can't give into them. There are too many agents hanging around Hollywood looking for clients.""  

In 1963, seven-time All Pro center Jim Ringo walked into Vince Lombardi's office to negotiate his contract for the 1964 season. For the first time, Ringo walked in with an agent. Lombardi stood up, excused himself, and walked out of the room. Five minutes later, he walked back in. 

""I can't negotiate with you,"" Lombardi said.

""We haven't even started yet,"" Ringo replied.

""I can't negotiate with you, because you've been traded to the Eagles!""

Now, of course, all players have agents... it's weird if a player *doesn't* have an agent. [(In 2022, there were only 17 out of more than 2,000 players.)](https://www.whas11.com/article/sports/nfl-without-agent-lamar-jackson-dj-humphries-bobby-wagner-kaiir-elam-football/417-cd5fcc4c-58f3-4682-8eb2-028ec8b18e34)",2.0,nfl,t3_10mltg3,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers,2023-01-27T11:20:58Z,greenbaypackers,-3.621005495623871e-05

Keeping him for next year just makes the dead cap hit for the following years even worse, at the same time that the likelihood of him retiring keeps increasing after each year (and we're gonna take that cap hit whether or not he's still playing).

If he still wants to play, trading him this year is absolutely the best option for 3 different parties. 

* Rodgers gets to keep playing  and go to a team with a stronger roster & with more flexibility to add players for a run or two. 
* The team that trades for him gets a player who still has elite potential, who even in the worst year of his career was better than around half the league, and who is almost certainly an upgrade over their existing options. Because the Packers are stuck with a chunk of his contract, they get him for a year or two on a deal that's pretty easy to manage compared to the potential he brings.
* The Packers get out from under Rodgers' contract which otherwise will continue to hurt our roster even more over the next few years, whether or not he's even still playing. They get to give Love a legitimate chance and find out whether he can lead the team moving forward or if they need to look elsewhere.

Best case for the Packers is if he's not picky about where he ends up in which case there might be some bidding for him, but if Rodgers has a specific destination in mind then he'll have the leverage to make that happen.

I'd be happy to get a single 1st for him, maybe even sending back a later pick.
