Obviously if they do I'll be super excited because it would mean they believe in him, but right now he is really really raw for a pass rusher, and has a lot of flaws.

If we already had a good D-line I'd be much happier drafting players like Wilson or Murphy as depth who can have time to develop but I don't think most of them will be ready and productive year 1.

At this moment I'm personally hoping for QB or Witherspoon at 5, then IOL/Center, then d-line in the 2nd round. There are some really solid IOL/Center players this year I think I'd be ok with taking later in the 1st, and we can draft our d-line projects 2nd round since there's basically no way we get Carter/Anderson",1.0,seahawks,t3_1104clv,False,0.0,None,2023-02-12T00:46:39Z,seahawks,0.091882421875

If we trade down and have three 1st round picks then I'd be ok using one on a d-line but other than that I don't think there are any we should take in the top 15 (unless PCJS really really like them for some reason and in that case I'll be hyped).",12.0,seahawks,t3_1104clv,False,0.0,None,2023-02-12T00:43:17Z,seahawks,0.535625

\- 51. Philadelphia Eagles
Original pick: Cam Jurgens, C
New pick: Kyler Gordon, CB
Gordon had three interceptions, six passes defended and 71 tackles for the Bears this season. He would be a good option if the Eagles lost James Bradberry in free agency this offseason. Jurgens was drafted as Philadelphia's potential replacement for Jason Kelce, but he played 31 offensive snaps this season. -- Tim McManus

\- 52. Pittsburgh Steelers
Original pick: George Pickens, WR
New pick: Rashid Shaheed, WR
The Steelers have a history of successfully drafting wide receivers in the second round, but Pickens was long gone in this scenario. It was a toss-up between the undrafted Shaheed and fourth-rounder Romeo Doubs, but Shaheed edged out Doubs because of his late-season consistency and fleet-footed versatility -- a big plus in the Steelers' offense. While Doubs missed more than a month because of an ankle injury and was minimized in his return (thanks to the emergence of Christian Watson), Shaheed became a bigger factor as the season went on, finishing with two touchdowns and 488 receiving yards. -- Brooke Pryor

\- 53. Green Bay Packers (via LV)
Original pick: Alec Pierce, WR (IND traded up)
New pick: Romeo Doubs, WR
The Packers didn't get Christian Watson in this re-draft but were fortunate to retain half of their rookie receiver duo by getting Doubs, who originally was a fourth-round pick. He finished the season with 425 yards and three touchdowns while averaging 10.1 yards per reception. Had he not missed part of the season with a sprained ankle, he might have gone much higher in this re-draft. -- Rob Demovsky

\- 54. New England Patriots
Original pick: Skyy Moore, WR (KC pick from NE trade)
New pick: Cole Strange, G
When the Patriots selected Strange at No. 29 overall last April, it was a surprise to some around the NFL because he was projected to go a bit later. The 6-foot-5, 305-pound guard ended up starting every game as a rookie (playing 93.8% of the snaps), and his 93.6% pass block win rate ranked second among rookie linemen. He had some flashes of excellence, paired with rookie growing pains, and projects as a long-term fit at left guard. -- Mike Reiss

\- 55. Arizona Cardinals
Original pick: Trey McBride, TE
New pick: Trey McBride, TE
By the end of the season, McBride looked like he was worth the second-round pick the Cardinals spent on him. He had 26 receptions for 241 yards in his final eight starts after having 24 yards before that. It took him a little while to get there, but for a Cardinals offense that lost tight end Zach Ertz to a knee injury and didn't have Maxx Williams at full strength, McBride would be the right fit again. -- Josh Weinfuss

\- 56. Dallas Cowboys
Original pick: Sam Williams, OLB
New pick: Kenyon Green, G
The 6-foot-4, 323-pound Green was an option in the first round for the Cowboys last April because the team liked his position flexibility. As a rookie, he started 14 games and would project as a long-term part of the Dallas offensive line. Williams had four sacks and flashed at times, but Green is the better value here. -- Todd Archer

\- 57. Buffalo Bills
Original pick: Luke Goedeke, OL (TB traded up)
New pick: Dameon Pierce, RB
Is Pierce the receiving back the Bills drafted James Cook to be? No, but it's interesting to think what he could have done to take the pressure off Josh Allen in the Bills' offense, especially if there was more of a commitment to running the ball. Pierce likely would have led all rookies in rushing if not for a season-ending ankle injury -- he had 939 rushing yards and four touchdowns before his injury in Week 14. The Bills could address receiving back later while adding a solution for Devin Singletary hitting free agency in 2023. -- Alaina Getzenberg

\- 58. Atlanta Falcons (via TEN)
Original pick: Troy Andersen, ILB
New pick: James Houston, LB
The Falcons missed out on Ebiketie in this re-draft, but they have to address their pass rush. With Houston, they could get that and take pressure off Grady Jarrett. The sixth-rounder Houston had a huge impact on the Lions, becoming the first player to have two sacks in a debut game since 2017 during the Lions' Thanksgiving loss to the Bills. His impact continued for the team, as he finished his rookie season with eight sacks and 11 quarterback hits. -- Michael Rothstein

\- 59. Green Bay Packers
Original pick: Ed Ingram, G (MIN pick from GB trade)
New pick: Devonte Wyatt, DT
Wyatt began to flash his potential late in the season when his playing time increased. He had three quarterback hits and 1.5 sacks in his final four games. He's still a raw prospect, but he has exceptional physical traits for someone his size (6-foot-3, 304 pounds), and the Packers will always look to stockpile talent up front. -- Rob Demovsky

\- 60. Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Original pick: Cam Taylor-Britt, CB (CIN traded up)
New pick: DaRon Bland, CB
When this draft happened last April, the Bucs had cornerbacks Carlton Davis, Jamel Dean and Sean Murphy-Bunting, had moved Antoine Winfield Jr. to nickelback and had Logan Ryan and Mike Edwards at safety. That's a solid group on paper. But none of them had five interceptions this season -- Murphy-Bunting had the most with three -- and there were moments when the Bucs desperately needed a takeaway, going five consecutive games without one. Plus, Dean and Murphy-Bunting are set to become free agents, as is Edwards. Adding Bland to the group would have given them a boost, as he finished his rookie season in Dallas with five picks and seven passes defended. -- Jenna Laine

\- 61. San Francisco 49ers
Original pick: Drake Jackson, OLB
New pick: Abraham Lucas, OT
The Niners still have high hopes for Jackson, who has flashed promise as a pass-rusher, but the chance to nab Lucas here is too good to pass up. He started 16 games for the Seahawks and ranked 17th among all offensive tackles in pass block win rate (91.9%). With Mike McGlinchey set to become a free agent who might have priced himself out of the Niners' range, a solid tackle on a rookie contract would be nice to have in the pipeline, much like San Francisco did with guard Aaron Banks in 2021. -- Nick Wagoner

\- 62. Kansas City Chiefs
Original pick: Bryan Cook, S
New pick: Drake Jackson, DE
Jackson wasn't spectacular as a rookie but could develop into a high-quality pass-rusher. He had three sacks and one interception for the 49ers. The Chiefs, in this scenario, have a need at defensive end after missing out on George Karlaftis, and they already took a safety at No. 30. -- Adam Teicher

\- 63. Cincinnati Bengals
Original pick: James Cook, RB (BUF pick from CIN trade)
New pick: Brian Robinson Jr., RB
Let's think outside of the box here. Sure, Cam Taylor-Britt is still a solid option, especially given his form toward the end of the season; in his nine starts, he had 39 tackles on pass plays and six passes defended. But Robinson could be a key long-term addition with Joe Mixon entering his seventh pro season in 2023. Robinson finished his rookie year with 205 carries for 797 yards and two touchdowns. -- Ben Baby

\- 64. Denver Broncos (via LAR)
Original pick: Nik Bonitto, OLB
New pick: Nicholas Petit-Frere, OL
The Broncos would still eye Bonitto and the available edge rushers in this spot. Right tackle, however, was a position consistently hampered by injuries and change, a seemingly annual event in Denver. Petit-Frere struggled down the stretch in Tennessee but flashed quality potential in both pass protection and in the run game, starting 16 games. It will be a surprise if he doesn't take a significant jump in Year 2. Bonitto had 1.5 sacks in 338 defensive snaps. -- Jeff Legwold",6.0,seahawks,t3_10wdetu,False,0.0,None,2023-02-07T18:06:41Z,seahawks,6.366021274218298e-06
78,1110,1110,1620081392477,"\- 34. Detroit Lions
Original pick: Christian Watson, WR (GB traded up after DET/MIN deal)
New pick: Josh Paschal, DE
Lions general manager Brad Holmes ultimately got it right when he drafted Paschal with the No. 46 pick in the real draft. If he were to do it over again, he likely would make the same selection. Detroit's defense needed a major upgrade, and Paschal's versatility and leadership traits as a three-time team captain at Kentucky were on display with two sacks and three stuffs during the season. -- Eric Woodyard

\- 35. New York Jets
Original pick: Roger McCreary, CB (TEN pick from NYJ trade)
New pick: Breece Hall, RB
The Jets would take Hall again, even though he finished the season on injured reserve (ACL surgery). Before the injury, he was their best player on offense, averaging 5.8 yards per carry. Hall, who said he's ahead of schedule in his rehab, should be ready for the 2023 opener. It might take him some time before he's back to his old form, but it will be worth the wait. -- Rich Cimini

\- 36. New York Giants
Original pick: Breece Hall, RB (NYJ traded up)
New pick: Braxton Jones, OT
The way this re-draft worked out, the Giants didn't get an offensive tackle with either of their picks in the top seven. Jones played better than Evan Neal this season, anyway. In fact, Jones -- whom the Bears drafted in the fifth round -- had the best pass block win rate of any rookie tackle (92.8%) and was second in run block win rate (78.7%). -- Jordan Raanan

\- 37. Houston Texans
Original pick: Jalen Pitre, S
New pick: Jermaine Johnson, DE
Pitre was an outstanding pick for Houston here, but he's not available now. Johnson, a first-round pick for the Jets, was buried behind a veteran defensive line of John Franklin-Myers and Carl Lawson and played 301 defensive snaps. He's good against the run -- with a 33.1% run stop win rate -- something the Texans needed in their front after allowing the most rushing yards in the NFL (170.2 per game). -- DJ Bien-Aime

\- 38. New York Jets (via CAR)
Original pick: Arnold Ebiketie, DE (ATL traded up)
New pick: Boye Mafe, DE

\- After three picks on offense, the Jets have to go defense. Their original pick, Jermaine Johnson, just went off the board, so let's pivot to Mafe. He didn't have much production (three sacks) in 17 games for the Seahawks, but this is a bet on his upside. He has the right size (6-foot-4, 261 pounds), speed and edge-rushing traits to be a 4-3 end in the Jets' scheme. -- Rich Cimini

\- 39. Chicago Bears
Original pick: Kyler Gordon, CB
New pick: Jaquan Brisker, S
The versatile safety was Chicago's most impactful rookie -- it landed him with its pick at No. 48 -- and showed early signs of becoming a mainstay in the secondary. Brisker stood out on a defense that struggled, particularly with its pass rush. He led the Bears with four sacks, becoming only the second defensive back in the past 10 seasons to do so, and was second in team tackles (104). Perhaps Brisker's biggest contribution came via the resurgence of Eddie Jackson in his move back to free safety while the rookie played up in the box, in the slot and was called on to blitz. -- Courtney Cronin

\- 40. Seattle Seahawks (via DEN)
Original pick: Boye Mafe, OLB
New pick: Kenneth Walker III, RB
Regardless of how you feel about spending early round picks on running backs, the Seahawks would be thrilled -- and probably surprised -- to get Walker in nearly the same spot they drafted him. He's a finalist for Offensive Rookie of the Year after leading all rookies in rushing yards (1,050) and rushing touchdowns (nine). -- Brady Henderson

\- 41. Seattle Seahawks
Original pick: Kenneth Walker III, RB
New pick: Arnold Ebiketie, OLB
The Seahawks loved Ebiketie but never got a chance to take him in the actual draft, ending up with Boye Mafe instead. With Mafe off the board in this scenario, they could take Ebiketie, who had similar production during his rookie season but a much better pass rush win rate -- 17.6% compared to Mafe's 10.2%. -- Brady Henderson

\- 42. Indianapolis Colts (via WSH)
Original pick: Andrew Booth Jr., CB (MIN traded up)
New pick: Alec Pierce, WR
It was another big season for rookie wide receivers, evidenced by the seven selected in the first round in this re-draft. The Colts actually traded down and got Pierce at No. 53. But with no obvious left tackle on the board, Pierce looks like the best of the remaining wideouts -- a big need for Indy. The Colts could have gotten more out of Pierce (41 catches, 593 yards), but his production was solid when viewed in the context of a dysfunctional offense with poor quarterback play. -- Stephen Holder

\- 43. Atlanta Falcons
Original pick: Wan'Dale Robinson, WR (NYG pick from ATL trade)
New pick: Tyler Allgeier, RB
Allgeier, whom the Falcons took in Round 5 last April, showed he is the type of back Atlanta is looking for, and after a 1,035-yard season, there's no reason to think he can't be its back for the next half-decade. While this leaves the Falcons without edge rushers -- initial pick Arnold Ebiketie, who would have been the pick again here, was just picked -- this selection would bolster the offense. -- Michael Rothstein

\- 44. Cleveland Browns
Original pick: John Metchie III, WR (HOU traded up)
New pick: Martin Emerson Jr., CB
Emerson had a terrific rookie season for the Browns, winning a starting job out of camp opposite Denzel Ward. Cleveland would be happy to grab him again here, a round earlier. Emerson's size and range allowed him to hang with some of the top wideouts in the league. With Ward, Emerson and 2021 first-round pick Greg Newsome, Cleveland would boast a foundational cornerback trio that is young, versatile and prolific. -- Jake Trotter

\- 45. Baltimore Ravens
Original pick: David Ojabo, OLB
New pick: Trevor Penning, OT
There was strong consideration to once again take Ojabo, who should have an increased role in 2023 after essentially getting redshirted this past season while recovering from his Achilles injury. But Penning, whose rookie season was cut short by a foot injury, would've competed for the starting right tackle job and provided depth on the left side. He would've helped the Ravens early in the season when they went through four different starters at left tackle. -- Jamison Hensley

\- 46. Minnesota Vikings
Original pick: Josh Paschal, DE (DET pick from MIN trade)
New pick: Lewis Cine, S
The Vikings get Cine 17 spots lower than they drafted him, thanks to a series of injuries -- including a compound fracture of his left leg -- that cost him 14 games of his season. Cine had gotten two defensive snaps prior to his final injury, but the Vikings drafted him with 2023 (and beyond) in mind. With early reports suggesting he will make a full recovery, the Vikings still very much have him in their plans. -- Kevin Seifert

\- 47. Washington Commanders (via IND)
Original pick: Phidarian Mathis, DT
New pick: Roger McCreary, CB
Washington lacks corner depth, and even though it signed William Jackson III the previous offseason, he showed few signs of adapting to its coverage scheme. McCreary would give the Commanders a quick-twitch slot corner and allow them to use Benjamin St-Juste on the outside, along with Kendall Fuller (or Jackson if he progressed). Regardless, they need more talent at this spot. A receiver would have been desired -- maybe Tyquan Thornton? -- to add more pop to the offense. But, for value, corner works here. Mathis, meanwhile, suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 1. -- John Keim

\- 48. Chicago Bears (via LAC)
Original pick: Jaquan Brisker, S
New pick: Skyy Moore, WR
The receiving corps around quarterback Justin Fields lacked considerably in 2022. An ankle injury forced Darnell Mooney to miss the final five games and he finished as the leading receiver, with 493 yards and two touchdowns. Moore was far down the depth chart in Kansas City due to an abundance of playmakers around Patrick Mahomes, but he still had more catches (22) than six Bears receivers. His 250 receiving yards would have ranked third in Chicago. Addressing the wide receiver position in the draft could have saved the Bears from sending their own second-round pick to Pittsburgh for Chase Claypool at the deadline. -- Courtney Cronin

\- 49. New Orleans Saints
Original pick: Alontae Taylor, CB
New pick: Alontae Taylor, CB
There was some surprise last April when the Saints drafted a cornerback, considering how deep the position group was expected to be. But after the trade of C.J. Gardner-Johnson and an injury to Marshon Lattimore, Taylor played an important role. He stepped in immediately once he came back from an early-season knee injury, and it was clear he had potential. He played 628 defensive snaps and didn't allow a touchdown as the nearest defender in coverage, and that came on 64 targets his way, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. Taylor could end up being a key player on the New Orleans defense, and it wouldn't hesitate to draft him again. -- Katherine Terrell

\- 50. Kansas City Chiefs (via MIA)
Original pick: Tyquan Thornton, WR (NE traded up)
New pick: Isiah Pacheco, RB
The Chiefs drafted Pacheco in the seventh round, but he wouldn't last that long in a re-draft. He played sparingly over the season's first several weeks, but he eventually replaced Clyde Edwards-Helaire as the starter and wound up leading the Chiefs in rushing. His 830 rushing yards were the most for a Chiefs back during the regular season since Kareem Hunt led the NFL in 2017. He also has value as a receiver; he caught five passes for 59 yards in Kansas City's AFC title game win over Cincinnati. -- Adam Teicher",5.0,seahawks,t3_10wdetu,False,0.0,None,2023-02-07T18:06:30Z,seahawks,0.0001041843927616

Original pick: Jahan Dotson, WR (WSH pick from NO trade)
New pick: Kenny Pickett, QB
The Saints have struggled to find the right quarterback for the past two seasons and, with no 2023 first-rounder plus limited salary-cap space, their options aren't great. With Chris Olave off the board, they could use the first of their two picks on a quarterback instead of starting over for the third straight year. Pickett's numbers aren't great -- seven touchdown passes, nine interceptions -- but he and the Pittsburgh offense improved down the stretch. -- Katherine Terrell

\- 17. Los Angeles Chargers
Original pick: Zion Johnson, G
New pick: Zion Johnson, G
The Chargers needed to address their offensive line and did so with the selection of Johnson. He was a Day 1 starter, and despite expected rookie growing pains, proved he will be a capable -- if not outstanding -- anchor on the right side in protecting quarterback Justin Herbert. It was tempting to select another playmaker for Herbert to target here, but the best already are off the board. -- Lindsey Thiry

\- 18. Philadelphia Eagles (via NO)
Original pick: Treylon Burks, WR (TEN traded up)
New pick: Jordan Davis, DT
Why not load up the front with players from college football's best defense? The block-eating Davis is the exact type of player coordinator Jonathan Gannon needs in the middle for his hybrid scheme to work effectively. A high ankle sprain interrupted a productive rookie season, but his upside remains high. In the real draft, Philadelphia traded away this pick for wideout A.J. Brown, but there isn't an instant-impact receiver left on the board. -- Tim McManus

\- 19. New Orleans Saints (via PHI)
Original pick: Trevor Penning, OT
New pick: Jahan Dotson, WR
Penning has a lot of potential, but injuries at the beginning and end of the season delayed his progress and limited his playing time. With Chris Olave already taken in this scenario -- and with Michael Thomas' future in question -- this team needs to add a receiver. Dotson's seven touchdowns were tied for the lead among all rookie wideouts and would have tied tight end Juwan Johnson as the Saints' receiving leader. -- Katherine Terrell

\- 20. Pittsburgh Steelers
Original pick: Kenny Pickett, QB
New pick: Derek Stingley Jr., CB
In this scenario, both Pickett and receiver George Pickens are off the board, leaving the Steelers to address another position of need. With corner near the top of the their 2023 offseason wish list, drafting Stingley would check a major box in shoring up a spot that lacked a true lockdown player after the retirement of Joe Haden. Stingley finished the season on injured reserve with a hamstring injury, but he didn't allow a touchdown as the nearest defender in coverage and showed potential. -- Brooke Pryor

\- 21. New England Patriots
Original pick: Trent McDuffie, CB (KC traded up)
New pick: Evan Neal, OT
It was an up-and-down rookie season for Neal with the Giants, but just as his bookend tackle Andrew Thomas grew after a shaky start to his career, the projection is Neal will do the same. The Patriots learned firsthand in 2022 how difficult it can be when there is a shortage at tackle. Neal has high-end traits with which to work. -- Mike Reiss

\- 22. Green Bay Packers (via LV)
Original pick: Quay Walker, ILB
New pick: Quay Walker, ILB
Walker gave the Packers a versatile player who had no trouble handling both inside linebacker duties and the occasional rush off the edge. The more comfortable he gets, the more the Packers will move him around. He led the team with 121 tackles. The only negative from his rookie season was two ejections. -- Rob Demovsky

\- 23. Arizona Cardinals
Original pick: Kaiir Elam, CB (BUF traded up after BAL deal)
New pick: Tyler Linderbaum, C
Knowing what we know now about Rodney Hudson's 2022 season -- he played in just four games -- Linderbaum would've been an obvious pick if the Cardinals hadn't traded away this selection to the Ravens for Marquise Brown. In reality, the trade would probably be repeated in order to placate quarterback Kyler Murray, but drafting Linderbaum would've filled the hole at center that plagued Arizona all season. Linderbaum started 18 games for Baltimore and led rookies in pass block win rate (94.7%). -- Josh Weinfuss

\- 24. Dallas Cowboys
Original pick: Tyler Smith, OT
New pick: Kaiir Elam, CB
That Smith went so high in the first round in this re-draft shows you the Cowboys were onto something when they took him. Linemen Zion Johnson and Kenyon Green were other options in April, but Elam is the pick here, not just because of what he did this season (two interceptions for Buffalo) but because he fits the size profile Dallas wants in corners. The Cowboys were shown to be thin at corner after losing Jourdan Lewis and Anthony Brown to injuries. -- Todd Archer

\- 25. Buffalo Bills
Original pick: Tyler Linderbaum, C (BAL pick from BUF trade)
New pick: Kyle Hamilton, S
I thought hard about running back Breece Hall here. The Bills need to invest in the offense to take pressure off quarterback Josh Allen, and Hall would have been a great fit. The Bills can't let Hamilton get by them, however. He is young, physically talented and can be a difference-maker for the defense. He would have been a huge help for the Bills as a depth player in 2022, especially due to injuries, but also could have been a long-term answer at safety with 2023 free agent Jordan Poyer potentially departing. -- Alaina Getzenberg

\- 26. Tennessee Titans
Original pick: Jermaine Johnson, DE (NYJ traded up)
New pick: Treylon Burks, WR
This re-draft gives the Titans a do-over, allowing them to keep A.J. Brown while complementing him with Burks, who is a similar yards-after-catch specialist who can win on contested catches. With so much defensive attention devoted to the rushing attack and double coverage on Brown, Burks would get the opportunity to dominate one-on-one coverage. The Titans want to be physical in all phases of offense, and adding Burks would support the ""be great around Ryan Tannehill"" mantra coach Mike Vrabel wanted to have entering the season. Burks finished his rookie season with 33 catches for 444 yards in 11 games. -- Turron Davenport

\- 27. Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Original pick: Devin Lloyd, ILB (JAX traded up)
New pick: Jamaree Salyer, OT
The Bucs ultimately traded out of this spot and used it on two picks in the second round: defensive tackle Logan Hall and offensive tackle Luke Goedeke. Their thinking in prioritizing offensive line help wasn't wrong. Goedeke, however, just wasn't the right pick -- he allowed five sacks while playing left guard. Salyer, a sixth-round pick last April, was thrust into the Chargers' starting left tackle role in Week 4 for Rashawn Slater, and as L.A. general manager Tom Telesco said: ""He saved us this year."" Salyer's versatility could have helped the Bucs not only at left guard but when Tristan Wirfs and Donovan Smith were out with injuries, giving quarterback Tom Brady a cleaner pocket. -- Jenna Laine

\- 28. Green Bay Packers
Original pick: Devonte Wyatt, DT
New pick: George Karlaftis, DE
Wyatt turned out to be more of a project who might pay dividends down the road, but the more immediate production Karlaftis had -- six sacks and more pressures than any rookie defensive lineman not named Aidan Hutchinson -- would have served the Packers better. -- Rob Demovsky

\- 29. Kansas City Chiefs (via MIA from SF)
Original pick: Cole Strange, G (NE pick from KC trade)
New pick: Trent McDuffie, CB
McDuffie missed six games early in the season with a hamstring injury, which set back his development. He started every game in which he played, however, and the Chiefs felt comfortable enough with him late in the season that he played outside corner and in the slot. He didn't have an interception, but he has a bright future in Kansas City. -- Adam Teicher

\- 30. Kansas City Chiefs
Original pick: George Karlaftis, DE
New pick: Jalen Pitre, S
The Chiefs were looking for a safety in this draft and wound up with Bryan Cook as one of their second-round picks. Pitre would fill the need here. They would get a playmaker who can replace Juan Thornhill, an unrestricted free agent, in the starting lineup next season. Pitre finished the season with five interceptions and 99 solo tackles. -- Adam Teicher

\- 31. Cincinnati Bengals
Original pick: Dax Hill, S
New pick: Dax Hill, S
The Bengals were over the moon when Hill was on the board last April. At this point, he still marks a key position the Bengals will need in 2023 when safety Jessie Bates III will be a free agent after spending this season on the franchise tag. Hill has grown as a rookie and flashed potential as a long-term starter, though he played 123 defensive snaps during the regular season. -- Ben Baby

\- 32. Detroit Lions (via LAR)
Original pick: Lewis Cine, S (MIN pick from DET trade)
New pick: Devin Lloyd, ILB
In the real draft, Detroit moved up 20 spots to take wideout Jameson Williams, but with Williams long gone in this scenario, they could focus on the defense instead. Adding another physical presence in Lloyd would've benefited the Lions' defense, as it ranked in the bottom tier for much of the season. Detroit's coaching staff has a knack for developing talent and could've used Lloyd's tackling ability; he finished the season with 115 tackles and three interceptions for Jacksonville. -- Eric Woodyard
ROUND 2

\- 33. Jacksonville Jaguars
Original pick: Logan Hall, DE (TB pick from JAX trade)
New pick: Luke Fortner, C
Having missed out on pass-rusher, the Jaguars could take Brandon Linder's replacement a round earlier. Fortner played every snap as a rookie and gave up the fewest sacks of any rookie lineman in 2022 (four). That was the second-fewest on the team behind left guard Tyler Shatley (three). -- Michael DiRocco",6.0,seahawks,t3_10wdetu,False,0.0,None,2023-02-07T18:05:14Z,seahawks,6.403715510266539e-07

The 2022 NFL rookie class created a lot of buzz with up-and-down quarterback play, explosive wideouts and shutdown cornerbacks. Some of the season's biggest stars, however, were taken in the later rounds. So, what if your team had the chance to change its picks?

We asked our NFL Nation reporters to give the teams they cover a do-over, re-drafting the first two rounds of the 2022 NFL draft -- all 64 picks. We asked them to explain their reasoning for each pick, especially in the instances when they went away from what the teams they cover did last April. We're once again starting with a clean slate: The order below is as it was when the draft began on April 28, 2022. There are no trades allowed, with teams picking in their original spots going into the start of Round 1.

Only one quarterback -- Pittsburgh's Kenny Pickett -- was selected in the first two rounds last year. Will another name (perhaps Brock Purdy?) be picked in this re-draft, and where will Pickett land? Plus, how high will late-round standout cornerback Tariq Woolen, a first-team All-Pro selection, climb?

ROUND 1

1. Jacksonville Jaguars
Original pick: Travon Walker, DE
New pick: Sauce Gardner, CB
Adding an elite cornerback in a conference that includes quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert is a no-brainer. Gardner led the NFL in passes defended (20), had two interceptions and was named first-team All-Pro for the Jets. With the development of Tyson Campbell, this would give the Jaguars one of the league's best cornerback tandems. Walker had 3.5 sacks as a rookie, and his pass rush win rate (10%) ranked 41st of 48 qualifying edge rushers. -- Michael DiRocco

2. Detroit Lions
Original pick: Aidan Hutchinson, DE
New pick: Aidan Hutchinson, DE
Hutchinson was everything the Lions imagined in his rookie season and more. He helped change the culture, with Detroit winning eight of its final 10 games. He led all rookies with 9.5 sacks and had three interceptions and two fumble recoveries. -- Eric Woodyard

3. Houston Texans
Original pick: Derek Stingley Jr, CB
New pick: Tariq Woolen, CB
Woolen was a fifth-round steal for the Seahawks, as he tied for the league lead in interceptions (six), had the fourth-most passed defended (16) and made the Pro Bowl roster. Compare that to Stingley, who had one interception and five passes defended. The 6-foot-4 Woolen has outstanding physical traits -- he ran a 4.26-second 40-yard dash at the combine -- and is fluid in and out of his backpedal, which makes it hard to attack him deep. -- DJ Bien-Aime

4. New York Jets
Original pick: Sauce Gardner, CB
New pick: Brock Purdy, QB
Yes, Purdy will be on the shelf for at least six months with a UCL tear to this throwing elbow, but we're thinking long term not short term. It hasn't worked out with Zach Wilson -- the No. 2 overall pick in 2021 -- so it's time to change direction at quarterback. Purdy was Mr. Irrelevant in the real draft, but he'd be very relevant to the Jets. He'd look good in Gotham, especially if they fail to land veterans Aaron Rodgers or Derek Carr this offseason. In seven starts -- three in the playoffs -- Purdy completed 66.5% of his passes, throwing for 1,943 yards with 16 touchdowns and four interceptions. -- Rich Cimini

5. New York Giants
Original pick: Kayvon Thibodeaux, OLB
New pick: Kayvon Thib
odeaux, OLB
Let's stick with the original pick of Thibodeaux. He led all qualifying rookies in pass rush win rate (17.9%) and got better as the season progressed once his knee was healthy. There's little doubt Thibodeaux will be a good player. The only question is whether he develops into a star. -- Jordan Raanan

6. Carolina Panthers
Original pick: Ikem Ekwonu, OT
New pick: Tyler Smith, OT
With quarterback Brock Purdy off the board here, it would have been easy to stick with Ekwonu. He had a solid season after a slow start and has shown the promise to be a long-term solution to a longtime issue. Smith, however, graded out slightly higher for the league's ninth-ranked run offense and allowed seven sacks after being thrown into the position right before the season. Ekwonu allowed eight. -- David Newton

7. New York Giants (via CHI)
Original pick: Evan Neal, OT
New pick: Garrett Wilson, WR
This is the kind of No. 1 receiver Daniel Jones and the Giants need. Wilson led all rookie receivers in receptions (83) and yards (1,103) this season, and that was without steady quarterback play for the Jets. He's going to be a star in New York, but with that other team. Neal gave up 11 sacks in 13 games as the Giants' primary right tackle. -- Jordan Raanan

8. Atlanta Falcons
Original pick: Drake London, WR
New pick: Drake London, WR
Yes, the Falcons need pass-rush help, but if you take London off the team, receiver remains a massive need. He was consistent throughout the season and had his best two games when Atlanta switched from veteran quarterback Marcus Mariota to rookie Desmond Ridder. London finished the season with 72 catches for 866 yards. He also is a willing blocker as a receiver, something valued in coach Arthur Smith's offense. While Chris Olave and Jameson Williams remained considerations here, London fits well in Atlanta's offense, and there's no reason to deviate from that. -- Michael Rothstein

9. Seattle Seahawks (via DEN)
Original pick: Charles Cross, OT
New pick: Charles Cross, OT
There's no need to overthink this one. Cross had a strong debut season. He finished third among rookie tackles in pass block win rate (88.5%) -- well ahead of Ikem Ekwonu (85.8%) and Evan Neal (80.9%), who went ahead of him in the actual draft. Seattle had Cross rated higher than Neal on its board anyway. -- Brady Henderson

10. New York Jets (via SEA)
Original pick: Garrett Wilson, WR
New pick: Christian Watson, WR
The preferred choice is Wilson, who had a terrific rookie year for the Jets, but it's an easy pivot to Watson. He got off to a slow start in Green Bay, but he became Aaron Rodgers' go-to receiver over the second half of the season. He tied for first among rookies in receiving touchdowns (seven) and finished third in yards after catch (263). Chris Olave would've been a fine choice, too, but Watson has a higher ceiling because of his size, speed and vertical ability. -- Rich Cimini

11. Washington Commanders
Original pick: Chris Olave, WR (NO traded up)
New pick: Ikem Ekwonu, OT
Wide receiver Jahan Dotson is excellent and will be a dynamic slot, but No. 11 is a bit high to take him. Washington could build a strong right side of the line with Ekwonu, then shift Sam Cosmi inside to guard and have a stellar pairing for a long time. Or they could shift Ekwonu to left tackle to replace Charles Leno Jr. Ekwonu started slow but finished strong and should be a fixture for the Panthers. Coach Ron Rivera wants to build a strong line; he can do so with Ekwonu. -- John Keim

12. Minnesota Vikings
Original pick: Jameson Williams, WR (DET traded up)
New pick: Jameson Williams, WR
In retrospect, choosing Williams and not trading away this pick would have fit perfectly into the Viking's ""competitive rebuild."" There would have been no rush to get him on the field as he rehabilitated the torn ACL in his left knee, given the presence of Adam Thielen, K.J. Osborn and the since-acquired T.J. Hockenson around All-Pro Justin Jefferson. Williams would have been ready to replace Thielen as the No. 2 receiver in 2023. Williams' best performance came against the Vikings in Week 14, when his first NFL catch turned into a 41-yard touchdown drive. Can you imagine moving forward with the pairing of Jefferson and Williams? -- Kevin Seifert

13. Houston Texans (via CLE)
Original pick: Jordan Davis, DT (PHI traded up)
New pick: Chris Olave, WR
The Texans traded down two spots last April and took guard Kenyon Green, who had a rough rookie season, allowing eight sacks. They didn't have explosive playmakers on the outside -- Brandin Cooks led the team with 699 yards in 13 games -- and Olave would inject some talent into this offense. He had 1,042 receiving yards, second most among rookie receivers. -- DJ Bien-Aime

14. Baltimore Ravens
Original pick: Kyle Hamilton, S
New pick: George Pickens, WR
Hamilton was a solid pick who shook off early struggles and finished strong. He concluded the season with five passes defended and 46 total tackles. But imagine Lamar Jackson lofting touchdown passes to Pickens in the end zone. Pickens' elite pass-catching ability -- he led all rookies in yards per reception (15.4) -- is tough to pass on because he provides much-needed playmaking ability on the outside. -- Jamison Hensley

15. Philadelphia Eagles (via MIA)
Original pick: Kenyon Green, G (HOU pick from PHI trade)
New pick: Travon Walker, DE
In the real draft, Philly jumped two spots to take big defensive tackle Jordan Davis, who has shown promise. In this scenario, however, Philly will grab his Georgia teammate after a surprising fall down the board. Walker had 10 quarterback hits, 21 pressures, five tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks and an interception for the Jaguars while lining up both at outside linebacker and along the front. While he has some developing to do, the Eagles build from the inside out and value versatility, and he checks both of those boxes. Let's see if they can get Davis with their next pick. -- Tim McManus",10.0,seahawks,t3_10wdetu,False,0.0,None,2023-02-07T18:04:56Z,seahawks,3.77766490534149e-07

Are projects just like Darrell Taylor, who could boom or bust. Just because we need DL I don't understand the fascination with the next best guys in this year's draft at those spots when (if we don't have a trade partner and don't like any QBs) we could get an instant starter to line up across from Woolen, or some other starting level player in another role we also need (though I'm sure we can find a trade down at 5 this year no problem if we don't want to take a remaining QB)",3.0,seahawks,t3_10vgtph,False,0.0,None,2023-02-06T17:06:53Z,seahawks,0.4459
83,1138,1138,1620081392477,"This CB class is really good (with at least three ready to be starters on the outside as rookies) but I think this edge class (after Anderson) is a bit inflated, and full of athletic freaks with huge bust potential. 

I'm sure at least one of them will turn into a superstar but I'm really hoping we either take a QB, Witherspoon, or trade back instead of drafting two more project edge rushers like D. Jeremiah thinks we should.

At 5 I'd be excited for Levis or Stroud if PCJS want them, and Witherspoon if not, and if we trade down or use our later pick, I like:

- Devon Witherspoon, Christian Gonzalez (CB)

- O'Cyrus Torrence (G)

- Drew Sanders, Trenton Simpson (LB)

Tyree Wilson and Myles Murphy are both projects, and Nolan Smith and Will McDonald are both probably situational pass rushers like Taylor. If we take any of them I want it in late late first with a 3rd pick from a trade back or in the 2nd round since we already have Mafe and Taylor on the back burners. Also if BPA is a CB, it would be great to have another really good corner (who would be cheap also) to play across from Tariq.

This is what I like most. Very few QBs picked high ever get the chance to have good support, and anyone who comes here has great coaches, culture, and also weapons at WR and RB. They also get a pair of really good, young tackles and possibly a good mentor in Geno to ease them in. 

I also have to say that for the QBs I really do like all of them quite a bit. I think Stroud and Levis are both projects but I love their traits (and I love that Stroud is a Seahawk's fan haha). I would be so excited if we spend capital on any QB in the 1st because I think PCJS are great at evaluating them and if we take one then I think it means we have a great shot at finding someone special",1.0,seahawks,t3_10j7o78,False,0.0,None,2023-01-27T09:37:11Z,seahawks,0.1849878450788752

Players like Tyree Wilson and Myles Murphy are definitely going in the top 15 or top 10 but that's just on their athletic ability alone. They are still projects with huge bust potential.

I really really really want us to draft starters over projects this year, so that's why I especially like the idea of Stroud/Levis/Witherspoon (if they like the QB obviously) at 5 and then with our second pick (or if we trade down) to take anyone on your list there (plus Gonzales).

We already have 2 projects at edge so when D.Jerimiah says we should take Tyree Wilson and McDonald (both projects and McDonald is underweight and situational pass rusher) I really really hope that doesn't happen when there are like 3 corners who can start year 1 and could line up with Tariq and Coby.

3192,29385,29385,Brailledit,"The Roman presence on the peninsula basically followed the same pattern as the Greek commercial bases, but unlike the Greeks, Rome's introduction to Iberia was the result of a power struggle with Carthage to gain control of the Western Mediterranean during the 2nd century B.C. In any case, it was at this point that the Iberian Peninsula as a geographic unit entered the arena of international politics and, by virtue of its privileged location between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and its rich agricultural and mineral resources in the south, became a much coveted strategic objective.

The Roman invasion and eventual conquest of the peninsula took place over the long period between 218 and 19 B.C. The Romans were alarmed by the Carthaginian expansion to the northeast; like Napoleon centuries later, they believed that the Ebro River delineated a natural boundary with Gaul, which was then a Roman province.

This conflict of interests led to the Second Punic War. While Hannibal was making his legendary journey across the Alps, the Roman legions were attacking his Spanish base at Carthago Nova (present-day Cartagena), with its seaport and mines. Hannibal's defeat by Publius Cornelius Scipio (209 B.C.) not only marked the beginning of the end for his army in Italy; it was also the beginning of the Roman conquest of Spain.",55.0,nfl,t3_10rvp67,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2023-02-02T15:09:06Z,seahawks,-0.008208255726099
3193,29386,29386,Brailledit,"Based on the findings at Atapuerca (Burgos province), estimated to be around 800,000 years old, the presence of hominids on the Iberian Peninsula dates back to the Lower Palaeolithic period. Experts are still debating the origin of these early settlers, who may have entered the peninsula directly from Africa via the Straits of Gibraltar, but more likely arrived by crossing over the Pyrenees. In any case, the remains of utensils and works of art found on the peninsula are certainly from this period, corresponding to the same hunter-gatherer cultures that existed in other parts of Europe.

Moreover, the Iberian Peninsula constituted the western boundary of a process of cultural dissemination that began in on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean around the fifth millennium B.C. Known as the Neolithic Revolution, this process consisted of the transition from a collector economy to a producer economy based on agriculture and stockbreeding. Another period in the history of the peninsula began around 5000 or 4000 B.C. and lasted until the 16th century A.D., which was characterised by the dominant role of the Mediterranean basin and civilisations.",120.0,nfl,t3_10rvp67,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2023-02-02T14:50:40Z,seahawks,1.987024356955253e-05

Coby Bryant looked pretty nifty on some of his nickel blitzes as a rookie, but his sample size for rushes is also low. 

One thing to pay attention to are the grades for what PFF calls “true pass sets” because they focus on just those plays where the player has a genuine opportunity to rush the passer.  

Darrell Taylor, while horrible against the run, had an 80 grade in true pass rush sets.  Meanwhile, Nwosu’s grade drops off to a 65 in true pass rush opportunities; in part because he was keyed on in obvious passing situations as we lacked a top pass rusher and in part because he’s not that dynamic an athlete and relies more on savvy and hustle to generate pressure. 

Woods and Harris were both significantly better in true pass sets, while Collier, Jefferson, Irvin, and Mafe were all below average in those situations when we needed them to make an impact as rushers.  

Jefferson’s grade is probably the most interesting because they rate him as significantly below average as a pass rusher despite the fact that he converted a high percentage of his pressures into sacks.  Jefferson is horrible against the run, one of the worst on the team, and grades as below average as a rusher overall and in true pass sets.

4736,39965,39965,Chessinmind,"Ryan Neal filled in really well for Jamal Adams and was having a career year before hurting his knee. He ended up being the highest graded safety in the league.  His best game was the win over the Chargers when he had a 93.9 grade, broke up three passes, had an INT, limited them to 3.3 yards a reception, and had four run stops.  Neal is an RFA and an easy second round tender decision. He can play all over the field, and there are options to use three safety formations next season when Adams returns from injury.  He was at his best when playing in the box, probably because it allowed Quandre Diggs to play his natural position.  

Speaking of Diggs, he had a very good year overall after bouncing back from a dislocated ankle and broken leg.  He allowed just 47.6% of passes to be completed against him.  He was at his best while playing single high coverage over the deep third of the field, when given that opportunity, with a team-best 31.1 snaps per target and 65.3 snaps per reception allowed.  He had 70+ grades in the three final games, as the defensive coaches hit a nice schematic groove, including a 91.1 overall grade in the season finale against the Rams.  

Rookie of the year candidate Tariq Woolen had quite a first season in the NFL.  A 6’4 corner with 34” arms, a 42” vertical, and a 4.26 electronically-timed 40, Riq the Freak was one of the most spectacular athletes to enter the professional ranks this season.  He allowed just 55.3% of passes to be completed against him.  He displayed an amazing ability to recover on plays where he initially misread a receiver or coverage assignment.  In addition to leading Pro Football Reference’s passer rating allowed metric, he also shared the league title for interceptions.  

Playing opposite Tariq, Michael Jackson had an interesting season.  On the one hand, he started all 18 games, shared the team league in pass breakups with Woolen, and allowed a respectable 88.4 passer rating allowed by PFF’s calculations.  Jackson had great coverage games against the Rams, Giants, and Chiefs.  There were times in that Chiefs game where it seemed Mahomes had nowhere to go with the football, despite lots of time in the pocket to make those decisions, because of some stellar coverage play by Jackson, Woolen, Diggs, etc.  He also had some terrible games: 122 yards and a TD allowed in the loss to the Raiders, six games with a coverage grade below 47.  This was by far the most he’s playing in the NFL, and he showed at times he can play well in this league. 

Coby Bryant had kind of a similar season as Jackson.  Both were starting for their first time in the NFL.  Both attracted targets every 6.9 coverage snaps, as some opposing quarterbacks sought to avoid Woolen and Diggs.  The general feeling is a positive one for both players, even though there was some inconstancy in play.  Great games against the Cardinals, Chargers, and Jets.  And some not so great games against the Falcons, Bucs, and Niners. He’s a very cerebral player with limited lateral movement to keep up with the speedier slot receivers. 

There’s no point in piling on ILBs Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton.  They were the worst coverage linebacker duo in the league, but Barton is a free agent and Brooks had ACL surgery last week.  Brooks was just as bad if not worse in coverage during his first two years in the league.   On the positive side for the position, Tanner Muse looked awesome in coverage in the those final few games without Brooks.  They may have struck gold with Muse, but they won’t know for sure until he plays more next season.  Either way, they need to sign and/or draft a top ILB to help fix this defense.

**Without Trades**:

1. **Pick 1.5:** Will Anderson Jr (Edge, Alabama): Arizona surprises everyone and takes Myles Murphy at #3, allowing Anderson to fall to #5. 
2. **Pick 1.20**: O'Cyrus Torrence (OG, Florida): Hawks get a day 1 starter to replace Gabe Jackson, who's been/will be released. A mean interior run blocker with a fairly high floor and even higher ceiling. 
3. **Pick 2.37:** Siaki Ika (NT, Baylor): A 360lb natural nose tackle. A rotational player to help relieve Al Woods, becoming an everyday starter in year two.
4. **Pick 2.51:** Jack Campbell (LB, Iowa): A violent wrap-up tackler with a knack for sniffing out runs and misdirections, with sideline-to-sideline speed. Adds immediate depth with the ability to displace Barton/Muse as the starter, with the eventual return of Brooks midseason.
5. **Pick 3.83**: Tyrique Stevenson (CB, Miami): A strong and long corner with great ball skills -- Pete can't pass him up in the 3rd round.
6. **Pick 4.122**: Zach Evans (RB, Ole Miss): More criticism incoming to the Hawks FO for drafting a RB only one year after taking Walker II in the 2nd round. Evans is a powerful runner between the tackles with great burst -- a deadly 1-2 punch to relieve Walker.
7. **Pick 5.152:** Rashad Torrence II (S, Florida): The second ""Torrence"" from Florida taken in this draft. Torrence is an athletic, physical safety with great instincts. 
8. **Pick 5.155**: Henry To'oTo'o (LB, Alabama): An athletic inside linebacker who excels in zone coverage. 
9. **Pick 6.195**: Ricky Stromberg (C, Arkansas): A high IQ center and nasty run blocker. Stromberg will surprise many due to his productivity as a 6th round pick, while also frustrating the fan base with his below-average pass protection.

**With Trades**: 

1. **Pick 1.5**: With CJ Stroud still being available at Pick #5, the Seahawks trade Pick #5 to Carolina for picks #9, #39, and #114. John Schneider surprises nobody, picking up a 2nd and a 4th rd pick to move back 4 spots.
2. **Pick 1.9**: Tyree Wilson (DL, Texas Tech): At 6'6/275lbs, Wilson becomes a day 1 starter at the DE position in year 2 of the Hawks 3-4 defense, immediately improving *both* the pass rush as well as the run defense. 
3. **Pick 1.20**: O'Cyrus Torrence (OG, Florida): Hawks get a day 1 starter to replace Gabe Jackson, who's been/will be released. A mean interior run blocker with a fairly high floor and even higher ceiling. 
4. **Pick 1.37**: BJ Ojulari (Edge, LSU): A well-rounded Edge who can get after the passer and set the edge on the run.
5. **Pick 1.39**: Drew Sanders (LB, Arkansas): An instinctual pass rusher who also excels in zone coverage, with the versatility to play both inside and outside.
6. **Pick 1.51**: JL Skinner (S, Boise State): Reminiscent of Bam Bam with his 6'4/220lb frame, and room to put on weight without losing athleticism. Pete Carrol gets an enforcer as a depth piece, with Adams' ability to stay healthy in question.
7. **Pick 3.83**: Jaquelin Roy (DT, LSU): A powerful NT with the strength and quickness to demand a double team.
8. **Pick 4.114**: Kendre Miller (RB, TCU): A powerful runner between the tackles and strong pass protector with great hands and receiving ability -- the Hawks new 3rd down back to spell Walker.
9. **Pick 4.122**: Zacch Pickens (DT, South Carolina): Another athletic interior D lineman who can anchor against the run. With Al Woods entering the last year of his contract at 36 years old, and with Poona on his way out, Seattle solves for their future while addressing two of their biggest weakness entering this draft -- pass rush and run defense.
10. **Pick 5.152**: Dontayvion Wicks (WR, Virginia): With good size, strong hands, and elite acceleration, Wicks adds some much-needed depth to the receiver room.
11. **Pick 5.155**: Julius Brents (CB, Kansas State): A 6'4 corner in the 5th round. Pete does what Pete does.
12. **Pick 6.195**: Javion Cohen (OG, Alabama): An athletically-gifted guard with room to clean up his technique.",2.0,seahawks,t3_10d9bh7,False,0.0,:sea1:​,2023-01-17T15:01:12Z,seahawks,0.0073072727538285

As SEAinLA said, taking a LB in the 2nd is hardly a reach. I know analysts/commentators/random people on the internet have stressed positional value to death over the past few years, but the other side of that is that it's possible to get one of the best prospects at a position later.

EDGE1, QB1, DT1, will all be gone in the top 5. CB1 will probably be gone in the top 10. ILB/MLB1 might be there at 20 and ILB2 might be there at 37. Compare that to taking something like the 7th EDGE and the positional value starts to be neutralized.

Those contracts are:

* Nwosu(2022) - 2 years $19.055m
* Myers(2019) - 4 years $15.45m
* Ed Dickson(2018) - 3 years $10.7m

8483,64614,64614,Esuu,"Ah fair, I must have missed that. Either way it doesn't change the market value of a QB of Lock's caliber. 

*Even if* PC/JS are still really high on Lock there's no reason for them to do something out of line with the market. We saw the same thing last season. They clearly thought highly of Geno, but still only gave him $3.5m with incentives.",2.0,seahawks,t3_10h16fi,False,0.0,​,2023-01-20T12:28:44Z,seahawks,0.115364256
8484,64615,64615,Esuu,">So for me his contract is going to be very telling. If JS gives him 3-5 and like 20-25mil. He is the guy of the future and we are not looking to draft QB. If we give him 1-2 and like 10mil, or wait to get him done till after the draft then JS really likes a guy and wants to try and get him while not fully thinking Lock can be the guy.

Back-up QBs almost never get more than 1-year deals. Some of the backup QB contracts last season were:

* Teddy Bridgewater - 1 yr $6.5m
* Tyrod Taylor - 2 yr $11m
* Jacoby Brissett - 1 yr $4.65m
* Case Keenum - 1 yr $3.5m
* Joe Flacco - 1 yr $3.5m
* Colt McCoy - 2 yr $7m
* Nick Foles - 1 yr $6.2m
* Andy Dalton - 1 yr $3m

Bridgewater, Taylor, and Brissett are all much closer to that bridge QB/borderline starter than Lock is so you can ignore those contracts. All of the others are at $3.5m or below. Given it's a new season and a higher salary cap I could see 1 year $4m for Lock being not quite huge overpay territory. I would expect something more like 1 year $3-3.5m or 2 years $7m if we are going to re-sign him.

I think too much has been made of Lock being involved in the trade. It was probably just an easy way to get an up-close look at a guy with good tools/physical traits and get a cheap backup in the process. For all we know Lock being involved in the trade was Denver's idea because they didn't want a backup for fans to clamor for if things went sideways this season. 

I wouldn't be surprised if they bring him back this year, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they don't and grab a QB in the late second or 3rd to be the back-up/developmental QB, assuming we re-sign Geno. Either way, don't read into it when they throw Lock 1-2 years and below $10m.

Not a blue chip prospect like Carter or Anderson, but a hell of a consolation prize. Has insane measurables and will be a combine star. Needs to develop pass rush moves but at 21 years old he has as high a ceiling as anyone in the draft. 

19/20. Top CB available/Trenton Simpson

This pick is a little tougher to project without knowing what happens before us. I really like the idea of taking a stud CB if one of Ringo, Porter Jr., or Gonzalez falls to us. I know we have Woolen and CB, but keeping CB in the nickel and pairing woolen with a stud on the outside will help every level of our defense.

Good size and athleticism. Highly productive at UO who excels in run defense. Great motor and a big hitter. Think he fits and the positional need is filled. Missing some sideline to sideline quickness we like but excels in the box running downhill.

If both Jalen Carter and Will Anderson are gone, as well as any worthy quarterbacks then Seattle should trade down. I’ll finish my write ups later today for these picks. Definitely wanted to double down on the d-line in the second round. Would probably have taken a center if one was available in the 4th round, or even the 3rd round. Joe Tippmann will be a name to watch out for day two of the draft to fill the middle of the o-line. 

9.
Peter Skoronski
OT Northwestern

Best linemen in this class, will be better suited to play as a guard. Move him to the left side next to Cross and let Lewis play in his natural position on the right side. Building the team through the trenches should be the blueprint for the Seahawks this upcoming draft. 

25.
Lukas Van Ness
EDGE Iowa

Big athletic and quick off the edge, young and still learning the position. Is able to play both on the inside and outside, a versatile player who’s got a high motor and tremendous upside. Will probably go higher than 25, but if he’s available then Seattle should absolutely take him. 

37.
Calijah Kancey
DT Pittsburgh

Honestly reminds me a bit of Donald due to his build, even played at the same school. He’s a fiery player who never gives up on the play, always attacking. Not a tall DT but doesn’t matter due to his strength and lower balance while shedding blocks. He’s already getting first round buzz, so be on the look out for his combine. 


39.
Jalin Hyatt
WR Tennessee

Track star speedster that can take the top off the defense, not a technical route runner but has soft hands. Plays a lot like Will Fuller. 

52.
Mazi Smith
DT Michigan

Great strength and physicality, can shut down the run and take on blockers without a problem. He’s going to test as one of the best DTs in this draft class, would fit Seattle’s scheme and most likely start day one as a nose tackle.

First off, apologies for this being so delayed. Been on the road for work and just got back in town last night. 

But anyway enough of that, we've got football to talk about. It's been an exciting year! Didn't end the way any of us wanted it to, but nonetheless it's always an enjoyable ride with this community. Below are the grades from the Wild Card game, final season overall rankings in all categories, and below that are links to every PFF Grades post from this season. I'm glad so many people enjoy these posts as much as I enjoy providing them and discussing them with all of you. 

Looking forward to (hopefully) an exciting draft, offseason discussion, and another great year of Seahawks football in 2023!

Hope everyone has a wonderful 2023 and as always, Go Hawks! 

u/baconwise, I know the Mod Team pinned this post last year, so if you feel like doing that again, go nuts. Thank you to you and all the mods for helping regulate this place throughout the season!

For Comeback Player of the Year, it's a toss-up.   All of the contenders have great cases.

Edge players under contract in 2023:

Boye Mafe, Alton Robinson, Tyreke Smith, Uchenna Nwosu, Darrell Taylor.  You can play with this group.

Interior D Line players under contract in 2023:

Shelby Harris (salary cap problem), Quinton Jefferson (average at best), Al Woods (36 years old next year), Bryan Mone (average), Jarrod Hewitt (jag depth).  This group is not ready to compete at a high level.

For this reason, it would probably be more fortunate for Jalen Carter to fall than Will Anderson.  Even though I think Carter comes with much more risk than Anderson.

Seahawks probably need to acquire 2-3 defensive tackles this offseason.

Daron Payne might be available this off season and would require a lot of cap space.  In the draft: Jalen Carter, Bryan Bresee, Siaki Ika, Calijah Kancey, Mazi Smith, Keeanu Benton, Byron Young, Zach Pickens, Gervon Dexter.

It would be nice if they could completely rebuild the interior d line.  Even if it means they dont add any edge players.

But Will Anderson actually played the run very well in college and his ceiling is Von Miller.  Jalen Carter and Will Anderson wont both be there, so you just take whichever one falls.  Which is possible if 3 QBs go in the top five.

28187,231380,231380,danish07,"My point is that you and a lot of others I’ve listened to are critical of the teams cap management, and I was providing context to show that the Seahawks are actually one of the best managed teams in the league capwise. They are very responsible with the cap. I think their biggest mistakes capwise have been trading draft picks for expensive veterans, but that was the choice they made. 

I’m not disagreeing with everything you said, I just don’t think it’s so dreadful.  I don’t think the team planned on paying 2nd tier QB money this year, and their cap situation reflects that.  Letting Geno walk is a valid strategy moving forward. It depends on how serious they are about Drew Lock and this rookie QB class. 

Yes, they have holes. They just finished year one of a rebuild so I’m not sure what your expectations are but I think so far so good.  They have a lot of ammunition in this draft and could acquire another 5-6 starters if things go as well as last year. And if they stick with their best player available strategy they could pull that off. 

Interior LB is certainly a need. I don’t think they need 3 but probably 2 and they won’t be full strength until Brooks is back. 

I’m pretty neutral on the safety position. Both Adams and Diggs have painful cap hits. I can go either way with those two. I think you must bring Neal back. It doesn’t matter what you’re paying at safety, a 2nd round tender costs $4 mil or so. You barely save anything if you let him walk and sign another veteran. 

I would be tempted to sign your favorite guard/tackle convert and a center in the draft, and just move forward with an elite o line.  Although our center is smart enough to have value, and just good enough that you can hide him if he is surrounded by good guards. 

Our edge players are probably good enough, but our defensive tackle group is dreadful and needs major investment.  Serious draft capital and maybe a splash FA/trade needs to go here.  There might be opportunities if you let Geno walk. 

RB is absolutely a need. The only RB they have under contract are Kenneth Walker and Deejay Dallas. 

Also, our cap space tied up on QB last year was just under $30 mil. If we retain Geno it would might be similar, depending on how they structure the contract.",12.0,seahawks,t3_10tln4s,False,0.0,None,2023-02-04T13:41:27Z,seahawks,2.1995869544812798e-08

28201,231399,231399,danish07,"Basically the Seahawks need a better defensive line so people are just mocking the best available defensive lineman to them.  But it's worth looking at what we actually have on the roster for 2023.

EDGE

In 2022, Seahawks rostered 5-6 edge players: LJ Collier, Boye Mafe, Bruce Irvin, Uchenna Nwosu, Darrell Taylor.  Alton Robinson, Tyreke Smith, and Darryl Johnson were on the IR.

In 2023, Seahawks have 5 edge players under contract: Boye Mafe, Alton Robinson, Tyreke Smith, Uchenna Nwosu, Darrell Taylor.  

So for EDGE, they are prepared to go into 2023 with what they have, despite possibly losing LJ Collier and Bruce Irvin.  But the position lacks a game wrecker and it lacks depth in case of injury.  EDGE is not our biggest need and it would be hard to justify taking more than 1, maybe 2.  I would say if best player available ends up being an EDGE player like Will Anderson or Tyree Wilson, then so be it.  

INTERIOR D LINE

In 2022, Seahawks rostered 5-6 DTs: Poona Ford, Shelby Harris, Quinton Jefferson, Al Woods, Myles Adams.  Bryan Mone finished on the IR.

In 2023, Seahawks have five DTs under contract: Shelby Harris, Quinton Jefferson, Al Woods, Bryan Mone, and Jarrod Hewitt.

IDL doesn't really look ready to go at all.  They will probably let Poona Ford go since he doesnt seem to fit the new scheme.  Shelby Harris is a cap problem, Quinton Jefferson is just a guy, Al Woods is getting very old, Bryan Mone is an average space eating NT coming off an injury, and I am not sure if Jarrod Hewitt is even supposed to make the team.  You could legitimately draft 2 or 3 defensive tackles and they could all be upgrades.

So in my opinion, defensive tackle is unquestionably the bigger need over edge, and they should lean that way if it comes down to similarly graded players.  Disruption from the interior is rare and valuable, and they might have a chance at players like Jalen Carter and Calijah Kancey.

The point is that the dead money has already been paid, but it looks to me like he doesn't have any guaranteed money going forward, so you actually end up saving $24 million on the cap over the next three years by cutting him, with no remaining guaranteed money to pay.

So $19 million is the number everybody should have in their head when discussing Geno Smith and free agency.  Yes there will probably be some cuts. But every player who gets cut usually creates dead cap and then also creates another empty roster spot that has to be filled.  


It is unlikely they franchise tag Geno. The full ~$32 million franchise tag would go against the cap, and I believe the cap space has to be available at signing.  So this would be hard to do and they probably won’t go that route.

Kenny McIntosh would be an instant upgrade at backup RB and 3rd down back.

We need one of these good centers.  Sedrick Van Pran,  John Michael Schmidtz, Luke Wypler, Ricky Stromberg, Joe Tippman, and a couple others.  Just pick your favorite center.

Darnell Washington (6'7 270lbs) is a unicorn beast at TE who can run like a rhino and make one-handed catches.  Put him in the 3 TE set and get a great blocker plus red zone threat and chain mover.

Zay Flowers is the receiver that Dee Eskridge was suppose to be.  

Siaki Ika (6'4 350 lbs) and Mazi Smith (6'3 337lbs) are two defensive nose tackles that could be really good.  Ika is huge, hard to move, and takes on double teams.  Smith is insanely athletic for his size.  

Tuli Tuipulotu (6'4 290lb) edge rusher led FBS with 13.5 sacks this year on a terrible USC defense.   He received the Morris Trophy for best defensive lineman in the Pac 12.

29752,248832,248832,gavincantdraw,"I want to share a few things about non-profits to put the article in perspective. As someone who works at a nonprofit, I will say that it is not abnormal for a non-profit to spend over half of its funds on staffing and benefits. So if you see a non-profit doing that, that is not at all abnormal or malicious. However, it is not common for a three person nonprofit staff to make half a million annually.

What is particularly egregious though, assuming this is all intentional excess and not someone who makes a ton of money being clueless about money management, is that WNY is running primarily on unrestricted funding, which is basically solid gold to nonprofits.

For many organizations, funds are obtained through grants. Grant funding is typically (though not always) **restricted** funding. In applying for grants, the organization states their intentions for the funding and must abide by this intention in how they spend it. Thus if the grant is for feeding school aged children, and you meet a kid who needs a backpack, you can't use money from that grant to buy the backpack without getting permission from the funder. Sure buying a school aged child a backpack is a good thing to do, but the funds are for food.

However, if the funding is **unrestricted** (typically acquired through donations), you can buy the kid a backpack and a new pair of shoes because you happened to noticed his were tattered.

So for WYN to have primarily unrestricted funding and pay salaries instead of taking advantage of their flexibility is a slap in the face to nonprofits who are limited by restricted funds.",1.0,seahawks,t3_10xc1pi,False,0.0,None,2023-02-08T16:52:28Z,seahawks,0.0024015882497899

First off, fans should never be antagonizing in another teams' sub. It's stupid and immature. Anyone who came here after that trade with the intent of cause problems is stupid. I want to be clear on that before I say anything else. If a Seahawks fan came here to cause problems (and I know some did), they're an idiot. Anything I say from hence forth does not justify the actions of anyone who did that.

I think there's a lot that happened in the Seattle media market that was missed by most NFL fans that provides context for Seattle fans being pissed at Russ. For one, he was trying to stay the babyface while demanding out. He would say the things fans wanted to hear in interviews and then leak the teams he wanted to go to. Contrary to what some claim, Seattle did try to get him line support. The team just whiffed in the draft, which is a very normal thing for teams to do. However the team did trade for Duane Brown (at Wilson's request) and Gabe Jackson, putting veterans on his blind side. This in addition to things like signing Greg Olsen, made some fans feel like the team accommodated Russ as best they could with his salary.

While I cannot speak for members of this sub (I avoided football reddit altogether after the trade as I was hella bummed), I do know there were Bronco fans on social media who were rubbing it in and saying that PCJS were fleeced. This (along with years of prior division rivalry) sparked the animosity as it felt like salt in the wound. So when Russ struggled, there was an unparalleled level of schadenfreude. I had wanted him to succeed (6,000 yrds passing but losing every game for the sake of the picks Seattle had), but even I experienced this euphoria as Seattle sat atop their division while the Denver picks just went higher and higher on the board. Remembering the Broncos fans that were rubbing it in, some lashed out.

Once again, anyone who came into this sub to cause problems was wrong and an idiot and should be banned not just from this sub but the Seahawks sub.

Personally, I believed (and still believe) Russ is a unique quarterback. I've never had so much fun watching a QB. He has that ability to win a game because he just feels like doing it. I think he just needs structure to be at that level again. Some people do well with free reign (Brady, Manning), others need someone who can build a structure that allows them to succeed (Wilson, Allen). I think Sean Payton can do that.

I do also want to note, that NO fans just got picks for a coach who was not going to come back and coach the Saints, where as Wilson was the active leader of the offense in Seattle. So the dynamic is a little different in regards to these trades.

Anyways, hope there's not too many typos as I have no desire to proofread right now. I also hope you guys don't take Sean Desai from Seattle because I think he did wonders for the rookie CB's.",2.0,denverbroncos,t3_10ur5kg,False,0.0,None,2023-02-06T14:25:21Z,seahawks,0.0139352632560954

Jadeveon Clowney was indisputably the best defender going into the 2014 draft. He quickly proved he was good in his rookie season, but we now know that Khalil Mack (5th overall) and Aaron Donald (12th overall) were better options. It seems obvious now, but in January 2014, everyone felt differently.

Just because Seattle can't draft the indisputable one and two doesn't mean they won't still have a chance at a great player. I understand being bummed out because Seattle is a playoff team with a top 5 pick and this is the closest the team will ever get to a number one pick without imploding. I was playing those mock draft simulators to pick Jalen Carter at #3 all season as well.

The good- for a long time both our offense and defense seemed like they could hang with a top 4 NFL team. Geno is a great bridge. K9 is a bonafide NFL starting RB. DK is a superstar. woolen is a superstar. 

The bad - defense. Tackling. Drives with rhythm. Barton.

The only good team he has gotten to the playoffs in those 6 years were the 2020 Hawks and while I do think Pete had a piss poor game plan for that Rams game and playoff exit, I also think our colapse that year was bigger than that one game.

Pete has mastered the art of squeezing silver or out of trash, not gold mind you but silver. Unfortunately, he has also lead this team through 8+ years of bad to near worthless drafts that have had an especially big impact on our defense and offensive front. be Dynasties like the Cheifs and current 49ers stay alive through good to great drafting. Somehow Pete has managed to build winning teams in spite of terrible drafts.

This year I dont like to give Pete as much credit though as others, because if you had asked me before the draft if I thought this team could make the playoffs I would have laughed in your face. However, had you told me Geno was capable of leading the NFL in multiple passing metrics, that our rookies would be the best draft class in the NFL, the Rams and Cards would be 2 of the worst teams in the league, and that our schedule would end up being the second easiest, then I would have told you Umm yeah that team should absolutely make the playoffs and win 3/4 of the games against the NFC south. To me, Pete underperformed with what he ended up having this year. The surprise shouldnt be what Pete did to get this team to the Playoffs, it should be how much more talent he had than we all thought and how easy his path would end up being.

What I personally want from Pete is to have someone actually hold him accountable for a few seasons, hire someone to manage the clock, make some major changes to how they game plan (be more flexible week to week rather than trying to work so much on base defensive principles), give more control over the draft to JS, and finally keep his foot on the pedal a bit longer after we get a lead.",1.0,seahawks,t3_10j00r3,False,0.0,None,2023-01-23T00:46:42Z,seahawks,0.0372647393710312

He while talented and capable of keeping us in games also caused us the lose a few. As for can he win us games? I still don't think so, when called upon he hasnt just taken command of a game just yet. There are moments, but nothing enough to say Geno put the game on his shoulders. So by those two metrics I dont think Geno earned that big of a contract from us. So I dont think a 24m a year deal for example would be some big hometown discount, but rather a fair valuation from us.

32711,269608,269608,joergonix,"I have 3 main issues with trusting the ""system"" or Pete. First off I do think that he is one of the greatest coaches in NFL history. 

However, my first issue is that he is older, mental cognition, neuroplasticity, and creativity begin to fall off a cliff for even healthy 70 year olds. This leads to a lot of weird changes to the way a lot of healthy older people think and feel about the world around them, it shapes their strategies and daily practices. This isnt an issue of Pete is too old and dumb now, its an issue of age makes the brain work differently.

My second issue is that for all the things we give him so much credit for, he also has major flaws that he cant seem to escape and might be getting bigger with every passing year. Take this season for example, lets do a thought experiment here and say that in August someone had told you that our schedule would be historically easy, our rookie class would be the best in the NFL, and that Geno would break a few of Russes records and lead the NFL in multiple passing metrics. Now they also tell you that we lost all 4 games to the weakest division in football and we were a one and done playoff team. How do you feel about the coaching once you have filled in a few of the variables? To me Pete deserves some credit for Geno, and a bit of credit for these young guys, although hard to say how much was John vs Pete. However, with all that credit how do we not manage good enough play calling, game planning, and game / clock management to win 1 game against the weakest division in football? Pete has strengths, many of them, but his weaknesses are costing very winnable games.

Finally you should never trust systems without checks and balances and accountability. Pete currently has almost none. Pete is the Seahawks dictator, and a very stubborn one at that. I'll give that his methods have resulted in quite a few playoff births, but we have only won a single playoff game since the death of Paul Allen and the effective crowning of Pete. We need ownership that is motivated to win and hold Pete accountable.",4.0,seahawks,t3_10fv1i8,False,0.0,None,2023-01-19T11:01:12Z,seahawks,0.0477398122236845

32714,269611,269611,joergonix,"I dont know what decision I would make if given the power honestly, but here are some good reasons why. 

1. When Pete says always compete, he really means always being competitive. This for better or worse means that high picks like this dont come around often for us. Sure we could find a QB later on, look the 49ers just did jt, we did it with Russ, the GOAT was a 6th rounder, but the odds are way better with those top 10 guys. Look at the starting QBs in the AFC right now, its nuts.

2. Positional financial advantage of drafting a QB. The highest paid QB makes 50m the next highest paid non QB player makes 60% as much. Teams dont just take QBs high because of how they think they will change their franchises. They do it because for the $35m we will pay Geno you could pay a rookie QB and 2 above NFL average play makers for 3-5 years. The real question is draft a QB and sign an all pro guy like Aaron Donald / CMC / Mack / Bosa / Hill to pair with them or 2 above average probowl caliber guys. Or keep Geno and eat 35m in cap and draft a player that best case scenario could be a 20-25m a year player.

Teams draft not just based on need or who is the most talented on the board. They draft based on how much money they would have to pay to have a similar player at that position.

3. You want to add a QB to an offense that has all the right pieces rather than add a QB to an offense that is critical play makers short even without a QB. Gift a rookie QB an offense with the best WR duo in the NFL, some great TEs, a young but talented line, and an incredible RB room. Grab a young QB in a few years and who knows if Lockett will still be around or DK will extend or if we can afford to keep the offensive line together.

4. If this year proved anything in the NFL it proved that its easier to draft a QB than buy one. Russ, Watson, Ryan, Stafford all stunk. Meanwhile an historically bad QB class still produced 2-3 starters.

All that, but I still like Geno, I think his price will be fair, and best case is it will take multiple seasons for a good rookie to be at his level. The pros of getting a rookie though are hard to ignore, and while we all want to make an emotional decision, unfortunately this one is far more nuanced. Sadly the last thing I want us to do is draft a rookie and sit him behind Geno, it would be a waste of the competitive advantage a rookie gives to your cap. Some teams have done it, but mostly with cheaper QBs under contract already. I also dont think it's fair to Geno. I dont see Geno wanting to be somewhere where he doesnt believe that he is both the present and the future of that franchise.",1.0,seahawks,t3_10fhnlp,False,0.0,None,2023-01-18T22:11:49Z,seahawks,-0.000287246447482

32719,269617,269617,joergonix,"First off my opinion of Geno is that he has a ball control issue. He had 20 combined interceptions and fumbles, led the league in interceptable passes, and led the league in intentional grounding penalties. He also has a habit of taking deep sacks especially in critical moments. That said he put up great numbers otherwise, but never really displayed the ability to put the game on his shoulders like some QBs can. So should we keep him? It just depends on the type of team Pete and JS want to build, but Geno has his flaws. The reality is that we are seeing Geno through the perspective of low expectations which he far exceeded. He also put up big numbers for a team that was often behind in games because of a bad defense. QBs always put up huge yardage when their teams are asked to catch up in games.

As for the top 5 pick you have to be mindful of value at position and the likelihood of us having a high pick again soon. QBs have enormous rookie value not because everyone gets so excited for them or their game wrecking abilities or blah blah, but because they are expensive as fuck. Bad QBs will cost your team as much as your best player. So a rookie QB at 5 has a ton of value. If you assume Geno will cost us 35m and a rookie will cost you 5ish. You could gamble on a player like Carter or 30 million in savings gets you an Aaron Donald like player to pair with your rookie QB or better yet 2 15m per year pass rushers.

Im not claiming that we have to use the 5th for a QB, just that the idea isnt all that cut and dry and it very much depends on the team Pete and John want to build.

My point is that if by some miracle we get to pick 5 and not all 3 of those guys are taken, the mere prospect of the Seahawks picking a QB (which they definitely could) would most likely convince the Raiders, the Falcons or the Panthers to trade for 5. There's no way Levis' physical traits wouldn't convince at least one of those teams to pull the trigger.

34763,303006,303006,rickg,"*EDIT: I realized I didn't actually answer. So.. my answer would be Geno, but finding a way to reduce his '23 cap hit via deal structure.* 

*Why? Because my fear would be that the FAs would not make up for the reduced quality of QB play. If PC feels that Lock is 90% of Geno, though, that would be different. In other words, this is almost unanswerable since none of us know what Lock looks like now and relying on past performance is not necessarily a good guide - see everyone's impressions of Geno 12 months ago.* 

First, depending on deal structure etc, the team could drop Geno's cap hit to almost nothing in 2023, so this is kind of a meaningless exercise But... hey, I have coffee to drink so...

The amount of money you have to spend in FA only matters if you can add guys who a) are in positions where you need to upgrade and b) who are a noticeable upgrade. Cap space is a tool but you can't just say ""we have $40m"" wave your wand and boom, the right guys sign here. So the real answer is 'where do we need help, what guys in those positions are FAs, are they worth what they're asking'?

Basically - ""can we really spend the extra $20m in FA wisely, in ways that help us significantly""?

The advantage of a rookie QB is only partially in FAs and really that's temporary. It's more that, if you've drafted well, you can pay the stars you've developed vs letting them walk.

>From Weeks 6 through 18, Walker — among running backs — ranked fifth in rushing yards (904) and rushing touchdowns (eight), fourth in first downs (46) and second in explosive runs (21). He averaged 4.4 yards per rush in that stretch and had five 100-yard games. Among running backs with at least 100 carries in the regular season, Walker ranked fifth in explosive run rate (10.5 percent).  
Walker may win Offensive Rookie of the Year in February after leading all rookie skill players in scrimmage yards (1,215) and touchdowns (nine). He’s the real deal. And the 22-year-old Walker made a strong case to be the team’s lead running back going forward even if the team decides to re-sign Penny, who is going to be an unrestricted free agent entering his age-27 season.

>“The question about running backs is not what are their totals, but what do they get compared to what another running back would get if they had the same opportunities with the same blocking in the same scheme,” Schatz said. “And the fact is that Walker was not very good at success rate. He had a few highlight runs and then a lot of runs where he got stuffed for minimal gains.
