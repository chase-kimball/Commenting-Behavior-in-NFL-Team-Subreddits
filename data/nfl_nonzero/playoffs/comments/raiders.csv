I guess for me it always comes down to hindsight, every weekend the NFL some coaches a genius because he makes a call that he would have looked like an idiot had it not gone his way. And some coach makes a play call that doesn't go his way and he looks stupid but it was actually the call most coaches would have made.

All of us get to come after the fact and say what the real thing was. That doesn't make any sense to me.

The other thing that is hard to understand is what a coach is trying to actually achieve when they're calling plays. Instance with JMD everyone says he's too conservative in the second half. But I watched a lot of Patriots football over the years in the playoffs and they seem to be very conservative when they have a lead. They rely on the defense to make stops and the offense to burn clock. And I think that's what he was trying to do, even if he was just trying to get his players to start doing that this year.

From my perspective, he was training our players on how to close games and win the right way, not be gunslingers. And it didn't work out because we haven't had consistency in this organization for a long time, and our players were terrible in many instances.

Others blame the defense. So many people thought that playoffs in 2021 meant more in 2022. And now that 2 things have happened, and it's only 2 things (Carr leaving and a 6-11 season) they have completely switched to ""our roster is full of holes"" and we are going to suck forever. 

The roster has holes. Full of them? No. 
We made the playoffs scoring less and giving up more points than we did this year. That's fucling wild man. 
The team has offensive weapons, a good left tackle, a great young guard, a tackle who wasn't compete crap as a rookie and can play, and a serviceable center who can be cut if needed for a cheaper option. What's missing? A qb. And the stidham game vs the 49ers shows what? That stiddy is a stud? No. That weapons matter.  The chiefs game exposed Stiddy as not being great. Ok no worries. The offensive holes are really just the qb. 

The defense? 1st, like i said, it's important to remember they have up less points this year. Also important to remember: Hobbs missed 6 games, Rock missed 6 games, Deablo missed 9 games, Perryman missed 5 games, Jayon brown missed 9 games, and Chandler, after he started playing well missed the last two games. That's a lot of missed time from your starters. And finally, free agency and the draft we are loaded both salary cap wise and draft pick wise. Yes we had a bunch of 1 year deals and need to re-sign some dudes and let others walk. That's normal.

I, personally, don't think (and this is now my opinion) he wants to do that. Here are my reasons: the Saints represent the best or 2nd best situation for him. The coaching staff is already in place, in a weak division, with a good defense and a good running back and good receiver (Olave, not necessarily Thomas). Also, they are in a dome, and the media market is a joke unlike if he went to the Jets, Commanders, etc. My second reason he'd agree to a trade instead of free agency is that while there is a *chance* a team willing to take on his contract wouldn't then in turn offer it to him on the open market, there's also the chance they won't. Meaning he could end up with a team/teams not offering him that amount. This is also sort of shown with the amount of reporting that teams will want to renegotiate the current contract. If they want to do it, that means he won't get it on the open market. 

So those are my reasons why I think he will accept a trade. 

Side note about other teams and why the Saints still remain the best option for him, trade or free agency:

Jets: the media and cold weather will kill him
Commanders: lack of talent, cold weather, media
Bucs: who is the offensive coordinator? Replacing Brady isn't a great desire of anyone
Colts: who is the coach? Coordinator? Etc
Panthers: lack of talent around him
Texans: lack of talent around him

There's such a dearth of objectivity on this sub it's... most of the time, ridiculous to even try to engage. But I'll for a moment act like we're going to treat each other with respect—at least you didn't call McDaniel a name like most of the children on here.

So objectively speaking we have a coach who is on his second try at being a HC. He says he's smarter and we'll just have to take his word on that for another season or two. He inherited a team that had a statistical run of dumb luck—and still barely made the playoffs in 2021 at 10-7. Regression to the mean would have the 2021 Raiders under normal circumstances *at least* 4 wins poorer at 6-11 and if the door actually swung completely the other way with 2022 being as bad as 2021 was good then the losses could have been 6-8 more. Remember what happened in 2017? How we all wondered why that team could be so bad after it was so good the year before? Well, regression to the mean.

Ziegler and McDaniels came in and tried to swim against the tide and claw back some of those games that would be lost to regression to the mean by trading for Adams and signing Jones. Didn't work. 

Of all the blame that has to go around for the Raiders failure to pick up in 2022 where they left off in 2021 an inordinate amount has to be laid at the feet of the QB who was/is due to be paid a guaranteed $40M between the next two seasons. 

[Unlike the Raiders of the last 30+ years](https://www.reddit.com/r/raiders/comments/10b12hd/the_history_and_the_dysfunction_of_the_raiders_as/) McDaniels and Ziegler made a cold, calculating, football/business move not based on emotion, pettiness, vindictiveness, or a desperate attempt at recapturing past glories or at least headlines in lieu of wins when they decided to move on from Carr.

That's what makes it *feel* like he's going to succeed. And to be clear, I don't have a ton of faith right now, but what I was really talking about is that as much as *things have changed* (moving on from Carr, hiring a new coach and GM within the last year) that should be enough to indicate that *things could change.*

Here's what I have hard time with. How do you know that they didn't have a conversation with him—or try to?

But honestly, that's completely besides the point. The Raiders made ***a solid football and business decision*** about Carr—EXACTLY what this franchise needs to turn things around. Not football moves on emotion or pettiness. Not football moves based on trying to recapture some mystical past. A football move based on solid, rational, team building tactics.

Davis and Zeigler and McDaniel all could have sat down and said that Carr was loyal, and that we fucked him over by never giving him a real defense, and that the poor guy had to learn 47 offensive schemes in just nine years, and that maybe we'll just ignore the Cardinals game, and the Steelers game, and the Rams game, and the Washington, Giants, and Bears games from last year—and maybe we'll just ignore that he's probably not the best fit for this new system and he's going to make a boatload of money next year which could very well lock us into a mediocre defense which we know doesn't work—we'll just ignore ALL OF THAT because well, Carr is a good dude. And we'll let him play the last two games against TWO TEAMS WITH A ~~GOOD~~ GREAT PASS RUSH and so what if he gets hurt it's just $30 MILLION DOLLARS.

In 1978 the NFL not only added two games to the schedule but they changed the rules to add more scoring by eliminating bump and run coverage and allowing offensive lineman to grab defenders with their hands. The reason? More scoring. Not only does the more scoring make the game more interesting to most fans but the increased scoring means more commercial breaks because of kick offs, extra points, etc. This is the same reason why the NFL has decided to protect the QB more ardently. With each team having its best version of QB under center scoring and commercial revenues will be maximized.

The knee bone is connected to the thigh bone—or in this case one of the reasons that teams have great defenses is because they have great offenses. I think it would be an absolute treat to play safety for the 49ers and just sit back when your team is up three scores and play for the picks.

Or couched in a more practical way, if the Raider offense can pad it's first half lead against the Cardinals then that second half disaster never happens. If the Raider offense can score more than a FG in five second half possessions against the Rams then when Baker drives his team 98 yards in the closing minute it's not to tie the score, it's a pity TD that makes the final score 30-19.

The Raiders almost ***never*** win going away with Carr at the helm because he takes his foot off of the gas. Happy to see those days in the rear view mirror.

The debate will rage on, but one things for sure. When Brady is up by 18 early in the fourth quarter he wants to make it a three score game, and leave you broken and bleeding on the side of the road.

Our defenses have been bad because they've been bad. Our defenses have also been bad because our offense couldn't carry their share of the load.

1566,7265,7265,ATX_rider,"I'll give you and honest opinion—and I feel I'm qualified to do so because I'm a fan who has changed his mind when it comes to Carr.

First, you need to understand with respect to most of the responses that are heavily in favor of Carr/the Raiders fucked up/fire McDaniels that in the context of the Raiders we have been absolutely starved for talent at QB. there's no Drew Brees in our recent past—even Gannon was only a small 4-5 year blip and before him there was another barren desert of subpar QB play.

Second, most of the responses that heap hate on Carr come from a place of frustration. Carr just really hasn't progressed beyond a certain point and in fact, this season he regressed in many ways to his rookie form.

The biggest issue with Carr is that his issues (game awareness, pocket presence, ball security, accountability) can't really be coached out/away. I've seen him *toss the ball across the goal line and out of bounds twice*—as if he's making a layup. I've seen him pull up short of the line of scrimmage with the first down clearly attainable just to dish the ball off to a blanketed receiver who gets tackled for a loss or no gain. I've seen him *throw the ball away on 4th and 10* late in the fourth quarter to save a sack. He comes out ""flat"" at least 2-3 games a year.

The maddening thing about Carr is this week he can play straight up with Mahomes and throw punch for punch, and then next week Sam Darnold will be the better QB on the field. If his highs were not so high he wouldn't leave fans wanting so often. Carr can be elite for a game—*or even a stretch of games*—but over a season he's middle of the road. That should tell you what you're going to get on those games where Carr isn't elite.

Give Carr a top ten O-line and a top ten D and he will get you in the playoffs and maybe win a game or two. But to hoist the Lombardi you're going to need a top five O-line, and a generational D (85 Bears, 00 Ravens, 02 Bucs, 15 Broncos).",17.0,raiders,t3_10j5362,False,0.0,None,2023-01-23T09:48:45Z,raiders,0.0214320951371131

Taking a QB early in the first will be costly and set back rebuilding the team as a whole. 

Building the team in this draft, while riding with Stidham is likely to be the equivalent of tanking. 

A rookie QB either won't start in 2023 or won't win in 2023, as the draft capital was raided and the team still isn't good. That's a year of your cheap rookie QB gone, but wait, now you don't have your high draft pick in 2024, in a stronger QB class. If you hit a HR with the QB, maybe you feel good about the direction you're heading, but you don't have a choice because you can't draft someone else. Maybe McDaniels makes it to 2024. Maybe 2023 is so bad that he doesn't. Then your new QB gets to learn a new offense with a new HC and OC. Sound like a familiar cycle?

By punting 2023, you essentially provide McDaniels with another year of protection with 2024 being the make or break year, as the big contracts are all ending and the roster should reflect what McZieg wants and feels they need to win.

Say what now? You want to not go after Brady and chase a playoff appearance, but if they have the greatest off season in the lifetime of most Raiders fans and don't jinx it by *trying*, they're going to use reverse psychology on the league to make the playoffs? This is the nonsense we're spitting out as a fan base now? 

Things can turn around quick in the NFL and we've all seen many examples. However, those things don't tend to happen with dysfunctional organizations and coaches who aren't innovative. McDaniels has never tailored his offense to his personnel as a HC. We've seen the Patriots do it while he was there, but he didn't do it in Denver and he hasn't done it in Vegas. 

As of today, Chase Garbers is the QB. If you don't want them to sign Brady and load up for a run with the SB at home next season, I am not here to tell you you're wrong. I am here to tell you that if they don't, they will likely be worse in the 2023 and McDaniels probably loses his job. I don't think he wants that and regardless of what Davis has said publicly, if they don't look like a team that's going to win 10+ games out of the gate next year, his seat is going to be nuclear.

Philly is interesting with Sanders contract up, but im only seeing like 7 million in cap space there right now. Buffalo is up against the cap now too and have 2 pro bowl defensive players up and need Oline/Wr help.         
        
Things can change, guys will get cut traded and money will open up, but i dont see many teams willing to put up 12/year for a RB especially the teams that are moving off a RB this offseason. Like Dallas for exampkle are they going to cut Zeke/ take a cap hit and sign a 12 mil/year Rb- no.

Just like you said, had he balled out and played great, it would’ve cost them more. But their was also the risk that both sides knew, that if Carr played like he did this year or worse, he wouldn’t have gotten much in a new contract. So AGAIN, that shows they wanted Carr, that they wanted to commit to him, they did NOT have to give him a new contract when they did. Carr even said it after he signed, he loved that they were willing to commit to him so early, other coaches had always hesitated and weren’t sure. 

Yeah, not sure what your point is about the NTC, honestly, especially considering that you insist that they did Carr dirty and never really wanted him. It’s like no shit they put that in there because it’s what Carr wanted. 

Yeah, Carr would’ve had very little leverage had the Raiders not gave him a new contract. He could’ve threatened to sit, but push comes to shove he would’ve gone wherever the Raiders wanted to trade him. Especially since it would’ve been likely that they would’ve traded him to a bad situation. Management liked and respected Carr even after the benching. You’re acting like the extension wasn’t mutually beneficial. OF COURSE they wanted to look out for themselves, for the team. The contract was NOT extended SOLELY to benefit Carr. It was to benefit BOTH parties. You act like those things don’t happen. They WANTED to extend Carr, and they WANTED to keep him around for awhile, they really liked Carr, which was why they made it a priority to extend him. Most other teams in that position would’ve waited, let him play out his contract, then tag/extend him afterwards if they believed he was worth it. But they wanted to COMMIT to him right away, which they did. 

How the fuck would other teams NOT know what we wanted to do???? Do you think we’d just magically trade Carr to x team and magically take their draft pick without them knowing? The Raiders would’ve HAD to make it known to everybody that they’re trading Carr BEFORE his new contract kicked in, which again wouldn’t have changed anything on the Raiders end. Why would they tell teams they’re happy to keep Carr when they’d have to tell teams that they want to trade him before his new contract starts? You honestly believe that they’d call up the Jets and say, “hey we’re happy with Carr, but if you want him you need to make an offer before his new contract starts”? Everybody would know that the Raiders want to trade him, and they don’t want to pay his contract, just as they do now.

11673,95209,95209,MadWorldEater6969,"You’re absolutely correct, players do want to get has much money guaranteed as possible, they also want short contracts so they can get paid again sooner. 

You already made that uninformed statement. JMD absolutely wanted to keep Carr around, he did NOT have to redo his contract and give him an extension. He could’ve let Carr play out his current deal if he was unsure, then tag Carr in the offseason while they worked out a new deal if things did work out. That would’ve actually been a cheaper option than giving Carr a new contract right away. They made that a priority, has soon as JMD and Ziegler arrived they were working on a new contract for Carr, because they wanted to commit to him, all sides believed this would work. 

If they were not sold on Carr from the get go, they would not have gave him the contract they did with the guarantees they did, and they most certainly would not have agreed to a NTC. They also would’ve put the kicker for the guarantees in later, like after the league’s new year, like most contract extensions are done. Of course they wanted the flexibility to cut Carr, they wanted to give themselves an out should what did happen, happened, things don’t work out. 

They were trying to do right by Carr, they immediately worked on a contract extension, they agreed to the NTC, gave him a contract that would’ve paid him among the best, with a large portion of it guaranteed. The contract gave the team very little flexibility. If they wanted more flexibility, they wouldn’t have agreed to a NTC, nor would they want said his contract begins 3 days after the Super Bowl. You want flexibility, you make the contract start a few days AFTER the league new year. Then you have time to think about whether you want to pay the contract, you have the flexibility to maybe get Carr to rework the contract to make it easier to trade him too, because by then the other teams might have figured out their QB situation and it gives you leverage. But they did not do any of that, they were trying to do right by Carr. 

Yeah, they knew that they would never get Carr to agree to a 1 year 1 million deal, but they could’ve chose not to give him an extension in the first place, and keep the option to tag him which would’ve allowed them to trade him had they wanted to. So again, they were trying to do right by Carr and hoped to keep him around for awhile. 

How does playing him the last two give us a better “poker face”??? They HAD to tell Carr they did not want to keep him past this season, AND he had that NTC. So Carr HAS to be involved in any trade negotiations. Which would put them in the same exact position they’re in now. Everyone would’ve known that the Raiders were going to want him gone anyways, because AGAIN, he has that NTC, he would have to be informed and he would HAVE to agree to any trade. 

I’m sure they did tell Carr the truth privately. But that information was going to get out regardless.

JMD loved what he saw from Carr when he was in NE, he thought Carr could do well in his system and coaching, Carr thought the same thing. That’s why they both agreed to the NTC, contrary to what the Carr stans believe, they never had any intentions of getting rid of Carr until late in the season. 

Waiting one more game would’ve done jack shit. Wtf is this “cycle” you keep talking about anyways? What cycle? Carr was done with JMD, Carr wanted preferential treatment, he wanted to be treated like a star, and better than the other players, he hated being called out like everyone else was. That was the problem. Carr wouldn’t have agreed to any trade in any scenario. The ONLY way he’d have agreed to one is had he stayed another year, got his 40 mil, and then demanded a trade himself. That’s what a NTC does. 

We had almost no chance at making the playoffs anyways, we mathematically were alive, but never had any real chance. We also saw how well, and how different the team played when Stidham was in the game vs the previous 15 games with Carr. The team has a whole played better, offense, defense, all played better and had more energy with Stidham vs Carr. 

Yeah, why the fuck would the Raiders take on a portion of Carr’s contract? I mean, maybe you haven’t noticed, and didn’t know, but the Raiders have a lot of needs, having that money available, helps to fill those needs. Sure getting another pick would’ve been nice, but it wouldn’t make that much of a difference. You’re likely just getting a depth guy who needs a few years to develop anyways with that pick. Whereas with the free money, you could get a guy who can come in right away and have an immediate impact. 

No closure??? WTF is that supposed to mean? Keep Carr until he’s ready to retire no matter how bad things get??? They had communications. They brought Carr in, told them their plan. Then Carr’s brother went on a media blitz and trashed the Raiders (which most of you would NEVER accept from any other player), then the Raiders started talking to teams about a trade, when that framework was worked out, they allowed Carr to communicate with other teams, much like the Texans and other teams have done in the past.

Back in the day, teams gave out contracts of 5-7 years if they really believe in a player and it was back loaded. Now players want 3-4 year contracts so they can get a new contract sooner and get paid even more. They front load contracts which ensures that the players get most of their money sooner. Outside of Mahomes, when was the last time you saw a player get a contract longer than 4 years? 

JMD and Ziegler absolutely wanted to keep Carr long term, and in today’s NFL, 3-4 year contracts ARE long term. 

Carr did insist on a NTC, and JMD and Ziegler had no issues with that, everyone, JMD, Carr, they all thought it would be a happy and long marriage. JMD had wanted Carr for awhile, Carr loved everything he was hearing about how JMD planned on utilizing him, he coached Brady, he thought JMD would be able to do really great things for his career, help him achieve new heights. Unfortunately for everyone, it didn’t work out the way they hoped. 

You’re probably right Carr doesn’t take the contract without the NTC. But he also might’ve had they put more guarantees or something else, who knows. I remember saying, that had I been Carr, I wouldn’t sign without one because of the constant trade rumors. 

They absolutely were doing right by Carr, paying him a contract that would make him one of the highest paid players at his position. And you’re damn right they were also looking out for themselves too. Every team tried to protect themselves and do what’s best for them, just like the players. 

Benching Carr did absolutely NOTHING to lower his trade value. By that time the team had already made that decision. What do you think the right move would’ve been? Play Carr the last two games? Even if he played lights out, it wouldn’t have charged anything. They were still gonna move on. Only difference would’ve been they’d have done Carr REALLY dirty by NOT telling him of their intentions, and let him find out through the media that they were gonna try and trade him.

He isn't firing Josh McDaniels and Dave Ziegler because Mark Davis craves stability. Mark Davis understands what McDaniels and Ziegler are doing to make this franchise a sustainable winner. As far as the report of him being broke, according to an NFL source close to Davis: ""That is complete bullshit. It is laughable, but I bet it got a lot of clicks.""

Yes Jacobs and Adams were very critical of JMD after that game. Since then they, and multiple other players have been very supportive of him.

defensive back Nate Hobbs said the players respect how hard McDaniels and his staff push them.

Because there is power in consistency. There is power in routine. You stick to a routine, no matter if you want to do it or not that day, because it makes you better.

Because he showed how valuable he was last year. JMD & Co didn’t believe in Jacobs initially, they saw the value of the position, knew from their time in NE RB is a plug and play position, and it’s usually pretty easy to find alternatives.

An average defense is not hard to build, just dont pay 15 mil/year to shitty players. Scheming is way more important. And the oline is legit a RT and some depth away from being average which again is all is needed there which can easily be picked up in FA. Joe burrow went to the championship twice in a row with a bottom 5 oline. its important but not needing a top 10 important. And i said top 5 defense not top 10. Defense gets less and less important every year as the league leans more towards an offensive game. As long as we have somewhere in the 15ish range we will be fine. Add Rogers and we are a playoff team immediately. Worst case we give up a first rounder this and next year but i have a feeling it will be cheaper than that, the Jets are our biggest competition to getting him, and they cant out bid us, they have worse picks and less money

Chiefs are kind of a respect hate team-wise, their fans make it high for me though. Complaining about how it's rigged when shit has gone their way almost laughably since Mahomeless showed up.

Steelers are a personal one since I grew up in WV in the 2000s/2010s. WV is bonafide Steelers country and having to hear all about this stupid ass Pittsburgh team that everyone liked really got on my nerves, even when I didn't care about sports. 

Broncos are here because they kinda have to be. Idk since I began watching the Broncos have just been this sad shell of a team clinging onto past glory (same). I less hate them more so I pity them.

9ers are a recent addition but BOY are they up there. This year in particular made me glad that we don't have to share a bay with those fuckers anymore.

18188,147188,147188,Save2faBackupCodes,"I tried my best to clean up the YouTube transcript:


Carr mid-convo: That was spur of the moment so that came from the heart. No that was uh, I was having fun with it man it's just been such a crazy time and why and how everything went down. So I'm just trying to have have fun with it. I mean, just even getting invited back here, you know for this week was funny. So, I've just been having fun with everything.


Q: Are you are you through the emotional part yet?  Have you processed it and kind of moved on? Or like where are you in that? 

A: You know, I have so much love for so many people that I've spent so much, I mean we spent so many years together. We've spent so many years together you know, we've had so many discussions and I've grown a lot, through a lot of hard times, a lot of fun times with you guys. You know, and with my friends, and with people in the building, and so I don't think that hurt from not being around them will ever go away, because I love them. But the excitement of what's next, I think is something that is kind of more where I'm at now, you know. I don't think, I'm not sitting there dwelling on it anymore, you know. And I don't wish any ill will for anybody or anything. I definitely won't be the Raiders quarterback that goes away and bashes the new one. You know that won't be me. So, I wish nothing but the best for this place and the people running it and everything.


Q: You've spent a lot of recent years under speculations, especially about what's next, which has to get old right? What was that like and are you ready to turn the page from that particular aspect?

A: Yeah, I mean a lot of it when, I'll say this you know depending on who the coach was and all those kind of things, they definitely let me know how they felt. And so although there was speculation, I didn't never worry about it because I knew where I stood, you know? Now this situation was different, and you know it is what it is. We both move on and I think it's fresh. I think it's good for everybody. I think it's good for me, you know, to move on with my family. But I'll always be a Raider, you know. I'll come back in 10, 15 years and come and take my boys to games and all that stuff. Yeah it'll be fun for me. Maybe the kids sit in the black hole for once.


Q: You control the narrative. What are you looking for in your next team?

A: I mean I just want to win. And so there's a lot of teams that, you know, want to win. And I'm just looking for teams that have made that decision consistentl, that they'll continually choose to do whatever it takes to, you know, put a winning program out there. You know, for me that's what I want, to win, win a championship, you know. And so that's at the forefront of my mind. It's not money, it's not this, it's not that, you know. I just want to, you know, I've thrown for the yards, I have the records, I've done the pro bowls, it's fun, and I'm thankful for all this, but as you guys know, it's not at all why I do it, you know. I want to win a championship and so that's on the forefront. That doesn't guarantee whoever I go to, we can automatically do it. But I'm just, you 
know, place where I have my best chance possible. It's nice having a no trade, because I can take my time, I can be patient. I'll never close the door, could be a trade, it could be I'm released, I don't I don't care about the optics of it. Like, who cares and I can control that, you know. I'm not just going to accept the trade because it looks better. I don't care about that, you know. I'm gonna make the best decision for me and my family. And it was actually nice I was talking to Peyton about it today, when he was released you know and he's like, man he's like it's kind of surreal in the moment, you're like wow, you can't even believe it. You know, but then you just go to the next place and you can move on. You do your best there and no it's nice to hear that from someone who I think is the best man to play the game, is someone I always looked up to and, you know, he's one of those guys that'll go down as one of the greatest ever. So to hear him say that, to hear him say I've been through that too, it's it's nice to hear it.


Q: It sounds like February 15th, it may not happen by this...

A: What's happening? I mean it could, you know. I just I'm doing my due diligence and I would love to talk to all the teams and figure it out myself. I'd love to do that and figure that out, and so we'll see but I'm not closing the door. Just saying I'll do whatever I can do that's best for my family.


Q: You still haven't gotten the ability to do that?

A: I have not.


Q: Have you heard discussions about that and where do you put those things?

A: I mean that's for them to talk about. I'm just abiding by the rules, you know. If it gets to that date, then it gets to that date, you know. And then I'll be able to talk to all my friends.


Q: They definitely haven't come to you with a trade to say yes or no to yet? 

A: I would let Dave talk about that, you know. I would say that there's definitely options that I have, and that I would let Dave speak on that because he's really, you know he wants to kind of be centered around what he's doing and so I don't want to put his business out there or anybody else. I don't think that would be best for me.


Q: It seemed like you're in a good place now, was there was there anger? How did that emotion kind of come through?

A: There was definitely anger yeah. Especially, you know, for certain situations. But like I said, I think I tried to say it best you can in a tweet, right? You know, I'm thankful for everyone that wants me to give me the platform to speak. I'm thankful for everyone that reached out and saying hey why don't you tell your side you know there's always two sides to a story. I said I'm thankful for that but it's not going to do anything, you know? It's not going to make me feel better. It's not gonna, it may give some people some insight and then open some eyes, you know. But for me, it doesn't doesn't help anything and I have nothing but respect for these guys and love for everyone here. So I don't plan on ever really talking about it unless I get crazy and write a book someday.


Q: Are you gonna take a moment Sunday to look around Allegiant? Is that going to be a thing?

A: Oh yeah. I'm going to enjoy it absolutely. I mean part of the first team to ever play here, you know. And that'll mean something to anybody down there 60 years when I'm really old, you know. When they bring us back for some reason and, you know, I think it'll be it'll be a cool moment. Seeing some of the Raider fans here today, you know when I started walking out, I mean I just got goosebumps because they're wearing the jerseys and it brings tears to your eyes because you love them so much and you pour your heart out to try and give them some memories, you know. And so it'll be cool. So yeah I mean I'll enjoy it but I'm not gonna save any grass or take it home or anything like that.",12.0,raiders,t3_10sdnlc,False,0.0,:Raider_Dave:,2023-02-03T01:38:34Z,raiders,0.0044619147448627

18202,147210,147210,Save2faBackupCodes,"The problem was the interpretation of the play on January 19, 2002:

In the replay, you can clearly see that the ball had stopped its forward motion and was tucked into Tom Brady's non-throwing hand. According to NFL Rule 3, Section 22, Article 2, Note 2:

""When [an offensive] player is holding the ball to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of his arm starts a forward pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body. Also, if the player has tucked the ball into his body and then loses possession, it is a fumble.""

The moment the ball touched Brady's non-throwing hand, the ball ceased to be in the ""attempting to tuck"" stage and was in fact ""tucked into his body"" and should have resulted in a fumble. In addition, the call on the field was a fumble and since the replay overturned this call, it suggests that Walt Coleman thought he had indisputable evidence to overturn the call.

The fact that the replay clearly shows the ball tucked into the non-throwing hand and no longer in a forward motion, as well as the lack of indisputable evidence that would be needed to overturn a fumble as was called on the field, demonstrates a deep conspiracy that was set in motion to actively suppress the greatness of the Raiders. I choose to accept no alternate points-of-view on this last point.

Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that the injured ankle is what caused the poor 2nd half of his season. The first half (pre injury) was just as bad as the 2nd, and the QBs who replaced him had at or near their worst performances of their career.



Out of all QBs who have started for him without BB - Carr, Bradford, Orton, Feeley, Clemens, and Simms - all but Orton had at or near their worst of their careers.

The tag option allows NFL franchises to retain a ""franchise player"" who is valuable to a franchise. The one-year, guaranteed contract that is offered to the player is a known, non-negotiated salary. If a designated player does not sign the offer and is unable or unwilling to negotiate an alternative contract before week 10 of the designated season, the player is unable to sign or negotiate a contract in the NFL for the remainder of the season.

The franchise tag provides general managers and owners a strategic way to manage salary costs and limit exposure to the financial risks associated with a long-term contract. Unsurprisingly, many designated players have criticized the use of the franchise tag by teams when it restricts their perceived ability to negotiate a more lucrative contract.",2.0,raiders,t3_10y3zt3,False,0.0,:4:,2023-02-10T02:05:17Z,raiders,-0.0571442048563341

29590,220279,220279,chimboslice18,"McD’s system takes a lot of time to learn and this is a make or break year for them. They’re not going to go after a QB that can’t come in and play immediately. That greatly limits the FA options to Brady and Garoppolo. Garoppolo is no better than Carr and a huge injury concern. Brady the only real choice in FA. 

In the draft it would be Young b/c he played in the system for 3 years, but would require a massive trade up and for that reason is unlikely. 

The only other feasible option i can think of is Mac Jones, who I’m not sure the Patriots are willing to move on from unless it’s for a 1st and I don’t think the Raiders will bite. If they could move Carr and a second for Jones that might work but still seems unlikely for both teams. 

I think the most logical outcome given all the factors is that Stidham comes back on a one year with player option deal similar to Mariota and they Raiders draft a QB in round 2-4. The history of drafting in NE is that they target specific QBs in the draft and those are often not in the first round. They want tall, smart QBs who play with poise and don’t need to move outside of the pocket to make plays. These QBs have become undervalued in todays game and increases the likelihood that their guy is somewhere in the middle rounds. I’m thinking McKee from Stanford and O’Connell from Purdue fit the bill. I DO think Stroud would also fit the makeup, but I don’t think they like the idea of taking a QB Top 10 when a tackle or defensive linemen fill a great need as well and fit the organizational evaluation process better. Most likely they trade out of the pick if Stroud is still there and some team desperately wants him. 

This decision likely won’t be made until after the draft is complete, so we’ll have a big waiting period for media/fans to speculate. For all the hate it might cause, Brady really is the only choice of available QBs (b/c I don’t think Mac is actually available)",5.0,raiders,t3_10fap3e,False,0.0,None,2023-01-18T10:25:22Z,raiders,-0.0337070054257419

He had some _ugly_ games this year, like against Kentucky, where he was sailing all of his passes and threw some ugly looking picks (1 seemed to be a miscommunication with the receiver, the other he was throwing a screen pass and threw it directly into a Kentucky player's chest)

He's not a ""1 read then run"" type QB, but his legs are obviously a huge weapon. He wants to pass before he wants to run, you can tell he's making progressions and is not always locking onto 1 receiver, and he moves up in the pocket well. He can bullet the ball 15 yards just by flicking his wrist (and did that a number of times mid-sack for a completion) and has an absolute cannon for an arm. His decision-making seems solid, and he doesn't make a lot of boneheaded mistakes

If he can sit for a year or two (like everyone is saying) I could see him developing to be a pretty solid QB. I'm very curious to see how going from a college offense straight into a harder-to-learn McDaniels offense would look like for him. I could see him looking like his Kentucky film as a rookie if we don't shore up the OL and if McDaniels is stubborn about fitting guys to his system instead of building the playbook around his players

If we’re talking QB as in taking snaps at QB, Lamar is obviously very good. A lot of times when the passing option isn’t there, him moving around either opens it up or means he can run himself. 

Lamar is an elite athlete. He can do things that probably nobody else can do. He can make any throw and he’s absolutely electric when he’s running himself. HOWEVER Lamar isn’t the best at making reads or adjustments. And that’s fine. He’s clearly been very successful without it. But just athletic ability isn’t going to lead to sustained success. That’s exactly why a guy like Russell Wilson fell off like he did (granted I think he’s going to do better next year). If you rely too much on your athleticism you’re going to struggle when you don’t have it anymore. 

There’s a reason why QBs like Brees, Rodgers, Manning and Brady were so successful for so long, even when they were really up there in age. Because they understand football, they understand what they need to do to put the defense in a spot where they can exploit them. 

I think it’s an overstatement to say that Lamar wouldn’t be successful elsewhere, but the organization definitely needs to embrace who and what Lamar is and what he brings to the table if they want to be successful.

First you have to actually find a QB talented enough to play that long; certainly not easy.

Then you have to be able to develop them, because few people come out of college playing like Herbert or Burrow. 

Then you have to be able to acquire talent to put around them to put them in a position to succeed; Carr has a lot of flaws, but he can make work with subpar receivers. He doesn’t have the highest upside, but he has a pretty decent floor 90% of the time.

32294,238075,238075,fsckedagain,"What Happens if the Packers Trade Aaron Rodgers?  
  
Rodgers does not have a no trade clause in his contract so he could be traded to a team as well.  The timing of the option should give the Packers all the way until the end of training camp to move him. The cap charge here would depend on when he was traded. If Rodgers were to be traded prior to June 1st the Packers would take on a $40,313,750 cap hit in 2023. If he was traded after June 1st it would be a $15,833,570 cap hit in 2023 with $24,480,000 due in 2024. This assumes that the Packers did not exercise the option before the trade. If the option is exercised then the trade number spikes to nearly $100 million. There should be no need to exercise the option until the last possible day.  
  
For the team acquiring Rodgers they would be on the hook for the salary for the year. The cap charge would be $59,515,000 if they do not exercise his option and $15.79 million if they were to exercise the option. Rodgers has an injury guarantee of $49.25 million for 2024 but that does not become fully guaranteed until 5 days after the 2023 Super Bowl. If Rodgers was cut after 2023 it would cost the team $43.725 million on the 2024 cap.

33301,241495,241495,gratefulfenny,"Fair enough but if you open eyes enough to see all of that, then you must agree that McZig have dealt with his removal in probably the worst possible way to try and gain anything in return for his moving on.  From arranging his contract in the first place, to his actual 2 game benching.  This is stuff rarely seen in the league but these are the two making these poor choices (I’m not talking about actually moving on from Carr as being one of their poor choices).  All this and not having any real solid idea of where this vision goes next, ie; Brady, Rogers, Stidham, or Stroud.

If they had spent time after the Saints, or even the Pittsburg game actually shopping Carr around, then we might already have a actual QB in line to start next year, but they didn’t even do that.  Really poor team/player/staff managing.  They even could have signed DC to a one year deal in the first place.  This would have helped decide what they tell us now, that they needed to see if DC would be their QB for the future.  Very idiotic to think if your not sure DC is the guy, why sign him to the deal they made for him???

Nothing these two have done in this ugly situation has shown the fans that there is any real direction they are trying to move to.  These two are just responding to poor choices after they have been made, instead of making calculated choices that indicate an actual plan or direction. Reactive instead of proactive is not a great way to run any business.

Carr was the best at calming the media down with saying such things.  I think one poignant moment was our LB, Blake Martinez retires mid season???   

You may say that McDaniels didn’t lose the locker room but I look at it as he had a strangle hold on the locker room.  A lot of this will come to light as soon as Carr finds a new home and is safely away from this toxic coach.

Agree if it is a rebuild and they miss stated their intent last year then there are many indicators (Jones signing a glaring one) they are going about this the wrong way.

I can’t believe that anyone who manages any group of people could think they will all respond to the same approach of coaching or leading.  That’s just not possible to bring the best out of each individual.  Some need atta boys while others need a kick in the ass.

McDaniels has not changed regardless of what he tells us.  These are the same traits that labeled him a terrible head coach.  

I know coaches need time to develop there personnel and team but in a full cycle (draft, FA, season) there are no real noticeable improvements (this duo has shown poor choices throughout).  It is easier to replace a coach than a starting QB.

Regardless of how Las Vegas parted ways with Carr, why would I cost my new team anything if I had a choice???  

The way I understand it, Carr has the choice of which team he will allow the Raiders to trade him to.

37635,272342,272342,not_beniot,"IMO people make more about Davante and Derek's friendship than they should. Yeah they had 2 great seasons together 10 years ago and are best friends off the field. But it's not unreasonable to think, after several years in the league, Davante knows what he needs from the quarterback (on and off the field) and recognizes that his friend might not be the guy for it.

Tae is on a Hall of Fame trajectory. Derek has all the arm talent in the world, but he's no Hall of Famer. 

You always hear people say Hall of Famers get to that level because they're cut from a different cloth. Brady is more on Adams' level than Carr is. This is why I believe Davante will support signing Brady, he may even push for it.

The criticisms of Brady are completely fair. He's fucking old and will get massacred behind a bad OL. But I think he can still play, he balled out in week 18.

He looked tired against the Cowboys, but he also had **66 pass attempts**. Unlike Tampa, our offense can actually run the ball. They'll lean on Jacobs (assuming he signs) and never ask Brady to throw it as much as he did this year.

The reality is IF (AND ONLY IF) we greatly improve the OL, Brady gives us the best chance to win next year. Not just for what he can do on the field, but for everything that comes with him off it. From listening to Crosby and Adams, Brady's borderline psychotic dedication to winning is exactly what they're thirsty for.",2.0,raiders,t3_10gndd5,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T00:41:43Z,raiders,0.0311697520452598

As stated in the Ruby Pokedex, it sharpens its sixth sense - Medicham - through meditation. This Sixth Sense would have allowed it to elegantly dodge attacks - aka a pass rush by Michael Strahan and OC Umenyiora - allowing their historic offense to score more than a paltry - what was it, 13? 14 points? Against the 6th seed New York Giants? Unbelievable. In fact, Medicham even has the ability to predict its foes' next move, which would have allowed it to dodge Michael Strahan on the inside at the nose tackle position, instead of on the edge where he was so effective all year.

43138,293474,293474,similar222,">Is Bill Belichick's absurdly good record in close games mean that he's not really a HoF coach, just super lucky?  Or maybe this new concept that close = luck is a cope? Our bottom 3rd record in close games the last 20 years simply means that we're just unlucky?

In the past three years, the Patriots are 25-25 overall, and 10-12 in games decided by 7 points or less. Where's the absurd goodness in close games?

Before that, the Patriots were absurdly good, *period*. Game in, game out, drive in, drive out, they were a dominant team. When you're a dominant team, your most likely result is either a blowout win or a close win, everything else is less likely. When things went their way for an entire game, they won big. When they caught more than their share of breaks for an entire season, they won 14 games or even 16. When a mediocre team catches more than their share of breaks for an entire season, maybe they win 10 games. When an average team catches more than their share of breaks for an entire season, maybe they win 12 games.

In Brady's last year with Belichick (2019), they won by 14+ points 8 times. Do you know how long you have to go back to find 8 such games for the Raiders? THIRTEEN YEARS!  None in 2021, 2 in 2016, 1 or 0 every other year all the way back through 2011.

So when I see a team whose results are 2/3 close games and 1/3 blowout losses, I think, that's a mediocre team. That's the 2021 Raiders. It's nice that most of the close games went our way, but don't kid yourself.

When I see a team with 2 blowout wins, 2 blowout losses, and everything else close, I think, that's an average team. That's the 2016 Raiders. It's nice that most of the close games went our way, but don't kid yourself.

Losing to the Rams this year was indicative of being a bad team. So was playing Drew Lock and the Broncos close in 2021, a bit less so. Getting blown out by the Chiefs once this year was indicative of being a bad team. So was getting blown out by the Chiefs twice in 2021, a bit more so. We had other games that were better, but nothing to write home about. It was fun that we squeaked out wins against mediocre teams 4 straight times to end the season last year, but it didn't mean shit. We weren't a good team, we weren't headed anywhere.

Look at the Vikings this year, dude.  13-4.  4 blowout losses.  Did that clutchness (if that's what you're thinking it is) carry over to the playoffs?  Nope, they lost to another average team, at home against the Giants.  Who proceeded to get absolutely destroyed the following week.  Vikings were the luckiest 13 win team ever, and all the signs were there even while they were winning in the regular season. Defense was terrible, offense couldn't put teams away.

I think people are pretty divided on Ruggs. Personally I'm with you on this, and everything else you posted. I think he was a miss *especially* when you consider the WR alternatives at that time. Drafting a lesser WR because Carr needed someone to take the lid off in order to make defenses respect the the deep ball is as dumb as drafting Ferrell over Josh Allen because he's more of a base end.

To your point about DBs, I think the Ruggs at #12 decision is even worse if you consider that they had to know they could probably wait at WR... but didn't want to because they knew they were going DB at #19 and I think they thought they couldn't justify a DB at #12.

- Incomplete pass on 1st down, -1.23 expected points
- 4 yard scramble on 3rd & 5, -1.16 points
- Incomplete pass on 3rd & short, -1.94 expected points
- 7 yard completion on 2nd & 9, +0.23 expected points
- Incomplete pass on 1st down, -0.55 expected points
- (Giving him credit for the QB sneak), 4th & 2 conversion, +2.19 expected points
- Incomplete pass on 2nd down, -0.7 points
- 4 yard pass on 3rd & 7, -0.72 points

Add up the 2nd half plays where Carr was asked to do something and the result of those plays was -3.98. That hurts when you end up losing by 1. The cumulative impact of his poor second performance was roughly equal to the impact of that horrible red zone INT. And of course if you add both together it means Carr finished the game with -8.26 expected points added in the last 9 plays we were counting on him to build/protect the lead.",1.0,raiders,t3_10s67w9,False,0.0,:12:,2023-02-04T08:42:48Z,raiders,0.0181646621167659

Uh no. I called it a desperation INT. You apparently chose not to read the adjective. That entire paragraph was agreeing with you that those last two drives were not his fault. I was only making the case that the four drives prior to that were his opportunities.

> Outside of the Hail Mary, Carr threw what 5 or 6 passes in the ENTIRE second half. In a Southern California dome no less.

I did detail each of these drives so don't act like I'm ignoring that. Counting up the play totals that I stated, our first three drives of the second half (our only drives in the first 26 minutes of the half), technically yes, 6 pass attempts, plus a scramble. 7 pass plays compared to 10 run plays, which, contrary to your conspiracy theory, is quite reasonable with a two score lead against an opponent that hasn't been able to score. In those 7 pass plays we gained 15 yards and 0 first downs. The running game was doing its job (4.8 yards per carry in those drives plus a first down), but the 2 yards per pass play killed those drives. If Carr had done anything with those plays, we'd have had more plays overall in the half.

As for the drive where we really did take the air out of the ball with 3 minutes left, was it right to call 3 run plays, trying to protect a 6 point lead late, after the Rams offense had finally shown some life? Hindsight says no because they ultimately punted (to the 2 yard line, notably), but they did gain 9 yards on the first 2 of those runs before unfortunately getting stuffed on 3rd & 1. To paint the second half pass/run ratio decision as McDaniels sabotage is just blind hatred.

> Then you look at how good McDaniels coached against the 49ers for 4 quarters for once this season and you see intent. How can anyone not see this??

Players often rally in the week after a huge change. For example it's common for teams to play above themselves for an interim coach in their first game before falling back to earth in later weeks. Did McDaniels ""coach good"" in the finale the following week against KC? SF didn't know what to expect, KC had more of an idea.

1. I think teams very rarely go into the season intending to tank. It maybe becomes more of a consideration midseason if things are going horribly wrong, think the Colts back when Peyton got hurt in his last year there, and they didn't have a viable backup or much else of a team.
2. McZ in their second year are under pressure to win. Yes, they could theoretically get buy-off from MD to tank and buy time to rebuild, (for some reason I will never understand, that's what Reggie McKenzie did), but that seems particularly unlikely, not just because of #1, but also because of MD's vocal frustration with visiting fans filling the stands.
3. The roster is very imbalanced in terms of stars and scrubs, with little in-between. And the stars are signed for quite a long time. Crosby, Miller, Adams, Waller, Renfrow... so to truly tank we would likely be trading a bunch of those guys, but the dead cap makes doing so less appealing, I can't see us trading more than 2 of them at the most.
