It's easy to look like a good OT when your QB is getting the ball out in ~2.5 seconds. Even then, Jawaan wasn't winning pass block reps, he was still getting pushed back into the pocket constantly. A guy who's been a starter for 4 years who *still* can't anchor is a bad sign. 

And we're not even discussing his run blocking. Jesus fuck it makes no sense. He should be an absolute mauler, but he doesn't have the functional strength to move guys. 

Little has shown that he can do what Jawaan can't. Personally, I'd try a tag-and-trade, try and get a 2nd and 4th or 2nd and 5th for Taylor.

1033,7795,7795,AceWolf18,"Hello! Jags fan here. Thanks for the invite on our subreddit:

Things about this game:

1. The jags are playing with house money. No one thought we would get this far. This team believes in themselves and in their coach. They will hold nothing back and will play risky ball to keep going.
2. The play calling will be aggressive. Like I said, no one expected us to be here. Why not go for broke?
3. There's no bad blood between Cisco and JuJu. Juju said Cisco reached out to make amends. I still see a lot of fans on both sides bringing it up and I hope we all just put it behind us like they have and play clean football this week. I hate seeing fights in what should be a friendly rivalry. 

I think this game will come down to a few different factors:

1. Can either defense limit the production of the quarterbacks?
2. Can the run game get going to open up the passing game?
3. How do the jags react to the environment at Arrowhead.

Hope we have a good game ahead of us on Saturday. Should be an awesome David vs Goliath matchup.",5.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_10gytz2,False,0.0,None,2023-01-20T09:48:21Z,jaguars,0.0272532986388459

If you're doing that specifically to land one guy, that's betting the farm. You can also do that by being medicore and trading up for a high pick to get your guy.

But in a vacuum, tanking doesn't have to involve it being for one particular prospect.

Really it's kinda shocking more teams don't do it on purpose, since that's what the league is set up to reward. Going 7-10 just gets you a worse draft pick and tougher opponents next year.

I seriously doubt we'll see any team with 17 wins in the AFC because every team in the conference will be playing at least 2 of the Chiefs, Jags, Bills, and Bengals, plus at least one of the Ravens, Chargers, Dolphins, and Titans.

Chiefs play the AFC East and West, NFC North, and Eagles/Jags/Bengals

Bills play the AFC West and East, NFC East, and Jags/Bengals/Buccaneers

Bengals basically have the same schedule as us just with the NFC West instead of South. I can forsee our records being very similar at the end of the season, maybe with the Bengals edging us out by one or two games, barring injury and major regression by both teams.

Chiefs have an arguably tougher schedule. AFC East gets you Bills, Dolphins, Patriots, and a possibly much-improved Jets. NFC North is also definitely tougher than the South, and arguably tougher than the West. The Lions are on the rise, the Vikings are a solid team with potential to outperform, and I just don't feel comfortable counting the Packers out (Bears could also get a haul in the draft and be one of the most-improved next year).

Bills have the worst of the 4. NFC East is definitely the toughest of the 4, and they only make up for it by getting the regressing Buccaneers (possibly without Brady). They have to play the AFC East and West, which I think are marginally more competitive than the South/North.

I'd wager Bengals go 3-3 in division, 3-1 against the South, 2-2 against NFC West, and 2-1 out of the others for a record of 10-7.

Chiefs I'm betting will go 5-1 in the division, 1-3 against the East (upset from either the Pats or Jets), 2-2 against the NFC North, and 1-2 against the others for a 9-8 record.

Bills will go 3-3 in the division, 3-1 against the West, 1-3 against the NFC East, and 2-1 against the others for a 9-8 record.

If we lose close again, I think that we'll still be a playoff threat, but it'll take luck to make a deep run.

I figure 6-3 or 7-2 out of that stretch of games.

Ravens, Bengals, and Steelers will all be tough games, and likely the Browns too, assuming that sex criminal Deshaun Watson shakes off the rust and the rest of that team continues to perform. I'd wager 2-2 if we're being honest, 3-4 if we're lucky.

I think Bills/Chiefs/Niners will all be hard fought games and could be 3-0 or 0-3. It really depends on how we come into those games, how they come in, injuries, luck, and like you said, timing within the season. They should be some of the best games of the season, hopefully.

1: Gets home field thru the playoffs and a bye

2: Gets home field for at least 1 game (probably 2) and the weakest seed round 1

3: Don't have to play the strongest wild card team, and home field round 1

4: Home field advantage

5: Gets to play the 4 seed instead of 2 or 3

6: Doesn't have to play the 2 seed

7: Makes it to the playoffs and a chance to upset

So option 1. He did an incredibly shitty job with Josh Rosen and helped him become one of the ""worst QB bust's in a while"" in your terms. That's pretty fucking bad, and not who you want around your developing franchise QB.

Option 2, Rosen was never going to succeed, and was always a shitty quarterback. This means that Leftwich has absolutely no talent evaluation skills and was unable to see tape on *a guy who played his position* and say ""hey, this guy does a lot of things bad"". There's zero chance the QB coach had no say and had no interaction with Rosen before they drafted him, and if Rosen never had a chance, Leftwich missed all the flags, whiffed, and allowed his organization to draft a guy with a top 10 pick who can't even make it as a backup in this league.

Teams generally don’t take deals that don’t give them flexibility to manipulate the cap because of how often it’s done.

As for your second point, realistically I shouldn’t even acknowledge it because we both know you’re being extra on purpose for the sake of arguing, but here we are. You’re correct. The cap does in fact prevent you just making super teams. You got us in the technical sense!

But that has nothing to do with what we’re discussing. We’re not discussing the cap in regards making a super team. We’re discussing the cap in regards to breaking teams up and honestly that’s just a myth at this point.

8464,70439,70439,Graardors-Dad,"Quick run down.

Outside corners are good. Slot corner and linebackers are ass expect a lot of passed to be caught over the middle on these guys. It also means we suck at guarding the flats.

Dline is also kinda ass but they can randomly play better in the middle-end of the game. Obviously Josh allen and Travon walkers are the guys to watch 41 and 44 since they are our high draft pick pass rushers.

Our safety Andre Cisco had a good game against Mahomes last game. Whatever offense kc runs and the defensive scheme they used was a good matchup for him. He really didn’t get fooled by Mahomes trying to look him off and throw to the other side of the field. Led to some big hits and and INT.

On offense

ETN is really good he kinda looks like Barry Sanders with the way he gets 5 yards on a play that look like it should have been a loss. 

Kirk is just amazing at getting open but not really a threat to break off a long TD.

Zay just does everything well, but can have drop issues but seems to get open a lot deep for not having crazy speed.

Engram has been playing amazing for us. His speed for a big guy is crazy.

Marvin Jones makes some crazy catches but you should know that since he was drafted by the bengals.

Trevor can be hot and cold he can sail some passes occasionally, but once he gets hot he’s hard to stop. The best thing about him is he is aggressive he will always go for the 20 yard play over the 5-6 yard play. Makes the offense exciting to watch, but frustrating overall.",4.0,jaguars,t3_10gry83,False,0.0,:CJ1::CJ2::CJ3:,2023-01-20T08:49:52Z,jaguars,-0.0242641499517299

If you are throwing a pass to the middle of the field you are going to be lobbing it or throwing it high you are going to throw it in a straight line. So even if you are 6’6” that’s only about 6’6” of height on the ball even someone who is 6’0” can easily reach to that height with out even jumping just reaching their hand up.

9209,77610,77610,HolographicHeart,"It was a nagging thought during the playoff run but the 2022 draft class has the potential to absolutely bite us in the ass. Walker had some decent games down the stretch but has not once looked the part of a #1 pick outside of the 3rd quarter in Week 1 and the 4th quarter in Week 18. Devin Lloyd was incredible out of the gate but has since been mitigated by teams realizing his coverage skills are egregious and Chad Muma is passable, but someone you might be looking to replace if no signs show next season. Josh Allen is solid but he's never going to be the TJ Watt type of LB who just completely wrecks gameplans singlehandedly and we need to stop expecting him to do so. And finally, Oluokun is a tackling machine but is asked to matchup with players he has no business covering simply because he is the more experienced LB.

Outside of that, it is difficult to really evaluate Caldwell because the middle of the defense has been so disappointing. I do wish he would show more exotic packages and blitzes but you can only do so much when your LBs get shaken in coverage so easily and the D-Line can't be depended upon to get a significant push at the LoS. So instead we just sit in zone and get picked apart by any of the great QBs who understand how that coverage functions. Front seven has to be the priority this offseason and if we're at the same point middle of next season then I'll start actively campaigning to oust Caldwell.

3. Red zone trips have to be touchdowns. Your defense isn't keeping Mahomes out of your end zone so you better make your own trips count.

Defense Keys:

1. Bracket Kelce, you cannot just let him sit in the open spot between zones, he absolutely kills teams doing that.
2. Keep someone on McKinnon at all times. You cannot let the layup go for 8+ yards every time it's thrown.

16057,122678,122678,NotSoFakeID,"I think the “front loading” refers to the dead cap numbers being easy to dump after the first two years, which makes it easier to get out of some of the contracts. For example cutting Kirk now would put us into dead cap hell, but next year we could save 10 million by cutting him and not completely butcher our cap. Other players the cut rate is even better, recouping up to 80% of the cap hit from a cut (oluokun, scheriff)

The issue is what happens when those players play kind of well and we want to keep them even though their contracts are sort of ballooning, which is what we’re experiencing with Agnew, RRH, Jenkins, and Shaq Griffin. Realistically, we only want to get rid of Griffin.

If Shad khan is flexible with cash, we can change some of those cap hits to signing bonuses and reduce our cap pressure a bit, which solves some of the problems but definitely not all of them. The players you listed are entering their second year, which is when the cap hit and inflexibility will be the biggest, so if one of those free agents contracts was really an immediate burden, we’d be in a tough spot, but next year the flexibility opens back up, especially if we don’t hand out any massive contracts this offseason.",2.0,jaguars,t3_10rp9q2,False,0.0,we r so great,2023-02-02T14:58:35Z,jaguars,0.1528912379972565

The best TEs of the last decade haven't been taken in the 1st.That is the only problem I have with this list - it is specifically stated it is for the 1st round, and I just don't feel TE is the most important position to address in the 1st.

1. OL/OT depth/starters. This is highly dependent on where people fall in the draft, and if Taylor is re-signed. If he isn't, I'd say this is the most important position to address in the early rounds. Even if he is re-signed, the OL still needs more talent and depth, so it wouldn't fall far down the needs list.
2. Interior DL - Football is won in the trenches, and a great DL helps your secondary almost as much as having great DBs. I love a lot of our rotational guys, but I honestly think the D needs to move to a 4-3 and if we do, we will need another body in the middle.
3. Slot CB - Our outside corners are both solid, in Campbell and Williams. What we really need is a strong cornerback who can play the slot well. I don't know if Williams could move there, but if not I could see someone like Cam Smith being high on the board, as he played a lot of snaps in the slot in college.

And injuries do matter for some people when ranking the top 5 qbs. 

That's the issue: there is no definition to what the word ""best"" or ""top"" means in this context. It is subjective in many respects. 

Also, worth mentioning that my major objection to your statements is the ""it's not even close"". 


For you, it seems like the major contributing factor is stats. And that's really it. You say that Herbert has had multiple years of success... but really it's mostly just multiple good years with good stats. 

Again, I'm not discounting the talent of Tua and Herbert, but to state it isn't close as a blanket statement.. nah. 

For you, injuries don't matter. For me, and a lot of other people, they contribute. 

I find it hard to rank a guy who has never completed a full season in the top 5. Tua will not be there until he can do that. After a season with two major concussions, i just cant rank him in the top five without seeing where he is next year, and if he finishes the season. 

You can disagree with me, but saying I can't make that argument or that the argument is invalid is trying to make an inherently objective ranking subjective. 

Looking through lists, I don't see Lamar as high as he should be when he is at his best. Why? Because most people won't put him as high anymore. If we were to go by what each of these guys can do when at their absolute best and 100% healthy, Lamar should be contending with Mahomes for the #1 spot. But he is hardly mentioned in the top three, because injuries matter. 

Let me be clear one more time: you not ranking Trevor in the top 5 is five by me. I understand your arguments. I understand what you value in making your own list.

17072,125799,125799,Oopiku,"""not close to being top 5 in the AFC"" is a bit rough to claim. I suppose it depends on how you look at your rankings.

Do you go off of who you think is currently, in this moment better? Is it who you believe had the better season? Is it you you believe will be better in 2023?

A lot to consider. Now lets look at who would be above him:

Without a doubt on most lists: Mahomes, Allen, Burrow.

These three aren't worth discussing. Not in the slightest, it would just waste our time.

Now you have this group to discuss for 4 and 5: Lawrence, Herbert, Lamar... maybe Tua?

Now you have to think about each one and why they might fit in the top five. You also have to defend yourself stating that Lawrence doesn't deserve to be CLOSE to the top 5.

So somehow you'd have to explain how these other 3 QBs (Herbert, Lamar, Tua) are much better than Trevor.

I'd argue that its hard to put Lamar and Tua above him drastically, when neither have played a full season the last two years. Lamar at his best is obviously hard to reach, but Lamar who can't play isn't hard to beat out. Herbert has great numbers, and it may make me sound crazy - but I just haven't seen him give me a performance where I said: That guy is THE dude.  I have seen that from Trevor. For me, the fact that their stats were similar this year but Trevor showed so much more when it mattered, in the playoffs, just means I can't accept (and I'm a fan, I get that), that Herbert is so far ahead Trevor isn't ""close"" to him.

Tua: Had a good year last season. but missed a few games while on the IR with a rib injury. In 2022, he was looking really good. The Ravens game was beautiful. But through the season he was put on concussion protocol twice, missing 4 games total (not include ones he had to leave). Even though Tua is one of the best when he is playing at his highest level, I find it hard to rank someone in the top 5 when they cannot finish a full season. He has yet to play a playoff game, as he had to sit out this offseason.

Lamar: Such a talented runner who can also pass the ball pretty well. Just not from the pocket. AP MVP in 2019, which was by far his best year passing (and running). QBR of 113.3. Simply amazing. Since then, his QBR has been: 99.3, 87, 91.1. Not bad, but a steep drop, right? It should also be noted that in 2021 and 2022, he didn't finish either season. He suffered injuries in weeks 14 and 13 of those seasons, respectively, and missed the remaining games - including missing a playoff game. He is 1-3 in the post season overall.

17109,125849,125849,Oopiku,"When he is healthy and active I would also rank him in the top five. But he might be the only one I put up there.

And again, I said arguably - which doesn't imply 100% certainty, but just an arguments chance.

For reference, this is my personal ranking:

1. Mahomes
2. Burrow
3. Allen
4. Hurts
5. Lawrence

Now, I want you to know this: I personally don't put as heavy a weight on running stats. many rate Hurts above Allen and Burrow, while they both have higher pass yard per game and TDs - though more INTs as well. Hurts does a good job protecting the ball for how often he runs.

So lets see how an argument could be made to not include Hurts in the top 5:

There are also a lot of people who might consider the talent surrounding the QBs when making the rankings. With Mahomes we have gotten to see this year that he can play with much less talent at WR and still put up the great numbers, which is why for me he is solidified as the #1 QB.

For Hurts, he currently has two of the top 10 WRs in the league on his team in AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith and a very good TE in Goedert. Last season, before picking up AJ Brown, Hurts had a QBR of 87.2. This year, with AJ Brown, his QBR is now 101.5 and he has made jumps in completion percentage, yards... everything.

How much of that is on Hurts improving in year 3 (2.5? He didn't start much in 2020)? How much of it is him having an incredible cast of characters around him? How much would his stats lower if he had no true star WR, instead of 2? Say he had the Jags WR room. Now, I love Kirk/Zay/Engram - but Kirk/Zay are not Brown/Smith at their current level.

And then, consider if I didn't put a huge weight on running stats. Maybe I believe that running as much as Hurts does makes him more dangerous, as he has a greater chance to be injured - thus he may drop a bit simply from that.

Again - I'm not making this argument because I believe he doesn't deserve to be top 5 - but just to prove that the argument COULD be made.",5.0,jaguars,t3_10oa11f,False,0.0,:JAX0:,2023-01-29T13:22:03Z,jaguars,-0.0246269352333516

In the first half of the season, up to and including the KC game, he was 14/18 for 77% FG percentage, with 1 missed extra point. In the back half of the season, including playoffs, he was 19/20 for 95% with the only miss being that one in the Meadowlands.

With the improvement in the second half of the season, he was middle of the pack at 85% for 17th best FG percentage.

KC picked up Isaiah McGuire (DL) with the pick. I ended grabbing Jaylon Jones (CB) with 94 - who I think was a steal here.

I'm only gonna list the top 3 rounds in detail, though I ended up with total of 13 picks through the whole thing due to he trade from KC.

1.24 **Paris Johnson Jr. OT/OL -** Kind of wanted to grab a CB in the 1st, but with Gonzalez, Smith, Porter, Ringo, Witherspoon and Phillips all off the board before 24, I just couldn't see the value. Especially with Johnson Jr. available here. If we keep Taylor, he could easily move interior as he has played guard before. Or he can be depth. Who cares - OL is hard to find talent for. I doubt he falls this far, though.

2.56 **Dalton Kincaid TE -** Even if we resign Engram, we were lacking a serious #2 TE this year. There are a lot of mocks having Kincaid go to a team (even us) in the 1st round. To see him fall here was like mana falling from heaven. Couldn't say no. He was one of the best pass catching TEs in college, and has the hands and size to be a huge contributor in the NFL.

3.94 **Jaylon Jones CB -** I couldn't go longer without a CB pick, and Jaylon was a good fit at 94. He didn't have the best 2022 - no where near as strong as his showing in 2021 - but a lot of that might have to do with overall team. He was a 5 star recruit. He has the size, speed and explosiveness you want out of an early round pick. Just not all the numbers, which is why he drops into the 3rd. I think he could be a great grab here.

Rest of the picks without explanation (would take too long since there are another 10):

4th: Rakim Jarrett (WR), Byron Young (DL), DeMarvion Overshown (LB)

5: Jay Ward (S)

6th: Jaxson Kirkland (OT/OL), Hunter Luepke (RB), Eku Leota (EDGE), Jonathan Mingo (WR), Jake Haener (QB)

7th: Jake Andrews (OL)",7.0,jaguars,t3_10kirdj,False,0.0,:JAX0:,2023-01-24T17:52:34Z,jaguars,0.0010851278260845

17138,125909,125909,Oopiku,"It's a weird one because a lot of the reason he improved is taking chances. That sometimes leads to it going the other way. 

Eagles game I chaulk up to a fluke. Don't see that happening again. He had 5 fumbles lost beyond that. 

And what games do we truly put on his turnovers as the difference makers? The only two I can really say is Denver with the two INTs, and the Eagles with the fumbles. And both of those happened in the first half of the year before he and the team turned it around.

How many games are we in BECAUSE of him, though? How many big games would we have lost down the stretch without him taking chances? Dallas, second Tennessee game, Ravens, Raiders...

Let's look at some turnover stats for some big QBs. Just the season games, not gonna include post season because not all of them played the same amount of games. Total turnovers will be ints+Fumbles lost.

Trevor Lawrence: INT: 8, Fumbles: 12, Fumbles lost: 9, Total Turnovers: 15

Patrick Mahomes: INT: 12, Fumbles: 5, Fumbles lost: 0, Total Turnovers: 12

Tom Brady: INT: 9, Fumbles: 5, Fumbles lost : 4, Total Turnovers: 13

Josh Allen: INT: 14, Fumbles: 13, Fumbles Lost: 5, Total Turnovers: 19 (crazy they only lost 5 fumbles)

Joe Burrow: INT: 12, Fumbles: 6, Fumbles lost: 3, Total Turnovers: 15

Justin Herbert: INT: 10, Fumbles: 8, Fumbles lost: 3, Total Turnovers: 13

Didn't include everyone, of course, just some names that are considered top shelf. 

Honestly, if those others get unlucky and lose more of those fumbles, each of these guys would be super close. Heck, they already are.

Honestly I was going to go into some more details about the secondary/LB group, since that will also be important tomorrow, but I was dead tired. Got off work really late and was scrolling through Reddit before bed and just had to answer before falling asleep, lol.   
Ultimately I think a better performance from the front will help the secondary drastically. Even with Smoot down, improved play from Robertson-Harris (who I somehow didn't mention above) and outside rushers like Josh Allen has been huge the last few weeks.   


I agree about Toney. He's dangerous. Some of those big plays last time to Toney attacked  Devin Lloyd and Chad Muma. KC loves using motion and misdirection and Lloyd especially bit on that a few times in week 10, causing huge gashes on screens and short throws. It makes it even more concerning that KC has seen better play from their RBs out of the backfield, especially McKinnon.   


In the first nine games of the season, including the one vs the Jags, between McKinnon and Pacheco KC saw these numbers receiving: 28 Receptions on 36 Targets for 225 yards and 1 TD.   


Since that point, in the following 7 games this is the production: 41 receptions on 49 targets for 417 yards and 8 TDs. 

  
I honestly believe this is the most dangerous area of the field for the Jaguars.

17183,125966,125966,Oopiku,"Welcome!   
Ultimately, football is won in the trenches, and in the trenches is where the Jaguars have seen the most improvement over the course of the year.   


O-line:   
In their last matchup vs KC in week 10, the Jaguars gave up 5 sacks. They were 3-7 and had given up 17 sacks on the year. Trevor had a QB rating of 89.7 and TD/INT different of 13/6.   


Since that meeting, the Jaguars have gone 7-1. They have given up 12 sacks in those meetings. Trevor has a QBR of 97.9  (this is all including the LA game last week) and a TD/INT different of 16/6. Keep in mind those stats would be even better if not for the weird first 20 minutes or so last week.   


Trevor is a VERY different passer when pressured. He has a 105.9 QBR and 71.8% completion rate with a clean pocket. When pressured that drops to 55.2 QBR and 49.7% completion rate.   


Through the last half the season, when you watch you can see a lot of things that have improved on the offensive line - RT Jawaan Taylor has had by far his best year. I can't find it anywhere, but I'm pretty sure he allowed no pressures from Joey Bosa last week. Walker Little at LT has also been doing very well, considering he is only starting because LT Cam Robinson was hurt six weeks ago. Both tackles have been extremely solid.   


This week the interior will be where we'll need to watch. Chris Jones is simply a beast. In the week 10 matchup, he accounted for 50% of KC's pressures on Trevor. RG Brandon Scherff, a big offseason signing this year, allowed three pressures and two sacks in that matchup. That simply cannot happen again this time around.   


D-Line:  
The Jaguars defense has seen some major growth and changes over the course of the season. Mike Caldwell has been extremely... fluid. This defense has a lot of talent on it, but the disaster that was the 2021 season made it so knowing the strengths and weaknesses of a lot of the talent was hard. As the year has progressed, the unit has found its stride and figured out what it does best.   


Typically a 3-4 front throughout the year, while bringing in a fourth man to the line during 3rd downs and other major passing downs, look for them to run more 4 man fronts with Josh Allen, Travon Walker and Arden Key rotating onto the line. All are athletic enough to cover, as well.   


The team as a whole honestly feeds off of the defense. The players are vocal with each other - and their energy when making plays energizes the entire team.   
Ultimately, I think that is where the game will be won.   


Can the O-line limit pressures, and shut down or limit Chris Jones?   


Can the defense make plays in the trenches and keep Mahomes contained?",66.0,jaguars,t3_10gry83,False,0.0,:JAX0:,2023-01-20T04:17:03Z,jaguars,0.0109949282782306

He didn't give them a pass for it at all, but he also didn't continue bringing it back up because he really can't.

2nd quarter, 6:56 on game clock, no flag. Tony doesn't comment on it. Al Michaels does a bit, but Tony I think is honestly just done with it at this point, and doesn't mention anything about the no call at all. Just comments that the Jags need to go away from passing underneath.

Without looking deep into it, I remember the 2007 Giants. Tom Coughlin. Patriots were 15-0. Giants were 10 wins. The Giants lost that game, but played the entire time even though it didn't effect seeding, if I remember right.   


The Giants went to beat the Patriots in the Superbowl. Coughlin was quoted say the final game of the season led the team to believe they could play with anyone in the league.   


And who knows - if they had rested, maybe they don't make it to the Superbowl to ultimately defeat the pats.

I hadn't seen the video so I went and checked it out on YouTube and it was awesome.  I love the motivation and I've seem Jockos videos before just not that one.

But it inspired me to make a hype video for the chiefs game surrounding THAT message.

Good.

I scraped the Jaguars official YouTube for several different videos and pulling shots all the way back from training camp.  I added music and a couple other tiny sound effects in the mix and stayed up way too late making it.  But I think it turned out well.


The logos at the end were simple. I just did a black and white logo and put it in photoshop. Deleted the fill and then painted over the outline with the team color and add a glow.

Made my own stutter effect just removing the image every other frame.

There was a ton of amazing footage to work with and that was the hardest part was picking the best shots and plays cause the Jags camera crew has captured some stunning shots which also made editing easy cause almost anything looked good haha.

  The type of guy who would've been demanding a trade after London.  
The type of guy who would've been toxic being down 27-0 to the Chargers.

As good as he is, that type of mentality can be poison to a locker room and prevent the type of turnaround we've seen this year.

30093,208269,208269,ddscience,"Most common definition of ""pressure"" in this context of OL performance is when a pass blocker is directly responsible for allowing either a:

- QB hurry (opposing pass rusher forces QB into early movements/passes), 
- QB hit (opposing pass rusher hits the QB but after a pass was made), or 
- QB sack

The ""directly responsible"" part is the most important piece. It basically means that we're excluding any hurries/hits/sacks that resulted from defensive schemes (pass-rushers that get to QB unblocked/untouched) or from QBs themselves (hanging on for too long, scrambling from a clean pocket, etc.). And **only** looking at the results of straight up pass-pro matchups between a pass-blocker versus a pass-rusher.

&nbsp;

Two things I can see leading to a lowish grade:

1. if Little had help on a majority of those sets against Mack/Bosa
 - I don't have actual numbers on it, but I would bet that Mack or Bosa were being doubled by Little + someone else on most of their pass rushes. In that case, since it's a 2v1, you'd expect even a below-average pass-blocker to win those reps, so there's not a lot of opportunities to ""shine"" and get positive graded plays
2. if they are considering his reps' wins and losses in addition to pressures
 - if you allow a pressure, then you got beat. But if you get beat, that doesn't always mean you also allowed a pressure. So Trevor could have been pressured 0 times all game with Little (or anyone) getting ran over every snap, as long as it takes the pass-rusher more time to run you over than it does for the play to unfold as planned.",3.0,jaguars,t3_10difei,False,0.0,:JAX0:,2023-01-16T21:25:47Z,jaguars,0.012312631034445
30094,208270,208270,ddscience,"Yep. Our game against them was a lot closer than the box score suggests and it was very winnable.

And putting all bias aside, the Jags have objectively been trending upwards while the Chiefs downwards over a similar timespan. 

I probably don’t need to mention the Jags’ recent string of games given where this post is, but since December (aka the past 6 KC games): 
-	2 were actually convincing/Chiefs-esque wins (SEA and LV)
-	3 were **very** nearly lost against notably weaker offenses (DEN x2 and HOU)
-	remaining game is a loss against CIN

Urban was a shit coach but Trevor was a pro-ready QB prospect who stumbled as a rookie and even went a full month without a TD. He's put in a lot of work, showed he can keep a level head in a rough situation, and taken a big step forward in his sophomore year. 

And he's the only QB in his draft year to have a good 2nd year. Wilson imploded. Lance looked shaky then got injured (and I will laugh when people say it's basically his rookie year in 2023). Mac's withering in a struggling offense. Mond got cut already. Ehlinger is meh-linger. And Mills only showed up to fuck the Texans out of the #1 pick.

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The kicker is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, extra point, that prohibits the extra point from doing, you know, just trying to score the point. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the kicker is in the motion, he can't be over here and say to the demons in his head, like, ""I'm gonna miss this! I'm gonna hit the upright! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to kick and then don't make it, you have to still make it. You cannot not make it. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, kicking motion of the ball, and then, until you just miss it.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there's the yips you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Aang say yip yip to make appa fly 

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, he talked in that dream episode too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). And fuck the great divide episode amirite?!? Haha classic…

- Spags blitzes were fucking nuts, free runners all the time

- Kelce destroyed us

- we were always one step behind them but the Kirk pass and the Agnew fumbled couldve easily swayed the momentum to us.

- Hamilton had a really noice game on the inside

- EDIT: DC Caldwell needs to be better schemewise, Cant have EDGE rushers on TEs. He did get creative a bit with 3 safety packages at the end. But needs more consistency

OFFSEASON needs

- Shaq Griffin cut, we need every penny of his 13mil cap

- restructure RRH, Sherff, Jenkins, Kirk, Zay Jones, Oluokun to create cap space.

- hot take: Trade Cam Robinson. There are very desperate teams that need OTs and we have Little who played better LT than him. Jets maybe or Rams?

- bring back J. taylor, Smoot, Engram, Key, Wingard (i know im missing someone)

- early draft selections: DL, CB, IOL

Also, were the productive players he brought in a product of good signings or excellent coaching? I’m leaning towards the latter, since these guys had average careers until they played under Doug. 

My biggest question is can he navigate around our salary cap issues and still bring in/retain key players for us to go further into the playoffs? That will be the biggest test for him.

The imgur album starts with the original throwback I'd use as an alternate. The rest would be the 18 possible combinations of the design. That includes --

* 2 helmet color options - black and TEAL(!)
* Jerseys in teal, black, and white
* Pants in teal, black, and white

Other notes --

* Retooled the JAGS badge from our previous set with a similar DUVAL badge
* Also have DUVAL on the helmet bumper, but would probably switch that out for a new wordmark
* went with black numbers on the home (teal) jersey to differentiate it from the throwback and to give us a cohesive look with other combinations using black helmets/pants
* went with teal numbers on the away jersey

But, Darnell Washington could also be a great addition. He reminds me a lot of Marcedes Lewis and we could use him and EE together on plays to create mismatches

1st: TE Darnell Washington;
Said what I think of him, whether we keep EE or not he would be a great guy to use like an extra lineman or as a mismatch. He’s also a good replacement for both Manhertz and Arnold as he excels at what they’re both good at.

2nd: DL Mazi Smith;
We need more QB pressures in order to be more successful on defense. Mazi Smith is great at getting to the QB and would be a good pickup for our Dline.

3rd: CB Jaylon Jones;
Incredibly talented CB that could play either slot or outside depending on where we put Darious. I think we move DWilliams to the slot and have Jaylon on the outside opposite Tyson Campbell.

4th: WR Parker Washington;
We need more depth in our WR room as we are likely dropping Marvin Jones, Parker Washington is a good receiver that could comfortably take his place in the roster and replace Zay if the time comes to trade him.

5th: OT Wanya Morris;
We need to protect the Prince, and Morris was the best player available here. Should be able to give TLaw plenty of time to select his shots.

5th: S Jay Ward;
Great safety that could be a good backup for Cisco and Jenkz should one of them get injured. Also seems like he is a good ST player so he’s got that going for him as well.

6th: EDGE KJ Henry;
Could be a potential Travon Walker replacement down the line depending on how Travon plays. Solid Edge, not much else.

6th: OT Zion Nelson;
Good OT/OL player for added depth to the oline roster

Every mock draft I’ve seen so far has us going tight end and I just hate it. Engram proved the player he is this year, he either needs a deal or a franchise tag if the team isn’t 100% sold still. Plus look at all the best tight ends in the league: Kelce, Andrews, Kittle, Waller. All taken 3rd round or later and took a few seasons to get their feet under them. Idk if it’s just a position that requires you to be big and strong so it takes longer to get going but it’s just what I see happening. Stick with the guy Trevor already knows and who is starting to live up to his potential already.

And if we stick with Engram, we might need a blocking tight end, but I don’t think that is worth a 1st rounder.

I can’t see us needing a WR either. Next year we have kirk, zay, and ridley. Even if ridley isn’t a stud anymore (he should be, since it wasn’t an injury), I can’t imagine he wouldn’t at least be able to play at a WR3 level.

On the OL, Robinson needs a new contract and I don’t think he’s worth the money he’ll demand. Fortner and Little I am happy with until their rookie deals are up and we can reevaluate then. Scherff didn’t perform at a Pro-Bowl level, but he was solid. Shatley and Bartch are back ups in my opinion. Taylor is the big question mark to me. He had some flashes again this season where he looks like he could be excellent, but his penchant for false starts scares me, so I’d say we could really use a solid LG, and it wouldn’t hurt to pick up another OL later on in the draft. If there is one available, that is my top choice.

On the defensive line, Hamilton and Fatukasi both are still under contract, but they’re both big bodies in the middle more than edge rushers. RRH really came on at the end of this year, but I think to shine he should be a rotational player and I would like to have an pass rush DE for each side anyway. Unfortunately the chance or a game 1 starting DE falling to 24 is pretty low, so I would rather take someone we can be sure of at a different position.

At CB I’ve been really happy with campbell and williams play on the outside, but we have no one who has been any good on slot receivers or tight ends. It’s possible a nickel specialist is around at 24, so that could be a possibility as well.

I would taki Mazi Smith here. A athletic freak with extreme upside and let him stew a year for our projected SB window by cap space in 24 and 25. Just enough time for him to get some experience before show time.

3rd: OG.

We could use more beef on the oline to either replace Bartch or work as depth behind him to continue to invest in our oline to keep Tlaw clean and help out on the run which ETN could use.

I would suggest Cody Mauch here if he falls down abit.

4th: Slot CB.

We need a slot CB to increase our pass defense so BPA here of whats available. 

4th: TE.

We keep Engram and resign Sam and get a depth piece here. Sam Laporta if available or BPA.

5th: RB.

Not sold on Snoop Connor as our power back esp if ETN puts on weight and muscle as he said he would during the off season.

Israel Abranikanda as powerback if ETN doesent. Deuce Vaugn as a pass catching 3rd down back if he does.

6th: OT.

Dart throw on a tackle with swing capabilities to replace Little as depth for the future.

7th: CB.

Dart throw on outside cornerback to replace Darious Williams in the future and depth for now.",4.0,jaguars,t3_10z5oel,False,0.0,DUUUVAL!!!,2023-02-10T18:09:54Z,jaguars,-2.4040759795858564e-15
