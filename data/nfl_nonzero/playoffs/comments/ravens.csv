2644,9395,9395,ArcadianDelSol,"> 1) Some metrics have Lamars accuracy as almost as bad as Zach Wilsons

Which is why every team in the NFL passed on him in round 1 - including us.

This entire sub is in denial about this fact. Lamar's only value is (was!) his ability to scramble out of a sack and gain 15 yards. Even before injury, he's not been doing that for 1.5 seasons now. He scrambles for 2 yards, or worse - he is now trying to pass his way out of sacks.

and he's pretty shit for pass accuracy. We're now losing games *BECAUSE* he wants to prove he's a passing QB, abandoning the SOLE reason he became a sensation early on.

Watch his first rookie season - he was breaking huge gains because even when he scrambled out, defenses didn't know what to do with him - they charged at him and he would juke away and have an open field ahead.

Since his 2nd season, they've all decided to park on the scrimmage and make Lamar come TO THEM - and that pretty much eliminated his SOLE THREAT as a quarterback. They forced him to, at best, 3 yard gains and then forced him to pass.

He had 2 seasons to fix that pass game and he didnt. He misses wide open players, he throws 10 feet over them and 4 feet below their hands. The throws behind them on cross routes and no team can win consistently when their QB is that wild.

I love what Lamar brings to the Ravens, but what he takes away might be too much considering he wants, literally, the 2nd fully guaranteed multi-year QB contract in the NFL.

Week 12 is a game we probably should have lost. On a 4th and 29, Flacco dumps the ball like 2yards to Ray Rice who punches his way to the first down marker and sets up Tucker for the winning FG in OT.

We then go 2-4 down and stretch and come into the playoffs completely cold. The Broncos have us all but dead when Rahim Moore completely whiffed on a game-tying TD pass to Jacoby Jones. Which, given the Ravens' play calling was likely a shot at drawing a PI call.

Lamar is healthy and motivated, Dobbins runs for 15 touchdowns, Queen and Smith prove to be a perfect duo to exploit 2023 offenses, Marlon Humphrey and Kyle Hamilton are DPOV candidates and a Ravens team that was already better than Cincinnati stays healthy, wins the division by 2 games and outslugs KC in the playoffs on the way to a third Lombardi trophy.

Realistic:  Lamar and the Ravens just can’t settle on a contract.  They trade him to Atlanta or the Jets in a heartbreaking deal that nonetheless loads up the draft capital for the next 3 years and the resulting cap space let’s them return most of the roster, add a receiver and bring in Derek Carr.  A good draft class has things looking up, but Carr isn’t quite good enough and the Ravens go 10-7 and barely miss the playoffs in a tough AFC. 

Worst case: Lamar gets tagged and the roster is gutted in order to to accommodate him on the cap.  He sits out training camp and reports right before week 1. Playing with a chip on his shoulder he’s an MVP candidate as the season approaches the mid point, but WR is still a problem, the secondary is too thin for the defense to get key stops and left guard is an big problem after Powers leaves.

Well first off, if you have to tag Lamar, well there goes your 45M.  But let’s say you get an extension and he has a nice manageable cap number in the first year of like 25M.  So now you’ve got 20.  Still a decent amount, right?  Well, Ben Powers is a free agent, right?  So is Marcus Peters.  Do you want those guys back?  Because just that is wiping out basically all of your cap.  And if you don’t bring them back, well that’s two more holes you need to fill (enter Ozzie Newsomes 80-20 rule).  

And I still haven’t mentioned Calais Campbell, Justin Houston, JPP, Brent Urban, Josh Oliver, or the fact that we have exactly 1 WR who this fan base would piss on fire to put out. And that we have to sign our draft class.  So the money goes fast.

This is why DeCosta values draft picks so much, and is smart to, because if you’re not constantly bringing in valuable contributors in the draft, the cap becomes unmanageable fast.",1.0,ravens,t3_10ip7lh,False,0.0, :OLD4:,2023-01-23T08:41:20Z,ravens,0.0510948302379912

It’s not like when they’re on the board at 22, if their 15th and 16th ranked guys on the draft board are there, but the 15th ranked guy is a tight end and the 16th is a WR, that they’ll draft the tight end. 

What it does mean is that they’re not going to reach for the 30th guy on their board there just because they need a receiver.  They don’t do stuff like that and they still won’t this year.

Best player available essentially means “don’t reach, and if an absolute stud falls to you, don’t overthink it because it’s not an immediate need” (Johnathan Ogden, Kyle Hamilton, etc).

guys like jimmy g or a rookie would require some serious upgrades to the roster that i’m not sure are feasible to make. no one is going to give us a WR worth a damn in a trade for lamar, there is not a jamar chase caliber WR in the draft that will be a day 1 super star (although i do think there will be contributors from this class eventually). the FA landscape looks like depth guys not feature WRs. i don’t foresee chark, lazard or juju being a big enough shot in the arm to turn this unit into anything worth writing home about.

now all of this could change if we trade lamar, get an outrageous return and spend some of that on a trade for a vet WR, a good rookie WR and a rookie QB. that just seems like a lot for us to do and doesn’t sound like what our FO does to me.

9752,56541,56541,Dryderson,">Kyle Hamilton

A - at the start of the year, I would've said a B.  But he has really come into his own at the back half of the year, graded out as the best overall safety.  Loved this pick on draft night and love it now.
>
>Tyler Linderbaum 

A - God, it feels so good to not worry about center anymore.  Tyler has been phenomenal, he's struggled against the truly elite DTs - Quinnen Williams and DJ Reader, specifically - but he still held up much better than a rookie center has any right to.  After an offseason of conditioning, I think he will establish himself as a top 5 center next year.
>
>David Ojabo

Can I say incomplete? Feel like we didn't see enough.  I'm encouraged by what we did see, especially a strip sack against the notoriously difficult Joe Burrow, but the reality is that we just didn't see enough of him.
>
>Travis Jones

B - Didn't get as much playing time as I expected he would when Pierce went down, but the unforeseen breakout of Broderick Washington led to him getting limited snaps.  Still, he played well and stuffed the middle of the field when he was out there.
>
>Daniel Faalele

B - Had some very early struggles, but showed if nothing else that he is a capable swing tackle, which is huge for us and our personnel planning for the future. 
>
>Jalyn Armour-Davis

D - I'm slightly coloring this opinion by saying that we could've had Tariq Woolen here and that really, really pisses me off.  But nonetheless, JAD was hurt early in the season and looked unimpressive in his debut.  Hope to see some growth and improvement in the offseason
>
>Charlie Kolar

This one I'm saying incomplete.  Barely played at all, I liked what I did see, I expect him to slide more into the Nick Boyle role while Likely fills a Slot TE spot
>
>Jordan Stout

C - Was outperformed by Camarda, but the hangtime he was drafted for started to show up later in the year so I'll give him half credit here.  Hopefully he can keep working with Koch to refine his punts and carry on our special teams legacy.
>
>Isaiah Likely

A - this might be a bit of a generous rating, but for a 4th round project TE he has drastically outperformed my expectations.  He had at least two games where he was the most productive passing target, almost singlehandedly winning that Tampa game.  Hope to see him much more involved next year.
>
>Damarion Williams

C - Whereas I lowered JAD because we could've picked Woolen as an outside corner, I'm slightly higher on Pepe because I think we weren't expecting Kyle to fill the slot corner role as well as he did.  Pepe will have lots of opportunities to make plays this incoming year as Kyle's role transitions to starting strong safety

What about the 9 times this year that hurts scored less than 27 points? I guess 27 is good, but only in those games right?  Absolutely ridiculous arguments lmao

So the rest of your argument is that some people(not me) incorrectly and stupidly said that Minshew would take Hurts job? Thats gotta be one of the dumbest responses ever. A very small percentage of stupid football fans said minshew was gonna take his job so now you think everyone thinks hurts was bad. 

I, and anyone that knows anything about football, have literally never thought that minshew was good or would take hurts job. For you to even mention that tiny percentage of fans is ridiculous. You keep saying this “starting QB Minshew” shit like i said it. I didn’t and maybe 1% of people believed it, and those people aren’t worth listening to or getting worked up about. 

And guess what? IT DOESN’T MATTER HOW STACKED AN OFFENSE IS IF THE BACKUP QB SUCKS! Thats literally the whole point of my previous comment! Put gardner Minshew on the bengals, bills, dolphins, vikings, lions and ravens and their offenses suck too, because minshew sucks! 

As i said, THE OFFENSE SUCKS WITH A BACKUP QB! Thats not new and it’s not unique to the eagles. Your whole point revolves around a tiny percentage of people that said minshew would take hurts job to make it sound like it was a widely held opinion that minshew was good and hurts isn’t is unbelievably stupid and disingenuous. 

I bet if you put a healthy Jimmy G on the eagles, they still make the playoffs this year. They probably wouldn’t go 14-3 and make the superbowl, but they’d make the playoffs. You can’t say a QB carried his team if you replace him with an average QB and they are still a playoff team. The eagles have an insane amount of talent, especially on offense and a great offensive staff. It’s truly mind boggling how anyone could argue otherwise.

12078,80916,80916,JBrundy,"I’m aware that WR’s making a lot of money doesn’t equal good wide receivers, but the whole point of the post is that we don’t pay wide receivers and how thats a problem. The post itself literally equates paying wide receivers with not just how good your receivers are but how much effort your putting in to get good wide receivers. So i countered that by saying that teams that pay a lot for wide receivers don’t win a lot. Thats seems like a fair rebuttal. Also, of those 16 teams i mentioned there were 6 playoff teams, 4 had cheap QB’s and the other 2 lost their only games. 

As for your other points, we wouldn’t have been able to afford AJ Brown this year, and we certainly wouldn’t be able to if we paid lamar, unless we gutted our team. 

As for devonta smith, when do we draft in the top half of the 1st round? Only recent times was hamilton, when all the good WR’s were already gone, and when we drafted our franchise LT. Can’t complain about not getting a guy like him early in the 1st, because it isn’t possible for us. 

As for the chiefs, juju, MVS and toney is a terrible WR room that only looks good because of mahomes and andy reid. If we had those 3, I guarantee you our offense wouldn’t be any better and you would complain that we don’t have any good receivers. Hollywood or a healthy bateman would be the #1 WR on the chiefs and would put up huge stats. Even duvernay on the chiefs would be a serious weapon. 

The rams found a diamond in the rough in the draft, the bucs took evans really high and godwin in the 3rd round. Kupp and Godwin are legitimate arguments, we had a chance at those guys but we didn’t take them. However, i bet they wouldn’t be who they are today if we did take them. 

I know you don’t need to spend a lot of money on WR’s to get a good WR room, i specifically mentioned teams spending a lot because that was the point of the post. However, the other options are drafting them early in the 1st, which we can’t do. Drafting them late in the 1st, which we’ve done relatively successfully with hollywood and bateman. Drafting them in mid-late rounds, then we have to rely on our god awful WR development. And trading for a proven WR, which will cost a lot of draft capital and will still cost a lot of money. That option basically goes away if we pay lamar, unless we gut a big portion of our team. 

The only real options for us to get a good WR are drafting them late in the 1st, which as i said, we did pretty well. Or drafting them in mid-late rounds which is extremely unlikely to work out for us. 

The main problem in my opinion is greg roman. If we got rid of him earlier, we could have hollywood, bateman and andrews which is a serious receiver room. Short of getting a truly elite wide receiver like tyreek hill, JJ, or Adams, no wide receiver we got would’ve significantly improved our offense because greg roman wouldn’t allow it. I think we found 2 good wide receivers in 4 years, which isn’t bad.

If he couldn’t recover from a hamstring strain in 2.5 months from his last game and 4 months since the original injury, thats very concerning. If he did recover and he still sat out despite his team trying to win a national championship, thats unbelievably concerning.

I genuinely feel for Snoop, you could tell he thought he got across the line there to take the lead on that leap, he balled out tonight and our team looked pretty solid. Even without our MVP it wasn't a blowout and that's better than what everyone was saying it would be. Shout out to that TD pass to D.Rob, was a helluva play.

JK balled out, a full season with him (and Lamar fingers crossed) is gonna be fun to watch next year.

Defense looks stout, Macdonald cooked up a good gameplan and I look forward to seeing this again next year especially with Roqan Smith back.

It's been a wild year, sad to see us go down, happy to see us go down swinging! Rooting for our other east coast Bird team to go all the way in the Eagles but truly just want anyone but the Bengals!

15416,98803,98803,LamarBearPig,"You clearly haven’t been following the Lamar situation. Before this season started, Lamar was asking for a lot of money and the ravens basically said we’ll see how you do this year and then we’ll talk. Lamar agreed because it was a big season coming up and neither party wanted the drama to spill into the season. Basically they wanted to focus on football and it gave Lamar a chance to bet on himself and “prove” himself worthy of a major contract. (Remember, we fucked up giving flacco a record contract that killed our cap for years and don’t wanna make that mistake again)

Lamar lost that bet because he was hurt a lot and not playing to his mvp potential. He’s not blind to that. Everyone knows injuries lower your value. If he wasn’t so adamant on wanting to be a raven forever, I might be more worried. But his main focus is to win a Super Bowl. He’s said that over and over. He said he’d rather win a Super Bowl than win an mvp or get in the hall of fame. 

Lamar has been asking for weapons since he got here and Roman’s offense prevented that. No big name WR wants to come to a run first offense. Now that Roman is gone, lamar has a better shot at developing as a passer and getting some big weapons. I think if Roman stayed, it would be 50/50 on lamar leaving.

Then we lose back to back to our rival, one of which being a playoff exit loss. Now we’re dealing with the millions of theories and rumors about what’s gonna happen to Lamar, our star running back is expressing unhappiness with coaching staff, our offensive coordinator single handily lost us multiple games where we were up by multiple scores at half (some even going into the 4th) with terrible play calling and then to top it off, we’ve been screaming to fire him for months and no one will listen.

And Of course I gotta mention that absolutely shit playcalling that led to the 98yd fumble return. JK scored the first time he touched the ball inside the 10yd line and out of our 12 plays inside the 10yd line, that was the only touch he got.

And I meant it in more of a historical context.

21244,125314,125314,Pheasantluvr69,"I had that same heuristic as well a couple years ago, but after the emergence of Jaylen Waddle I reevaluated my position and realized that WRs being more comfortable catching with their bodies is a lot more viable than I thought.  Sure it isn't preferential to a guy with a giant catch radius and hands strong enough to consistently contest jump balls away from his body, but it really doesn't disqualify a receiver from being not just successful but elite in the NFL.

Travis Kelce is the best TE in the league and he is another guy who i realized catches with his body or bucket catches 90% of the time. But he makes it work by being an incredible athlete who can get open and make plays after the catch, and having the technique, aggression and body control to box out defenders in traffic and on contested balls. He is honestly a decent comp for Johnston in my view, since their playstyles are kinda similar. Big bodies who are YAC monsters. 

Johnstons biggest weakness isn't his hands or tendency to bucket catch imo. Like I said I am not really that worried about the body/bucket catching, and if you watch the tape he does show flashes of improvement in that regard with several high point catches, one handed catches, and catches where he plucks the ball off the turf. His biggest weakness is his lack of aggressiveness at the catch point. He was not as successful as a guy with his size and strength should be at the point of attack and allowed incompletions and tipped passes that he could have caught. But again, there are examples on tape of him making some fantastic contested catches that a WR 3 inches shorter than him could never make. Just watch his Sophomore tape vs Oklahoma and you will see what I mean. 

All in all, I think people are missing the forest for the trees when it comes to Johnston. His size, and athleticism are ultimate equalizers. His hands aren't the best for a prototypical WR, but guys with the elite traits he has like Kelce (elite after the catch ability and size) and Waddle (elite speed and after the catch ability) make that technique work effortlessly. His aggression leaves something to be desired, but he can still compete for balls that smaller WRs could never make just on account of his size and jumping ability. And considering he has the agility and balance after the catch of a guy 3 inches shorter than him, it's really not such a glaring weakness. He's gonna be a steal at 22.",1.0,ravens,t3_10zxgoy,False,0.0, :SHADES:,2023-02-12T12:43:11Z,ravens,-0.0286567978117147

Lamar has sustained two lower body injuries in as may seasons, both of which were severe enough to keep him sidelined for significant time.  Lamar is also a player whose elite mobility defines him, and that mobility is a huge part of what makes him special.  I really think you have purple glasses on if you don't look at thag and think that kind of history could reasonably be expected to impact his future.


A Lamar Jackson who has lost just half a step of quickness would be half the QB he currently is.  You can't just bury your head in the sand because you like him.  I like him.  It's critical to also be realistic.


It's a simple truth that a contract like what Lamar is asking for binds the franchise's future to his performance for at least half a decade.

* The drafting of Markus Wheaton, a rare Steelers WR who didn't work out
* Kamar Aiken's flash in the pan in 2015
* The saga of Breshad Perriman
* The complete inability to develop Chris Moore into anything beyond an okay returner

Basically the only accomplishment you can argue he has are Kamar Aiken's magic year - and given he failed to get him to sustain that momentum the next year I dunno how much credit he gets there - and being the TE coach for Andrews' formative years, and I'd argue that given the rest of his resume that was more Andrews being that good than anything he did.

31387,177812,177812,ZombieFeedback,"* Marcus Peters - I honestly don't know. He looked slower this year, and he's 30 trying to bounce back from an ACL tear. He's only just 30 last week though, and while he was slower, he's still a clear-cut CB2 on this roster. A lot of it imo depends on how much money he wants. 80/20 rule, if you think Pepe or one of the other young CBs can grow and step up, it's a consideration given all the money you're going to have tied up in guys like Lamar soon. This is the toughest one I think.
* Roquan Smith - Bubble guy, not even considering an extension /s
* Justin Houston - I think you bring him back. It depends how much money he wants, if he's asking for a lot then it'll be hard to justify with Bowser and Ojabo both back to 100% and Oweh hopefully over his sophomore slump. That's three big ""ifs"" though, and even then you're thin there.
* Kyle Fuller - Much like Peters you've got the uncomfortable situation of a 30 year old cornerback coming off an ACL tear. (Happy birthday btw Kyle, yesterday was the day!) Fuller is going to be a lot cheaper though so I think you can make that call a lot easier. He's a local guy so I imagine he wants to play here too. This becomes a given imo if you don't re-sign Juiceman.
* Lamar Jackson - *Gestures vaguely at the 7,000,000 threads about whether Lamar gets signed*
* Ja'Wuan James - Cut him loose. It was worth a shot, but the reclamation project looks like a failure. Other than 24 snaps in the season opener, it will be four years since he last played in the regular season by next year. Eight since he played a full season. Stanley looked great, Mekari is the ultimate reserve, and I feel very good about Faalele as depth given how he handled spot duty as a rookie, and he'll only get better.
* Sammy Watkins - Ask your new OC what he thinks. Sammy's big advantage was he already knew the system, but with Roman likely departing, that is out the window. You can do a lot worse for your WR3/4, but he's really not worth too much more than vet minimum at this point.
* Jason Pierre-Paul - See what happens with Houston. If Justin stays, I think you let JPP walk. If he leaves, another OLB you can trust would be wise.
* Brent Urban - Keep. Unsung hero on the DL. Hope no other teams noticed.
* Steven Means - Let him go. He was having a great preseason, but recovering from a torn Achilles at 33 is tough.
* Josh Oliver - As with the Lizard King, ask your new OC. For me, it depends what you think of Kolar. I liked the potential he flashed, but that was one game. Do you feel comfortable with him as TE3? In either case, don't pay too much. Someone will probably want to jump on him as a revitalization project a la Hurst in Cincy, and let them overpay.
* Vince Biegel - Cheap prove-it deal. Torn Achilles, but he's on the right side of 30. Will he bounce back? Who knows. I'm willing to extend a low-cost offer to find out. If he doesn't want it, fine, no need to get into a bidding war.
* Kenyan Drake - Walk. JK and Gus are back, Justice had a good season, if someone throws megabucks at Hill then sure, but I don't see that, so I see no reason to bring Kenyan back. Hell, I'd probably be down to grab a mid-late round RB like Devon Achane or Kendre Miller before bringing back Drake. Late-round RBs are not exactly an unheard of thing, especially as RB3 to develop for a year.
* Daryl Worley - Offer him a deal but don't overspend. I like him as a depth corner, but you don't spend starter money on depth.
* Demarcus Robinson - Offer market value, don't go bidding. He was utterly overmatched as WR1, but with Bateman and Duvernay back - and hopefully another WR added in the draft - I think he can be solid as a WR3/4. Obviously depends on Watkins too.
* Kevon Seymour - Re-sign. He's not a very good depth corner but he's acceptable. He *is* a very good special teamer.
* Tyler Huntley - I don't know how original-round tenders work for UDFAs. If you can potentially get a pick out of it, even a seventh, then tender him and see what happens. Don't go any higher than that though, and if you can't original-round an UDFA and your cheapest option is a third, just skip it. Anthony Brown didn't honestly look that much worse and he's at his base as a rookie. You could do worse as a backup though. If someone pays the tender, pocket the draft pick.
* Trystan Colon - Offer him fair money for a backup. You can never have too much OL depth.
* Kristian Welch - Offer him a contract with a $1m hit. He and Malik Harrison are basically the same player, Welch is a little faster and Malik is a little more sure of a tackler, and both are special teams guys at this point. Malik's locked in here for another year, but you would save $1.1m cutting him and re-signing Welch. If you can save money getting a roughly identical player, do it. Otherwise, no reason to spend on a special teams linebacker.
* Geno Stone - Keep keep keep. He's not on-par with Williams or Hamilton but his play was invaluable when Marcus went down. Fantastic depth safety.
* Del'Shawn Philips - Probably just a camp body. He's here, he knows the defense, give him a chance, but he'll probably be gone by the time pads are coming on.
* Nick Moore - Do not break up the Wolf Pack 2.0. Sign him. Man just made all-pro, he earned it.
* Justice Hill - Re-sign. He's never going to eclipse Gus or JK, but he's a very good RB3, *and* he plays everywhere on special teams.
* Ben Powers - Depends on if you think Cleveland can take over LG. He played LG last year, and this year he gave Zeitler breathers at RG. If you think Cleveland is ready to be the guy - which I assume is why we drafted him - put him in and let Ben get overpaid. If you're not confident in him, try to re-sign him.

Do that for the full season and you're #3 in the league in YPC, right between Lamar and Josh. You're a clear-cut #1 amongst RBs, nobody else is above six. Do it for 250 carries - a reasonable count for a #1 RB - and you'd be leading the league in rushing yards in 2022. He was killing it. Could he keep that pace up for a full year? We'll find out in 2023. But was he doing it right now and by all appearances keeping it up in the playoffs? You bet!

We gave him 13 carries all game. In a game where the largest deficit was nine points, and where nearly the entire game was a single-score game. With a backup QB and practice squad WRs, we have a guy who's an absolute force on the ground, and was averaging about five yards a pop tonight, who stretched ten miles to get us a touchdown, and we couldn't even get him up to the 14 carries he's averaged in the other games since his return. Think about that: We used him *less* than we typically do tonight! Arguably our best weapon other than Andrews, and we used him *less than average* in a win-or-go-home playoff game.

There's no game to save him for after this, it's do or die. You sat him last week specifically so you could lean on him tonight. And then you didn't. In spite of never being behind by double digits.

Hop is done in Arizona. The new GM won't like him and he hasn't produced like his did with the Texans. He will come cheaper than Evans too, since Arizona isn't in a rebuild and would value Stone more. A 4th + Stone

Otherwise you'd have a shitton more cap casualties and forced trades every offseason compared to what we have now. And I don't think it would be a good thing for the average roster turnover in the league to skyrocket - it makes it harder for teams to build chemistry and culture over time and ultimately harms the on-field product. And I'm not sure if it was meant as sarcasm but your point about load management is also interesting - the irony of players getting guaranteed money (so that they can play as much as they want without worrying about it), is that teams now have an incentive to not let them play as often, so they can protect them and don't have to waste a ton of cap space on an injured player. In the NBA a third of the league basically knows they aren't competitive and aren't making the playoffs from game 1 of the seaons, while a third knows they are guaranteed to make it. Add on the fact that there are 82 games and no ones going to bat an eye if a player on a shoo-in playoff team misses 5 or even 10 games, and the players getting rest days aren't going to complain. The NFL is completely different - every game is massively important, and some players are probably going to get pissed off about getting benched or dropped from the roster for load management reasons (whether its because it because it makes it harder for them to make contract incentives, or it's just in their competitive nature, or they just straight up miss being out there with the boys).",0.0,ravens,t3_10vcy8v,False,0.0,None,2023-02-06T13:15:25Z,ravens,-0.00510011751

43288,253656,253656,ripthisaccount6,"NFL will always be an unfair league. 

The “officiating” problem has been a problem since the inception of the league. 

If a many billion dollar league cannot employ full time unbiased refs, there is a reason behind it. 

Could they make the league fair? Absolutely. They would just have to hire full time, unbiased refs and they would have to ensure that no team has a given narrative, and a system in place to prevent bad calls.

Instead, the current system is for them to make the bad call, not review that call, and then “apologise” for it the day after. 

Guess what? Making that bad call was intentional. They want to push a given narrative, or rig the Vegas line. They want to tell you how great mahomes is by handing him the win, or they want to fuck over people betting on the eagles.

The NFL, a multi billion dollar league, could easily implement a fair system, but choose not to. 

People casually watching the sport don’t realise this.

Just look at the AFC Championship game where there was a whole do-over to give the chiefs another down, so that they could win. 

Let’s look at the 2019 NFC championship game. There was the most blatant PI of all time, and all refs on the field, including the one that saw the play, decided not to call anything. 

They then made PI reviewable, for only a season before taking that away. Why did they take it away? Control. They wanted to appear like they’re helping the Saints, but really it’s intentional. 

Anyone with a brain, including a 3 year old, and the ref, absolutely knew it was PI. But didn’t call it. 

If that doesn’t open your eyes I don’t know what will. 

I’m not saying every NFL game is rigged, but select games, specifically playoff games are 100% rigged on the officiating side of things. 

I don’t believe the players are in on it, but the officials control the narrative.

Once you understand that the NFL ultimately is an entertainment product, and that the NFL has incentives to push a given narrative, and has monetary incentives of a particular team winning. The only way they can push this without it being blatant is through poor officiating.

Acting like the NFL can do no wrong and that it is all the refs fault is a mistake, the NFL control these refs.",-6.0,ravens,t3_110y2k9,False,0.0,Poor Mans Taysom Hill,2023-02-12T21:32:58Z,ravens,-0.0009934894825877

Harbaugh gets a lot of passes for stabilizing the organization that was pretty inconsistent from 2001-2007, following the Super Bowl win. The team hasn't been outright bad during his tenure unless injuries were involved, but a lot of people fail to realize that pivoting to Lamar in 2018 literally saved his job. 

I'd say Harbaugh has three main tendencies which really work against him. 

1. His clock management is not great.
2. His failure to acknowledge and address issues from the coaching staff. 
3. The team repeatedly plays down to competition. (2019 is an outlier)
