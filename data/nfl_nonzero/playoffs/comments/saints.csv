128,7000,7000,Alistair_Burke,"As a DC: A large amount of hope.

As a HC: I'm not hopeful.

Both sides can find what they want to be for or against, but I think he's less likely to succeed than be a good HC. There are a few things to examine.

QB:
The Saints don't have one. If you don't have a solid QB, you won't go anywhere. Also, DA had better QB play than Payton did in 2021 and still had a worse record.

Taysom:
The Saints had a great record when Taysom rushed for over 50 yards. I heard DA didn't like Taysom because he was Payton's boy. If he helps, he helps. I think DA got in his own head with Taysom. Maybe he's learned.

OC:
We all know that Carmichael was abysmal. Can he be trusted to work with a new QB and, maybe, get a rookie ready? I don't know. Everything probably rests on this. Carmichael also couldn't use Kamara right despite seasons of watching Payton. He plateaued with Taysom, too. I lost faith in Carmichael, and DA gave him a vote of confidence. If he's wrong, that's it.

D-line:
It's getting worse. DA needs to identify the right guys for the job. The line has been inconsistent for a few seasons. Teams can now run on the Saints. That said, they did enough to not drag the defense down. You expect DA to get that out of the unit, and he did.

LBs:
Looking great. Werner was a great 2nd round pick, and Elliss looks legit. Those two and DeMario are an amazing part of the team. DA had a vision for certain LBs, and scouting found them. Total win.

Secondary:
I think DA was part of the personnel moves, and I hated the team picking Maye over Williams. Maye is older but cheaper. I also feel like he'll miss some games due to a suspension. His play was fine, but he lacks the range of Williams. On the other side, Badger looked bad for about half the season then finished strong. He's getting older, but maybe he can keep it up. The whole secondary seems to live or die with Lattimore. That's good and bad. They're great when he's healthy, but they're weaker than they were in 2021. DA prefers Adebo to Taylor, which does confuse me. The unit got worse, but it's still really good when Lattimore is there.

Special teams:
This entire unit became a mess. Gilikin couldn't stay consistent while Lutz started weak, got right, then struggled at the end. Punt coverage is okay, so they have that. It got worse under DA. I don't know if it's his fault, but it is his job to find a solution.

Optics/Leadership:
At his best, you could say DA is a silent assassin/stoic coach. You don't see anything from him on game day. When the team is winning, that's a quirk you just shrug at. When the team struggles with penalties and execution, it looks like he doesn't care. Once you get that reputation, you don't shake it. Ask Aaron Brooks. Players were terrified of being around Payton after making a mistake. DA doesn't project that. That's fine if he has some enforcers on his staff, but who fills that role? Nielsen did, but he's gone. With guys like Payton and Campbell gone, there's no one like that on offense. DA doesn't have to change his demeanor, but he will have to rely on hard-nosed coaches. It doesn't seem like he's aware of that. I know some are tired of the now meme ""Keep doing what you're doing"", but it hasn't disappeared for a reason. It's who he is. When times are good, that's a fine approach. When the team has many weaknesses, it's not so good.

I want the team to succeed, but I get the feeling that DA is in over his head.",3.0,saints,t3_10rce3a,False,0.0,None,2023-02-02T07:19:52Z,saints,0.0069011357378329

Jacobs would probably be used better in New Orleans than Kamara since Carmichael seemed to forget he was one the team unless he wanted to rush him up the middle (same with Tayson, but to a more drastic degree).

Adams is better than Olave and anyone else we've talked about. That could change in three to four years. Sheheed and Renfrow are different WRs, so they're hard to compare. Renfrow wasn't healthy last season, so I have no issue giving it to Shaheed.

Waller is a better TE than anyone on the Saints's roster. Like Renfrow, availability is the only issue.

First of all, Carr is young enough that I'm pretty sure he feels like he's got another run as a starter in him, and a huge part of success in the NFL of that position is about confidence, so drafting a quarterback in the first round would kind of defeat the purpose. 

Secondly, the biggest knock or one of the biggest knocks on Hooker is that he is 25 years old and is rehabbing from his knee injury, so people already feel like you're losing a year of value of him as a starter. But recent reports show that he is well above schedule with that, and expects to be ready to participate in training camp.

Lastly, there were some rumblings from the organization about changing the offensive scheme a little bit. Making it more modern, and if that's the case they need someone who can run it properly.

My personal philosophy on coaching is that, if you have one that has the traits and capabilities to win a championship, you are patient with them and give them every opportunity to win. If you don't, there's no point in delaying the inevitable. 

During Payton's 7-9 years, there was confidence that he had the ability to turn it around, which he did. So I advocated for and was very happy that the team utilized patients to let him finish the job. 

Allen just doesn't inspire that confidence, so I wish bait would have been cut and we could have brought in a DeMeco Ryans or someone to see what they have to offer. And since we didn't, and since I don't have a lot of confidence in him, winning, tanking seems like the most logical outcome here.

7593,73689,73689,Jopplo03,"I‚Äôm going to copy and paste u/ daybreaker comment because BountyGate deserves more than Roger Goodell‚Äôs investigation which a federal judge called ‚Äúfundamentally‚Äù flawed:

tl;dr  The coaches never admitted to paying for injuries (despite what r/nfl would have you believe). They said there was a pay for performance pool, which paid for interceptions, fumbles, and yes, big hits - but players didnt get paid if a hit was illegal or flagged. Goodell also never produced any solid evidence to back up injuries - just circumstantial evidence and evidence backing up the pay for performance pool.

 Roger Goodell claimed the Saints had a system from 2009-2011 where they would pay to specifically injure other players. He claimed to have several thousand pages of evidence of this, but refused to show it to anyone. Instead, he said what some of the evidence was, and the media went to town taking his word for it.

The coaches and players never admitted to any bounties - only to a pay for performance program, where you would get bonuses for interceptions, fumbles, big hits, etc.

But by then, public opinion was easily swayed by the media showing one hit on Kurt Warner, a few hits on Favre, and playing one audio tape by Gregg Williams, over and over and over and over, while still not asking to actually see any of the other evidence Goodell had.

To further advance the farce Goodell brought in a ""special investigator"" Mary Jo White, who claimed they had received a signed confession from a player, so the case was basically open and shut.

But then the NFLPA leaked the ""confession"" and it wasnt a confession.

Goodell said he had the bounty ledger, full of pages of a history of payments for ""cart offs"" and other injuries. Except when they released a page that had ""cart off"" payments on it, it was for a game where no one had been injured. The NFL quickly revised their statement saying it was actually for a different game.... that also didnt have any injuries in it.

The NFL then said they had a powerpoint presentation from Gregg Williams to the defense that specifically references bounty payments.  Except the NFLPA leaked that one too, and it was a ridiculous Dog the Bounty Hunter themed presentation that was just creating metaphors for their gameplan to the popular-at-the-time TV Show.

Those are just a few examples. Basically, any time Goodell said he had evidence, and it got leaked, that ""evidence"" didnt say what Goodell said it did.

And yet no one in the media really cared about all the inconsistencies. They kept writing their articles about how shameful all this was. Getting on their soapboxes. Pete Prisco, in 2011, had said the Falcons shouldve injured Drew Brees to keep him from breaking the passing record against them. But then he became the biggest critic of ""Bountygate"".

The whole thing was a giant media shit storm created by Goodell, because the league needed a scapegoat to look like they were ""tough on player safety"" ahead of the retired players concussion lawsuit. And it apparently worked, because the league got off BIG TIME with the relatively small settlement the judge awarded.

Basically, Gregg Williams is an over-exaggerating asshole who uses harsh language to fire up his team. But to this day there is no solid evidence of any payments for actual injuries. The details of the pay for performance plan even specifically pointed out that players didnt get paid a bonus for any illegal hits. And from 2009-2011, the Saints were near the bottom of the league in personal fouls and opposing team injuries.

Now, pay for performance was certainly illegal in terms of violating the salary cap. But the media firestorm and outrage wasnt over the salary cap violations - it was over the injuries. Which were never proven. We had several players suspended for a year, Coach Payton suspended for the year, our GM Mickey Loomis suspended for 8 games, and ou assistant coach Joe Vitt suspended for 4 games. We also lost two 2nd Round draft picks, and were fined $500k.

Paul Tagliabue was later brought in and voided the player suspensions. Goodell also said that if the Saints cooperated, and helped the league start several safety initiatives in high schools, we would get our 2013 2nd Round pick back. Benson never spoke out against Goodell, and was entirely cooperative with anything he wanted. We never got our 2nd Round pick back.

Many people will claim there is proof of a $10k bounty on Favre from Vilma, or that it wasnt from Vilma, but actually from Mike Orenstein (who was in jail at the time and couldnt have actually sent anyone anything). There's never been any proof of these things - these all come from just one source, Mike Cerullo, who had actually been fired from the Saints for several reasons and had to be escorted from the facility by the police. Seeing as how he's the only ""witness"" Goodell ever had, it's pretty easy to call into question his reputation.

We were pretty much victims of trumped up charges that a lazy media did nothing to refute.",30.0,nfl,t3_10h7l8n,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints :Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-20T18:10:45Z,saints,-0.0093781053648511

8151,79768,79768,Kitchen_Net_GME,"I got more tin foil on Drew. Drew‚Äôs last season was 2020. In the off-season prior, Drew was doing very intense strength building and arm velocity building. 

https://theathletic.com/1986561/2020/08/11/how-drew-brees-is-using-his-legs-to-take-10-years-off-his-arm/?amp=1

‚ÄúHouse, a former Major League Baseball pitcher and coach who has built a second career as a throwing specialist for pitchers and quarterbacks, knows that each mile per hour of velocity Brees could achieve would translate to 1 yard of distance on his throws. They spent a month strengthening his arm and shoulder using various functional strength training techniques.‚Äù

And this: 

‚ÄúAfter a month in the gym, Brees took his arm to the field. In early July, House said Brees was throwing ‚Äú45-, 50-yarders like he was 25 years old again.‚Äù By late July, House said he was throwing ‚Äúballs 57, 58 yards without even trying.‚Äù

So a lot of people were excited when training camp started that the Brees deep ball was coming back. 

And then in training camp, we saw‚Ä¶‚Ä¶nothing. Three weeks into to basic 7x7 drills there was not one single deep pass from Drew. 

In training camp Drew has QB challenges for fun after practice. They try to hit targets and what not. 

I finally sat down to watch it and saw something immediately. Drew had a ‚Äúhitch‚Äù in his mechanics. Clear as day, and I have studied that man since 2006. 

I think he went all Tiger Woods on his shoulder and did more harm than good. I believe he had a significant injury from that training that never hit the press. His passes never were the same. 

To add on that, Brees broke like 11 ribs several weeks later. 

I think when he writes a tell all book there will be things that shock a lot of people regarding his health.

Edit: another example was 2010 season for Drew. He was not playing well at all. His 2009 was MVP worthy, as was his 2011 season. But by comparison his 2010 was awful. 

It later came out that he played the majority of the 2010 season with a torn MCL.",126.0,nfl,t3_10gy9lu,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2023-01-20T11:34:52Z,saints,0.0033425358395518

The very next pass was a routine throw on a slant to MT. This was a terrible throw and it skipped on the ground before it got to MT. 

The next throw was the infamous non call. The pass itself was very very soft. As mentioned earlier, the cornerback could have just played the ball for the pick 6. 

The corner imo was surprised how slow the pass was and arrived way to early. 

Then in OT Brees could not throw good passes. 

I‚Äôm 100% convinced he literally threw his arm out and he may not have been even able to play in the SB.

I mean the difference between the offense of the Saints in 2021 vs last year was a stark contract.  He knew that he had a talented QB that made questionable decisions so they focused on the run game with timely passes tossed in and through 6 1/2 games Winston had only thrown 150ish passes and looked great, this year prior to his benching the Saints had Winston already throwing 150 times in just 3 games.

He knows what Wilson can/can't do, he'll analyze the rest of the offense and figure out their strengths, and you'll see a drastic improvement on that side.

Jameis took back breaking (literally) sacks often too. Easy to forget, but if you rewatch the first game against the Falcons, the first 3 quarters were exactly that.

If he doesn‚Äôt take sacks in those positions he tries to force it downfield which leads to a lot of picks. 

Jameis stans can be funny. They see the upside and that‚Äôs literally it. His upside is crazy high, sure. Dudes got more talent than most QBs in the NFL, but his decision making is terrible and his lack of ability to check the ball down is why he will never be a long term starter.

15047,142001,142001,Skullkid1423,"Gregg Williams (our defensive coordinator for a few years, including our Super Bowl) was known for fast and hard hitting defenses. For years the NFL was trying to prove he lead a pay for injury program. The NFL investigated us by looking into sound bites from games and locker room speeches, interviewing coaches and players, as well as watching game film.  There was a lot of smoke to it, but the only thing anyone admitted to or could be proven was pay for performance pools. Basically whoever lead the team that week in big hits, TFLs, INTs, Fumbles, etc. would get the ‚Äúpot‚Äù of money that coaches and players contributed to. This program circumvents the salary cap by providing in house bonuses/bets. The NFL was also getting a lot of heat about CTE at the time (less about it being a thing and more about the NFL knowing about it and not acknowledging it) so this was a perfect way for the league to look like they were tough against injuries and made sure to hammer home the title ‚Äòbountygate‚Äô and try to punish the organization as much as possible. 

The league tried to suspend some key defensive players for a substantial amount of games, as well as Payton a full year, Gregg Williams and some defensive coordinators claimed to be involved indefinitely. The Saints appealed and the case went to former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. After he reviewed the findings along with the NFLPA Head (the guy literally in charge of keeping the players in the nfl safe) he determined the investigation the NFL lead contained no tangible evidence towards an actual bounty program, but rather pay for performance. Tagliabue did note there is a lot of stuff in there that could lead to the thought a program existed, however it was not substantial and he reversed the suspension of the NFL players and lowered the suspension to the coordinators to 6-8 games as the coaches did break that rule. He kept the suspension to Payton and Gregg Williams. The saints lost draft picks and were fined. 

Goodell and the league still won though, the headline of Bountygate stuck and not many people outside of saints fans actual researched the Tagliabue findings.

ETA: obligatory fuck Gregg Williams. 

Also, I‚Äôm not saying we didn‚Äôt have a bounty system in place, we probably did.

Just not sure it would lead to a SB. Not that Carr would, but the investment there is much less and lets us continue retooling despite having our QB for now. Expectations would also be less crushing than if we had a former MVP

Tbh if we were making a crazy swing--which I still think getting Carr or just rolling with Dalton and aiming for the draft next year is the best realistic path--even though it has a much chance of busting at that point I'd rather trade 2 1sts to the pick 5-10 range and try to get Anthony Richardson since that would be cheaper and the player would be younger. Not that Richardson wouldn't face a similar question mark with our coaching staff but I'm assuming the other top QBs are out of reach.

Veterans like Kamara, Cam Jordan, Demario, etc. make our roster good enough to make an attempt and otherwise we would actually lose money by moving them because we live in 'cap hell' without suffering too badly by restructuring them all the time

Ownership and FO doesn't want to shit the bed and lose our culture, which it's already a given that coaches and players sure don't. Why throw out everything we have and risk being the new Browns for a hypothetical future 'win the lottery' scenario. It should be obvious by now that having loads of open cap space and high picks does not make an ascension to contention any more likely than hovering around .500 and hoping a window opens, and likely means losing everything else you have going for you in the process. It's sustainable to be 'over' the cap unless you go absolutely all-in or a global crisis like COVID lowers the cap

You can chill on all-in moves and let the cap settle a bit without giving up on being competitive. And bringing in Derek Carr rather than a backup quality QB isn't exactly an all-in move. The Eagles are a good example of consistently retooling without bottoming out. Honestly, so are the Chiefs when they eventually moved to get Mahomes.

Dennis Allen has had 10+ losses in every season he‚Äôs been a head coach. Occam‚Äôs razor: sometimes the simplest answer is the right answer:

Dennis Allen is a bad head coach

If we had tanked in 2023 with Dennis Allen, we‚Äôd be in an amazing position right now:

No Maye who‚Äôs injured and has a suspension upcoming

No Mathieu who isn‚Äôt in our long term plans

Our 1st round pick at #10 or lower to get our next franchise QB

A much better cap situation because we didn‚Äôt go all out for Watson

If we try to compete this year, we end up stuck with a bad head coach, an old roster, and overpaying for a bad qb (carr, hendon hooker, etc)

You can tank but keep the good culture by keeping older vets just for the culture. For instance, Cam Jordan stays (if he wants) to keep the locker room culture after 2023

Here are the moves we can do to tank and set ourselves up for another SUPER BOWL WINDOW NOT BARELY WINNING SEASONS

trade Demario and resign kaden Elliss to have a dominate young Lb group 

Trade Bradley Roby for picks and play lattimore Adebo and Taylor

Trade mathieu  to a contender or just let him play out his contract

Resign Dalton to a 1 year deal and run it back with Dalton vs Winston 

Cut Thomas and don‚Äôt resign Landry. Do resign Harty to a 1 year prove it deal 

Trade Peat IF you get a good deal. Guards can play for a long time and a great OLine is important to a young qb for 2024

Don‚Äôt trade Kamara, he‚Äôs got a suspension and coming off a bad season he‚Äôll get nothing

Draft all depth position, DO NOT DRAFT A QB THEY ARE NOT A GOOD BET OUTSIDE TOP TO MIDDLE FIRST ROUND

let Davenport and Onyemata walk unless they accept cheap deals

Play our rookies like Payton Turner, if he sucks ok we lose more games. If he‚Äôs good great 

Overall, we are in the terrible mediocre middle of the colts, raiders, commanders, etc where it‚Äôs just patching holes on a shitty boat

Why does everyone need to be Sean Payton? Plenty of coaches coach without huge bursts of emotion consistently. Belichick, Reid, McCarthy, Reich are hardly animated on the sidelines for example. Doesn't mean their players didn't believe in them and certainly doesn't equal lack of success. Y'all act like DA is Jim Caldwell emotionally.

26767,247448,247448,myxanders,"This sub is a pathetic shit show right now.

There's a lot to unpack from the Richard stuff. 

One, the co-DCs hasn't ever and clearly didn't work out this time. That solved itself when Nielsen was hired away. 

Two, Richard has been here for two seasons, and yes we've seen some great secondary play overall in that time, but we weren't exactly starved for good DBs before that. The big difference was cutting down in penalties in the secondary.

Three, DA has overseen the building of the defense, the strength of our team, for 7.5 years now. It is highly unlikely that the guy who said ""keep doin what you've been doin"" is going to make such any drastic changes to the overall scheme that would ruin our defense. It's much more likely Richard wanted to add wrinkles that don't mesh with DA's philosophy.

Just because there's shakeups in the defensive staff doesn't mean the offensive staff isn't going to get touched. Yes, Pete is returning. But it's still too early to tell the final makeup of the staff on that side of the ball.

The doomsdayers in this sub are so annoying. One breath they want to tank, the next they complain that we're the Texans despite having a stable front office and talent on both sides of the ball.

The bottom line is the team took a bunch of risks to extend the window while Brees was around and attempt to prop it open once he left. Sometimes things just don't work out. I don't think anyone anticipated that Michael Thomas had fewer than 16 games left as a Saint after his record breaking season. I don't think anyone anticipated Trevor Penning getting turf toe and a Lisfranc injury in his rookie season. I don't think anyone anticipated a global pandemic would occur and cause an always-inflating salary cap to decrease for a season.

It sucks when it works out worse than anticipated. But that doesn't mean the front office isn't trying to win, despite what some loud ones here might suggest.",21.0,saints,t3_10rce3a,False,0.0,Ruiz,2023-02-01T20:15:53Z,saints,-0.0313506934435923

Tanking can happen at the front office level and arguably down to the head coaching level (see recent controversy with Lovie and the Texans at the end of the season or the Flores-Dolphins controversy). But below that, every assistant coach and every player is out there giving it their all with very few exceptions. Those exceptions might be something like a skill position player declining to hit someone aka ""business decision"" but otherwise they know their value is tied to their performance on tape and they have no reason to tank their own career prospects for the good of the organization. I guess you could argue that it becomes little challenging to motivate them if it's clear that the front office thinks the season is over, but that's subjective and hard to quantify.

We see front office-level tanking every year.

Let's say a defensive tackle mauls the QB about 3 full seconds after the ball is thrown. It's a blatant penalty. No argument from anyone there. Instead of gifting the offense 15 yards, simply boot the DE from the game (after a review of course) and suspend him for X games. For less severe examples, like reckless but not blatantly foul play like a DB colliding with a WR the wrong way, you can apply less severe penalties, but do NOT change the outcome of the play unless the infraction directly influenced the outcome of said play. In other words, a sack is still a sack and it's still 4th down. If the defender hit the QB dangerously, then punish the player directly and maybe the team indirectly (off the field - see below) if they do it too often.

You can also grade teams on how many instances of dangerous/reckless play they had in a given year to rank them by ""clean"" play level overall. The cleanest teams get the extra 9th home game and will get more primetime games than the dirty teams (the NFL doesn't want horrific injuries on primetime national TV... right?). You could also take draft picks from the dirtiest teams and award them to the cleanest teams on a sliding scale if you really wanted to punish them. I'm sure there could be more ways to reward/punish too - those are just off the top of my head.

28133,265850,265850,shyguyJ,"I would say Payton's roster construction and talent evaluation certainly leaves a lot to be desired.  We can say he was held back by 5 years of basically the worst defense in the history of the league, but he played a large role in constructing that defense. 

Outside of a few hits here and there, his drafting was pretty shit until Jeff Ireland came on board (the Lattimore/Kamara draft).

On the flip side, I'm not sure anyone consistently got more out of what they had to work with than Payton (even if his decisions directly resulted in ""what he had to work with"").  He and Brees carried those historically bad defenses to 7-9 (bleh) records or better.  For a brief moment, he made some people believe Jameis Winston was salvageable. When Brees went down, he steered a Teddy Bridgewater-led ship to almost not miss a beat.

The Taysom as a real QB romance was obviously misguided, but even then, we had a winning record.

One thing I will say about Payton is that he was always decisive and fully committed - and never scared to take a risk if he thought it was the best chance for the team.  Even if I disagreed with something he did, I always felt like he believed in it and got his players to believe in it.  In terms of motivation, fire, having the buy-in and support of the players, he is near the very top level of coaches, if not at the top.

My friend is a Packers fan, and after one of their playoff losses, he wrote in to a mailbag basically just saying ""Mike McCarthy is scared"" over and over because of his game management and decision making.

Having watched a ton of games with that friend, his feeling with McCarthy was always ""we're still gonna fuck it up"", while my feeling with Payton was always ""we've still got a chance"".

Didn't know the Donald was a Rams fan. Neat.

But to your point, as long as there are threads asking about sore spots or worst calls or bad officiating in general, this will come up.  

And you are right: bad calls went both ways.  But the bad calls were not equal. You get the Goff facemask, you get first and goal, hell, let's say you even get a touchdown.  Cool.  There's still 6 minutes left in the game, we still drive down, and we still have a chance to win the game. That doesn't even account for the hands to the face/roughing the passer on Brees in overtime on the pick, but you probably don't want to talk about that.

However, if you go back through the comments in this thread, no Saints fan was ""crying"" here or really saying much other than ""yea, that sucked"" until you felt attacked and butthurt and the need to ""defend"" your team.  

Imagine being so sensitive, salty, and attention whorey that you go into a thread about ""most painful moments"" for each team, knowing 100% what Saints fans will bring up, see that they are talking about it in a pretty normal manner, and then decide that you have to jump into that sore wound and twist a little knife in it just for the fuck of it *after you benefitted from it* and then call the fans ""crybabies"" after you instigated them responding to you.

Dalton‚Äôs thing was he would panic and tuck the ball and then just kind of hunch over on wobbly knees for a couple seconds, then when the defender brushed him Dalton would fold up like a lawn chair. When Carr panics, his technique is more like a happy feet dance, and then he‚Äôll just bolt in a random direction- straight into a defender‚Äôs arms usually.

This is a big part of why Brady‚Äôs pocket presence is so legendary. He was an expert as positioning himself in the pocket so that his lineman had the best possible angle to block the defenders. With Carr it‚Äôs the opposite- when he panics and dances in a random direction it literally makes it impossible for his lineman to stay on the defender (but you‚Äôll almost always see the ignorant fans blaming the OL).

I have a sneaking suspicion that Carr‚Äôs issues with panicking and poor pocket presence really ramped up after he suffered that bad leg injury.

Signing expensive Carr (who we have to give the Raiders draft capital to obtain) is going to guarantee more ‚Äúcap hell‚Äù and ‚Äúcan kicking‚Äù and is going to reduce our ability to sign free agents at other positions and is also going to reduce our ability to retain homegrown talent.
