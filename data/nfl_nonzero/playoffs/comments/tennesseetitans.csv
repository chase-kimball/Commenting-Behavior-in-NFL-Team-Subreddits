662,1246,1246,0le_Hickory,"I feel bad for Ossai because Mahomes entire game is an exploit of the QB rules. No one in the 80-90s is underhand flipping the ball in the grasp. No, defenders had already murdered the QB at that point in the sack then. Basically, Mahomes is the best at making something happen in the second when he knows he is caught and the defender slowing up to not get a penalty. 

So… season on the line Mahomes is running down the sideline. You let up… Tony Romo orgasms ‘Jim, he just faked out the defense. So smart another 10 yards. Brilliant. That’s probably the game.’  

That is playing in Ossai’s mind. Don’t let up. He’s a tricky one. He probably sees that he’s out of bounds now but Ossai is big and momentum cannot stop now. An excuse me hand on the back. Trying to stop Ossai’s momentum before he crashes into the bench.  Yellow flags.

1784,18416,18416,Bieber_hole_69,"Only real way to restructure him and lower cap hit with a year left on the deal is to extend him as far as I can see. The 2021 restructure to fit Julio under the cap did enough damage to future cap that he'll be on the cap through 2025 due to void years regardless. I'm also pretty sure Tannehill does not want to play on a lame-duck contract in 2023.

I'm sure there's a middle-ground to be reached for both sides that gets Tannehill on a manageable deal while giving him future security in return. The cap should also continue to go up, so his salary at current rate would look better in 2024 than it does now.

If he was extended through 2025 and you converted $20,000,000 of his 2023 base salary to a signing bonus, it would lower his cap hit for 2023 by by a bit over $13,000,000. That deal, along with cutting Dupree, Lewan, Woods, Cunningham, Bullock, and Jamarco Jones pre-6/1, and also with a Simmons extension probably puts us at around $45,000,000 in cap space heading into free agency.

There's something to be said about getting above-average QB play for $30,000,000 or so against the cap that Tannehill can provide. Derek Carr and Daniel Jones may be getting upwards of $40,000,000/yr after this off-season. You would also have to tie the cap down with guarantees further into the future with any free-agent/trade candidate QB than you would with a Tannehill extension. It provides more flexibility for the near future than bringing in an outside QB would.

If the team is not in love with one of the QBs in this draft to trade up, I think the best solution to the QB situation is probably to just extend Tannehill and keep him through 2024. You can reassess in the draft next year. His salary and a rookie's salary wouldn't be prohibitive to have together in 2024 if you wanted to draft someone and try to get out of a Tannehill's extension for 2025. But all in all, if Tannehill's gonna be the QB in 2023, it's probably best for both sides to extend him.

Edit: Also looking into other restructure and extension candidates, with a Landry restructure and a Henry extension you can probably free close to another $15M in cap space. We could easily be sitting with around $55,000,000 to work with come March if that's the route Carthon and Vrabel want to take for a re-tooling of the roster. It also does not tie us down to the Tannehill/Henry offensive core for longer than 2024, and could still be worked around if they want to move on after 2023 instead.

And if you wanted to get *really* bold with it and expect Tannehill, Henry, and Landry to be on the team in 2025 with salaries comparable to what they get now, with salary-to-bonus conversions and all the previously listed moves you can get to around $70,000,000 in cap space. The only issue obviously being you can't move-on from any of those guys before 2026 without some dead money to work around...but if they think both guys aren't going to seriously decline and we can't find upgrades through the draft or free agency at better value...why not? Trimming the fat with the cap casualties previously listed doesn't make this team much worse than it already was, none of those guys were significant contributors and missed most of the season, (aside from Bullock, but he's too expensive for a kicker of his caliber.)

There's no play calls or designs to get around the personnel problems when you have to start the worst tackle pair in the league, the smallest lineman in the league at left guard, the worst receiver group in the league, and have a backup at QB for several games. By the end of the season we had one Day 1 starter left on the o-line, and he was a third round rookie. Anybody calling plays for that offense once the injuries started pouring in was going to crash and burn.

If Vrabel had any inkling that Kelly may be a decent OC or the future at that spot, why burn him with those personnel problems? The offense was going to be bottom-five regardless of play-caller, and we'd be having the same ""Fire Kelly"" chants we had with Downing by January if it was him calling the plays.

Why not just let Downing go down with the ship for the last month or two of the season instead? The issues inherent to the offensive struggles were the roster, that wasn't changing if you fire the OC mid-season.

This is probably a move in the right direction, as en vogue as natural grass has recently become around the league and with fans.

I think the Jags overpaid for Kirk, but that doesn't also mean Woods is anywhere near the same class as Kirk now. Kirk is a way better player and is worth way more. Kirk played like a bonafide WR1 last year while Woods played more like a WR3 on an actually competitive offense.

I think there's about a 99.999% chance Woods is not on the team in 2023, he does not provide anywhere close to the value saved if he's cut. You cannot be a competitive team and try to upgrade at WR and elsewhere when $12M that could be freed up is still tied up in an over-the-hill Robert Woods. Hell, we need that money just to get under the cap and sign our rookies, so he's a no-brainer cut in March.

You can get the production we got from Woods out of a 2nd or 3rd round pick. In fact, three of the five WRs taken in the 2nd round of the 2022 draft had more yards than Woods, and Romeo Doubs as a 4th round pick that only started seven games had only 102 less yards than Woods.

1806,18442,18442,Bieber_hole_69,"I think the lack of talent in the position group is more at fault for Tannehill getting battered last season, but Carter did not do much to alleviate that. Injuries decimated our o-line group this year, I'm sure Carter would look better after last season if Lewan could have been in the starting line-up for more than 5 quarters or whatever. Carter was stuck with the worst tackle group in the league last year and the smallest o-lineman in the league at left guard. Hard for anyone to make that situation better, but it's definitely possible Carter made it worse.

Dennis Daley was giving edge rushers a free shot at Tannehill at least once in pretty much every game, but because he was better in the run blocking game he was kept in the starting lineup. When Radunz finally cracked the starting line-up in December he looked pretty good in pass protection, (at least compared to Daley lol,) until he immediately tore his ACL.

I don't know how much of it can be put on Carter vs. Vrabel/Downing's prioritization of the run game over pass protection, but under Carter the Titans have never really had a great pass blocking group. They can maul in the run game as good as anyone though.

When given good talent though, like in 2019, Carter's o-line looked great. Nate Davis has developed well, but outside of that there's not any guys he's really, ""developed."" Ben Jones, Taylor Lewan, Jack Conklin, and Roger Saffold were all standouts before Carter got here.

Other than Davis there's been only busts on the o-line under Carter so far. Isaiah Wilson (probably not his fault though,) and Dillion Radunz were both highly regarded prospects that have flopped in the NFL. From the 2022 draft NPF's future remains to be seen, but he did seem to play worse as the season went along which is not a great look for Carter.

He's also known to be a real hardass too. Players don't really seem to like him. Taylor Lewan got into some scuffles during Carter's first season and they butted heads to a serious degree. It seems like Lewan eventually warmed up to him, but his recent comments on BWTB have not painted Carter in a positive light at all. There's also a decent chance he was a catalyst in causing [Ty Sambrailo to retire in the middle of the 2021 season](https://titanswire.usatoday.com/2021/10/13/tennessee-titans-ty-sambrailo-retirement-keith-carter-report/), although I think Sambrailo also gave some BS reasons behind retiring too, but that's a longer story.

All in all, I don't think any Titans fans are sad to see Carter go. He may be a decent coach and the lack of talent on the o-line isn't really something to blame him on, but he definitely wore out his welcome with fans and players. I do personally think he's a good coach though, and maybe his abrasiveness has lessened since he started here. But even then, abrasive personalities like that in coaching tend to have diminishing returns as they wear out their welcome with players, and it seemed like it was just time to move on from him regardless of his coaching ability.

Edit: [Mike Herndon brought up a good point about Carter's o-lines getting better as the season went on, which is a good sign for his coaching ability](https://twitter.com/MikeHerndonNFL/status/1618639835954319362?s=20&t=wSF-Whf33aMrsz2Z0J44mw), but I will counter that with his o-lines often starting the season with injured players or new starters that got better as they got more reps as well. The 2019 o-line was an improvement on 2018 and down the stretch in 2019, (when they were genuinely an elite group, watch the left side in the Divisional Round against Baltimore. Lewan and Saffold put on as dominant a performance as you will ever see,) after Conklin got his groove back post-ACL tear, Saffold adjusted to a new team for the first time in his career, and Nate Davis entered the starting line-up in full as a rookie. Of course an o-line is going to look better later in the season when all those pieces start to gel for the first time. I think the o-line is a position group that, regardless of the position coach's ability, will tend to get better as the season goes along and guys start to mesh well together. Obviously it's a bad sign if they get worse, but I think it reflects a bit less on the coach's ability when compared to a d-line group getting better as the season progresses for example.",73.0,nfl,t3_10luv49,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2023-01-26T10:10:37Z,tennesseetitans,0.0196015531488588

Using the Drafttek trade value chart, the Bengals would be giving up Tee Higgins + 300 dcap in exchange for 490 dcap + 420 dcap.

That's 610 in net draft capital for Cincy, or the equivalent of about the 30th or 31st overall pick. Chase Claypool with a year left on his contract was traded for the 32nd overall pick, (although as it's a 2nd rounder, it's worth less than the typical 32nd overall pick,) so I just cannot see the Bengals feeling like that's fair value for Higgins.  

For that compensation it would probably just be worth it for the Bengals to keep Higgins for another year and see what they can do about an extension, or just wait to get a 3rd round comp pick when he leaves in FA. Burrow won't get expensive until 2024, it would be worth it to get another year of Higgins before then even if he just walks. I also can't imagine that we wouldn't be outbid for Higgins if this was the offer, somebody else would be willing to pay more.

Now without that 2nd pick coming back to us with Higgins, that would put the net draft capital the Bengals receive in return as 910, or the equivalent of the 18th or so pick this year.

You don't want to shake things up more than you have to when you had a top-10 offense the year before.

Steckel's been with this team since 2013, pretty similar to Arthur Smith in the way he's been able to keep the job through a bunch of different HCs and OCs with way different backgrounds and philosophies.

In his time as HC here, Vrabel has made only one outside OC hire of the three he's had so far. LaFleur was the only one, and being it was on his first staff here it's not like he had much of a choice. What was Vrabel gonna do? Promote Jason Michael to be OC? He had to hire outside.

And say what you will about the decision to promote Downing in hindsight, but the exact same process got us Arthur Smith in 2019. We had a top 5 offense for a season and a half with Smith, there was no reason to shake things up when he left for Atlanta. So they promoted the TE coach in Downing that also had an outsized hand in designing a red zone offense that was historically efficient.

Obviously though, the hire did not work out. It does provide Vrabel with the perfect opportunity to shake up the offense with an outside hire at OC though.

Maybe Steckel will be the next Arthur Smith or maybe he'll be the next Todd Downing, who knows.

They got the combine in for 2020, but there were no pro-days or private workouts. Getting hands on with players and seeing them in person seems to be a large portion of how J-Rob evaluated players. Look at how many Senior Bowl guys we've drafted over the years lol.

Then for 2021 in-person meetings for player evaluations were once again limited, but also there was such a limited college season for tape evaluation as well as players just straight up opting out of the 2020 season.

Then when we're essentially back to normal for the 2022 draft process and it ends up being a pretty good draft class for J-Rob and company.

Obviously nobody could have predicted such massive changes to the scouting process would happen in 2020, and it seems there's some correlation between J-Rob's drastic downturn in draft quality that took place concurrently. 

Adapt or die though, he could have weathered the storm better if he wasn't so stubborn and set in his ways. Some analytics or less traditional means of scouting could have prevented some of the worst whiffs. Some of the more forward thinking orgs around the league, (Eagles, 49ers, Ravens,) didn't seem to have the same level of difficulty navigating the COVID drafts. 

With the 49ers, Trey Sermon is the one big whiff of those two classes, but by my count all 12 other draft picks across those two classes are still on their roster.

And if the Colts went 8-0 down the stretch instead of 1-7, Jim Irsay would have been a football f’n savant for hiring Jeff Saturday.

I don’t think speculation based on a hypothetical situation is a very productive or useful exercise.

We didn’t make the playoffs. Todd Downing didn’t keep his job. Why get upset or stressed out over an outcome that didn’t happen?

The rumors that Downing was getting fired started leaking from Ken Moore *before* the game against Jacksonville in Week 18, so do we even know the speculation based on a hypothetical to be substantive? Two different OCs on playoff teams were fired today, could Downing not have been a third had we got bounced in the Wild Card round?

And the fact that four different assistant coaches got fired, this was a staff house cleaning project that doesn’t seem like it could have been entirely contingent on one Week 18 win and playoff berth. It’s not like Downing was singled out, Carter was canned too. Vrabel and the FO were clearly unhappy with the offensive staff, I don’t think 8-9 or 9-8 instead of 7-10 was going to change that.

I feel too often here it’s being conflated that Vrabel not firing Downing mid-season is an indication he didn’t want to fire him at all. Do we know that to be the case? The one firm thing we know is that, yes, he die in fact fire Downing literally the day after the season ended. Just because you as a fan want a coordinator fired during the season does not mean it’s a reasonable or rational thing for an actual franchise to do. *Two* coordinators were fired during the season this year, and they both occurred a week before or immediately concurrent with the HC also being fired. It’s not normal procedure to make staff changes mid-season, even for the worst teams every season.

1826,18466,18466,Bieber_hole_69,"I would imagine they want to shake things up after firing Robinson.

Ossenfort and Robinson have extremely similar backgrounds as Patriots scouts through-and-through.

If ownership did not like Robinson's vision for the future of the team, they likely would not like Ossenfort's vision either because it's probably pretty darn similar. It would be pretty underwhelming to move on from a GM and replace him with the same exact kind of guy in Ossenfort that was only here for the worst years of Robinson's tenure as far as the direction of the roster and drafting goes.

Cowden may be an in-house guy that's been in the building longer than Ossenfort, but has a completely different background as Cowden got most of his early experience under Marty Hurney in Carolina. They likely have different philosophies because of this, even if Cowden worked under Robinson longer.

I would assume Ossenfort is a major ""Patriots Way,"" kinda guy, just like Robinson was. With this next GM the Titans were probably just not intending to go back in that same New England direction.",5.0,nfl,t3_10ekgsf,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2023-01-17T13:51:24Z,tennesseetitans,0.0047432533800601
1827,18467,18467,Bieber_hole_69,"One time, right after a tough loss, and not naming him isn't exactly harsh criticism. Vrabel never publicly undermined Robinson or said he was doing a poor job, outside of that one comment that was also directed at the receivers group themselves.

So you want somebody other than Todd Downing....to do exactly what Todd Downing was doing? And you would want them fired for doing that too, right? You want the waterboy calling plays by the end of the season? There would literally be no difference in the season if Todd Downing got fired on December 17th or waiting until January 9th like they did. You can't just fire people willy-nilly like that, there's a reason it's pretty rare for coaches to get fired during the season lol. A grand total of 2 coordinators were fired this year during the season, and both were fired at the same time the head coach was or within a week of the head coach being fired.

And yes, firing an OC is more impactful than firing a GM when it occurs during the season. The OC that is responsible for calling plays during games, installing the gameplan each week, being at practice every day, scouting future opponents, being in meeting rooms with players all day, etc. The GMs job is pretty limited during the season when it comes to day-to-day operations. Of course the GM is more impactful on the direction of the team at a macro level, but you'll notice an impact on the team more directly during the season by firing a coordinator than firing the GM.

The decision to fire the OC and the decision to fire the GM were also made by completely different people.

The 2020 and 2021 off-seasons are what got Robinson fired, full-stop. Ossenfort was here for those and not for the great 2016 and 2019 off-seasons that kept J-Rob employed.

Ossenfort was a Patriots guy through-and-through, just like Robinson. Did we really want that again?

That's two absolutely horrific drafts, some awful free agent signings, and the roster trending in a negative direction with what positives? Autry, the 2022 draft, and...? Some good UDFAs? Morgan Cox?

If we're looking at track record of the team while they were here, Ryan Cowden would be the pick over Ossenfort, but being completely honest it's probably not a bad thing to shake up the FO with outsiders given recent history.",8.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10ejxim,False,0.0,11,2023-01-17T13:25:15Z,tennesseetitans,0.0827536807666
1829,18469,18469,Bieber_hole_69,"Todd was fired after the season ended, isn't that criticism?

You want him to go up to the podium after a game and say, ""Yeah, playcalling was ass brother, we gotta get this bum out of here soon."" 

I'm sure there was internal criticism of Downing that wasn't aired publicly, including the fact he was *fired* immediately following the season. There wasn't any real benefit to firing Downing in December compared to January, nobody was making an offense with as many injuries and as little talent that much better by calling plays in Todd's stead.

In December Vrabel said: 

""We’re not going to make any coaching changes during the season. Those are things that I evaluate at the end of the season. I see what’s being taught. I have the luxury of going into each and every room. I hear what’s being coached. I hear the details. I hear the design of each and every play. So, that’s not something that I’m going to be doing right now. But again, we’ll evaluate everything at the end of the season and go from there.” 

And he did evaluate. And Downing got fired. That's not criticism? And I'm pretty sure he criticized the offense during the season at press conferences. He at least wasn't saying they were doing great or anything lol.

How many teams, good or bad, are firing coordinators during the season? Are they model franchises you want to be emulating? I think it's fine to not make any mid-season changes given the circumstances this year. What's the benefit? Would Tim Kelly have done any better than Todd Downing at calling plays for Joshua Dobbs to run with two of the worst tackles in the league and two back-ups on the o-line in front of him?

And what criticism did Vrabel air publicly about Robinson? Other than the quote after the KC game about not having anyone to throw to, when has he been outwardly critical of the roster construction? And it's not like he was wrong when he said they had nobody to throw it to, the receivers cost us that game after a tremendous effort to hold the best offense in the league under 20 in regulation.",5.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10ejxim,False,0.0,11,2023-01-17T13:12:18Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0106293898764091
1830,18470,18470,Bieber_hole_69,"Please, tell us how you are blessed with the knowledge of what Schwartz was doing in the building on a week-to-week basis.

Oh, you don't know? Just like the rest of us? Damn that's crazy how you can immediately declare that Bowen is going to suck and all hope is lost then.

There's definitely a difference in the 2020 Bowen that was calling plays for the first time and wasn't even DC in title compared to the Bowen that's been calling plays for three years now and is actually on the sideline each week.

Nevermind that 9 of the 11 defensive starters from Week 1 in 2020 are no longer on the roster and probably 80% of the personnel has changed, and maybe that was the biggest problem facing that awful defense in 2020.

It's definitely a loss for Schwartz to depart, but c'mon with acting like you know exactly how much this is going to impact the team 8 months before they play another game lol. Don't even watch the games then jesus fucking christ.

Schwartz wasn't on the field calling plays in 2021 or 2022. The Titans could have hired him to be DC in either one of those years and have him just call the plays if that's what they wanted to do, but they didn't. I'm sure Schwartz would have been happy to have the job and stay in Nashville if he's willing to take a DC job in Cleveland, but he wasn't offered it.

Do we even know if Schwartz was in the building every week drawing up the gameplan with the rest of the staff? Or was he on a consultant schedule and providing insight when needed. How much more wisdom can he impart on our current staff after two years if he's not the one actually running the defense? How much more is there for them to learn about his scheme if it's not the scheme they're actually running and instead they're just taking elements of it.

If Schwartz were as hands on and actually the guy pulling the ""play good defense"" lever every week like you suggest, why didn't the Titans make any effort to just make him the DC instead? Schwartz wasn't even their first choice for this senior consultant role, they wanted Dean Pees instead and he turned them down for the Atlanta DC job.

12973,87978,87978,Markosaurus,"When the public sees “PED’s” they think of a syringe in your ass or a supplement you take that let’s you put on more muscle or have a faster reaction time. They think of a substance that’s let’s you perform better on the field. 

The public at large does not think of PED’s as treatment that lets the athlete recover faster from injury. 

Is often said that the best ability is availability, and while an athlete is in their physical prime, they are incentivized to be on the field performing at their best for as long as possible. If you suffer physical ailments later in life, most athletes would make that trade off because of the sheer earning potential they have in their physical primes. 

It’s because of this fact of business that most NFL athletes use recovery drugs that allow them to get back into a game or a season sooner.


The HGH that was delivered to Manning’s wife was supposed to help him heal and recover faster from his neck surgery, and that’s why it was overlooked. He wasn’t juicing to put on more muscle, he was trying to heal from a major injury faster. The narrative of the latter statement is much easier to forgive, especially when people compare steroid violations to the steroid era in Baseball or what Lance Armstrong did.

All other interviews with coaches whose teams are still participating in the playoffs are prohibited until Jan. 30.
* Jan. 30: Assistant coaches whose clubs are participating in the Super Bowl who previously interviewed for another club's head-coach position may have a second in-person or virtual interview with such club no later than 
* Feb. 5, the Sunday prior to the Super Bowl.

I don't think we have to be that bad if we move on from Tannehill. My ideal scenario (and I know a lot of people may not agree with this) is if Will Levis (or CJ Stroud if you prefer but I'm not as high on him) was on the board at 8 and Vrabel calls up Arthur Smith and trades 11 and Tannehill for 8 to go get Levis. I don't see Arthur Smith wanting to go with a toolsy rookie QB because he may be out of the job if he doesn't win in the short term but at the same time he probably doesn't want Levis in the division if he drops to the Panthers at 9. Tannehill was at his best in Arthur Smith's system and they'd still have pick 11 to go get another weapon. It also allows them to keep and develop Ridder if they believe in him long term. With the state of the rest of the division I think it would automatically make the Falcons the favorite to win the South. Meanwhile we get our QB of the future and give up no additional draft capital to do so. It feels like a win/win trade for both sides and we could spend the rest of the draft getting the pieces to run an offense that supports Levis. Henry takes a lot of the pressure off early and with another offseason I feel like we'd be in a really good position. Of course this all hinges on Levis dropping to 8, the Falcons being willing to deal, and the team believing in Levis.


Ultimately I just feel like we're in striking distance of a QB at 11 and we'll have a new offensive coordinator so if you were going to build an offense around a young QB now is as good a time to start that process as any, especially if you clear almost $19mil by moving on from the 35 year old vet on the last year of his deal in the process.",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_zw494y,False,0.0,None,2023-01-26T17:21:36Z,tennesseetitans,0.0423844501842636

You (and anyone else who is interested in ACTUALLY having a reasonable debate about Tannehill) should take an objective look at both the good AND the bad (of which there is a lot of evidence for both) to get a clear picture of who he is as a quarterback at this stage of his career.

Tannehill is on the last year of his deal and is due $36mil. Even if you don't cut/trade him to free up the $18.6mil you'd save by doing so you still need to plan for next year and beyond. The only reason to completely ignore the position is if you're convinced Willis is the future and I don't see that as being the case.


There's also no guarantee we pick this high in the future, especially if we're successful at improving the roster. 11 is within range to go up to get one of the top 3 QBs (if you like any number of them). Getting a QB on a rookie deal is a great way to build a competitive roster.


Philosophically, if you identify a franchise QB and can get them, you do. Alex Smith should never stop you from trading up to get Patrick Mahomes. If you trust your identification process and think a stud QB is attainable you go attain them.

19217,120332,120332,RyokoKnight,"Radunz was labeled in his draft as a potential starting LT, that may be forced to become an Interior guard at the NFL level.  (The reason for this is that in college when faced against inferior opponents he could easily overpower he did great at LT but on the few occasions he was matched against an equally strong opponent he had trouble dealing with them when he didn't have an overwhelming advantage.) Essentially that analysis played out perfectly as he had trouble sticking at either tackle spot (it would have probably been better in retrospect to leave him at LT or LG in truth rather than move him around as he never had the traits you'd want in an RT) but is best used at interior guard where he can get better size/length match ups that mask some of his issues.

In essence we took a chance on a backwater Tackle on the cheap and got a guard. 

NPF on the other hand was mostly mocked at RT at the nfl level, while he has LT experience he didn't have the overpowering size, length, and strength traits you want in a starting LT... He probably is an okay backup/relief LT, but he is best left at RT where his traits for his footwork, agility, and run blocking are best placed. (I never once considered NPF a true LT, and I don't think most people looking at his tape thought that either as he has basically every characteristic you want in an RT and will probably shine at the position next year).

When I think of the LT position, I imagine an immovable bulwark someone who can win a 1 on 1 (and maybe a 2 on 1) strength battle every time, and has the arm length and power to keep their target blocked down or at the very least make them move so far around them that the play still has a chance to get off.  When I imagine the RT position, I think of agile quickness and shiftiness... someone who can form the backside of the pocket to protect the QB and keep their hands on their target battling them blow for blow every step of the way. 

It's why if we don't end up with Paris Johnson, the next person with LT traits we should look at is Dawand Jones as he has the elite LT traits NFL teams look for even if he played mostly at RT. In truth he will probably be a better LT than he ever was at RT in college it will just take some time, and the few times he played it in college he was excellent at it. (The reason he played RT btw is that Paris Johnson was Ohio's LT and he is a natural at the position and is a more balanced and polished overall OT than Dawand).",6.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10yx5ca,False,0.0,"""BIG Jeff"" Simmons",2023-02-10T13:12:14Z,tennesseetitans,0.0562909417545295

Not flattering comparisons on either account as both came into the league with flaws and a bit raw.

The difference between the two ultimately came down to the team working with them and the player learning/developing. Josh Allen slowly gained composure in the face of pressure and started playing less hero ball focusing more on tight accurate throws and still has the legs to get yards when absolutely needed. Carson Wentz on the other hand kept pushing himself beyond his physical limitations and continues to rely on hero ball plays that more often than not end up screwing himself and his team out of winnable situations.

Will Levis could be either of these...a Carson Wentz that developed, gained composure, and learned his limits would be an Elite QB leading the Eagles to a superbowl... a Josh Allen who didn't develop, gained poor running into sack traits, and began playing hero ball every game would be a potential back up on some roster.

Paris Johnson is imo the most likely choice if he's there at 11, as he's really the only true LT that is 1st round caliber. Skoronski is just too small and will likely get pushed to RT (at best) or guard at worse which isn't what you want to spend an 11th overall pick on when you can find starting caliber Guards later in the draft. (Broderick Jones probably has a better chance at being a RT but again he may also have length issues and could also be forced to be a guard... you try him out at LT but don't be surprised if he's a RT/guard essentially).

Quentin Johnston would be my next bet as the 2nd most likely choice (behind Paris Johnson). However he's isn't like a Ja'marr Chase level wr... in some ways he's more comparable to a Burks caliber WR with slightly worse hands but slightly faster speed... but considering our need at WR that would still be excellent and you just hope he becomes a Julio esq player.

Addison is very light, weight wise and will likely be forced into slot at the NFL level. He's someone you try out on the outside and hope he sticks but he's not guaranteed and will have a higher likelihood of injuries if you put him out there. (he is probably the best WR of the draft  imo his body type is just so thin and I think its fair to say playing with Caleb Williams at QB may have boosted his overall college performance).

JSN lacks athletic traits and has played mostly from slot in college... he's probably a slot guy at the NFL level but you probably try him out like Addison to be your WR -Y and then put them in the slot when that doesn't work.

So then you have Mayer... in some ways he can be both a blocker or an additional catcher... you can hold him back to be a chip blocker, or you can throw him out to be your ""kelce"", inside slot guy and it isn't the worst idea for a team dedicated to the run especially if you think about using your TE's as essentially larger WR's that can run block downfield and take more unfavorable matchups.

He's already said if he's cut he plans to retire (he has no interest playing for another team), furthermore there are reports he's lost a lot of weight over the season/start of the off season and doesn't appear to be keeping in NFL level shape. The thought process is he may be done and desire to pursue his podcast career. (which is why he has no interest playing for another team he can make a fine living without getting hurt every week).

IE your perceived value of him hitting the open market is irrelevant if even half of the above remains true.

>Cutting him doesn’t make the positon group better

Correct, you don't just cut him and then just have an empty spot on the field... you replace him with a long term solution. Paris Johnson would be an excellent choice. Alternatively taking Dawand Jones in the 2nd (or late 1st if we trade back) could be an equally good long term solution. As long as whoever we get to replace him is on the field and even slightly better than Daley... we've improved at the position group, and done so at a far cheaper price point overall.

This is ""better"" because having a player that isn't available half the year and takes several games to not play like ass at the start of each season (optimistically) is essentially worthless at best and an active hinderance to the team at worse (depending on cap space and what you may have given up to keep him on the roster).

My point is that a great Qb gives you more margin for error with the rest of your roster versus the other way around (which is how we have been doing it in Tennessee)

The Chiefs were a good team before Mahomes got there. But like us in 2019 and 2020, they hit the ceiling with Smith, which is why they drafted Mahomes in the first place. We were at the ceiling last year, and now we have regressed.

This idea that we can just build a great roster around RT or an average QB and win a SB is fantasy land. There are only 5 average QB's (Hostetler Ripen Dilfer Flacco Foles) that have led their team to a SB win in the last 32 years.

Those aren't great odds and path to buildning a consistent winner to ME. But that's MY opinion. I would rather do what it takes to trade up and draft a QB this year.

23492,141102,141102,SweetPockets51,"Arandric Kornell Carthon (born February 10, 1981), nicknamed Ran Carthon, is an American football executive and former player who is the general manager for the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as an executive for the St. Louis / Los Angeles Rams, and Atlanta Falcons.

Carthon played running back for the University of Florida and signed as an undrafted free agent with the Indianapolis Colts in 2004. He played for three seasons in the NFL with the Colts and Detroit Lions.

Carthon was born in Osceola, Arkansas. His father is former NFL running back Maurice Carthon. He attended Key West High School in Key West, Florida, and played for the Key West Conchs high school football team. As a junior, he rushed for over 1,300 yards; as a senior, he rushed for over 500 yards and was named to PrepStar's All-Region team, despite missing seven games with an ankle injury.

Carthon accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier and coach Ron Zook's Florida Gators football teams from 2000 to 2003. As a senior in 2003, he was the leading rusher for the Gators. Carthon is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

After his NFL career was over, he returned to Gainesville, and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in sociology in 2008.

The Indianapolis Colts signed Carthon as an undrafted free agent in 2004, and he was a member of the Colts from 2004 to 2006. He saw no action during the 2004 regular season, and only limited action in nine games as a running back and kick returner during the 2005 and 2006 regular seasons.

Carthon finished his career with the Detroit Lions during the second half of the 2006 season.

After retiring, Carthon was hired by the Atlanta Falcons as a pro scout in 2008. He spent the next four seasons in Atlanta.

In 2012, Carthon was hired by the St. Louis Rams as their director of player personnel.

In 2017, Carthon was hired by the San Francisco 49ers as their director of pro personnel.

2020- best offense in franchise history after years of being a defensive franchise and we go lay an egg after deciding to pound Henry into stacked boxes after early success in the air, thanks for phoning that one in Art. 

2019- literally got hot at the exact moment necessary and ended up a good half of football away from the big show where I think we pound the 9ers. 

2021- The defense was good sure but Tannehill hadn’t got to be on the field with all his weapons healthy since like week 4 going into that playoff game. Julio hadn’t stayed on the field, Aj hadn’t stayed on the field and Henry had been out 2/3 the year. 

To top that off it was the first year the OL really took a big lump and was piss poor all year. Then add Todd Downing being awful all year and everyone wanting him fired. 

Yet I was suppose to believe that team was gonna make a run? yeah right. 

Tannehill had no chemistry with anyone besides Aj and it showed for instance on the opening play when him and Julio on two different pages and our OC called a single read play that the defense had seen so often they instantly recognized it=INT. 

Then we call a screen in the redzone that we had ran 2-3 times THAT game and the OLB reads it and makes an easy pick.

You can get reasonable production from those positions for cheap enough.

Of course, there has to be a good player at one of those other positions or it all falls apart. 

Top half of the first round picks should be reserved for trying to maximize the talent and cost of a premier position like QB/LT/WR/CB/Edge. Those positions cost a fuck ton for decent production and are hard to come by as a result. 

We can get an austin hooper level player for 6m for 1 year. But even a run-of-the-mill average LT like Lewan will cost 15m. A GOOD LT is 20m+. A GOOD QB is 40m+. You just aren't getting ahead at TE when even Travis Kelce makes 15m. And odds are you aren't getting travis kelce.

The proper way to assess this way is are we 20m worth of players away if we extend tannehill, obviously knowing that if we do we are going full rebuild in like 2 years. 

---
#####Here is where I start to go on a tangent. 

I can certainly see some reasonable scenarios where that works out really well for us. 

Let's say we use that money to get orlando brown and dalton risner on backloaded contracts since we build knowing we are throwing 2025 in the trash entirely. If we get them on the cap for ~15m total, grab a meh speedster at wr like breshad perriman for cheap to put pressure on the safeties deep, then we have a lot of flexibility with the draft. 

We could move our pick/picks for a proven talent similar to how the rams made their run. Or we could go straight BPA to try to stack as much young, cheap talent as possible knowing we are going to be blowing up our fets in 2 years while also maybe landing a stud CB/WR/Edge in the process to help us with our push. 

We could also go the entirely opposite route and cut/trade a bunch of vets now and make 2023 our trash can year and gear up for a real run in 2024/2025. Or anywhere in between, but I tend to prefer committing 100% to one plan or the other to either succeed or fail big as opposed to just kind of staying relevant but never good enough a la the 2018-2022 colts.

But that is like asking if Tannehill is worth top 5 QB money. 

Obviously no. 

But we don't live in a vacuum. The issue is that we need to replace him for less than the money saved OR have a massive production spike if we pay more. 

The list of FAs is not appealing at all basically.

31179,168635,168635,WhiteXHysteria,"Disclaimer, I have no strong feelings either way on if we should change QB. I am just presenting some information. (My biggest opinion is if we change QB and want to compete we should move up for Bryce and shouldn't be going for geriatrics.) 

Some context. We allowed 49 sacks this year while having injuries at all 5 positions on the line. 

In 2019 the Bucs allowed 47 sacks. They got an elite QB with 0 mobility and dropped to 22 sacks(21 on Brady) and won the super bowl. 

In 2007 the patriots allowed  21 sacks. 

In 2008 the Pats lost brady in game 1. They ended up allowing 48 sacks.

In 2009 Brady was back and he was sacked 16 time(Hoyer added 2 more sacks). 

Keep in mind, all the pre-2021 stats had a full game less. 

A good QB can be game-changing for the OL. For all that  Tannehill is good at, he is not great at dissecting a defense at the line. He is not good at calling out protection and all. That is why Ben Jones has handled that job. Tannehill also is sub par at feeling and evading pressure. Obviously, Malik doesn't do the line any favors either. 

Brady could step in here with 5 Dennis Daley's and not hit 40 sacks, maybe not even 30. He is about as good as QBs get at knowing what the defense is doing at the line. Allegedly, Bryce Young is elite at this as well but I've not watched him and the NFL is a different beast than college.

When you get a QB like Brady you get a guy who will see exactly how the defense is planning to attack and can make adjustments at the line to counteract that, whether that is keeping a man in to help protect or whether it is changing a route for a player to be hot. Something we almost never see anyone do here.

This is a big part of the saying that great players elevate those around them.",5.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10ctbc5,False,0.0,300 to link?,2023-01-15T16:43:50Z,tennesseetitans,0.026084062027934
31180,168636,168636,WhiteXHysteria,"The defense was completely fine before everyone was injured. Even without Landry. He takes it from fringe top 5 to possibly the best in the league.

31181,168637,168637,WhiteXHysteria,"Brady would have no problem throwing short passes. 

Go look at the offensive line sack ranks for Brady's teams. The 07 and 09 pats were top 5 fewest. The 08 pats without him were bottom 5. The bucs before him were roughly bottom 10 and immediately jumped to top 5 when he came in. 

His football IQ makes a massive difference. 

Tanny can run but he's pretty mediocre in terms of reading a defense. He stares down receivers and doesn't feel the pressure well. 

Brady is possibly the best ever, right with Peyton, at being able to know exactly what the defense is going to do at the line. 

He sees it and makes changes at the line to either move protection or change routes to take advantage. He doesn't need to run. 

He's played with some shit teams throughout his time and made it work on his ability to break down a defense while making any generic slot receiver a god from his quick passes. 

I don't want him because of his age but acting like he wouldn't elevate the line with his football IQ is kinda silly.

31182,168638,168638,WhiteXHysteria,"Nah. Brady is way smarter than that.

I don't think we should even bring him in but he can read a defense and protect himself as well as anyone. 

Someone able to break down the defense at the line can make a big difference to the blocking. 

I can't ever remember us having a QB that was elite at reading defenses at the line.

Ekeler is a huge fantasy merchant. He’s not a great pure runner. His receiving is good, but massively overrated because Joe Lombardi’s offensive playcalling bag only goes as deep as “spam Ekeler”

And honestly I think its really sad that when we’re comparing the teams Brady and Mahomes have had to what Herbert’s had, that these are the best two guys you could come up with.

Almost no offense only has 1 redeeming player, but of the playoff teams, Herbert has definitely done the biggest carry job. Any receiver worth any damns has missed time.

Outside of that, it's not like Mahomes really has an incredible amount of competition at the position.  


Brady, Manning, Culpepper, Vick, Palmer, Brees, Roethlisberger, Rivers, McNair, Warner, McNabb, Eli Manning were all capable of producing insane stats and carrying teams.  


I guess my point is all this stuff about Mahomes leading in stats more often kind of goes out the window when you consider his competition vs the kind of competition Peyton and Brady had to deal with

37276,197955,197955,daoogilymoogily,"1. I completely and utterly disagree with your first point; we’ve had three different coordinators and three different schemes under Vrabel.

2. Your second point is ridiculous, that’s not how good drafting works, you don’t ignore the BPA and pick based on position. For instance this is not a good draft for OT, if Paris Johnson is off the board there is no other OT worth taking over one of the top three WRs (Idt Skoronski plays OT in the NFL). And just think, one of our best DL is an undrafted free agent. So why just use picks based on position? It’s asinine.

3. I completely agree about Carr, besides the fact that it’s clear we want a mobile QB and Carr is less mobile than Tanne (who is fairly mobile tbf)

4. Nobody wants Henry gone, but it might be for the best to spend his money on a position other than RB. He’ll go down as one of our greats either way, but I think it really depends on who we get as OC. If it’s one of these guys who runs a spread option then yes, definitely keep him. If it’s a Shanahan disciple who can get a rolling office chair 1k yards in a season, then we should probably move on from him.

On top of that there are several other significant reasons. Several of the key players to the Titans SB run were later traded to the Ravens (McNair, Mason, and Rolle off the top of my head). That really pissed off Titans fans and further stoked the rivalry. The Titans were irrelevant for awhile in the early to mid 2010s but still every time when we played the Ravens there was just an air of hate. When Tannehill and Henry came on the scene we were relevant again. Slapping the Ravens in Lamars MVP season, in Baltimore, in the playoffs, really kicked it back off. We didn't just squeak out with a win, we beat them like the Ratbirds they are. Then the following year they knocked us out of the playoffs after we had a pregame, midgame, and post-game scuffle on their logo in the middle of the field.

I have been a Titans fan since they moved to Nashville. They're the only sports team I follow closely. I hate the Ravens more than any other team and it ain't close.

If not, then it's all moot.   Either way we have to make a choice - build a stellar offense around new young talent, or keep playing clock control with our veterans and build a world-beater defense around our all-pro players who still have lots of gas in the tank.

Because clock control ball with a mid offense only has ever worked for a handful of teams in terms of winning a championship, and every one of them had a lights out defense - one that can score and create takeaways that give that mid offense more shots to at least kick field goals.

Right now we don't have either thing.   If we don't have our guy at QB, then I say we work on being mid-to-good at offense and make moves to really try to get this defense over the hump.

It's just the plays, zoomed out, shown twice, and nothing else.  And those views show you things the broadcast view may not pick up - like Karras wacking Simmons before Simmons hit back, or that the player who supposedly 'dove at their knees' actually just fell straight down on the ground in his stance without moving forward at all.

The downside is the player itself sucks - it's absolutely basic.  The controls are play/pause, 10s forward, 10s back, and a slider bar that lets you skip around.  No frame by frame, and the overlay hangs out for several seconds obscuring the screen when you do seek, so you have to go a little farther than you meant so it will be out of the way when the play comes.   If you wanted to do analyst videos or something you'd have to screencap or download the whole thing - and I don't think there's a download button.  Probably would have to go jack the video source file directly, especially if you were going to make analysis videos for youtube or similar.

As for the rest, it's a mixed bag.

I used to have Sunday Ticket and it was nice to be able to record and replay the games I wasn't going to see live anyway, and this is similar -  except you can only watch the live games on a phone or tablet using the NFL app, not your TV, or even a computer.   There are ways to hack around that of course but it's not built into the service.  The other stuff can all be watched on a computer, but not the live stuff.

The replays have 3 versions:  Full broadcast, Condensed (same as full but all the dead time between the whistles is trimmed out so it's just plays), and the All-22 which I described above.  It's nice to be able to watch a condensed out of market game in an hour and change without having to skip through commercials and dead air.

The archive right now goes back to 2009 or so, so the world is your oyster as far as rewatches go.   If they eventually add more that would be killer - it'd be nice to see like the coaches film on the 1972 Dolphins or whatever - but I doubt footage that old even still exists to archive.  But if they do keep adding it'll be cool IMO.  I definitely used it to watch some Chris Johnson highlights in All-22.

> Last year I heard from a lot of people that he interviewed with, how well he did. He is very qualified, and I think he'll be a great partner to Vrabes. I know Vrabes well, and that's such an important relationship – the head coach/GM one. Having each other's back and having the respect of each other is so critical because you are leading that organization together. … I think it's a great fit with (Ran and Mike), because the first part of any relationship is there is a mutual respect, and I know they'll have that. And I think the loyalty – they are both very loyal people and I think they'll have each other's back. And that's the thing – you're going to have your hits and you're going to have your misses but if you stay with it through all of those you have a chance and I believe strongly knowing the two of them that they will be a really good fit.

This then caught fire amongst pop social media, and caused a bunch of speculation about which  mysterious NFL player was laying pipe to Jeff Stars cavern of mysteries.

Bussin with the Boys, a now Barstool owned podcast is hosted by Taylor Lewan and some fat guy. As any social media driven business goes, it is important that you remain relevant and you remain popular..
