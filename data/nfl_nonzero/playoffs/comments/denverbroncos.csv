From his Hall of Fame entry:

>The Denver Broncos selected Steve Atwater out of Arkansas in the first round, 20th choice overall, of the 1989 NFL Draft. A hard-hitting and instinctive safety, Atwater played in 167 games during his 11-season career.

>He made an immediate impact at free safety in his rookie season. Atwater recorded 129 total tackles (2nd most on the team) to help turn around a Denver defense that ranked 20th in points allowed the previous year to become the NFL‚Äôs stingiest unit in 1989 that allowed the fewest points in the league. The Broncos finished that season with the AFC‚Äôs best record at 11-5 and a berth in Super Bowl XXIV.

>Atwater was voted to the first of eight Pro Bowls following the 1990 season and earned first-team All-Pro recognition for the first of two straight years (1991-92).

>In 1997, he was an integral part of the Broncos‚Äô championship season that was capped by the franchise‚Äôs first Super Bowl title. Atwater contributed 83 tackles (61 solo), one sack, two interceptions, eight passes defensed, and two fumble recoveries as Denver finished 12-4. His strong play continued throughout the postseason. He added 15 tackles (10 solo), one sack, a forced fumble, and five passes defensed in four playoff games.

>Atwater played his final season with the Broncos in 1998 and he helped lead them to a second straight Super Bowl victory. That year he recorded one interception, seven passes defensed, and racked up 55 solo tackles 30 assisted tackles. He had four tackles, three assists and two passes defensed in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Atlanta Falcons.

>In all, Atwater, recorded 24 interceptions which he returned for 408 yards and a touchdown, added five sacks, and registered more than 1,000 tackles. He was named to the NFL‚Äôs All-Decade Team of the 1990s.

Like last year, when he would go for a 4th and 7, and then punt on a 4th and 4, with seemingly no legitimate justification for either, it opened him up to criticism‚Äîespecially when it stopped working (last year week 18 for example, or that TNF game against KC last year). Take this game against us for example. There seemed to not be too much concrete reason why he kept everyone in‚Äîwhen an example of something should‚Äôve been: if BAL wins, then we‚Äôre playing everyone to get the win. If they lose (like they did), then our starters are just going to play 2 drives and then they‚Äôre done. If he‚Äôd said something like that, that would at least lower the temperature a bit where someone could at least say ‚Äúokay, there‚Äôs something resembling a plan here.‚Äù But instead, he allowed himself to get caught in no-man‚Äôs land with this weird ‚Äúidk what tf we‚Äôre doing‚Äù game plan, which ended up burning him. And if you do too much of that, then even when one of your gambles ‚Äúworks,‚Äù you‚Äôre still going to get shelled because people will think that the process wasn‚Äôt right‚Äîif that makes sense. Broken clock scenario. It‚Äôs a similar thing we experienced with Hackett (setting all the other just general bad coaching aside).

This is our process.‚Äù And it was most evident on that Seattle field goal where he freaked out and rather than saying, no, we‚Äôre not settling for this, we have to get closer, he did what he did.

Point is, people are a lot more comfortable with decisiveness, or at least the appearance of it. It just feels ‚Äúsafer.‚Äù At least from your leaders. With indecision, you put yourself in a permanent no-win situation. And I think with Staley, despite the numerical success, it‚Äôs sort of a ‚Äúonce you see it, you can‚Äôt unsee it‚Äù thing, fair or not, and it‚Äôs the type of posture that‚Äôs woven into who you are as a person, meaning, it‚Äôs extremely hard to change, which tells those fans that he‚Äôs pretty much always gonna be the guy going for weird 4th downs and making bizarre decisions that only sometimes pan out, which in turn, is going to waste the prime years of their young star quarterback.

I worked at a hotel that had some regular professional athlete visitors. 

Mark Schlereth. Very cool! First Bronco I ever met and always was willing to talk about them. When I got the first iPad I was showing it off to him and we went to YouTube and watched Alex Gibbs blocking instructional videos and we talked about how lineman watch tape. 

Ryan Clady. Absolute giant of a person. Told him I was a fan and kept it moving. 

Larry Fitzgerald. He seemed like a decent guy, possibly his agent was traveling with him and didn‚Äôt really let him interact beyond asking for an extra pillow. 

Jerry Rice. The only person I ever asked for an autograph, because one of my best friends was obsessed with him. He very graciously made one out to him, and another visit he asked for a travel toothpaste and as I was walking over to hand it to him, I stopped, threw it to him and he did the standard Jerry Rice catch. How many people can say they threw Jerry Rice a pass?

Steve Young - met him once when he filmed a commercial and then again at my hotel job. He was just as gracious as he was to a dumb kid watch him read his lines as he was to the adult who told him what time breakfast hours were. 

Tom Jackson - at the same commercial shoot as Steve Young. Very cool. A lot of the other kids didn‚Äôt know who he was but as a Bronco fan I did.  

Patrick Crayton - had the absolute biggest wrist watch I‚Äôve ever seen. 

Lomas Brown - genuinely cool dude. I loved seeing him. 

Jon Ritchie - good dude, one time hung out and chatted with my brother when he found out he was an Eagles fan. 

Marcellus Wiley - fun guy. Big Broncos fan in his personal life. 

Qadry Ismail - very cool, down to earth guy. 

Trent Dilfer - as big of football nerd as his rep was, kind of a douche. I have a 1998 Washington playbook (that I believe was owned by Mike Martz) and he looked at it for an hour with me.

Jon Gruden - had an aura about him. Very intimidating. Probably because he‚Äôs racist. 

Ron Jaworsky - nice guy, but wasn‚Äôt going to go out of his way to conversate. 

Brian Dawkins - Very polite, respectful. I said big fan and he said he appreciated me and went on his way. 

Shaun King, Michael Irvin, Mike Ditka - if you can‚Äôt say anything nice, don‚Äôt say anything at all‚Ä¶",3.0,denverbroncos,t3_10sq71z,False,0.0,None,2023-02-03T16:21:24Z,denverbroncos,0.0118993101919967

It seems strange to me that people people Tucker the GOAT because of his accuracy metrics and disregard Vinateris playoff and super bowl clutching moments, however, they'll turn around and label Brady the GOAT because of his playoff and super bowl accomplishments but not Aaron Rodgers even though he has the highest career QBR at 104 (the only QB to hold an >100 career rating) while Bradys is 96. 

It's contradictory but mirroring. Brady also had a higher QBR until his old age seasons dropped his average. 

Either Brady and Vinateri should be considered GOATS at their positions or Rodgers and Tucker should be otherwise you're not judging off the same standards.

EDIT: Also, Tucker has only been in the league 10 years. Vinny played over 20. Let's see how Tuckers career finished before we slap that label on him.

I don't believe in banning people for the sake of being just a fan from other team. You said in other comment that you never go to other subs but what about our other users? Should they be banned from any other team sub just for being Broncos fans? What if a person comes here and say he's a giants fan but roots for the Broncos because of their family, should I ban this person?

I do believe in taking things under context and promoting good discussions. I do not care where you are from and who do you root for, as long as you follow the rules and be respectful.

I agree, even though Paton will never admit it.

If we do hire an OC so good that they get poached as a HC next year, I'd say it's maybe a good problem to have. And hopefully in that situation, you have someone working under that OC that may be able to step in and replace them and at least keep a consistent scheme going that works.

We aren't really even interviewing any other offensive guys outside of Payton. Shaw I guess, but he's never done it at the pro level that I am aware. And I think we only interviewed him as a potential OC if Harbaugh chose us, which didn't happen of course.

>From 2006 through 2021, the Saints were the NFC's top-scoring team with 27.6 points per game. Across the entire league, only the Patriots scored more points during that time. New Orleans finished six seasons with the top total offense, including in Payton's first season in 2006. The previous year, the Saints ranked 20th in that statistic. Brees' skills and how much he threw the ball were a major factor, as New Orleans attempted more passes during Payton's tenure than any other team. But even from 2017 through 2020, when the Saints ranked in the bottom half of the league in pass attempts, New Orleans ranked in the top five in scoring in each of those seasons. As Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said in 2021, speed is also a big part of why Payton's offense operates so well.

He was interviewed Tuesday morning in a Los Angeles-area hotel conference room by Penner, another Broncos owner Condoleezza Rice and general manager George Paton.

Morris, who has previous head coaching experience with Tampa Bay and Atlanta, also impressed the Broncos‚Äô trio with his preparation and plan to win, according to sources.

We cannot know this. It's been slow and the media clearly doesn't have connections within the group that's running this search to give answers. We don't know who their preferred candidates really are, we don't know what their negotiations may look like, hell we don't even know for sure which candidates they've interviewed or when they interviewed them.

It may well actually be the shitshow that everyone is screaming about, but it's equally possible that it looks that way because we don't have the same level of media access we enjoyed during the Elway years.

But so what? the Broncos have had a really damn good defense every year since Super Bowl 50, and every year since Super Bowl 50 they've proven that having a really damn good defense doesn't matter. We need to fix the offense, and Sean Payton is unquestionably the best option to do that this offseason.

He took a good Drew Brees and turned him into a Hall of Famer. I'd be happy if he could take a bad Russell Wilson and turned him into a good one. And if he can't fix Russ, then at least he's proven that he's capable of coaching up a QB for 2 years from now when we can move on from Wilson and draft a replacement.

Because the first team that hired a coach is a division rival of the team that owns Payton's rights. Two other teams potentially interested in Payton have notoriously incompetent owners. That leaves two teams who are, as far as we know, still planning to conduct second interviews with him.

Since we're on the topic, let's straighten a couple of things out: Sean McVay almost walked away. He was not ""almost fired."" And as far as Dan Quinn discourse went last season, people wanted Hackett and were dismayed and resigned to Quinn being the next HC because Paton and Quinn worked together in the past. The majority of folks hated the idea of Quinn then, and now there's this weird coping shit going on where we're trying to tell ourselves ""we need some mediocrity""? C'mon man.

You began by stating what you want (someone proven), I replied with what I *don't* want (a myopic ""proven vs unproven"" dichotomy).

I think you're projecting. They're interviewing three first-timers (Evero, Demeco Ryans, David Shaw) vs four previous HCs (Harbaugh, Payton, Quinn, Morris).

If I could have my pick of this bunch, I'd take Payton no doubt. He is a proven winner and has given his opinions on ""fixing"" Russell Wilson.

If not Payton though, give me the gamble over the known mediocrity of Quinn or Morris, especially since we'll have our own first rounder in 2024 to make up for if Evero sucks

25815,157606,157606,iSamurai,">	Besides the head coach and play-caller, there isn‚Äôt a more important member of the coaching staff than an offensive line coach.

>This is for a multitude of reasons, but just on the surface level, there isn‚Äôt a coaching position teaching more players on the field at once. Being able to communicate and teach a multitude of different players isn‚Äôt an easy task.

>Nearly half of the offensive players on the field are taught directly by the offensive line coach, making the responsibility he has even more vital to the team‚Äôs success. No two people learn the same way, and how players use technique across the offensive line is vastly different depending on the position. For example, an offensive guard‚Äôs responsibilities are entirely different than offensive tackles.

>To go along with that, the offensive line is a very tough position group to teach in today‚Äôs NFL. While the saying goes, ‚Äúeverything starts up front‚Äù applies to all levels of football, the college game and NFL game are vastly different ‚Äî what these players are asked to do at the collegiate level often doesn‚Äôt correlate easily to the NFL. Pairing that with how NFL practices are becoming more and more strict regarding how much physical contact is allowed ‚Äî it makes it increasingly difficult to prepare players at a position like the offensive line, where contact is inherently part of everything they‚Äôre supposed to do.

>Offensive line coaches are also tasked with how to block and counter against all of the exotic looks various defensive coordinators throw at them throughout the season. While blocking may look the same to the average fan, this could not be further from the truth. Depending on the look the defense is giving them and the play the offensive coordinator is running ‚Äî blocking responsibilities change down to down.

>Because of how difficult the job is now and is increasingly becoming, the value of having a really good coach to both prepare the starters and develop the newcomers, despite the difficulties, is indispensable to any staff in the league.

26647,161224,161224,jl_weber," I really like this Twitter thread from Ted Bartlett (former lead writer for the best Broncos blog ever, It's All Over, Fatman.) It's long, but it's like a free class in executive leadership and hiring. Ted is also the CFO of a company. [https://twitter.com/TedBartlett905/status/1619523185007009792](https://twitter.com/TedBartlett905/status/1619523185007009792)

Key summary points:

* Owners most important job is to set a vision. Without that, everything falls apart.
* One issue the Broncos have had is whiplash between who has the ""juice"" in the building. NFL teams often go back and forth between the GM being top dog and the coach. That doesn't mean that the coach is running the scouting and draft, but that they are seen as the lead executor of the owners vision. Ted believes a coach should have ""the juice"" in a building. They should be CEO and GM should be like a COO.
* He sees it as Paton having the juice last year and Hackett was hired as a subordinate. 
* Penner could be looking to change this dynamic and get it back to having the coach be the CEO.
* Ted lists out his opinion on things that don't matter, but get focused on too much, including a coaches scheme, connections, personality, and what side of the ball they come from. 
* He lists what he thinks is more important like openness, accountability, emotional intelligence, toughness, and humbleness.

These boards can have some connected boosters on them. It wouldn't be the first time a rabid college board had intel on hires before others.

The story itself does line up with the timeline of things, would explain the silence from the Broncos.

Why would the team have shifted PR strategy like that?

This also has a decent amount of detail, but again, it's not like it's very hard to make up plausible fan fiction. I just guess, what would be the motivation for a paid UM forum to make this up?

26690,161283,161283,jl_weber,"I feel like wasting my time today.

The ""media"" as a conspiratorial conglomerate colluding to mislead you does not exist. It is made of of individual people, owners, investors, and companies that all have different agendas, business models, standards, and ethics. They are not coordinating. The differences in what they do can be apparent to an educated reader.

Somebody like Ian Rapoport does not make stuff up. His value is information. If he makes things up, his value is no more. If he was found to make things up, I promise that it would be a scandal and he would be fired. He is reporting things that players, agents, team employees, and others tell him. Could they be telling him one thing to push an agenda? Sure, that's why he is probably waiting to report things until he has multiple sources. When you read his writing, he's also not demonstrative. ""I've been told this is likely to happen"" is what you're going to hear from him and you see that he shares information less frequently because he is working to confirm things. Now, if a source provides him poor information, he's not going to go back to that source. That source is of no value to him. He's also working in an industry that is based in entertainment. If he was reporting on national security, he'd have a much higher threshold and wouldn't even share some of the developments. But he works in football and this isn't that serious so he's going to share information earlier on when there's still a chance that people change their minds. He acknowledges that a lot of the time.

Then you have people like Ben Allbright. He tries to do what Rapoport does, but he then inserts his own interpretation into it. He's doing all the same things, but then he says, ""This is going to happen."" Why? Probably cause his ego wants the satisfaction of saying ""I called it."" You can still get value from the information he says, but you have to read closely to separate it from his added opinion.

Then you've got folks like Zac Stevens here. He doesn't really do any reporting, he just shares what others report and adds his own commentary. He's just pure analysis and his only value is in the speculation and entertainment he provides. Zac tries to be objective, but every day on their podcasts he's ask a lot of ""What ifs"" and he acknowledges making things up just for the fun of considering the implications. ""What if the Broncos traded for Aaron Rodgers?"" This is all well and good as long as you don't take it too seriously and he never tries to claim he knows more than he does. Zac is professional, but there are loads of amateur versions of this (Joe Rowles and Nick Kendell, for instance) who don't have any unique information, but try to provide valuable opinions and analysis.

Then you've got the bottom of the barrel. People are just stirring the pot. Skip Bailey is obviously the prime example. They can be as small as Twitter randos, as prominent as national TV hosts, and much of the time they mask their agendas with previous experience (Skip used to be a reporter in Dallas, lots of former players fall into this bucket). These are the folks you're thinking of. They are just around to get eyeballs. Eyeballs do have value in an advertising-supported business. These guys can get them in the short time, but people get sick of them. Without any information, their entertainment value slowly erodes. They are not long-term money making operations most of the time. Unfortunately, the barrier to entry is very low for these folks with social media so they aren't going away. And for lazy businessmen, this is a low overhead. They can turn these folks into content farms and just have them churn out absurd shit that juices SEO and tries to trick people. Smart readers may get tricked a few times, but eventually they just cut sites like that out of their diet.

Of course, the tough part - and the reason we get lots of claims of ""THE MEDIA"" - is that a lot of places employee all of these types of people. ESPN has great journalists on down to Skip and other trash. That doesn't help their reputation, but it doesn't mean it's all trash.

So I will not say that a headline is never ""complete bullshit"", but I do think that's rare, especially from somebody like Ian Rapoport. And, yes, I've been sharing a lot of links during the coaching search - some reporting and some commentary - but it's because I think this fun. It's a wild ride and I'm just enjoying it because it's not that serious, but it's fun to get happy and angry and yell and shout. The whiplash can be frustrating, but I don't think it's because we're always being lied to. I think things change and I'm just going to enjoy the ride. I can enjoy it because I can tell the difference in all of the above when I read them.",1.0,denverbroncos,t3_10mzy5t,False,0.0,None,2023-01-28T11:26:52Z,denverbroncos,0.0089734952830395

Those coaches didn't fail because they were first time coaches. A good organization and leader will dig deeper than that to understand what went wrong.

Vance Joseph failed because 1) Elway has admitted he didn't set up to succeed with the team he build 2) Kubiak was still around as a senior advisor and so power structure with the org was odd and 3) Vance, in my opinion, as seemed caged off and like he was performing in press conferences. I don't think he was very transparent with players.

Fangio failed also because of a the QB situation, but also because he was inflexible, both in who he hired and how it managed players.

Hackett failed because he had no clue to how to run a team and no plan for how his gimmick would adapt when the going got tough (other than growing a goatee).

My personal opinion is that the difference between Payton and Quinn is far greater than the difference between whoever those picks would be and free agents we could get.
