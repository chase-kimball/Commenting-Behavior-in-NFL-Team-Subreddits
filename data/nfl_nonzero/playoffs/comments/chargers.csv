Hard to keep up the shameless positivity after that. But, I hope it was made clear Lombardi cannot stay. Staley sure, I’m cool with another year but I’m not confident in the man. 

Anywho, Without those 5 turnovers, Lombardi’s offense only scored 10 real offensive points. He had all season long to figure out a running plan that worked for this team, he failed. We lose Mike, and all of a sudden (*to nobody’s surprise*) the passing game gets condensed to a 10 yard box. And no, it wasn’t because we don’t have Slater, The OL gave Herbert space and time more than not. Discount injuries, Daboll ran his team into Minnesota and won. McDaniels almost beat the Bills in their stadium with a 3rd stringer. Harbaugh almost beat Cincy in their stadium with his backup. Good coaches get through injuries. Good coaches know how to make the best of the situation. Input Herbert into any of those teams and they’re Super Bowl favorites. 

I’ve had some time to dwell on this, so it’s not a “*wahh we need to fire somebody*” type of reaction. Staley did his job, he had his defense humming for 30 minutes. Does that excuse the inexcusable? No, what happened is a fireble offense. But, if he can get the right OC in here let’s roll with it. I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt, because when he interviewed for this job, he had a plan for Herbert’s offense. He was cockblocked from hiring Kevin O’Connel and Mike McDaniels. As a result, he had to go with the emergency plan: Lombardi. Two seasons guys :/ He’s had to two full seasons + a playoff game to give this team some sort of identity that isn’t just “*Well if Herbert isn’t God on the field this offense looks shit*”.

Unless Joe Biden owned the chargers, I can’t see myself really caring about the ownership being my driver for supporting the team or not. I do understand your side and have more friends I could count that have bailed the team and or hate the team altogether because of the spanos argument. Yet, not a single one moved out of San Diego and it’s rare that you find a spanos hater who ever holds the city accountable for their part in the fiasco. Reality is that it was JUST AS MUCH THE CITY GOVT’s fault we no longer have a “hometown” nfl team. Yet, because Spanos did what he felt was the inevitable and best decision (in his and others opinion) for his investment, which is far greater than any of ours, we all tend to put the blame on him. 

Don’t get me wrong. I don’t like Dean anymore or any less than any of the asshole politicians who sat on the city council, including the mayor because let’s face it. They rigged that vote not to pass by simply refusing to allow the vote & funding for the stadium to be decided on by the entire county which is where the overwhelming majority of fans resided. Had they done that we would still have a team. And why so many refuse to acknowledge that very key fact of the matter is beyond me. But it’s not surprising to me. Reason is, the majority of fans who hate Spanos and who now refuse to support the team because of him. Are the same fans who make San Diego one of the absolutely worst sports cities in the country when it comes to team loyalty. “ThAtS nOt TrUe, lOoK aT ThE PaDrES….” Everyone can miss me with that shit lol chargers were selling out late season games too in every season they were winning and making runs for post season. The measure of a legit sports town is not the attendance and support a team has when they are winning, but rather when they are not winning. And I’m pretty sure the term “fair weather fan” was created to describe San Diego hahaha and let’s face it, LA is absolutely no different hahaha Rams won the Super Bowl last year and could barely fill half the stadium with their fans this year. 

But I digress. Fuck Spanos but I’m not going to allow him to be my reason or better yet, allow him to be my EXCUSE for whether or not I support the team my family and I have been fans of for going on just over 6 decades.",1.0,chargers,t3_10d31zk,False,0.0,None,2023-02-02T19:19:54Z,chargers,0.0148442385468843

Washington is an insane blocker but there’s not much there as a receiver right now. You’re banking a lot on developing him at a position where it’s already tough to develop players.

That’s not sustained success. When the Patriots dynasty was picking from 28+ every season and still having to draft well to maintain that, that’s where it gets difficult. We can’t even get the sustained success to expose his deficits. Most guys who are routinely drafting top 20 don’t get such a massive sample size to keep drafting top 20 from. They get fired for failing. 

I agree that they are good picks. What I am not going to do is say that drafting Keenan Allen in 2013 is the reason Telesco should still have a job. That’s lunacy. 

>If the dolphins had telesco in 2020 they'd be the best team in the league right now. 

Wtf does this even mean. The Dolphins assembled that entire rest of the team by themselves. They messed up taking Tua over Herbert but that’s it. 

>Telesco has assembled some good rosters in his time, look at our roster this year. On paper that's a deep playoff roster, it's not all telescos fault we fuck things up like we did the other night. 

All of r/chargers was saying WR was an issue all last season. We need to add more WR talent. We need speed at WR. We need a deep threat to open up the passing game. Even Joe Lombardi came out and criticized our roster construction for limiting us in that way. Joe freaking Lombardi. At the trade deadline, everyone on r/chargers was clamoring for a WR.

After we made the playoffs in 2013, he drafted a bust at 25. After we made the playoffs in 2018, he drafted a bust at 28. When he traded up in the first round in 2020, he drafted a bust at 23.

4059,14094,14094,AssssCrackBandit,"It will be close to multiple 1sts. Rap has already reported that the Broncos, Texans, Ravens, Panthers, etc are all willing to trade at least 1 first. So there will be some sort of bidding war to inflate the price.

Also, just look at the other coaches of Payton's caliber who were traded. The compensation was close to multiple 1sts:

- Gruden was traded for two 1sts

- BB was traded for a 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th


So I expect that Payton will go for a 1st and another high round pick (top 3 rounds, maybe 1st). And the factor that I haven't even brought up is coach control. All these coaches traded for large amounts got final say on personnel decisions and complete roster control and the reports are that Payton wants this as well. That's another risk, since handing roster control to a coach can quickly prove disastrous, especially if its a guy like Payton who has never had complete roster control before (he always reported to Loomis in NO and it's speculated that was one of the big reasons that he left.",1.0,chargers,t3_10h6fz9,False,0.0,.,2023-01-23T09:16:24Z,chargers,-0.0898217868804931

https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2023/01/21/saints-want-more-than-a-first-round-pick-for-sean-payton/

To me, the money matters not bc of the cash flow or revenue or anything but rather the alternatives that it leaves the Chargers. If Payton gets a monster 5-7 year. $20-25MM/yr contract like most are predicting, it basically ties you to him as a coach no matter what. He can come out and go winless his 2 seasons and we would have no recourse but to keep him as coach for the next 5 years after that because of the enormous amount of money committed, not even thinking about the amount of assets you had to trade to get him.

Like Gruden got half the salary than Payton is expecting and despite having a pretty horrible run at HC, the only reason the Raiders were able to move on is because of the email scandal and the fact that Gruden was forced to resign. 

And this is not even going to Payton's character concerns and my doubt that Spanos/TT would want to associate with something like that 

But my biggest issue is with the compensation. At this stage in Herbert's career, with his contract looming, we have to start building thru the draft since our cap is gonna be very tight moving forward. Giving up even a single 1st, tho it will be more than that, would go completely in the face of this. And even then, its not a guarantee that Payton will make us a contender.

Or made Linsely the highest paid C in the league. Or that we just gave out a huge contract to JC. Or took on Mack's contract. Or the fact that we have two $20M WRs.

And I don't think LT is very upset with ownership considering how close he is to the Chargers org right now and how much work he does for them.

5493,25556,25556,BoltGang17,"This part sums up the fuck ups from top to bottom so well:

>Herbert said after the game that offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi called an interior run with a “kill” built in for this third down. The kill, or audible, was a jet sweep end around. All week, the Chargers had been practicing that jet sweep play with receiver DeAndre Carter as the handoff man, according to Herbert. Carter was already filling in for Mike Williams, who suffered a back fracture in the Chargers’ meaningless Week 18 loss at the Broncos. At this stage of the second quarter, though, Carter was out of the game with an ankle injury, so Michael Bandy, a former undrafted free agent who started the season on the practice squad, was in at Carter’s spot.

>Herbert got to the line and saw a Jaguars front aligned to stop an interior run. Based on this look, Herbert killed the initial play, checking to the jet sweep. Herbert took the snap and turned to hand off to Bandy, who was running in motion from right to left. Bandy was not even looking for a handoff. He was not aware of the kill, Herbert said. They fumbled the exchange. Bandy recovered, but the Chargers were forced to punt. And Trevor Lawrence engineered a 53-yard touchdown drive on the ensuing possession to put the Jaguars on the scoreboard heading into the break.

>The jet sweep handoff call from Lombardi was an asinine decision in the first place, even if Carter had been in the game. The Chargers have run four jet sweeps to Carter this season. He has gained a combined -21 yards — note the negative sign in front of that number — on those four touches.

>Beyond that, Bandy playing meaningful snaps in a playoff game is an indictment of this entire organization. Bandy earned his practice squad spot with a fine training camp. And my intention is not to pile on a hard-working player who has made some meaningful contributions this season. But a team trying to win a Super Bowl has to do better. Williams would have been on the field if Staley had just rested his starters in Week 18. And general manager Tom Telesco should have added more receiving talent this past offseason. Perhaps a speed threat who, you know, could thrive in that type of lateral rushing concept

Imagine if Bandy had been active week 18 instead of Mike. Or we had someone other than Bandy. Or Lombardi wasn't fulfilling the definition of insanity by trying shit that doesn't work over and over again. Man!",109.0,chargers,t3_10cgjm3,False,0.0,33,2023-01-15T04:40:48Z,chargers,-0.0011947280837524

Its become evident that the group of receivers we have now won’t be able to get the job done. With a weak free agent class of receivers, I’ve shifted my eyes onto 2 rookie WRs this coming year. Jalin Hyatt out of Tennessee and Zay Flowers from Boston College. 

[Hyatt](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ErLlocREu14) has a small sample size of tape, and possibly a limited route tree, but his vertical speed and deep ball ability are absolutely elite. He’s reported to have ran a 4.29 40 yard dash, so that could be exactly what we need to maximize Herbert’s arm.

[Flowers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BHicaltRE1c) has some of the best after the catch ability to get skinny and shifty in space in this class.

Also lots of luck. Injuries were decimating the line last year but the team got hot in the right moment and their other pieces (Mixon, Higgins, Hurst) were getting hot as well so you got a great combination too.

8228,43915,43915,Diemonx,"Good thing this game was on a saturday. Would have hated to have to go to work, sleep deprived and with such a depressing loss on top of it.

I've only been following the team since 2011-2012 so I missed 2006, 2009 and the 2010 Specialest Team heartbreakers. I would put this on the top for losses or at least close to it. McCoy playoffs I knew going against Denver was an uphill battle. Lynn playoffs I knew going against Brady and the Patriots as depleted as they were was not gonna end well, so expectations were set. This time I had lot of hope that because all the pieces were there, all the games outcomes fell our way and they also won all the games they needed to win [the only big disadvantage I saw coming into the game was coaching](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/107my45/thoughts_on_wild_card_matchup/j3not9x/?context=3) so maybe they could be the last year Bengals: A team getting hot at the right time with an elite QB at the helm. I suppose this ended up being the Jags (for now).

 But the whole team fell apart. So I guess this takes the top for me. I rather they had lost normally on a hard fought game, or even a blowout like week 3. But no, they had to lose with a game for the history books. If you caught me in the game threads I was not even a bit confortable with the 27-0 lead, and was even less confortable once they scored to end the half. Our 2nd half perfomance had shown that everytime they let a team score before half that they almost end coming back most of the time. And then drives happened, and then Jax kept scoring, we did not, Dicker missed, Bosa had a meltdown.

Lombardi is gone. Staley, we will see. His job was secured before week 18, then he burned some after the Mike Will thing and then the only way he was out was if the playoffs were a disaster and that is exactly how it went. Telesco, I don't know enough about GMs but it is true that his numbers don't lie. I won't even touch the ownership stuff, that feels as set in stone as it is.

I'm not sold on Payton yet. We will see if that even ends up being a possibility and if it is what the price tag will be. Giving away a 1st and 2nd doesn't bode well for the chances to upgrade the offense/defense so even if Payton came in he would have to work with the same personnel. Which is not bad at all but there are depth and injury concerns that won't take one offseason and a winning coach to fix.",1.0,chargers,t3_10clva7,False,0.0,85,2023-01-15T12:22:48Z,chargers,0.0183473987518331

I would like to be conducive in maintaining a user friendly experience, a welcoming atmosphere for positive discord between fans of the team and other team fans or new fans in general, and be a positive role model, maintaining composure in even the most catastrophic of team decisions, injuries, or games.

**2. Do you have prior experience as a moderator?**

I do not, this would be my first experience as a moderator. I do carry other life experiences that I think would be beneficial to this role, such as people skills and the ability to get along with essentially anyone. It's better to be a decent/good worker that everyone wants to work with than an exceptional worker that no one can stand

**3. What time zone do you live in?**

Central Standard Time

**4. How long have you been a fan?**

My family wasn't really into football whatsoever, so I didn't really watch or indulge in the sport at all growing up. After high school I joined the workforce and my coworkers at the time were very into football, and asked who my team was, and the only thing I had to go off of was my youth football team that my coach named the ""Chargers"" because it was his personal team. 

tl;dr I've been following and watching since around 2014, and it's been a hell of a ride

**5. Why should we pick you?**

I understand that I don't have very many technical skills or moderating experience, but I do however spend 98% of my time on Reddit in this sub, and I feel like I would be able to properly moderate the daily operations and help observe and keep the peace between us and the other football subreddits. This team gives me weekly heart attacks for half the year, made my hair turn gray in my twenties, and routinely makes me defend us at my workplace from the jokes and general tongue lashing I receive from the other football enjoyers, but damn it that's just Chargers football. I can't see myself rooting for another team, I'll be doing this until they bury me with ""Family, Trust, Respect"" on my tombstone

I think the price will be low enough that taking a chance on him would be a smart move with a lot of upside. If he turns out to be what the Colts were hoping when they drafted him in the second round, then if we have to move on from Keenan next year we could be looking at Mike and Campbell on the perimeters and Palmer in the slot, with potentially another rookie we draft this year rotating in and developing behind the scenes.

Our punt return unit as a whole also improved and gave Carter space to work with, which another competent returner will be able to take advantage of.

This is the second year in a row that we've gotten good return production from a cheap guy in free agency.

I'd agree that the draft is the better place to find a speedy receiver since they'll be on a rookie deal, but outside of the top guys a lot of receivers take some time to find their footing in the pros, and from what I've heard there aren't really any elite guys in this draft.

The Chargers needed to address their offensive line and did so with the selection of Johnson.

It was tempting to select another playmaker for Herbert to target here, but the best already are off the board. -- *Lindsey Thiry*

[**Nolan Smith**](https://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/106309/nolan-smith)**, OLB, Georgia**

The Chargers have multiple options here, but the front seven is a big problem. L.A. allowed 5.9 yards per play (29th). A [torn pectoral muscle](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/34924191/sources-georgia-lb-nolan-smith-torn-pec-season) in late October ended Smith's season, but the 6-3 senior posted 11.5 sacks in his career while, like most Georgia defenders, working in a heavy rotation. He is a versatile linebacker who is comfortable standing up or playing with his hand down and has the first-step quickness to stun blockers while also being agile enough to play in space as an off-ball linebacker. That's perfect for the Chargers' base 3-4 scheme and today's NFL.

Smith, just 235 pounds during the season, will need to add strength, but his ability to quickly get into the backfield gives the Chargers a long-term pass-rusher opposite [Joey Bosa](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051389/joey-bosa).

Los Angeles went edge rusher in Round 1 and tries to fix the run defense with Ika -- the draft's best nose tackle -- here.

The long story short is nobody in my family aside from my brother consumed football content, I finally started learning after my brother taught me about it and I decided my team would be the Chargers because my neighbor (who is the person I watch every single game with, with the exception of home games) would be screaming and hollering every Sunday and even in a few cases had the police called for being so fuckin’ loud because the neighbors below thought he was getting murdered. With all that being said a 5th Grader me befriended the neighbor and on November 5th, 2014 @ 10:00 AM I officially became a Chargers fan.

For the next 3 Hours I watched as my newly acquired team lost 0-37 to the Miami Dolphins. I figured if the lows felt that low than surely the highs would feel so high (Ive never been more wrong about something in my life) so against the friendly advice of my brother: “You can still pick a different team!” I stuck with the Bolts ever since!

Let’s not even mention their move to LA, who the fuck cares about that.

But we can have this made up argument if you want.

I believe the biggest piece we've missed from every coach over the years is the ability to call a complete game. This is obviously a nuanced issue with multiple layers that are impacted by the staff, the players and more.

 I can't think of a single instance in the last few years where we didn't drop the ball (figuratively or literally) in one or multiple facets of the game, at least a couple of times a game, every year.

Lynn, had HORRIBLE clock management. He also was dealt the unfortunate hand of not being adept at public speaking in difficult/stressful situations. Causing him to experience a lot of foot in mouth, scenarios. 

Staley has scripted some truly genius plays and sequences over time. But has fallen apart in the second half numerous times and made some truly questionable decisions in his second season. I'm inclined to cut him some slack for this season as I believe we (slightly) outperformed expectations based on our injuries. (Sans the playoffs). I also really blame Lombardi for how fucking bad our offense was.

Staley or any coach for that matter, needs to call complete games. Nobody is perfect, but nobody should allowed to be continue making bad calls either.

27880,155190,155190,TrueJP,"I need to take a break from last night...

So, let's talk about what you want to see in coordinator changes for next season.

I'll start...

I can't see Spanos firing Staley or Telesco... this offseason. I also can't see him paying for a proven coach like Payton. But, I can see us replacing Lombardi and MAYBE Hill.  Besides, I think Staley still owns the trust and faith of our locker room. His pregame gameplans and analysis are also consistently improving.

That said, I do think he needs an experienced hand to help manage in-game decisions. So, I'd like to see a former head coach added as a coordinator/Asst head coach. 

Best case, he learns and improves. Worst case, we have his successor in case he doesn't work out.

With that said, here is my list of names, ranked in order of preference:

OC

1. Frank Reich, former HC for Colts, QB Coach/OC for the Chargers, probably needs another OC job before he'll get interest as a HC again (perfect for what I described above), experience developing talented young QBs.

2. Pep Hamilton, Houston Texans offensive coordinator, XFL GM/head coach, QB coach for Herbert's offensive rookie of the year campaign.

3. Matt Weiss, Michigan Wolverines co-offensive coordinator, while he's not had HC experience, he's a SB champion with the Ravens in '12, instrumental in developing their record breaking run game in '18/'19, a wonky young dude who might work well with Stanley.

DC

1. Ronaldo Hill, feel like we need continuity here with how long it's taken the defense to begin gelling, also feels like he and Staley would both loose their jobs if either does

2. Vic Fangio, former NFL defensive coordinator and head coach, if we don't get Reich and decide to replace Hill, this is the obvious choice, needs a DC job before he'll get any interest as a HC, Staley runs HIS defense, who better to handle mid-game adjustments than the guy who invented your scheme

3. Brian Flores, Steelers Senior defensive assistant & linebackers coach, former MIA HC, always felt the MIA defense played hard for him, MIA did him dirty and he deserves another shot.

4. Sean Desai, Chicago Associate head coach & defensive assistant, history with Stanley in Chicago, no HC experience, up and coming defensive mind, gamble, unproven

27882,155192,155192,TrueJP,"None of what you said is wrong. But, if you've watched as much Chargers football as I think you have, you know that Herbert is a robot who precisely executes whatever gamelan he's given. To date, this is the most damning indictment he's earned. 

It was clear Staley was trying to run out the clock beginning with that last drive of the second half with the cushion our DBs started using. Felt like Lombardi was calling the same game, albeit poorly. 

Herbert DID miss a couple throws. But, that endzone miss to Keenan looked to me like one of his throwaways (right at the outside edge of catchable for the wr but impossible for the DB). Low throws have a low probability of being intercepted. In all, it seemed like someone told him to protect the ball, especially after halftime, e.g. go out and try not to lose. The whole team looked like that in the 2nd half 

To me, that's why this is coaching and not on the players or Herbert. The players proved they could dominate in the first half. Staley proved this too with his first half gamelan. But he blinked too early and underestimated a hungry Jags team and SB winning coach.

All of the QBs you listed have at least one of either superior weapons or scheme/coaching. If we ever had these, we didn't use them in the 2nd half.

But, you're right that Herbert's got to start going a little rogue sometimes like these other QBs. Sometimes the scheme sucks or the play breaks down.

Herbert did not lose us the game. He just didn't know how to overrule Staley's/Lombardi's conservative impulses.",1.0,nfl,t3_10cl3m8,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2023-01-15T17:41:15Z,chargers,0.0007717271183025

29974,163860,163860,WyldeBolt,"Mirror:

> Kellen Moore spoke with the media Wednesday for the first time since agreeing to terms with the Chargers to be their new offensive coordinator.

> Here are my takeaways.

> (1) The Chargers and coach Brandon Staley focused most of their offensive coordinator search on the Kyle Shanahan-Sean McVay coaching tree. They interviewed three assistant coaches from McVay’s Rams staff in Thomas Brown, Zac Robinson and Greg Olson. They interviewed Vikings assistant quarterbacks coach Jerrod Johnson, who coached under Shanahan with the 49ers in 2017 and spent last season under former Rams offensive coordinator Kevin O’Connell. Moore, of course, does not come from that tree.

> Moore was asked about the focus Staley had on that specific tree — something Staley spoke about explicitly at his end-of-season news conference. And Moore explained his core beliefs and philosophies in the context of that tree.

> “From an offensive perspective, you take bits and pieces from everyone,” Moore said. “And I think that’s the beauty of it. We’re going to build a 2023 L.A. Chargers offense.”

> He added later: “Naturally, just because you haven’t coached with certain coaches, it doesn’t mean you’re (not) influenced greatly by those guys. Certainly, the younger offensive head coaches have had a huge impact on this league and are guys that I watch each and every week, and I love watching those guys and studying their offenses and hopefully being able to incorporate some of that.”

>  (2) We heard similar projections after the Chargers announced Joe Lombardi as their offensive coordinator in 2021. Quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator Shane Day, who was fired along with Lombardi last month, had coached with both Shanahan and McVay. Tight ends coach Kevin Koger had spent two seasons coaching under Matt LaFleur, who coached with both Shanahan and McVay. Staley talked about building a blend and incorporating some of those elements.

> That never really materialized. The offense more or less operated in Lombardi’s image with a heavy dose of shorter-developing routes and concepts. The Chargers got Justin Herbert on the move periodically on bootlegs — a staple of the Shanahan-McVay style of offense — but it was never at any point a backbone or major element of the scheme. What was missing, most notably, was what Staley referred to as the “marriage of the run and the pass.”

> So I am in wait-and-see mode when it comes to incorporating some of these elements into the offense, considering Moore’s background.

> (3) Moore mentioned two systems when discussing his core philosophy. One was the Air Coryell system, developed and made famous by former Chargers head coach Don Coryell. The other was the West Coast system, originated by legendary 49ers coach Bill Walsh.

> Moore has ties to both systems.

> He spent the final three years of his NFL playing career as a reserve quarterback for former Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett. Garrett adopted the Air Coryell system from Ernie Zampese, an assistant for Coryell from 1979 to 1986. Zampese was the Cowboys’ offensive coordinator from 1994 to 1997, and Garrett was a backup quarterback for Dallas during those seasons. Moore then coached under Garrett for two seasons in Dallas, first as a quarterbacks coach in 2018 and then as the offensive coordinator in 2019. The Air Coryell system is very much a downfield passing attack.

> Moore then learned the West Coast system from Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy. Moore was McCarthy’s offensive coordinator and play caller for the past three seasons. McCarthy coached under Paul Hackett for almost a decade, first at the University of Pittsburgh and then with the Chiefs. Hackett coached under Walsh for three seasons with the 49ers.

> The West Coast offense, which is rooted primarily in shorter horizontal timing routes, has a rich history in the league. Lombardi, in fact, is a descendant of Walsh. Lombardi learned the system from Sean Payton, who learned it from Jon Gruden, who learned it from Mike Holmgren, who learned it from Walsh. The system, of course, goes through different iterations and variations as it is passed down and molded by different coaches. But this connection feels worth mentioning, especially since there might be some overlap between what Herbert learned in the previous offense and the West Coast concepts Moore is going to bring in.

> “Will you be able to see the Air Coryell-Jason Garrett side? Absolutely,” Moore said. “Will you be able to see the West Coast and Mike McCarthy? Absolutely. We’ll keep things that are in place here that Justin feels really, really good about. And then we’ll be willing to explore.”

> (4) This marriage of the run and the pass is a crucial piece of what Moore needs to build. The Chargers lacked a certain level of intention when designing and preparing their running game, and there was a lack of synergy and cohesion between the running game and the passing game in Lombardi’s offense, particularly in 2022. Moore was asked about this Staley phrase — the marriage of the run and the pass.

> “It’s alignment, and so much of it is about the presentation,” Moore said. “Certainly, the run game and the play-action pass and the movements on first and second down, when those two are in sync, the presentations are similar, it puts defenses in conflict. I think that’s something that we’re really excited about building here and developing certainly in the first- and second-down game. And it will allow you to be more aggressive, to get the ball downfield. Certainly, it doesn’t mean you go crazy with it, but you can build those marriages. And we all know the top offenses in this league and the beauty. When those two things are in sync, it’s a beautiful thing.”

> This sounds like a good start and overall approach. We will see if Moore can put it into action.

> (5) Moore referring to pushing the ball “downfield” should be a welcome sight to Chargers fans. Over Lombardi’s two seasons, Herbert ranked 35th of 38 qualified quarterbacks in air yards per attempt, according to TruMedia. With Herbert’s arm talent, there is no reason he should rank that low. Some of it is Herbert’s propensity to move through his reads quickly and get to his checkdown. But ultimately it is up to the coaching staff to put Herbert in positions where he is encouraged to make those types of throws.

> A big part of this conversation, too, is personnel. The Chargers need to add more speed at receiver so they can access these areas of the field more consistently and dangerously. Moore spoke rather refreshingly about what speed can do to an offense.

> “Speed is always dangerous. We certainly have seen that throughout this league, and when you do have speed, it certainly is a huge advantage,” Moore said. “You hope that you can find a way to create those opportunities still from a schematic standpoint. But speed, you can’t coach. Speed’s very special. Certainly, you want some of it. Every guy doesn’t need it. There’s plenty of ways of playing football. But certainly when you do have it, it’s a nice little advantage to be able to utilize.”

> (6) Moore and Herbert got a chance to connect last summer when they made a commercial for Kendall Auto Group, a car dealership chain in the Pacific Northwest. Moore said the two spent “a few days” together making the commercial. “It’s amazing how life can come full circle here on you,” Moore said. Moore is from Prosser, Wash. Herbert is from Eugene, Ore. Moore played at Boise State. Herbert played at Oregon. Moore said he and Herbert have some “crossover relationships” from their Northwest roots.

> “He’s an awesome, awesome person,” Moore said of Herbert. “Awesome player, certainly know all the physical talent. But I’m just really, really excited to work with him.”

> (7) The process of hiring Moore moved rapidly for the Chargers. Moore said he had conversations with the Cowboys on Friday and Saturday about his future. By Sunday morning, they had agreed to part ways. Moore said he then had a conversation with Staley “rather quickly” and things moved from there. Staley and Moore spent time together in August when the Chargers and Cowboys held joint practices.

> “Anytime you do one of those, you kind of get to know the other staff pretty well,” Moore said. “Spend a lot of time just getting practices organized, schedules and scripts and all that sort of stuff. And I really, really enjoyed my time with Brandon during those couple days.”

> Moore said he and Staley kept in touch over the season via text, and those joint practices set the stage for how quickly the Chargers were able to make their move and bring Moore aboard.

> (8) As far as the rest of the Chargers’ offensive staff, Moore made it sound like that group will stay mostly intact.

> “Brandon and I have been able to talk through this over the course of the last few days, and I just love the way he really likes this offensive staff,” Moore said. “Every interaction I’ve had I’ve really, really enjoyed. So I’m really excited to work with these guys.”

> The Chargers have an opening at quarterbacks coach, and that should get filled here in the next few weeks. I could see the Chargers making a change at offensive line coach. Brendan Nugent was hired last offseason to replace Frank Smith, who left to take the offensive coordinator job in Miami. Nugent was brought in from New Orleans, where he had previously worked alongside Lombardi. That connection is obviously gone. And with so much emphasis being put on improving the run game and building that marriage between the run game and the pass game, an offensive line coach who has familiarity with Moore would make sense",1.0,chargers,t3_10raaxi,False,0.0,Chargers,2023-02-01T17:54:40Z,chargers,-0.0005489421084736

If we were to take Robinson, it would actually be more like a 50/50 share. I don't hate the idea of taking him because that RB duo would be dangerous and could actually help develop deep passing opportunities if we have to keep defenses honest to a strong running game. That's part of the reason why our deep passing sucked. It was less about having a fast WR and more about our offensive scheme plus a weak run game that opposing defenses didn't have to worry about too much. I think it's extremely unlikely Robinson is there at 21 but a man can dream.

That said, while it would be nice to have a speedy WR, I don't think it's 100% necessary if we fix the offense. Other teams have no problem opening up the passing game without a burner. We just need to get those WRs open, whether that be by speed or scheme. I do hope we take a faster WR but it doesn't have to be in the 1st round.

I'm not trying to say they are the same or even remotely close in talent. But measurables don't mean squat as long as you use it to your advantage.

Especially after joining a brand new team just before the season after not playing meaningful time in a game for over a year and then being thrust into the slot/PR/KR role.

Why doesn't the offense deserve credit for blowing it? Just because they weren't good in the first half either? Our offense is too talented to not score more than 3 points in a half. Given that doing so would've dramatically increased the likelihood of a win, it's hard to not consider it a failure. I think losing Deandre Carter in that game, especially with Mike Williams already out, was a bigger factor in that failure than we tend to talk about, but ultimately the scheming, playcalling, and clock management failed the talent.

38475,218288,218288,greyhair_,"Im going to go on a bit of a rant and I hope this makes sense:   


Overall it was a very unique season with ***unfulfilled potential and absolute heartbreak*** mixed with a lot of **toughness** and **resilience**.   
We found a few good new players for our team that where not on the radar of anyone earlier  in the season, and they stepped up massively.   


My thing is that yes, we did lose in the playoffs but to say that the season was a failure isnt something I can 100% get behind. I would argue that least 2-3 of those games we would win if we had a better OC, which has been the arching theme of the season. Staley is surrounded by mediocre coaching and its showing. Hes not a super talented head coach but he is a hell of a motivator and can sell salt to a slug.   
The thing I keep coming back to is the fact that we won a LOT of games within 2-3 points this season that we typically would have lost any other year due to Special Teams. To go 10-7 (an ugly 10-7) with everything that happened to us is pretty damn impressive because other Charger teams would have just caved in and called it a day. But we had Herbert and a ton of belief.   
Herbert at one point was out here taking a LOT of criticism and throwing to 3rd and 4th string WR's while trying to make something out of nothing and Austin Ekeler was carrying our team on his damn back while doing everything. His season will ultimately get overshadowed from the the wild card game we just had.   


It is also very apparent that we have zero depth. I was really disappointed that we didn't keep Oday Aboushi along with Nwosu. Aboushi would have helped give this line more continuity and flexibility but to let him walk was foolish. Nwosu absolutely was a beast for the Seahawks this season and had a team tying 9.5 sacks & 66 tackles. That would have put him as our sack leader and 4th most tackles. All because they where not ""Staley's guys"" when in reality they where really good assets for us in the 2021 season.   
We stood pat during free agency and didn't even try to trade for a WR or make a move. Big give away that we wouldn't go far in the playoffs.   


Wrapping up I really believe that we can fix this with Staley which might be a hot take? who knows. We have to get a better DC such as Vic Fangio along with a great OC such as Pep Hamilton or Frank Reich.

Look at the Giants and Brian Daboll…they’re playing with literal nobodies on offense aside from Saquon and they just beat the number 2 seed in the NFC. Why? Bc they have a coach that knows what tf he’s doing and that can elevate his players play. Look at Mike McDaniel. He nearly beat the Bills with Skyler Thompson at QB.

I'm active on the sub daily (whether I comment or not). I'd like to be a mod to help the sub be as welcoming and open for healthy discussions as much as possible, while ensuring the sub content fits the wants and needs of the community. There are different types of fans here - the longtimers, San Diego natives and faithful, LA natives, Herbert-era (2020-present) fans, etc. The sub should be a melting pot of all of the above, and the sub content (and frequency of it) should be determined by said fans. A unified and healthy moderating team could achieve just that.

On two discord servers, each with a few thousand members. Both servers dead now.

I don't know if it's because of Payton's PR push, our new fans having no idea how the Spanos family operates, or just Reddit being Reddit - but let me make this clear.

Sean Payton was *never* going to be the coach of the Chargers.

The Spanos family and Telesco are huge on culture fits - look at every player and draft pick since I don't even know when. They're all the same type of guy.

We've passed up on great players because they didn't fit the culture.

As for the qualifications: 

>Why do you want to be a mod? 

I’m quite active on this sub, even if I don’t comment/post as often as others. This is definitely my most visited subreddit as I check it multiple times a day (sometimes obsessively) and comment/post when something really interests me. My name should be fairly recognizable at this point. 

I also pride myself on being level-headed and never getting into arguments with others. I haven’t had any scuffles with our subscribers or on any other team sub. I don’t see any benefit to a one-sided dialogue or anything constructive about shitting on other people. It’s tough, but I’ve stuck with this team through and through. My post history will show some positive takes on this team, especially during our losing streaks and low points. I’ll fume internally about a loss but don’t feel the need to rage about it on reddit — that’s what my wife and friends are for! 

Overall I enjoy the commentary and opinions here and I’d like to maintain that integrity. Feel free to check my post and comment history of course. 

>	Do you have prior experience as a mod? 

Probably my downfall, but I have no experience moderating any subreddits — this would be my first time. Feels like a chicken or an egg problem - I haven’t had the opportunity to be a mod so I haven’t gained experience, but the lack of experience makes it hard to find an opportunity with a sub I really like. That said, there also aren’t really any other subreddits I’d be super interested in being a mod for.  

I also don’t have any CSS experience, but I’m willing to put in the time to learn if need be. I’ve got extra time at work that I use to practice R and SAS coding. My job also requires minimal experience with HTML that I need to brush up on anyway. I’m really excited about the prospect of moderating and doing so with the Chargers sub would be a great first opportunity. I’m a fast learner and am 100% willing to put in the time!

>What time zone do you live in?

PST. Actually just moved back to the west coast after a 7 year stint on the east coast. Glad to be back in the pacific time zone for more reasons than just the chargers! 

I’m also almost always on the game day thread just to see what others are saying and to upvote/downvote as I see fit, as well as to call out terrible reffing and praise incredible plays. Almost to a fault, I schedule my Sundays around Chargers games during the season so I’m almost always available. 

>How long have you been a fan for? 

Since the mid 90s! Grew up going to Qualcomm with my dad and his friends and have stuck with the bolts through the move and everything. For better or worse, I’ll be a fan until I die. 

>Why should we pick you? 

Not much to add to answer to number 1 above, but I’ll just add that I’ve applied to be a mod before and had some solid support. I was asked to be more involved in the sub, and I feel like I’ve really done this over the past several years. 

>Fuck the ____?

Raiders, of course. But over the years this is quickly shifting more towards Fuck the Chiefs, so why not add that too? Here’s a Fuck the Broncos as well for good measure. 

I don’t have a Raiders decal on my toilet, just some close die-hard Raiders friends I’ve known for years. At this point, the relationship is based more on pity than anything.

**To apply to be a moderator, please reply to this post answering the following:**

1. Why do you want to be a mod?

I’m active on the sub pretty much everyday. I probably have gotten into some arguments often in the past season or so, but I’ve never let my emotions get the better of me. I don’t believe I’ve ever broken a subreddit rule even though I’ve been in a number of discussions about a variety of topics. I like to think I’m level headed and reasonable regardless of the situation. I feel as though I am on this sub so often I could help out with whatever is needed. 

2. Do you have prior experience as a mod?

Yes, I’ve been a moderator with r/angelsbaseball for 4 years now. I also have experience on discord.

3. What time zone do you live in?

PST

4. How long have you been a fan?

2006 was the first year I truly remember, but I started becoming a die hard around 2012. I think I’ve watched every game since then, I even am able to schedule my work around game days. 

5. Why should we pick you?

I’m active on this sub everyday for multiple hours a day. I love this team and I’m an advocate for healthy discussion. I have moderating experience with r/angelsbaseball and I’ve never let my person afflictions affect my moderator duties. I’ll enforce the rules as they are written and won’t let my personal feelings or beliefs influence my decisions.

That right there shows that he is willing to change and adapt. He’s not stubborn. His defensive scheme evolved throughout the year and he adapted until it really became successful towards the end of the year.

There is a lot to look forward to for next season (despite that always being the case).  Herbert is a top 5 QB in the league and, when you have that, you’re always a threat.  In my opinion, Staley is a good coach but he is inexperienced and there is a learning curve.  That’s what happened vs. JAX, Doug Peterson is a much more experienced coach and we were out-coached that second half.  That being said, the team is VERY bought in; they trust him and what he’s doing.  He has shown a tendency to take care of coaching issues aggressively during the offseason and chase excellence at every facet.  Last offseason, he replaced our special teams coordinator and this season we had a top 5 unit in the NFL.  Our hiring of Kellen Moore reflects this too.  Moore has orchestrated a top 5 offense 3 out of the last 4 years in Dallas (the 1 year he didn’t their starting QB broke his leg).  Our weapons are better than Dallas at the top of our roster (we desperately need a WR that’s fast), so he should be able to make a lot happen.  Staley is definitely on the hot seat and Moore had been a serious HC candidate for like 3 years, which is why I think he took the job because lateral moves (OC to OC) don’t happen.  It would make sense to bring him in so you don’t have Herbert and co with their 2nd HC change and 4th OC.  This way, even if Staley does get fired, there would be consistency in the building.  Sorry, I know this was long winded, but I wanted to give you my take on the current state of the team.
