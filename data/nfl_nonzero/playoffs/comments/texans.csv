There’s a stat about leadership in America, specifically businesses.

If we can agree that the NFL and it’s franchises is a business (it is), then let’s assume these stats translate pretty even into nfl organizations.

The point: there *will* be coaches who have the knowledge but lack the leadership ability to run a team. These coaches go to teams like the Bills, Chiefs, Eagles, and 49ers to develop their leadership *as well as their knowledge*. I’m excited because Demeco might add us to that list, and I wonder if guys like Slowik and Johnson factor that into their decision.

1266,8351,8351,AngryCobraChicken,"**Q: Can we expect a new coach to be named soon? — Mike Grasse**

JMA: Yes. The first round of interviews concluded Sunday after Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka interviewed for the job. He was the eighth candidate to have an interview.

Now, the second round of interviews will begin. General manager Nick Caserio said the process would take two to three weeks. We’re now entering week 3. Most of the coaching hires in last year’s cycle were hired in early February.

So based on that, I’d expected a coach to be named somewhere between late January or within the first week of February. The fact that three of the Texans’ candidates are in the NFC championship game could play a factor in delaying the process.

The Texans’ top brass is trying to get this search right. Don’t expect them to rush it.

**Q: Your odds on head coaching candidates for Houston? Would defense be a focus in free agency and the offense during the draft? Or a mix of both in FA and the draft? — Veera on Twitter**

JMA: At this point, it’s tough to call who the Texans prefer. The information is fluid and the second round of interviews will reveal a lot. A candidate may blow someone out of the water. Who these coaches would bring on as their coordinators will also play a part.

What we do know is that Eagles defensive them to just seven points in their 38-7 win. Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen was good, too.

We also know that DeMeco Ryans is a fan favorite. CEO Cal McNair thinks fondly of Ryans, who was a former All-Pro linebacker, Defensive Rookie of the Year and team captain for the Texans. In his second year as San Francisco’s defensive coordinator, the 49ers’ defense is No. 1 in the league in points allowed and yards allowed. Ryans interviewed with the Texans on Friday after talking with the Broncos on Thursday.  He reportedly canceled two interviews to focus on the 49ers’ divisional playoff game against Dallas. They won 19-12.

Former Saints coach Sean Payton figures to be one of the top two candidates on the market, too, given his history of winning. Teams seem willing to pay the Saints at least one first-round pick for Payton. It will come down to which job is most attractive to Payton.

As far as free agency and the draft, I think a lot will depend on who the head coach is and what he values. If Payton is the head coach, then the Texans may not even have that second first-round pick at No. 12.

**Q: How about a rundown of a couple potential free agents? — Austin on Twitter**

JMA: I’ll give you more than a couple. The Texans are projected to have the fifth-most cap space of any team in the NFL at $40 million, and could have more with roster cuts and contract restructures. Though they likely won’t be huge spenders, they could spend more than they have in the past two years. These potential free agents are more of a dream, but they address needs:

• Bengals safety Jessie Bates: Bates won’t be cheap. He’s playing this season on the franchise tag for the Bengals, and has four interceptions and a forced fumble. But he’s young and he can ball. He has 14 career interceptions in five seasons.

• Washington defensive tackle Daron Payne:  The Commanders may end up re-signing him, but if they don’t, he could help the Texans out in a big way. He can play the three-technique or one-tech. And not only can Payne rush the passer, but he can stop the run, which the Texans were the worst at in the NFL. Payne finished the 2022 season with 11½ sacks and 18 tackles for loss. He’s also in for a big payday.

• Philadelphia safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson: He can play in the slot or he can play safety. And the Texans will be needing both this offseason, as Jonathan Owens and Tavierre Thomas are pending free agents. Gardner-Johnson has six interceptions this season. He’s a playmaker and the Texans will need that. It’ll just depend on whether they want to spend the money.",11.0,texans,t3_10jg0yh,False,0.0,None,2023-01-23T11:07:29Z,texans,0.0014566703327684

Surprised to hear this take. Personally, I'm not worried about his frame.

It's because he falls flat on his back and whiplashes the back of his head in the ground. Hence, the reason he's taking Judo in the off season to learn how to fall.

So because Brady is the GOAT QB, you value them over coaches? Bill Belichick and Brady were always great because Bill Belichick was able to keep talent at a low cost and because he was always able to scheme up great defenses. Brady is a master of picking apart zone defenses and never had to worry about his cast lacking talent until he hightailed to a Bucs team that was stacked with elite talent and another fantastic coach. If you’re going to make that argument, there are insane amount of underlying variables as to why the Patriots were a team (who traded a first for their HC, too) who had a dynasty for the better part of the modern NFL. 

>	Coaches are not worth a first rounder

There have been only 4 coaches AFAIK who have been traded for first round picks. Shula, Parcells, Belichick, and Gruden. The **only** trade that was not worth it was Parcells to the Jets, every other coach brought their team at least one championship. Sean Payton would only be the fifth coach in NFL history to go for a first rounder, and I think he absolutely is worth it if it’s only a mid first round pick like the Brown’s pick.",1.0,texans,t3_10hhn19,False,0.0,:nagatoro1:,2023-01-21T15:33:52Z,texans,0.0757965669393539

He is literally won of the winningest coaches of the 2000s and was instrumental in making the Eagles relevant and was able to lift Mahomes into what he is now. Would you still say Mahomes would be the best QB right now if the Bears took him instead of Trubisky?

>	belichick can’t make the playoffs without Brady

He literally played a playoff game without Brady while Mac Jones was a rookie. 

>	Sean Payton only won with drew Bree’s

Drew Brees only won with Payton so what’s your point? 

>	McKay couldn’t win with Jared Goff but he won with Matt stafford?

He got outcoached by Belichick in the Super Bowl and stopped one of the best regular season offenses by keeping them to only 3 points. I guess Tom Brady willed the Rams to just not show up for that one? Also, why didn’t Stafford lead the Lions to many Super Bowls if he’s apparently the biggest reason for the Rams winning a ring?

>	Gary Kubiak won with Peyton manning 

Are we remembering this right? The Broncos had an all time great defense that suffocated the Panthers. Funny enough, the season where Manning had a historically good offensive season with the Broncos, the Seahawks completely dominate them and a lot of that is due to Pete Carroll out coaching John Fox. 

Any good franchise will prioritize a good coach and a good QB, but coaching legitimately wins and is much more important than individual QB stats. Otherwise, why hasn’t Rodgers won more rings?

13444,102850,102850,Nectorist,"Alex Smith still elevated an already-terrible KC team. He had a career revival under good coaching, but that KC team wasn’t good before he arrived by any means.

I said the Seahawks hadn’t had a winning season since 2007. They still went 7-9 in 2010 and were lucky to play in a horrible division that year. 

Wentz had MVP-caliber play with his time on the Eagles then and Foles got extremely hot for a short playoff run. That team doesn’t win without either of them playing at a high level.

You can get a great QB via trade or free agency, yeah, but at the moment what QB is going to come to Houston? What free agent or trade-available QB is out there right now for Houston to acquire? Burrow, Hurts, and Herbert are in line for massive extensions, Mahomes is extended. Josh Allen is extended. Lawrence is on lock with the Jags for a few years, same with Fields with Chicago. These high-level talents just aren’t there and are being locked down right now. If anyone could just grab a good QB then they’d do it. 

If everyone could just find a guy in free agency or use a low draft pick to find their QB of the future then everyone would be doing it and no one would ever draft a QB high. QBs picked in later rounds perform worse on average. Guys like Young and Stroud project highly enough to have the ability to turn around a rebuild. Do you think Cincinnati regrets getting Burrow and building around him after? Or Miami? Or the Chargers? Or the Bills? Now, that’s not to say that all those teams have done a perfect job, but there is a certain floor with them now that they have good QBs in place. 

There is 0 reason to hold off on a QB while viable prospects are in the draft. This is far from a Malik Willis situation. Continuing to hold off every year will just mean sustaining mediocrity as we continue to place ourselves further away from being able to acquire a good QB.",1.0,texans,t3_10tn24o,False,0.0,:zerotwo1:,2023-02-04T19:42:06Z,texans,0.0159322585086998
13445,102851,102851,Nectorist,"The Chiefs had pro bowl QB Alex Smith before getting Mahomes, not just some nobody. If we actually want to look further at that, they went 2-14 before trading for Alex Smith, who immediately took them to an 11-5 record. Yeah, Mahomes stepped into a good situation, but that was because the Chiefs already had a winning QB that they had built around.

The Seahawks hadn’t had a winning season since 2007 (when they were led by pro bowler Matt Hasselback) before getting Russell Wilson in 2012. 

Nick Foles had a great playoff run, but otherwise has been a backup QB. That whole Eagles season was marked by Wentz performing at an MVP level (that he never replicated after his injury).

The Saints had gone 3-13 the year before acquiring Drew Brees and went 10-6 the year after getting him.

The Buccaneers had been a perennially losing franchise before acquiring Brady, the greatest QB of all time.

When the Rams got Jared Goff the franchise had previously been mediocre and his first season they went 3-13, but a year later they made the playoffs. Acquiring Stafford was done after they had already built a strong roster around Goff, so Stafford was traded for as a massive upgrade.

The Bengals is literally the perfect example of why you build around a QB. They hadn’t made the playoffs since 2015 when Burrow was drafted and they had gone 2-14 the season before. Within two seasons of acquiring him they’re in the Super Bowl despite everyone projecting them to have a terrible year. They got their QB, gave him some weapons, made the Super Bowl in his second year, and are now one of the top teams in the NFL.

All of these examples you’re bringing are of consistently losing franchises being able to elevate themselves to the playoffs after doing one of three things:
1) Aggressively trading for a QB
2) Drafting and developing a QB for the future
3) Signing a high-level QB in free agency

None of these teams were consistently making the playoffs despite bad QB play and were just in need of a small push over the line with a good QB. They were all terrible situations that were able to be turned around after acquiring a good QB. Good QB play immediately elevated these teams and they were able to go fill in the gaps in free agency or through the draft. Us sitting on our hands and refusing to take a QB until it’s just the right time will just mean that we will continuously put ourselves out of reach of having any success.",3.0,texans,t3_10tn24o,False,0.0,:zerotwo1:,2023-02-04T18:35:54Z,texans,0.0177123032575839

They aggressively acquired one of the greatest QBs of all time and won a Super Bowl. however, despite still retaining a strong roster, they spent the next 6 or so years not going out to acquire a QB again. They only did so this season

Andrew Luck retired in 2018, back when a strong core still surrounded him. Again, instead of answering the QB question, Indy just kicked the can down the road and now have to blow up their roster and tank so they can grab a QB

Cam has been gone from the Panthers for a while, and instead of just being aggressive in the draft and getting their guy, they’ve had several losing seasons with a not-horrible roster in a terrible division because, again, they haven’t settled their QB issue

This is all to show that a) QB is the most important position and b) the idea of just waiting for “the right guy” endlessly and using stop gaps in between isn’t a winning strategy. You’re going to run into a situation where you’re not good enough to win big, but not bad enough to play poorly enough to have a high draft pick. A guy like Carter or Anderson might raise our ceiling enough to win us a couple of extra games, but what happens when the QB issue still isn’t resolved? We gamble on far less certain players like Levis or Richardson? We gamble that we’ll be bad enough to pick high again in 2024 (we won’t be)?

Jamarcus was huge with a strong arm, but couldn’t not process the game at an pro level, had a horrible work ethic, and was a poor decision-maker (all of these are things Young excels are).

There are maybe a few more comparisons with Stroud and Jamarcus to be made, but again their concerns are different. Stroud struggles to create out of structure and was blessed by great receivers but is an accurate playmaker and can read coverage well. Most of Jamarcus’s hype was around his frame and strong arm, which if anything is maybe closer to what you hear talked about with Will Levis (although again, major differences between how those two are perceived and projected).

1. DeMeco - Former Texan and one of my favorite all time players, clearly is really smart defensively and called plays his entire career on-field, really liked this article https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35467765/how-49ers-defensive-coordinator-demeco-ryans-became-prime-nfl-coaching-candidate
2. Sean Payton - Probably the safest pick but we have to give up draft picks most likely, already has experience in a similar situation with the Saints, would be great for a rookie QB
3. Ben Johnson - this was my number 3 but hes staying in detroit
4. Shane Steichen - I like the idea of an offensive minded head coach and after ben johnson, Shane Steichen is my next choice. He's young and the eagles offense has some serious firepower

Those are my top 4, I don't really like the other options that much but out of the other selections, Mike Kafka seems like maybe he could be ok, and Ejiro Evero's defense has been amazing this year, however I am hesitant to take anyone from the Broncos after their season. I honestly do not want Gannon, I don't like the Eagles defense and he does not seem like the key reason for their success to me. Thomas Brown is a question mark to me, so I don't know about him.

I get that the lottery value of first round picks has a high ceiling, but it also has a roughly 50/50 chance of being a bust. So, in the case of Sean Payton, what you are doing is effectively trading away a 50/50 shot at a starter AND hoping that the guy you are promoting into their new job is a good HC for a coach with a 15 year winning record and a few million to spend in free agency. Some quick stats on rookie head coaches- their average tenure is \~3.3 years and between 2008 and 2020, rookie head coaches had a combined record of 437-522-1. That averages out to around 7-9. Payton's 153-89 record averages out to 10-6.

&#x200B;

To defend this a little bit, I know that a lot of fans are looking at the idea of sending draft capital out for a coach as too valuable of an asset to lose on a position (head coach) that we can fill without spending draft capital at all. We need to think about it from all angles though. For starters, why be Peter Griffin? Just take the boat. That 12th overall pick and newly promoted coordinator are mystery boxes. We could end up with THE best coach in the league or we could end up with a guy who should never have been promoted from the job they were actually good at (Pep Hamilton). We could end up with Christian Ponder, we could end up with Deshaun Watson (oops). The 12th overall pick this year will also come with a roughly $3.5million cap hit. We could spend that money in free agency and while we won't get back a guy of 12th pick's ceiling for 3.5 million, we can use that to sweeten the pot a little bit for some of the talent I've had my eyes on. Talent that should be a little cheaper to bring on board with Payton at the helm. We're coming off two 4 win seasons that led to a 3 win season. There is a definite Texans tax to the contracts that free agents want from us right now. Bringing in a head coach who has a record of winning 73% of his games over a FIFTEEN year period is going to help with that. Add to the fact that he is liked and respected by the guys who've played for him in the past? That's a whole lot of winning before we even play a down of football this year. Additionally, I'm not really offering 12th straight up. If I get the impression that 33 overall will do it then that's the offer, but I'm expecting to start with 12th and 73rd for Payton, 40 and 71. That has a pick value between 26th and 27th pick which in in the expected range of outcomes. If they aren't feeling the 3rd round pick swap, leaving it out brings the value to exactly 26th pick.

With Johnson heading back to Detroit, there's noone else who is even close. Steichen is a talented young offensively minded coach who has also coached the other side of the ball. There is only one major potential red flag and it kept me from hiring his co-coach Gannon last year- he needs to replace our offensive coordinator. Steichen and Pep worked together on the Chargers during Herbert's rookie season. If Pep will take the demotion back to QB coach in order to stay with Steichen at the helm great, otherwise, moving on.

Next man up is Ryans. Ryans would be an immediate PR success, with both the National media and the fans. Bonus, I like the way he coaches. The downside is, I don't want to be in the position 2-3 years from now where our OC gets poached just as we start rolling. I'd rather bring an offensive guy in to implement his own system to initiate an era of continuity for the offense. I'm just not sure that Thomas Brown is that guy, but if Demeco's interview doesn't go well, he might get bumped into this slot.

I think it can sometimes set a franchise back years if they don’t get the pick right, yet a lot of casual fans just don’t understand why year in year out their team is constantly underwhelming and underperforming.

If a rookie comes in and starts losing a lot it can have a compounding effect, he can start losing confidence, stop having fun, we lose so much and start talking about the next great QB prospect, don’t pick up his fifth year and now we’re back at square 1.

Having a good/mid team in place before you put an expensive investment like a rookie 1st rounder helps to diminish that risk of wasting years.

[So just taking a look at the QB’s](https://www.insider.com/nfl-draft-first-round-quarterbacks-busts-stars) drafted since 2010 I decided to create this very technical (/s) pie chart. The hits, busts and TBD’s are all subjective opinion but I will give you my reasoning

**Hits**
Luck
Lawrence
Burrow
Allen
Mahomes
Wentz
Herbert
Jackson
Newton

These are all, for the most part obvious. With the exception of Wentz (who won the Eagles a Super Bowl essentially) are universally known as Franchise QB’s. These are the guys you keep and pay (with the exception of Newton). I also felt Luck deserved to be in this category despite his early retirement.

**Busts**
Gabbert
Griffin III
Winston
Bradford
Ponder
Lynch
Tebow
Bridgewater
Manziel
Z. Wilson
Locker
Manuel
Rosen
Mariota
Bortles
Mayfield
Tannehill
Goff
Trubisky
Watson
Weeden

Again, with the exception of a couple of debatable names, the list is pretty straightforward. Tannehill, Bridgewater, Watson, Goff are replacement level starters, some better and more accomplished than others. Bortles had a good run getting the Jags to the AFC title game. However, it is difficult to argue that any of the names on the list returned adequate value for a 1st round selection.

**TBD**
Darnold
Tua
Lance
Fields
M. Jones
Love
Murray

All of these younger QBs have a decent chance at proving they were worth a 1st round pick. However, in my opinion it is too early to tell.

**Unknown**
Haskins

He showed some potential. Truly tragic. A shame we will never know. RIP.

The reason I wanted to point some of this out is to highlight the risky nature of selecting QB’s in the first round. As you can see, it is reflected in the percentages since 2010. Though I’m sure some of our opinions will differ on where some of these picks and their value lies, but I try to be as objective as possible. 

All that said, *IMO* I think it would be a higher chance of success for the Texans to draft a successful rookie QB if we first built the team around him. I have some other strong opinions about the reason why we may be thinking QB this year. Ultimately, I think it puts the cart in front of the horse, so to speak. Instead, deferring the 1st round picks to offensive line and defense in general, is a great place to start. Then maybe next year or in two years we can revisit using a very high draft pick on a rookie QB, and ride the wave to the Lombardi.

Let's stop with the hopium. If you want a rookie QB, your best bet is to actually spend some of that capital on established players. Tee Higgins might be available. You may need to trade for a high quality receiver. You need to go get a vet center and then another guard because I'm not putting my eggs in the basket that is Kenyon Green. Then you may need a vet TE who can do more than a few catches every now and then.

For example, yeah the tackles look good but it doesn't matter because the IOL was legit one of the worst I've ever seen this year. And yes we have the capital to fix it but the thing is that it's not established- hence, we don't know if even attempting to fix it will pan out how we hope. We have 1 RB and having such, really hurt us this year. Again, we need a unit of a running game not just one person. I don't think any of our WRs have proven themselves yet. Chris Moore has solidified himself as a solid WR4. Collins is inconsistent and hasn't maintained health. Even when he was healthy, you'd be hard pressed to call him a WR2/3 compared to other WR2/3s. That doesn't mean he can't get there, but again... It isn't an established thing. Our best TE is on the verge of 30 and had just a few splash moments. I would not bet on him being a foundational piece or even good enough as a stop gap. TQ showed promise but then again so did Brevin Jordan his rookie year and that didn't work out so well this year. We have no known, guaranteed good units on this team which is why taking a rookie QB is DOUBLE gambling. It's already taking a chance when you draft any given player but when you draft a QB in particular, to a bad environment, you are increasing the bust potential.  
 
Considering all of this plus the fact that we don't know if our OC will be good, average or just bad just really doesn't bode well. The chances and percentages aren't high. We'd have to either get a known brilliant OC or spend money/draft capital to build the team up with known quality commodities outside the draft. However there just aren't many good FAs at the skill position this year so you're talking about spending draft capital at that point in a trade.

I can see that argument and I can see the path to success through that route. It's pretty common in today's NFL to build the team and then find the QB. Additionally, picking #2 overall leaves some uncertainty as to what direction we go, and likely Jimmy and Carr will be on other teams if we wait to see what happens in the draft. If we were to lean into a solid vet at QB, it would solidify plans for the #2 spot. 

I do have a couple of thoughts that make me think we aren't a good fit for either of those guys. Despite still having a ton of holes I think we win more next season and if we want a younger play caller we will need to expend a good amount of capital for it or all of the guys getting hyped for next year could crash and burn. If we think there is a game-changer at QB we likely won't get a better opportunity to snag one on a rookie deal. 

I also can't help but think why either of those guys would want to come here at this stage in their career. Both of these guys are in their early 30s and history tells us that they likely only have a handful of really good years. Do Jimmy G and Carr want to gamble these last few years that the Texans will pop within their window?

Fans that don't want to go QB in the draft, or at least not with our first two picks, are hoping for a better crop of QBs next year. 

Considering the contract demands of a QB like Jimmy I think most fans would hope to spend that kind of money on other FAs, draft a rookie QB, and have Davis Mills back him up, or perhaps be the opening-day starter.  I think the only FA QBs that would make sense would be someone like Brissett, who is firmly stop-gap A+ backup/D- starter quality.

When BoB Mcnair first bought the Texans he didn't want to model them after the Patriots or this ""Patriots south"" bs that came up in recent years he actually wanted to model them after the Steelers. Before Belichick and Brady the Steelers were the model franchise for prolonged winning. It makes sense now when you look back at their head coaching decisions. Steelers have had 3 head coaches over 45 years, Kubiak and BoB had a long leashes and Bob McNair stated many times he wanted coaches for a long time.

Now to the present I think Casserio is a very sharp GM, the 610 guys played the bit about him analyzing Tomlin and how that works with the Steelers and it boiled down to being a leader first and a coach second really.

Troy Walters enters his third season with the Bengals and his second as wide receivers coach. He leads a talented unit which features veteran Tyler Boyd, third-year pro Tee Higgins and 2021 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Ja'Marr Chase.
In 2021, those three combined for 3374 receiving yards, the most by any receiver trio in the NFL. Chase, the team's first-round draft pick, had the most receiving yards by a rookie in the Super Bowl era (1455) and 13 receiving TDs. Higgins added 74 catches for 1091 yards and six TDs, and Boyd added 67 for 828 and five TDs. In the team's run to Super Bowl LVI, Chase recorded a team postseason record with 368 receiving yards while ranking second in receptions (25).
Walters served as assistant WRs coach in 2020 and helped guide the group through a transition to rookie QB Joe Burrow, despite no in-person offseason program. He also helped oversee a rapid ascension for Higgins, Cincinnati's second-round draft pick who caught 67 passes for 908 yards and six TDs.
Before the Bengals, Walters was offensive coordinator at the University of Nebraska from 2018-19. He helped the Huskers' 2018 offense average 456.2 yards per game (No. 2 in Big 10), 71.2 yards better than in the '17 team (385.0).
From 2016-17, Walters was offensive coordinator at the University of Central Florida and helped guide the offensive-powered Knights to the greatest two-year turnaround in NCAA history. He inherited the FBS' 127th-ranked offense (268.4 yards/game) and 125th-ranked scoring offense (13.9 points/game) from 2015, but by '17 had the Knights ranked fifth in yards/game (530.5) and first in scoring (48.2). UCF finished the 2017 season with a 13-0 record that included a win over Auburn in the Peach Bowl. Walters one of five finalists for the prestigious Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top assistant coach.
From 2013-15, Walters served as receivers coach and recruiting coordinator at the University of Colorado, where he tutored the program's top three single-season receptions leaders and top-two receiving yardage leaders. One of his protégés, Nelson Spruce, left Colorado with 41 school records, and another, future NFL second-round pick Paul Richardson, became the first CU receiver in two nearly two decades to earn all-conference honors.
Walters spent 2012 as WRs coach at North Carolina State, where he helped the Wolfpack rank 18th nationally in receiving yards per game, and helped two players break the 50-catch mark.
From 2010-11, Walters served as wide receivers coach at Texas A&M, where he worked alongside current Bengals head coach Zac Taylor, who at the time was the Aggies' TEs coach. While at A&M, he helped Aggies WR Ryan Swope set school records for catches (89) and receiving yards (1207).
Walters broke into coaching at Indiana State University in 2009, where he served as offensive coordinator while also coaching quarterbacks and receivers.
Walters had a record-setting career as a receiver at Stanford University, where he played four seasons (1996-99). He ended his collegiate career as the Pac 12 conference's all-time leading receiver with 4047 yards. He set career records for receptions (244) and 100-yard receiving games (19), as well as single-season records for catches (86 in 1997) and receiving yards (1456 in '99), and a single-game record for receiving yards (278 vs. UCLA in '99). In 1999, he won the Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the nation's top receiver.
Following Stanford, Walters was selected in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. He went on to also play for the Colts, Cardinals and Lions, and over eight NFL seasons totaled 98 catches, 1135 yards, nine TDs and more than 3800 return yards.
Born Dec. 15, 1976, in Bloomington, Ind., Walters attended Consolidated High School in College Station, Texas. He holds two degrees from Stanford — a bachelor's in communications (1999) and a masters in sociology (2000). He and his wife, Josephine, have two sons, Tate and Wynn, and two daughters, Faith and Landri.",5.0,texans,t3_10qctcq,False,0.0,:johnson3:,2023-01-31T16:58:15Z,texans,0.0140504209181322

I’ve been against taking a QB for a decent amount of time now and I don’t think I’ve ever been more sure it’s the wrong move to take one. There’s so many more confounding factors in play now that if we do take one, he’s bound to fail. 

1) it’s clear that Bryce/Stroud and I guess Levis are somewhere between the 2022 and like 2021 QB class talent wise. Whereas Carter/Anderson are on par with most recent players at their position; though neither have the Myles Garrett type of hype around them and that’s ok. If you’re taking a QB in the top 5 he has to be generational, and neither Stroud nor young are. Whereas it’s way more reasonable to argue that Carter or Anderson have that ability. 

2) Caserio is clearly on the hot seat and taking a QB would buy him time. This is probably the biggest pitfall we could fall victim to. I can’t emphasize enough how bad taking a QB just to take one to extend your tenure is; especially if he’s not head and shoulders better than the surrounding best players available, which they aren’t. 

3) Our defense SUCKS. We have no first or second round picks in the front 7 with a generationally bad rush defense. Now a good bit of that was Lovie’s archaic philosophies at work; another (and I think much larger) part of that is talent disparity. This is a really good defensive draft especially as it relates to the front 7. This is the time to build the trenches and solidify what was an abysmal rush defense in 2022 and 2021.

It's mentioned in pretty much every thread about him? 

The weird thing about Bountygate is, I don't think anyone was punished for intentionally seeking to cause harm to opposing players, they were punished for incentivizing players outside of their contracted terms to do something. I think it was $1000 if a player was carted off, $1500 for QB, and during a playoff run, Jonathon Vilma put up $10000 as a bounty against (I think?) Kurt Warner and Brett Farve, the Saints playoff opponents during their Super Bowl run. 


I know it's sick? but it was a long time ago, and it doesn't seem to be something that's persisted. No one seems to have a problem hiring Gregg Williams (outside of being a shitty coach).

Bryce Young's gonna get destroyed in the NFL like a Lambo in a demolition derby.  He's not gonna bulk up in any significant way, and he for sure ain't gonna grow 4 inches...so best case, you're stuck with a short and maybe a little less skinny kid.  All those skills of his are worthless if he can't stay healthy.

He has basically zero boom potential cuz he's already at or near his ceiling.  This is it.  You're looking at it.  Prepare for mounting injuries because he ain't built for the NFL...that's his projection, that's his future.

What happens when [THIS](https://youtu.be/Mt5S7vAjQvo?t=158) happens to Bryce or Stroud??  Do they pop right up, nod their head, and go grab their helmet the way Levis did?  Seriously, watch the clip.  (Christ, Bryce would be in the ICU after that lol)  

On Stroud vs. Levis:

Stroud's biggest weakness is escaping pressure, and tbh this is a dealbreaker.  Think about the best QBs in today's NFL.  It's the guys who can create when the play falls apart, breaking pocket containment and throwing on the run.  Aaron Rodgers in his prime.  Patrick Mahomes.  Josh Allen.  Jalen Hurts.  Kyler Murray.  Stroud's lack of escapability is a massive hole in his game that will get exploited at the next level. 

If Levis had played his entire career at OSU, he'd be the one with the gaudy stats and would in all likelihood be the consensus #1 pick in this draft.  (And he'd still be playing many years after Bryce tore his ACL for the 3rd or 4th time.)

Also, what's this noise about Levis is just ""some quarterback from Kentucky who people speculated might be decent""?  LOL!! 

First off, he's from Connecticut.  Secondly...well, there's [this](https://www.nfldraftbuzz.com/Player/Will-Levis-QB-PennState) and [this](https://www.profootballnetwork.com/will-levis-qb-kentucky-nfl-draft-scouting-report-2023/).  Levis is hardly ""just some QB from Kentucky"".  He's in the discussion with the other top prospects because of his talent and physical tools.  Period.  

On the Texans tackles thing...

I already blew up your argument in my previous post.  To reiterate...if your QB is dumping everything off for 6 yards underneath and in the flat on a 3 step drop, then yea, you're not gonna give up many sacks.  The sack numbers don't tell the full story.

Anyway, I'm done here...it's been fun.

Anyway.  

Interesting you chose to mostly defend Bryce Young with your counterpoints.  In my mind he's likely gone at #1, and the choice is Stroud or Levis (which in my mind is an extremely close comparison).

But either way, let's take a few seconds to make the case (yet again) that the gap between Levis and the other two isn't nearly as big as you think it is, and it's most definitely NOT ""time to end the debate"".

&#x200B;

> Levis was consistently fighting injuries this entire last season 

But kept playing at a high level behind a subpar Kentucky Wildcat o-line in the SEC.  That sounds like toughness, leadership, and playing through adversity to me.  

&#x200B;

> Young is definitely going to bulk before entering his rookie season 

You state this like it's an undisputed fact.  And maybe he does, but right now it's just your opinion, nothing more.  And the fact that you mention this underscores the point that he's a short, skinny kid whose body is not well suited to the NFL.

&#x200B;

> Bryce Young remained healthy throughout 

Sure, behind a vastly superior Alabama o-line.

&#x200B;

> The Texans also have the best O-Tackle duo in the league 

Yea, Tunsil maybe sneaks into the top 10, but you straight made that ""best duo in the league"" stuff up lol.  

And those o-line stats look a whole lot better when your QB dumps everything off under 10 yards and only ever holds the ball for like 2 seconds.  Mills averaging a measly 6.5 per attempt and still only managing 61% completions says a LOT.

&#x200B;

> you also can’t say Levis is a smarter QB than Young 

I said Levis has a high IQ.  I didn't say the others weren't smart.

&#x200B;

> Stroud led his team to the college football playoffs 

Sure, behind [one of the top o-lines in all of college football](https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-top-10-offensive-lines-2022) and with [a roster loaded with stud pro prospects](https://www.dispatch.com/story/sports/college/football/2022/12/21/a-look-at-ohio-states-2023-nfl-draft-class-led-by-cj-stroud/69611322007/).  How would Stroud have done as QB for the Kentucky Wildcats?  

So yea.  Overall your points are weak.

Here are the points you should've made (but didn't):

* Bryce is an absolute witch with pre-snap reads and throws anticipation routes with touch, pace, and accuracy on a level far beyond any QB in this draft class.  The kid's a freaking alien.  If he was 4 inches taller and 25-30 lbs heavier, he'd be the best QB prospect...damn, maybe ever. 
   * Which is why I think if the Colts or any other team trade up, he's gone
* Will Levis has the highest boom/bust potential of this year's top QB prospects.  He could be the next Josh Allen or the next Blake Bortles.  The Texans coaching staff will need to improve considerably and put pieces in place to coach this kid up or he likely won't take the next steps.",1.0,texans,t3_10jhgl2,False,0.0,None,2023-01-24T21:08:01Z,texans,0.0157504824267478

Anyway...

Any of these 3 kids will immediately improve the Texans, and while I'd be happy with any of them, I also don't think any of them is ""definitely the guy"".

I also don't think there's nearly as much separation between Levis and the other two as you seem to think.

Here are some things that inform my opinions...

Young and Stroud are the more accomplished, polished passers.  Tough to debate that really.

But maybe Young is a fragile, short, skinny kid whose body ain't up to the rigors of the NFL, especially not as a rookie behind this Texans o-line.

Maybe the same goes for Stroud. Maybe one of Stroud's weaknesses is escapability (not a great weakness to have in today's NFL, and especially not for a rookie Texans QB).

Maybe Stroud has never really faced adversity in his college career. Maybe he'll mope and pout as a rookie on the sidelines when things don't go his way. Maybe he's never had to be a leader cuz he's only ever played on [a team full of stud pro prospects](https://www.dispatch.com/story/sports/college/football/2022/12/21/a-look-at-ohio-states-2023-nfl-draft-class-led-by-cj-stroud/69611322007/). Heck, maybe he just not the kind of guy that the team rallies around or the type of guy who elevates his teammates.

Maybe what we've seen thus far from Young and Stroud is at or near their respective ceilings. And maybe the beatdowns they're sure to get as rookie starters on this Texans team gets in their heads and impedes their growth and progression.

Conversely...

Levis has a prototype NFL QB build with arm strength and toughness to match.

He's a potential run threat with the size and power to run over smaller defenders. He can be used on designed QB runs and is a threat in the redzone.

He has a high IQ and passed up offers from Ivy League schools.

He's an established team leader with proven leadership skills at every level.

He's dealt with a tougher situation (less talent surrounding him) playing at UK, and maybe coming into the Texans situation doesn't faze him to the extent it might faze the other two.

It's possible he's nowhere near his ceiling and just needs the right mentor and coaching to take big leaps forward.

Man, that's not fact, it's opinion lol.  There are many attributes that you're not in a position to compare objectively or with any certainty.  

Things like work ethic.  Leadership.  Character.  Intelligence.  Escapability.  How they handle adversity.  Higher ceiling, etc.

These are important attributes for any young QB entering the NFL, but especially important for any kid getting thrown into the Texans situation.

I don't think the gap between these two kids is as big as you think it is when all attributes are considered.

**Pick 65** - Tank Dell. Hometown hero. Don't care if he's our second WR of the night. Make our WR room 4-5 deep.

**Pick 73** - Luke Wypler -C- We should sign a new center before the draft, but if we don't we desperately need a one. And if we do, never say no to OL depth

1. DeMeco - Hometown hero. Clearly a great motivator, schemes well, and prefers a physical, hard hitting style. Controlling the best defense in the NFL right now. Everyone who has worked with him seemingly would die for him. He doesn't solve out most glaring offseason question - ""how is our next QB going to be positioned to succeed?""- but otherwise the perfect coach for us. With the right style of OC in tow, he would be an A+ hire in my mind. 

2. Steichen - Smart, hungry, effective OC who has proven he can coach up a young QB. 

3. Kafka - Very similar to Steichen, but with both worse talent and worse (but still impressive) results. Both Steichen and Kafka are B+ hires to me. Smart, responsible hires that wouldn't make strong waves with anyone who isn't closely watching the situation. 

4. Payton - Expensive, both in picks and salary. Has nothing to prove, and that's both a compliment and a red flag. The comp that I feel most strongly is Bill Parcells coming out of retirement for another round. And that would be great for us, but not necessarily better than the alternatives, given the cost. He's going to Denver. Better fit there in pretty much every respect. 

5. Gannon - Nothing against him, but this would be a very average hire. I believe he can be an effective head coach, but see no reason why he's best guy for the Houston Texans right now. He neither helps answer the QB development question nor brings any true intangible to the table. A safe, if uninspired choice.

31052,241260,241260,slinkyman98,"If we’re just talking records I think 6-8 wins is a very reasonable goal and a good starting point for the new regime. We have a last place schedule, a fairly weak division, and we get to play the NFC South. 

Division: I think we get 3 wins here, Colts and Titans are in a weird spot. Jags with Trevor Lawrence breaking out and actually having good coaching will be tough.

AFC North: Tough division, we’re not beating the Bengals, we probably aren’t beating the Ravens if Jackson comes back so that leaves Pittsburgh and Cleveland. I think Watson unfortunately comes back to form next year so I’m saying we only get 1 win out of this division.

NFC South: Very weak division probably the worst in football. The Saints and Falcons are decent teams but neither has a QB or a way of getting one. Panthers will probably be decent and the Bucs I think will be terrible with Bowles as coach and Brady gone. I think we get 2 wins maybe even 3 from this division.

Last place schedule is Jets, Cardinals, and Broncos. I think we can beat the Cards especially if we get them earlier in the year, Jets and Broncos will really depend on if they can sort out QB this off-season. I see 1 win coming from this group. 

That comes out to 7 wins so I think 6-8 wins is where we end up.

As for expectations outside of the record I would like to see the following

1. New QB shows promise in his 1st year

2. Progression from the 2022 draft class

3. Evidence of Ryans building a good culture throughout the year

4. Production from the rest of the 2023 draft class besides QB

National media didn’t watch a goddamn game of Texans football these last two years and they just come in with their hot takes and never have to answer for it. Fuck RG3, fuck Stephen A Smith, and fuck every other professional pundit who said that shit. 

Look I don’t blame them for not really paying attention to us, hell a lot of Texans fans didn’t really pay attention this year. But if you’re gonna come at us with racism you should probably take 10 minutes to do your research. 

Let’s start with Culley. No hate on him I’m sure he’s a good guy but it’s very clear he is not NFL head coach material and there were specific reasons he was brought in. He was brought in to steer a ship no one wanted to steer and he was brought in to save our relationship with Watson. He did a fine job tanking and he failed to save things with Watson. If not for the Texans he never ever would have gotten even consideration for a head coaching gig much less the job. He was brought in to do a specific job and he was given a retirement package 99% of people could never dream of to do it. He was fired after 1 year because he was a terrible head coach and we believed we could get a legit candidate. Saying we treated him badly or screwed him over is absolute bullshit. 

Lovie was a little different, we failed at finding a legit candidate and had to panic pivot to someone and he was already in the building. If the national media had taken 5 minutes to look at us they would see that Lovie Smith took over a slightly more talented roster than David Culley and somehow managed to win fewer games than David fuckin Culley. There are also reports that he lost the locker room here as well. By the way Lovie Smith’s career as a head coach was also over if not for us and he also got an insane retirement package to play a role for us. 

This got too long but y’all get the point. We didn’t mistreat anyone, we made mistakes but those mistakes benefited David Culley and Lovie Smith far more than they hurt them.

I keep going back to the mid 2010’s Texans. Some good rosters in there but QB constantly held us back.

And I agree our supporting cast needs work so work on it. We have 10 other picks this year besides the 2nd overall including another first, a second, and two thirds. We also (after cuts and restructures) should end up with about 40-50 mil in effective cap space. Put those resources to use to help your new QB.

Unlike BOB, Sean Peyton had a lot of success with the GM’s he worked with and didn’t seem to have constant power struggles and an overinflated ego like BOB. 

That being said , how much control over team decisions would Sean Payton expect Caserio to give him compared to any of the other HC Candidiates we’re interviewing?
