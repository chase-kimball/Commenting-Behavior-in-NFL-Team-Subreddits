I don't pay a ton of attention to those kinds of reports, but I definitely noticed during the Bears game the team looked so disinterested with Trey. I remember thinking watching that game live that he was on the ground all game and nobody was picking him up. It literally reminded me of the Any Given Sunday scene when Jamie Foxx loses his helmet in the rain and one of his teammates kicks it away from him. Obviously it wasn't quite that bad, but a stark contrast to anytime Jimmy or Brock go down. Usually a lineman or three are running over to pick those two up. 

Nothing from his interviews screams primadonna, but I can see how they'd feel a certain way about him. He didn't seem prepared. I doubt he was running plays as designed, and was relying too much on making something happen with his legs, which even when he succeeded he still seemed to get the cold shoulder. It's got to be frustrating when you've put in the work and you're doing your job and your QB is just playing backyard ball. Especially when the offense is predicated on precision.

They were one of the only teams to win a Superbowl without a single digit ranking on either side of the ball. You are right, though, Giants were worse in 2007, being 15 and 16 on offense and defense respectively (the only other team to not have a single digit ranking). That team was arguably worse than 2012 Ravens, but their defense was severely underrated in 2007. Given how badly they manhandled what was considered the best offense in league history, I think they overcame a weaker regular season performance to finish as one of the premier defenses in the league. In 2011 the Giants were 9th in offense and 24th in defense, which was another great opportunity for us but again, it's about when you get hot. 

The Patriots were never outside of the top 10 in at least one category in each of their SB wins. Their ""worst"" team was probably in 2001 when they were 7th on offense and 6th on defense, and probably their second worst was in 2003 when they were ranked 16th on offense, but they were still first in defense.

The only QB's to overcome not having a top 10 defense were Elway, Brees, and both Mannings. So we'll want to keep our defense intact, unless we hope to get Arch in a few years /s.

.

> Are touchdowns more your thing? Only Deshaun Watson had a better TD rate in his rookie season (9.3 percent vs. 7.6 percent for Purdy), and Hall of Famer Dan Marino checks in at a distant third (6.8 percent). 

.

> Perhaps you prefer a measure of overall efficiency? Purdy‚Äôs passer rating of 107.3 is the best ever for a rookie with 50 or more pass attempts. Or maybe you don‚Äôt like raw passer rating (I can‚Äôt really fault you).

Extending this, of our remaining 4 seasons, we had 2 seasons going 8-8 (2010 and 2014), and then just two seasons (very early in the century too, 2001 and 2002) where we had a winning record but did not make the championship game (lost in WC and Divisional). In particular this means that in the last 20 years, every time the Niners have achieved a winning record, they have made it to the championship game round.

Allow me to kindly explain why the 49ers were screwed this game by the refs. And this isn't to say the following:

1. That the QB injuries for us weren't caused by bad reffing, nor were they caused by the Eagles playing dirty, they weren't. 

2. That this in no way means we should have won. 

With that out of the way....

The game as it stands now is 28-7, clearly a blow out. Well let's see how many points should not exist. 

1. The first TD of the game, see this [link](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35553370/nfl-playoff-officiating-decisions-happened-controversial-calls-wrong-next-super-bowl). Called correctly 49ers force a turnover on downs, setup offense at the 40. Game is tied 0-0. 

So that would correct the score to 21-7. 

1. The roughing the punter call that kept the drive alive. Mason was pushed into the punter. Sorry, that's not a penaron Mason.

 Take out that TD, correct the score to 14-7.

A sport like football generates the most revenue out of all sports in the country, so that means only world-class talents are the ones who can rise to the top when any boy in any neighborhood in the country can play in their respective leagues and rise up if they're good enough. And if you're good enough, poverty is not a barrier to entry.


Tennis courts, swimming pools, skiing/snowboarding, golf, etc., is not accessible to the masses. There's entire neighborhoods, communities, and states where playing the sport isn't even possible for lower income people. So you'd only have a smaller preselected group who could even qualify in the first place doing that sport.



It would be impressive to be something like the best at equestrian, the best at archery, the best at figure skating, etc. But to then label those people the best *athletes*? That's something else.

10841,78990,78990,HawkofDarkness,"Excellent question.

I would think it's the scheme except the injury situation is not QB specific, and Shanahan's other teams as OC (the Falcons, Browns, Washington aside from the RG3 situation) didn't suffer the same level of injuries. It's only when he came here that it started to become a thing.


In truth, we've been talking about the injury situation *for a decade*. Here is an article going over this issue: https://www.knbr.com/2022/10/16/the-49ers-decade-long-injury-woes-defy-explanation/


For the QB position specifically there hasn't been one starting QB that hasn't suffered a season ending injury since 2012. Alex Smith, Colin Kaepernick, Blaine Gabbert, Brian Hoyer, CJ Beathard, Jimmy G, Nick Mullens, Trey Lance, Brock Purdy, all have received devastating injuries once or multiple times which have taken them out, with Smith being the least severe (serious concussion which kept him in the protocol and allowed Kap to assume control of the team).


This all under multiple coaches and regimes.


The injuries outside of the QB have even been more numerous and we've talked about that issue for years. The only common denominator with everything is that all of this only started happening once we moved to Levi's stadium, since previous to that we didn't have these types of injury issues. Remember that 2014 season where half the Niners team were lost for the season due to injuries or retired, which was wildly considered the craziest off-season for a team of all time? Happened when we moved to Levi's.


I wrote 5 years ago that Levi's stadium was cursed citing numerous examples of these injuries over the years and people laughed at: https://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/7g7igj/its_time_to_understand_and_acknowledge_this_levis/

And how exactly does Deebo not get credit for that play again? He does get the credit, as a receiver.


So tell me, is the touchdown only legitimate for the quarterback if they throw it in the end zone? At what level does the quarterback get credited for throwing the ball?

Saying that he's not as good as his stats is an opinion, not an objective truth. Very strange you don't understand that.


>Not even worth addressing here, I guess an 80 yard touchdown pass dropped 55 yards on a rope through two defenders is the same throw as a dump off falling backwards to a HB for an 80 yard touchdown? I don't understand how you can sit here and say all stats are created equal.


Definition of strawman and another thing I didn't say or argue. Point to where I said any of that.

Seems like a go-to move for you is to immediately strawman an argument and hope someone doesn't figure it out.


>Brady and Warner both played better than the information teams had on them in college, yes. Same with Purdy.


But I'm only using your logic. Your argument has been that tape itself is objective.


How is it that right now I can find videos right now on YouTube where some scouts say that a prospect will be a bust while another is a hidden gem **from the same tape**?


That's my entire point. You're saying that this analysation of the tape is somehow the objective truth of how good a player was but you're refusing to acknowledge that people have different ideas and opinions on the same material. 


Very strange how you can't get that simple concept through your head. 


This part is also strange:

Except that I never mentioned ever that it needed to be malicious since that's just another strawman you're putting in. A ""put-down"" doesn't need to be malicious. The definition is literally in the name: it's ""putting down"" or ""downplaying"" someone's accomplishments. You can put down someone without it being malicious. You can just simply be ignorant or wrong.


>They are pointing to factual things that happened in game and saying that while he played pretty well, his stats are not as good as the performance. It's literally an objective analysis. It's what PFF does as well, do you complain about them? 

But his stats **are** good as his performance states because those are his stats. He accomplished those stats. He wasn't bailed out by another player, nor did he have anyone else perform them.

And to say that his performance wasn't as good as his stats would indicate there's a baseline relative to other quarterbacks here. So his stats are not legitimate but other QBs are?

The fact that you mention PFF is funny because they have issues since they're not transparent with their methodology and there's **numerous** complaints about them on a number of forums, including here.

""The tape"" - no I'm talking about the analysation which you clearly skipped.

There is no objective analysation of ""the tape"". You're taking one person's viewpoint and making it out to be objective truth.

No season ticket holder is selling their tickets to this game for a net loss. If they didn‚Äôt want the tickets they could have opted out directly with the team this weekend instead of opting in and selling them to you and losing $300+. I‚Äôve personally bought seats in the club section in the past for random regular season games for around that price before also but I‚Äôm telling you that if you think you are going to get great seats for this game at that price it‚Äôs not happening dude.

I think we'll be able to sign Moseley cheap due to his injury this year. A 1 year loaded with incentives.  

Assuming Brock Purdy will be good to go 100% healthy for training camp, JimmyG walks. If purdy needs surgery and will miss time into next season... We might try to 1 yr JimmyG again.  

I think we re-sign Glinch. He's a beast of a run-blocker. I know his a liability in pass protection, but we run the ball. He won't be in high-demand so I think we can get him for a reasonable price too.  

I'd love to see us keep Jauan Jennings, but he's a really talented guy that I think can pick up really good WR2 money on another team. His stats aren't there, but the talent clearly is. Crazy good hands especially on contested catches. He is crazy clutch on 3rd down. Outstanding run-blocker. I think he'll be able to get a nice contract elsewhere that we can't compete with.  But, can't we just offer him a tender that he either takes or sits the year out? I can't remember how that stuff works. He's complicated I guess.

Robbie is a wild card. Last time his contract was up, he talked a lot about going back to Chicago. I could also see him retiring. My gut tells me he will want more money to stay than we'll be able to give him.  

I know he's not on this list, but I can see a world where Trent Williams hangs it up this offseason. He is still at the top of his game, but call it a sneaking suspicion for me.   

I feel like we lose Azeez to a big payday from another team. The guy is good enough to be THE guy on some other teams in this league.  

We sign Gipson to a new deal with Ward walking. We don't have to pay him Ward money, but he's solid in that spot.

Kroft walks. Dwelley gets a new contract.    

We probably offer deals to most of the D-linemen, but nothing big, they might do better elsewhere.

16876,122426,122426,Nickppapagiorgio,"Home and away is also rotational, and extends in perpetuity. For the regularly scheduled games, it is the opposite of what occured 3 years prior. The Vikings get home games against Atlanta and Tampa Bay next season, because they had road games against them in 2020. 

For the 2 remaining games against NFC opponents that aren't regularly scheduled, home and away is also rotational. The NFC North and NFC West have an Away, Away, Home, Home rotation. For example in 2019 and 2020, every NFC West team hosted an NFC North opponent. In 2021 the 2 divisions just played each other. In 2022 and 2023, every NFC North team will host an NFC West opponent. In 2024 the two divisions will just play each other again. In 2025 and 2026, NFC North teams will have to go back out on the road both years to play an NFC West team. And so on and so forth.

Since this rotation has been around since 2002, it's been known for 20 years that an NFC West team would travel to Minnesota in 2023. That NFC West team became the 49ers when both teams won their divisions in 2022.

The rotation you have with each division is slightly different. One division will always be home, Home, Away, Away. One division will always be Home, Away, Away, Home. One division will always be Away, Home, Home, Away. Which rotation you have with which division dates back to what was set at the 2002 realignment. The NFC North's rotation with the NFC West specific I'd the Home, Home, Away, Away. They have the other 2 rotations with the other 2 divisions.

With this setup, you can never play the same team at home in the regular season more than 3 years in a row. 3 years in a row would only happen if you caught them on both years for the irregular game where your division was hosting, as well as a regularly scheduled home game in addition.

More broadly speaking, sports gambling, like poker, is a category where a professional gambling class can exist, because at its heart the gamblers are competing against each other, and the casino is just taking a cut. With poker this is more directly visible with the raking of the pot, with sports gambling, it's more indirect with lines set and adjusted based on how much money is coming to each side. You may make money by recognizing when your fellow gamblers are doing something wrong, then exploiting it.

What makes sports gambling difficult to be profitable at is overcoming the vigorish which is the casino's cut of the proceeds. It's not enough to be better than your fellow gamblers, you have to be quite a bit better. To use point spread bets as an example, as they're typically set at -110 on both sides, you should win 50% of the time. However to break even you must win 52.4%  of the time. To actually turn a decent profit you need to be in the 54 to 57% range. A good handicapper can get to 52% and lose money. Only a few can consistently get 55%.

It‚Äôs a mob scene folks! 

The Eagles fans are drunker and stupider then ever. Hard to believe but, they‚Äôve somehow managed it.

The city is in fact sold out of beer and citizens are resorting to drinking rubbing alcohol and occasionally water by accident.

Cars are on fire, lamp posts are down and the city streets are pure bedlam. They‚Äôve burned down the local sports bars and taken to looting Costco. 

The local library, long forgotten and ignored remains safe as does the employment office.

A personal pet peeve of mine is the fan boys covering their base model Dodge Ram  4x2 pickups with ‚ÄúChiefs - Super Bowl Champions‚Äù 

Only 83 more payments and that Dodge Warlock is all yours!

And the final straw for me is the Midwest fans (who don‚Äôt live in KC) adopting the Chiefs and wearing their Chiefs hoodys from Scheels this week.

Mf‚Äôer, you didn‚Äôt like the chiefs when they were losing?!?!?? But you LOVE them now?

It‚Äôs just like when the cringe Bay Area traitors adopted Seattle when they won (their only) Super Bowl. 

I hope the best team lose - but let‚Äôs be honest‚Ä¶

The NFL is crooked AF!!!

The chiefs got a do over and the NFL intentionally hid the dropped ball/‚Äúcompletion‚Äù in the NFC game.

Roger Goodell is a crook and this is all about $ports betting at this point

* The first one is straight forward.  He doesn't believe QB runs are a straight up solution to create rushing yards.  This is accurate.  If Trey is running it 6 times a game at 5 YPC, that 30 yards isn't significantly altering the team rushing total.  Trey would have to be running it 10-12 times a game for their to be a large enough volume of rushing yards from the QB to be impactful on the team total rushing yards.

* The third quote very specifically says *""when you are a threat to run, even though you don't have to do it every time.""*  
This is it spot on.  He wants the *threat* of the QB run, without the need for 12 QB runs a game.

Shanahan has an incredible track record in the media of saying things publicly and actually putting into practice the things he is saying.  The only things he's been sketchy on is injury reports.  Outside of that most of the things he said, he put into practice.  


>Did you watch Trey College days?  
>...Does trey has accurate throws like Allen?

Trey was incredibly accurate in college.  You might question the openness of the WRs or the talent of the other defense, but you can't actually argue he was inaccurate in college.  

Josh Allen came into the NFL with major accuracy concerns.  They aren't the same college prospect, but they are very similar NFL prospects if you look at Lance now and Allen in year 2.  Through his first two NFL seasons Josh Allen completed a mere 56.2% of his passes and 65.2% from year 3 and beyond.  

>He uses his athleticism to evade and sometimes ram into opponents. If he slips thru, he has speed! Who the fck does that remind you of? Fckin Lamar Jackson bro! Stop playin!

That does not remind me of of Lamar Jackson.  Jackson isn't a barrel into opposing players type of runner.  He's also so much faster than either of them.  

Josh Allen doesn't avoid contact like Lamar.  A lot of his runs are closer to defenders than Lamar's juking style.  He uses his size, moderate speed, and physicality to gain yards on the ground.  This is probably the closest running comp to Trey Lance's reckless abandon.

No.  He is not anywhere close to the runner that Lamar is.  I could have said the other comp, but I thought that was too easy (and all upside).

* ""How a guy executes his own offense""

* ""Figure(ing) out what plays they're (the defense) doing""

When asked about his decision to select Trey Lance for the the very first time, Kyle Shanahan offered 10 points about Trey's mental ability to handle the quarterback position before even bringing up his physical gifts.

I don't believe the narrative that he wants Trey to be Lamar.  
I believe the situations Trey found him in dictated more running than Shanahan would have liked.  

* The Arizona start, Trey was only declared the starter late on a Friday.  He had no time to learn a gameplan or work with the starters (Kittle not among them, because he was inactive).  He only had limited pieces of the playbook that could be used.  His only weapons were Deebo, who dropped 22% of his passes in that game, an Aiyuk who still wasn't getting separation from defenders (and in Shanahan's doghouse), and Mitchell only had 9 carries.  
That situation dictated Trey running the ball more than passing it.  
* The Chicago game, half of his runs came after the defense blew the lead and he was forced to lead a comeback in weather that was not pass friendly.  If he hadn't been forced to lead a comeback He probably would have only finished with 6-8 runs.  
* Just like he only had 8 at Houston.  
* And likely would have finished close to that number against Seattle, where Shanahan even admitted the gameplan wasn't to run Trey all day, but to do it a couple times to force Seattle to adjust to it, opening other areas of the field.  

I think Shanahan always viewed Trey Lance as a mold of Dak Prescott's field general (the pre-2022 version) with Kyler Murray's legs, who has averaged 6.9 Rush Att/Gm.",2.0,49ers,t3_10zheko,False,1.0,:jerseyaway11: Alex Smith,2023-02-11T10:02:17Z,49ers,0.0005132443525919

On multiple occasions where the Chicago offense was about to walk off the field after a 3rd down the defense committed stupid penalties that gave them a free first down an extended the drive.

>He scored 10 points

In the mud bowl Jimmy Garoppolo led the offense to 6 points in 59 minutes.  

Trey Lance also isn't supposed to be the entire offense.  Elijah Mitchell got hurt in the second quarter.  Jeff Wilson came in and was horrible 9-22-2.4 YPC.  Deebo, who only got 2 carries in the second half, also fumbled away a redzone possession earlier in the game.  George Kittle didn't do anything either... because yet again he wasn't healthy for a Trey Lance start.  

Trey was 8/13, 62%, 121 yds,  9.3 YPA, 92.2 Rating before the defense blew the lead.  If the defense doesn't give up those scores, the 49ers have the lead, and Trey Lance isn't throwing the ball one more time in the 4th quarter (like how Fields didn't).

They aren't merely simulating games in all these throws, they are specifically working through a number of different things.  

Counting training camp stats is worse than counting spring training stats for a pitcher learning a new pitch.

You are trying to imply those are two are identical situations when they aren't.  

* Nothing about the preparation for those games is the same.

    * Arizona was on the road, against the #1 defense in the NFL at the time.

        * B.Aiyuk still had troubles separating & was in the doghouse.                          
        * Mitchell was the starting RB, but that position was still highly inconsistent.  
        * Mitchell only ran the ball 9 times in that game.  
        * Kittle was not available for that game.
        * Leaving Lance with no security blankets and only 1 good target.  That one good target (Deebo) dropped 2 of 9 targets (22.2%)         
    * wk 14 vs TB
        * Purdy had an incredibly safe and reliable security blanket in G.Kittle.

23184,160963,160963,SoKrat3s,"you're last point is true, but all injuries happened in different manners.  

Jimmy's first ACL tear was from a scramble down the field, he tried to turn upfield for more yards, stuck his foot in the ground to pivot, and tore his ACL.  That has nothing to do with scheme.  

His initial high ankle sprain in 2020 occurred when a Jets defender fell on the back of his foot.  He simply reinjured it later in the season.  Not really scheme related.  

In 2021 his thumb got jammed up in a passing attempt (similar to R.Wilson).  Nothing extremely unusual about that play or hit.  

In 2022 the Dolphins did have a free rusher off the left side.  But Jimmy saw him.  Jimmy refused to throw the ball away or take the sack.  Instead, with the defender already in his face trying to tackle him, he makes a really confusing attempt to run for it, and gets tackled from behind.  

One of his biggest problems that nobody talks about his his refusal to throw the ball away.  While the 49ers haven't been sack leaders, Jimmy G still takes more hits than he should because he refuses to throw it away.  

The Trey Lance injury isn't a scheme issue.  Trey looked right at the two defenders and chose not to slide.  His belief that he can just truck every defender out there is what caused his injury.

>They refuse to acknowledge that scheme played any part in any of the 4 QB injuries they had this year.

* Trey Lance made the decision to keep the ball and run.  He looked straight at two defenders and decided not to slide.  Are mobile QBs more prone to injury?  Sure.  Nobody disputes that.  But Allen, Hurts, & Jackson all run nearly the exact same play Lance got hurt on.  
* Jimmy Garoppolo had a defender in his face and decided with his complete lack of mobility that running for it was better than stepping up into the pocket or just taking the sack.  He also could have thrown the ball away, but if you actually knew anything about him you would know he refuses to do that.  He has just 22 throwaways in 1561 dropbacks since 2018. 
* Scheme didn't force Purdy to hold onto the ball on the play he got hurt on.  He's actually admitted himself that he should have released it sooner.  You also have ""experts"" at the ringer who attack Shanahan, completely ignorant to the situation that the ""backup TE"" is actually a pass blocking specialist.  Just because someone isn't out there catching 100 passes a year that doesn't mean they aren't normally a proficient blocker.  The scheme was for the pass-blocking specialist to give just a small window, and there is a small window to throw on that play.  And nearly every team in the league has 2 TE sets where the better pass catcher isn't the primary blocking TE.  So again, that isn't scheme.
* There wasn't anything wrong with the scheme on the play Johnson got hurt on.  The RG (Burford) & RT (McGlinchey) both had 1-on-1 blocks.  Burford just gets beat by his man 1-on-1.  That happens sometimes.  It wasn't poor scheme.  It was a great pass rush win for Suh.  

You say all this but it just displays a really poor knowledge of what actually happened on these plays.  Not knowing the 49ers players I get.  But not knowing Suh just happened to win a 1-on-1 battle with the RG, that's inexcusable.  

>and his chief critique all year that he holds the ball too long 

lol.  His chief critique is not holding the ball too long.  His average TTT was 2.84s, 25th/40, or close to league average and a half second quicker than the league MVP.  

If anything, his biggest critique is getting a bit lucky on some of the potential interceptions that were dropped (along with the normal being an inexperienced rookie stuff).

No, I'm not using the benchmark.  I'm saying it's the only game in the sample size.  An obviously incomplete sample size.  

There simply isn't enough of a sample to come to any grand conclusions about Trey Lance.  
And he was still the youngest QB in the NFL to attempt a pass through week 17 of the NFL season (S.Howell surpassed him at this mark in week 18).  

>But overall it just wasn't a good offensive performance against a Texans team that had completely checked out for the season.

Had they checked out the week before, when they beat the Chargers?  A loss that would lead to LA missing the playoffs?  

>Purdy looked better than Lance in every start

This is the problem with fans like you, you can't lift one player up without trashing the other.  You can talk about how great Brock was, without trashing Lance.  

Purdy also has 6 starts (+ 2 complete playoff games) to the above sample size of 1 game for Trey Lance.  
All of that occurred with nearly every weapon at his disposal.  

Kittle has been unavailable for more than half the time Trey has been under center.  That Houston game is the only passable weather game he's had with the version of Aiyuk that was good at separation (he was terrible, in the doghouse in the first half of '21).  In all three of his starts he's only gotten an average of 12 Att/Gm from E.Mitchell.  Meaning all the run game came from mediocre to poor backup RBs.  And he's never played a single snap with CMC.  
So it isn't as simple as saying ""what Brock did"" vs ""what Trey did.""

I do not *think* Lance deserves to be starter right now. Nor do I *think* Brock isnt a great QB, cause he is. And I dont think we need to get back some value for what we paid, literally dont care. 

However, or if, and its a BIG IF - Lance improves his throwing mechanics/quickness/reads, he would 100% be a better QB than Purdy. 

As it stands, Lance *still* has the higher ceiling, but Brocks floor is a skyscrapers length above Lance's. At the end of the day, Lance still has the arm, and he might not be as shifty/slippery as Brock, but he still has enough mobility to matter. 

Alternatively, in theory, Brock can improve his throwing mechanics to have a better deep ball, weve seen this happen with Tua. 

That being said, if Brock is the starter after the inevitable QB battle, im more than happy with that, I really like Brock, but he has a physical cap to his ceiling, and to be fair, Brady and Manning did too, but they both had effective deep balls in their arsenal. Right now, I view Purdys ceiling as a much more mobile Drew Brees, because his greatest strength is his processing/decision making.

If we want to go by the stats, why do we completely fail to mention that he had a 83 QBR that season? That is a higher QBR than Aaron Rodgers (74) the year he won MVP 2021. Lamar had a higher passer rating as well with 113.3 to Aarons 111.9. 

We have both already established that Lamar clearly doesnt have many weapons either.

The year is 2023, we have ascended from the ability to play QB solely from arm talent, it is far more complex than that now with RPOs, read options, and sheer improvising talent. 

As for Roman, pick one only a few yards from the goal line:

Yes, the throw to Diggs shouldve been a pick, and him dropping it is the only reason Purdy didnt have any turnovers.

On offense, DK Metcalf is better than CD Lamb and Kenneth Walker is better than both Dallas RBs. Our defense **should** have an OK day against them (I won't say easier because it's the playoffs). 

Defensively Parsons is a problem and he'll get some stops. VanderEsch is playing hurt and Kearse might not play at all. Injuries not withstanding I like our chances because Kyle and Demeco have neutralized better defenses before: First Miami this season. They did it on the fly too after Jimmy got hurt and McDaniel brought the house at Brock. And not to bring back bad memories but Kyle neutralized KC in the super bowl for 3 quarters until a certain CB got a PI flag, a certain QB overthrew or didn't see a wide open Kittle and the refs forgot their flags when KC held Bosa. Purdy sees the open guy more often than not. He had one hiccup against Seattle iirc, didn't see wide open Deebo, but the man knows how to play the position. There's not much tape on him either.

This is not a knock on Aiyuk.  Quiet the contrary, I‚Äôm explaining his remotely decent reason for quitting, and why he never will again.

A Vast majority of passing plays have some form of a clear out route.  [Here is a prime example, where it is read ‚Äúnumber one‚Äù.](https://imgur.com/gallery/xNpuvt3)  It‚Äôs goal is to **clear out**  defenders and make room for other routes.  It‚Äôs the first read because the QB should look there first to move the safeties toward it (but if it‚Äôs open - let it rip). Often times its primary goal is only to get rid of defenders.  In both example, it's to make room for the crosser.  It‚Äôs an extremely common technique that works well - Deebo was wide open.

The problem is, since it's essentially a distraction, many QBs overlook it, and many receivers don't commit to it.  (Randy Moss was famously guilty of this before joining the Patriots).   Jimmy NEVER looked at it.  That's why so often you'd see a WR running straight down field alone with his hand up.  The defenders gave up on the clear outs because Jimmy only threw short.  Aiyuk got accustomed to never getting the ball when he ran a clear out.  That‚Äôs why Aiyuk gave up here.

But for the last five games, and this play in particular, Aiyuk has learned that Purdy reads the entire field, that Purdy genuinely runs through the full progression of pass routes, and that Purdy is better at finding the open man then Jimmy.  In the Aiyuk give up play, Purdy actually checked his deep clear out, checked the crosser - which triggers the safety to come down, so Purdy goes back to the deep clear out.  That‚Äôs amazing.  That‚Äôs him going to the first read, to the second read, **then back to the first read,** on his own violation.  That's elite quarterbacking.  And Aiyuk will learn his lesson - never give up on a route when Purdy is still standing.

This is also why I‚Äôm sick and tired of talking head ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù shouting how ""Kyle calls aggressive plays because he trusts Purdy so much more than Jimmy.""   Horseshit.  They got the same plays, but Jimmy NEVER looked to throw the clear out.  In the Aiyuk give up play, Jimmy would have never taken his eyes off of the crossing Deebo.  It‚Äôs not different play calling.  It‚Äôs simply Purdy doing more with the same plays.",126.0,49ers,t3_10g6nou,False,0.0,:jerseyaway08: Steve Young,2023-01-19T16:47:09Z,49ers,0.0078076909802519

31117,208778,208778,bhfroh,"here's a better example:

A few years back, in the Harbaugh days, the 49ers played against the Saints. We sacked Brees, forcing a fumble that we recovered and would have ended the game. Our guy hit him in the chest with his facemask. It was a textbook tackle. Instead he got flagged for RTP, put the Saints into FG range, and they kicked the game winning FG. Had that flag not been thrown, the 49ers would have won the number 1 seed by way of tiebreaker with Seattle. Instead, we were the 5th seed. League officials backed up the refs instead of holding them accountable even though the footage is as plain as day.

This is what Joey is talking about when he says there's no accountability. The league can NOT admit that their officiating is sus because it would call into question the legitimacy of the sport. And with more and more people starting to feel it's looking more and more rigged, the last thing they wanna do is confirm those conspiracies.

Me, personally? I think the referees officiate with a heavy bias towards making the NFL look good. They make calls that would favor the higher scoring teams that have weekly highlight reel players. So that when the refs next CBA comes up, they can go to the league with: See, we could have called 3 or 4 guys on that Mahomes touchdown for offensive holding, but you see the highlight reel viewership, jersey sales, ticket sales, and other league revenue skyrocket because of that? Yeah, you need us to be subjective. This is why the NFL won't put a skyjudge in every game. Why highlight reels never show BS calls that result in huge momentum swings.

Check this quote from Crabtree on that type of play, namely the SB corner fade on last play:

 * ""Crabtree appeared to have a mature response, but he didn‚Äôt stop there. Crabtree decided to say what he believed would have helped get the call ‚Äî a better throw from his quarterback. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even want to say this, but if the ball had been a little lower, giving me a chance to make a play, I‚Äôm sure they would‚Äôve called it,‚Äù Crabtree said.""

Kaep has no skills as a pocket QB and we saw how that affected our passing game in that era. In passing situations during Kaep's reign at QB, more often than not, it was the crudest of pocket skills exhibited by Kaep. The coaches have to take the blame for having Geep Chryst as his QB coach and the power run cult, with 0 emphasis during those three/four years on working on the craft of quarterbacking.

And passing on Mahomes by Lynch/Shanahan is still a huge ding in my book. Although, only Reid and Payton actually attended his workout. But, if they had decided to build on offense first in 2017, would Kyle have attended Mahomes workout? Or would they have zeroed in on Watson?

it never ends...the speculation. But I have lived it and am none too happy with that stupid play call yesterday @7:03 1Q.

just off the cuff:

 * The reporting on cap limit for 2023 is a huge increase
 * Purdy is going to miss most of the offseason
 * Lance is hot garbage as a Pocket QB and raw, way too raw overall as a football player
 * We have the money + a much higher cap ceiling
 * We have an offensive system good enough to win any game, any type of matchup
 * We have a top tier defense (and if Ryans leaves and we need to go outside, acquiring Brady or be working towards that could increase our odds of landing a good DC)
 * Brady literally was born and raised just down the freeway from the stick and 30 miles from Levi's
 * We already met once with him after the 2020 season, flirted, discussed schemes, philosophy
 * If we get Brady, you can bet your ass McGlinchey [is gone, which would be a two-4-one](https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-22-at-8.12.19-PM.png?w=1000&h=600&crop=1)
 * Tom Brady has thrown for over 100,000 yards in his career and is still a top 10 QB, an exquisite and seasoned professional football player.
 * As Purdy has shown, Kyle needs a ""smart"", yet intellectually austere forward passer to run his offense.


Other than Kyle we have an offensive coaching staff who is learning their roles, figuring out how to be designers, installers, teachers.

Cut ups of Purdy from college, who is chewing those up this week? Quinn's background is D line coach, he's a well rounded D coach (seems to subscribe to position-less models for Defense) but his roots lay there, in the trenches. cliched, but this game will be won in the trenches. If our line plays a little better than last year's game, I like us turning three drives into 21 points, not settling for nine.

""What are your thoughts about the game last year""

We won, but any advantage the Cowboys gained was as a result of self inflicted mistakes by our 49ers.

 * ""false-start penalty that would have iced it on a QB sneak and gave the Cowboys their last shot""

I remember that, but the game was only close because of earlier, self inflicted mistakes. If I remember the facts from that 1st half, we left 12 points on the board. And we only scored once in the second half. fuck this shit, we're going to win this playoff game with offense and while each NFL team is different each year, these cores are pretty much the same on both sides of ball, both teams. We have more weapons than last year and more experience than last year, and a will to win that is emergent (where last year, we made plays, but it was hard to measure).

First Purdy only played 1 series so you can even judge that. Second is that injury combined with a few blunders from ahanny is what beat us not the eagles lol

The first TD was the result of a missed call and no challenge. When Philly finally did get a legit TD it put pressure on shanny  with having his 4th string QB in and trialing due to a bad call and shanny messed up trying to put JJ in a 2 minute drill which gifted the eagles 7 more points.

If the refs got the bogus 4th down call right or we challenge it then we probably aren't as aggressive to get Purdy hurt but even if he did we wouldn't have put JJ in the 2 minute warning in a tied game getting the ball after half. So we should have went to half with the score 7-7 with us getting the ball on the road with a hurt QB. Philly was extremely fortunate to be up 21-7 at half.

36596,242749,242749,gotdemmadsquirtsyo,"Yeah things happen every playoff game for jimmy lmfao, you guys are silly.

Yeah rams gifted jimmy the pass. That's why that's jimmys playoff game with his highest passing yards and TDs despite having a negative last 12:30. For the first 47:30 it statistically blew every other playoffs game first 47:30 out the window. Then it went completely the other way. That's because they stepped up the intensity in the 4th quarter. Yes teams who ate losing in the 4th quarter try harder. I rewatched the game 2 months ago and you can clearly see the Rams intensity ramp up.

Problem is with the Rams gifting jimmy the pass he needed to not be on pace for just 300 yards. Having the passing advantage jimmy needed to be on pace for 400 yards. We needed jimmy to force the rams to give up selling out to stop the run and jimmy couldn't do that. Once the 4th quarter came and we still couldn't run the ball and the Rams were willing to empty the tank in the 4th jimmy couldn't handle the heat the Rams were bringing. 

Jimmy 100% failed the running game. We had weapons and they were gifting jimmy the pass and he ended up with 232 yards. I get it 232 yards is a career playoff high for jimmy, a landmark game for jimmy but that's why he just isn't good.

If you have had excellent coaching and have years of experience on winning teams and in the playoffs you are averaging 160 yards passing and 50% more INTs to TDs for you playoff career it proves you just aren't very talented. I can post a ton of examples of average at best QBs that have played far better for their playoff career than Jimmy. How many great QBs that have 5 or more playoff starts have played worse than jimmy? Jimmy is exactly what his playoff stats show. Jimmy exactly who the eye test shows. Jimmy is exactly who nobody wanted last off season. At this point I'm not even sure youve even watched jimmy play football, my guess you just seen pictures in magazines and are attracted to jimmy.

Think about it relative to lower body injuries - people tear their ACL and have careers post surgery, and that ligament takes the massive amount of force needed to change direction at speed. The UCL in football is taking far less force than a pitcher ever places on it, and it‚Äôs not something that will be reinjured in normal QB play.

Our strength is YAC; it's time to get physical and make their secondary hurt every time they try bringing our guys down.

My only major concern is the Dallas pass rush. From last game, 1) don't leave Parsons unblocked. That was stupid of the Bucs.

On defense: pass rush has to play HARD. Against a weak Seattle OL, Omenihu and a few other guys did well, but Bosa didn't even make the stat sheet. I know that's never the whole story, and they actively scheme against Bosa, so I'm not super scared or anything.

41166,291260,291260,r1kng,"My 3 Keys to Victory


1.  Win the Time of Possession

In the Eagles loss to the Commanders, they were at one point in the game quadrupled in TOP, ultimately losing 40:19. If the Niners can control the clock, hit some key 3rd downs and most importantly keep Hurts and company off the field it‚Äôll be the Niners best chance.


2.  Win the Turnover battle 

The 49ers led the regular season in INTS and Turnover differential at +13. If the Niners can force some early turnovers and capitalize on points (TDs not FGs) it‚Äôll be huge. In WK10 vs the Commanders, the Eagles lost the Turnover margin 2:4


3.  Win in the Trenches

The Eagles arguably have the best OLINE in football with Two All Pros in Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson. We all know how good our run defense has been all year but this easily will be our toughest task to date. 


On the opposite side of the ball, the Eagles allow the 17th most yds per game vs the run (maybe their lone ‚Äúweakness‚Äù if there is one) I bring up WK10 again bcus this is a game they did lose (however, before they went out and signed guys like Suh/Linval) and even tho they only allowed 3.1 YPC the Commanders as a team rushed for over 150+ on the ground ‚Äî something I believe the Niners can have success with albeit a healthy CMC


On paper the Eagles boast a rising star at QB, four guys who have double digit sacks + Fletcher Cox, two 1K WRs and the stingiest pass defense in the league. All that to say, I still believe we have the pieces capable of beating them. Should be a good one Sunday!
