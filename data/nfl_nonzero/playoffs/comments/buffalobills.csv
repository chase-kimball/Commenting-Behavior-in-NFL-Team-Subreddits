That's part of why the season ending is so frustrating is because you play so much regular season and then all it determines is seeding but after that it literally doesn't matter how well you did in the regular season, there's no winners and losers brackets or best-of-3 or anything like that.

Lets be honest here, the only good proven WR on this team is Stefon Diggs. He isn't wrong of guys off the street playing snaps, Beasley should've stayed retired, and Brown has a play once in a while but other than that doesn't contribute much.

Gabe Davis is an average at very best vertical threat WR who has a heavy drop rate, McKenzie is only good enough for a gadget role and occasionally a short screen pass or something. Shakir unproven since they barely play him but looks great when he does in limited action. and Kumerow when not injured is really only a ST guy.

WR is a sneaky big need for this team in the off-season, we need to drastically improve behind Stefon Diggs. WR and OL needs to be Beanes biggest focus's this off-season.

Apart from that large loophole, one of the most insidious aspects of online sports gambling specifically is how easy it is to hide, and therefore do a massive amount of damage before it's discovered (or the person asks for help on their own). No one would bat an eye if a young guy watched a lot of sports (on TV or phone), or spent a lot of time discussing sports with friends or online, etc. You can make the bets from your sofa/bed/toilet, without even going to a bookie or lottery kiosk. A friend or loved one would likely notice soon enough if you were hung over every morning, passed out on hard drugs half the time, making multiple large purchases each day, going to card games 3x a week, or desperately chasing anonymous sex at every opportunity; however, if you have separate finances, even your significant other might not notice a problem with online betting until you've dug a massive financial hole for yourself.

Even the halftime commentary (TSN) is sponsored by an online betting company, and half of the ""analysis"" has degenerated into insipid talk of over/under, parlays, odds, spreads, etc.

Although I'm usually fine with letting people have their vices, and wary of sounding like I'm clutching pearls, I think it's shitty that this is being normalized as part of watching sports for young people, particularly since most of the people who develop gambling addictions are young men.  It's like watching a social ill unfold in real time.

9595,55973,55973,EagleRoxy2,"Ok so I will admit I haven‚Äôt been *super* into the football until about this season so I could be wrong on some of these, but here‚Äôs what I found 

1. We need a better D coach(or just a better D scheme). We‚Äôve been drafting high and getting free agent for D line but they couldn‚Äôt get any pressure on an o-line with 3 backups and a knee injury. We had one sack against Burrow, and it was Milano when he was out of pocket. In fact, Milano was the only one who didn‚Äôt look completely lost. The Poyer and Tre collision really sold this for me. We have some great players here but Chase and Higgins were consistory **WIDE** open. 

2. Our o-line sucks. Mitch Morse is great but besides that there‚Äôs not much else. Allen got sacked on a 3 man rush, that should be enough to tell you where the line is at. Dawkins had a bad year and the rest of the line might be worse then the Bengals last year. We need some actual players who can protect Josh, or at least open up holes.

3. Our WR room is a joke. 14 is the only one I can feel comfortable throwing to. Diggs gets doubled and our whole plan is fucked. Davis and McKenzie both have a ~50% catch rate which is way too low compared to Diggs ~70%. Knox also had a pretty good year if you look at catch rate, but he spent most of the year blocking or just not being targeted.

4. The coaches unwillingness to use rookies is insane. I‚Äôm always reminded about Milanos rookie year where he spent most of it on the bench despite preforming incredible. Elam is out performing Dane Jackson yet he was still on the bench all season. Don‚Äôt even get me started on Shakir, he had an amazing catch in the Dolphins game and has out preformed McKenzie by a land slide, yet he still barely got any snaps. I know he‚Äôs not a rookie but Hines is in the same boat. He‚Äôs an amazing Kick/Punt returner with some great speed so I‚Äôm fine if he doesn‚Äôt play too many snap, but really only 4%?

5. No run game. Why did we draft Cook if we aren‚Äôt going to use him? He averaged about 5 YAC this year and I‚Äôm fine with him sharing snaps with Motor, but why not sure then? The O-Line is terrible but they were still finding a way to make it work, yet they still didn‚Äôt get the touches. We need a more balanced offense.

But this is fixable. If I was the Bills, what would I do?

There‚Äôs a few routes we can go with this 

In the first round/second I‚Äôd draft a WR. The bills need another WR if there not going to use Shakir or if he‚Äôs just going to be in the slot. Drafting a good WR2 who could be a WR1 in some teams like Waddle is what we need. 

If we wait to the second round for a WR is draft a guard. We desperately need to beef up the O-Line, and either drafting a guard in the first and third or signing a FA.


We also need some Safety depth and if I‚Äôm being perfectly honest, I‚Äôm not sure where to get it. Poyer was injury riddled all season and as much as I love him, I don‚Äôt see the Bills resigning him and then keeping Edmunds instead because he‚Äôs younger and presumably cheaper.",8.0,buffalobills,t3_10jd611,False,0.0,58,2023-01-23T10:32:17Z,buffalobills,0.0036240317529486

As an example- expecting our receivers to separate by just sending them on a long vertical every play is crazy. 

This is now a time for introspection and self examination by the organisation. We need to scheme very differently. This will be good for Josh- he needs to work within the play design and take what‚Äôs on offer.

No one says any teams or fanbases _should_ have ‚Äúbro‚Äù alliances when this is a competitive league. But a lot of us really respect and root for your franchise and you can spin up whatever narrative you want to spin it. 

It fucking sucks to be a small market team that no one has cared about for decades. It is nice to finally have a star QB to lead the team. It is wonderful to finally be a contender and not just have hope but have the ability to dominate.

We are the same. Losing sucks for anyone but not many of us are true neutral fans.

17790,115952,115952,MulliganPlsThx,"From the fan-generated FB post:
> This one hurts. But of course it does! It adds to the fatigue we all feel. We‚Äôre tired ‚Äì tired to our core. We‚Äôve been beaten and shot and frozen and lost in a wilderness of powerlessness and trauma. And, so, we hang our hopes on our team. The one shining spot over this past year ‚Äì the Bills. They were our beacon, the cornerstone of an identity that was not associated with the unimaginable. Winners! But, then, today, they lost. And I think I might know just a tiny bit of the reason why ‚Äì they‚Äôre exhausted too. They are just as much a part of this injured city as we are; maybe even more so as they bear the burden of not just their own ordeals, ambitions and hopes, but of the hopes of all us. 

>And that‚Äôs a lot to carry. Yet they did, willingly and well. They fought and battled and carried on despite and in spite. Even when one of their own was felled and the outcome was unsure and unknown, they stepped up. But, somewhere along the way, and because they are human and are subject to human shortcomings, the tank hit a hard E. The players, the coaches, the staff; they‚Äôre all weary. I saw it today. When they came out on the field this afternoon, I didn‚Äôt see the spark, the fire, the heart they‚Äôve been rolling with since last May. All I saw was tiredness and a demonstrative, intangible weighty burden ‚Äì just like that which has beset the rest of us. Just like the city whose name, and hopes, they carry. And, you know what? That means the world to me! It means they care; for each other, for us. This past 12 months would, and has, laid low the heartiest of Buffalonians. They‚Äôve been through what we‚Äôve been through because they chose to. They could have ignored the city, the people and the abundance of distress we were going through. Many NFL teams do! But, over and over again, they praised us, the fans! They showed up. They connected. They believed in us as much as we believed in them. That‚Äôs character. And it‚Äôs exhausting. 

>I am grateful for the abundance of distractions, the frustrations, the elations and the hope the Buffalo Bills have brought me this season. They were my respite ‚Äì they were that for all that invested in them. But I‚Äôm even more grateful for seeing Josh Allen sign the teddy bear of a kid with cancer; for Dawson Knox at Roswell Park; for all the team making Buffalo not just where they play, but where they contribute just as much off the field as on. I‚Äôm sorry they‚Äôre not going further. Truly. And I hope they get the rest they so richly deserve. I hope we all do.

No Keenum is not a bad backup at all, but our team is picking in the top 10 maybe top 5 level outside QB play. Allen made us contenders while Keenum can't elevate a bottom tier roster.

The one season part does make somewhat sense.

19570,135773,135773,PoogeneBalloonanny,"In offense:

* Please bring back the short passing game that Daboll made bread and butter
* We should be in 11 personnel on most first downs to start drives with a focus on more passes, provided we can have personnel that can also run out of 11 personnel (upgrading Saffold's spot should help us with that at the very least)
* Also for 1st downs in our territory, a lot more under center action along with 11p
* Layer in the runs, especially if they give us light boxes (and dependent on opponent D strengths week to week) but predominantly we should run multi level concepts vs zone, and rubs/crossers vs man
* Main priority is to get the less flashy 1st downs (10-15 yard gains), or 2nd and shorts to make life easier
* Only deviate from this 1st down principle by going for a shot play if they give us a very favourable man look on one of our weapons, and in certain situations (down a lot, or up a lot, 2min drill at end of half for example)
* The *occasional* 1st down shot (esp if we get a good look) is great, but not to the extent where it became a *tendency* for us in 2022
* 2nd and shorts are great (underrated result vs getting a short first down IMO), anything with less than 3 yards to go (that number is flexible for situations and field position too) we should be in a heavier personnel + under centre + PA and dial up proper shot plays, if nothing is open take the incompletion/throwaway or have Allen scramble for the <3yards to go
* 2nd and super short (1 yard and below) should be super aggressive, heavy AF personnel, 1 or 2 deep routes, everyone else in pass pro, and also under center + PA. If the D checks into a deep passing look pre snap, check into a run (in our already heavy personnel). Otherwise go full bonkers, I still want to let Allen be Allen, just in a smarter manner
* The first downs should be high percentage passes with Allen coached to take what is given, in the \~10% that we don't get a 2nd and short, repeat the 1st down principle with 11 personnel short passing play but layering the run in too
* I would deviate from those early down philosophies a tad in the redzone with a more balanced rush tendency where the tradeoff between pass and run is less pronounced, as well as passing spaces being tighter (but still be more pass heavy in absolute terms, dependant on the defense of the week)
* I also would rarely have us do designed QB runs outside the redzone, but have them in our backpocket for the redzone
* In general things I'd like to see more in offense: plays schemed up for Knox, more motions, more screens and designed RB passes and finally way way more middle of the field targets

Defense:

* Not much to ask, just please please be more adaptable
* Feels like our defensive coaching is just an NPC as it does not seem to change week to week according to our opponents
* More man coverage against QBs that tear up zones and/or rely on a rhythm based offense
* If a QB struggles vs the blitz (Lamar?) blitz the shit out of them as a gameplan and continue doing so if that works
* I like nickel as our base, and it depends on personnel (can we field 3 LBs?) but have more 4-3-4 looks against the run teams, only a bit.

Just a heads up, we have a first round pick (unlike the Saints or Dolphins for example). We can get Torrence without trading or cutting Diggs

>You can't have your cake and eat it to.

Again, I really don't understand why drafting Torrence in a hypothetical would mean we have to cut Diggs

>So why do you put more value on guard than WR or any other high value position

I am not, I am valuing an A grade guard over some B/C grade receivers (Flowers not included, again my first choice 1st round pick). 

Ironically the colts have spent more in original draft capital on WRs than we do. Diggs, original day 3, Davis, original day 3, Mckenzie, Kumerow Shakir etc

Colts had 3 2nd round WRs this past season on their roster

>Let's say you are starting from scratch. Who are you taking first QB/WR/DL/CB/T/G?

QB, wide receiver, edge rusher and then the rest in no mandated order with a lot of context to take into account

>Weird how very elementary logic gets thrown out because of the draft

How so?

QB, check

WR in Diggs, check

DE, half check

>Look at Strange and Green.  
>  
>Horrible picks.

You keep on saying ""not this draft specifically"" blah blah which I deem irrelevant, but hey.

But then you bring up 2022's draft class where the guards were seen as thin on the top but with a lot of solid depth (Parham, Rhyan, Strange (lol Patriots), Salyer). Torrence who I use as an example is better than Strange and Green, at least in my opinion he is.

2022's WR class is also far far far far far more stacked than this year's. I actually wanted a 1st round receiver (and a CB FA) in 2022, does that sound like someone that values OG >>>>> WR?

My favourite guard prospect was Parham, I thought those 2 were overrated.

>At best, you draft a great iol, maybe even the next Nelson! How did that work out for the Colts this year? Terrible run game, awful team.

Please realise it is 2023 and we have just gone through the 2022 regular season.

Nelson has been awful in 2022 post back surgery.

The Colts also don't have a good QB or a good OL outside of Nelson even.

Of course they don't have Diggs, but I actually like Pittman and Pierce a lot (I wanted us to draft Pierce last year, funny coming from a ""person that hates WRs"" lol)

>A guard ain't putting us over the top

True, but no single position is. We need to potentially replace Edmunds/Poyer/Singletary amongst other spots needing help.

>Guard is objectively terrible first round value

So are all the countless 1st round WR busts

My whole point is to apply this discussion as it is pertinent to THIS YEAR'S DRAFT where I personally see an underwhelming/risky WR class at the top outside of Addison",1.0,buffalobills,t3_10o5v6f,False,0.0,"Overseas Bills Fan, yes we exist",2023-01-30T07:54:05Z,buffalobills,0.0017314140433612

Extreme example, but again why are you here

We aren't getting a Diggs/Chase type receiver with our pick, I'd argue that even with a top 10 pick we wouldn't be, with how weak this WR class is at the top

We could be getting a Zack Martin type guard at 24

I've said this elsewhere, value of a draft pick is position AND the individual players in question

The 100% consensus is QB >>> RB for example, would you have drafted Dustin  Krum over Breece Hall last year????

* IMO (and somewhat consensus) this is a weak WR class at the top 
* My opinion, also in line with consensus, WR depth is strong this year
* Consensus opinion: OG is the opposite, ONE blue chip prospect and bad depth (I don't fully agree, I like Vorhees)
* IMO the only blue chip prospect at WR is Addison, and he is still WR4/5 at best compared to last year. Consensus is high on Johnston, and mixed on JSN, I am not high on either.
* If Addison is gone (highly likely) and I am GM, my thought is to tradedown for Flowers and double dip by getting Andrei Iosivas in the mid rounds
* Just an aside, Iosivas is a huge wildcard, top 10 round measurables but an Ivy League player, will be interesting to see how long he remains under the radar. 
* I don't hate on WRs like you make me out to, but in THIS DRAFT there are potential studs in the late rounds, not the case for guards.

Value for a draft pick is inherent to both the individual and the position, you are making it sound like it is only valuable to the position and nothing else

Yes, if Addison is there, take him

1. This year's WR is thin at the top with good depth (a lot of good day 2 and day 3 guys)

3. My personal opinion is that the only WRs in a vacuum I'd take over Torrence are Addison and Flowers. And then knowing the receiving depth and non-existent OG depth, it's just Addison, who btw will be long gone.
4. If Addison, Flowers and then Johnston, JSN (the latter 2 I think are overrated) are gone in our pick and Torrence is there, I'd pick Torrence easily (or trade down)

>It's just that interior OL are more easily impacted by scheme, both positively and negatively

To an extent yes, but not to an extent where the jimmies and joes don't matter.

With the running game:

* The best run designers in the league are Shanahan, McVay and Roman (despite his woeful faults in the passing game)
* They all had inferior run games this year in comparison to the Eagles who have the best OL in the game
* Mcvay and Roman actually had some pretty lackluster run offenses this year on the whole
* There are guards in the league that cannot displace D-linemen, cannot pull, aren't athletic enough to reach block, or just all 3
* Having good personnel allows you to be more scheme diverse (if certain members of the OL can't pull, then that is one less set of plays to worry about it, if we can't run zone, then that's half of all run plays to not gameplan for, for ecample)

Now I am with you, I said that they were equivalent, not one more than the other. I really want to bring back the quick passing game that Daboll made our bread and butter, especially in first downs and occasional third and shorts.

But:

* I am not asking us to field Joel Bitonio and Zack Martin
* Just for us to replace Saffold who is both really really bad and an UFA
* I also don't want us to swing way too far in the opposite direction and become the Joe Lombardi offense, neutering Josh as one of if not the most talented passer in the league
* Guards like Saffold can't even be masked in the short passing game if they give up literally instant pressure (like he did vs Cinci) in the interior where D-linemen have a quicker and more direct path to the QB
* We still need to run the ball, in short yardages and in the redzone
* Repeating my run point, having good personnel allows you to be more scheme diverse (opposing Ds thinking, are they going to run/attack us at all levels?)

>To dismiss is and say someone is a fool is not really paying attention

19615,135844,135844,PoogeneBalloonanny,"Yesterday I said that Josh Allen covers up a lot of bad for the Bills and people were quick to say he‚Äôs not without blame. And obviously, no QB is when their team loses that way ‚Ä¶ BUT I don‚Äôt think people realize fully how much he has covered up for people in that building

Sean McDermott likely isn‚Äôt going to go anywhere but for someone whose top qualities are leadership and defensive prowess ‚Ä¶ he always seems to get out coached in the big games and the defense always seems to be the ones crumbling

The last four playoff exits: blew a multiple score 2nd half lead, blown out by KC, 13 second kickoff and yesterday. The defense can bully bad teams in the regular season but can‚Äôt stop a good offense when they have too  At this point it‚Äôs a trend. An inexcusable one at that

Brandon Beane gets such high regard for finding Allen ‚Ä¶ but that 2018 class was the last of his that had ANY pro bowl players. So much capital has been wasted on undersized d lineman who can‚Äôt generate pressure against a backup o line

They drafted a CB in the 1st and were too scared to use him for most of the year despite the secondary issues. The big addition to the offense was pass catching RBs ‚Ä¶ only to never throw the ball to the RBs. The o line got ignored despite clear issues

And that‚Äôs the frustrating part - it‚Äôs like there was no real plan. The game plan didn‚Äôt fit the personnel at all. The Bills receiver room had 2 receivers who could win outside or downfield and a bunch of slot guys - and then operated an offense built around the deep ball

There was no quick pass aspect to this offense all year. Slot WR role vanished. Allen was expected to scramble to avoid pressure and find someone deep. Which is even harder when your best deep threat has questionable hands and routinely drops well placed ones (like yesterday)

The Bills hired a first year play caller in the most offensive driven era in NFL history, in their championship window, despite one not having won a Super Bowl in over 30 years. Just short sighted moves that never seemed to gel with any sort of actual plan

There was never any situational football with this team. Yesterday on maybe the biggest play of the day - 3rd and 2 they threw 40 yards down field then punted. It largely felt like Dorsey would pick a play at random. And not just yesterday, this was all year long

They can out talent teams in the regular season and Josh Allen is a unicorn who can play hero ball and save the day most of the time - but if he has an off game this team has no shot of beating an actual good team. This roster is very flawed and  now it‚Äôs aging with little cap

Take Allen off this team and I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôre .500. Turnovers have been an issue, but that‚Äôs to be expected when Allen is asked to match Mahomes/Burrow stats with his arm while also being the teams RB1. It‚Äôs a ton to ask of any player. Especially with this play calling

The approach to building this team needs to change. It can‚Äôt be, invest in the defense and Allen will carry the offense every game. If McDermott and Frazier can‚Äôt figure it out with so much invested into it, change gears.

If there was ever a time to change its now. The def see has been built around 6 players - 2 are FAs (Poyer, Edmunds), 3 are working back from severe injuries (White, Von, Hyde) and the other is Milano  Idk how they work around those contracts, but they have to try and mix it up

Start loading up around Allen and trying to outscore everyone. It‚Äôs basically what they have to do in the playoffs anyway.   I‚Äôm frustrated as I‚Äôm sure many Bills fans are right now. Will 100% be back next year, but really hoping we see some changes before then

Adding one thing here. No juice?!? In the biggest game of the season, at home, with Damar in the building. It‚Äôs absolutely inexcusable  The Bills were dominated in a way they haven‚Äôt been in years.

DC

* Leslie soured me a lot after 13 seconds
* He has shown further stubbornness this year by sticking to his soft zone, vanilla pass rush NPC scheme
* Staley showed the league how to beat the Phins offense, we refused to do so 2 weeks after
* The Ravens showed us how to (nearly) defeat and nullify the Bengals offense, we refused to do so
* The actual defensive positive plays against Cinci came from us leaving the stupid NPC soft zone game
* No stunts or exotic pressures all year long and yesterday
* Barely any man or disruption at the LOS all year long and yesterday

DC wishlist, all ears for more suggestions:

* Vic Fangio
* Sean Desai
* Jerod Mayo
* Wilks if he is free

DL Coach

* Our pass rush has been just anemic for years, aside from the addition of Von
* How come Harry and Jerry get good as soon as they leave?
* Eric Washington needs to be fired, I as a fan don't know any suitors for a positional coach so am all ears
* OSU keep on producing elite DE talents, can we maybe look at their DL coach?

OC

* This one is harder to justify as Dorsey has only been doing so for one year in his young career
* But man was he bad
* No creativity, no motion, no ""easy gimme"" plays and the total abandonment of the short passing game from Daboll's bread and butter that made us so great
* Similar stats but way more reliance on Josh Allen highlight reel plays despite improved personnel

OC wishlist (am all ears again):

* Frankl Reich, Joe Brady internal promotion, even just hearing out Kingsbury or Hackett, Bill O'Brien, Tee Martin, Matt Nagy,  Sean Payton pipe dream
* Remember the Venn diagram for ""bad HC good coordinator"" is huge re: Nagy, Hackett and Kingsbury etc

OL coach:

* Biggest disappointment of the year for me, a guy with an actual reputation and pedigree (and thus expectation) comes in and brings no results
* Brown has regressed, Bates has regressed, Saffold looks washed, heck even Dion looks to regress
* Just fucking throw a brinks truck at Munchak",25.0,buffalobills,t3_10jd611,False,0.0,"Overseas Bills Fan, yes we exist",2023-01-23T08:53:33Z,buffalobills,-0.1985629629629629

When the sack total reaches four or more, he's 4-8, but still owns a 93.8 passer rating and a 18-13 touchdown-to-interception ratio.

Our team trusts the guys that were here over rookies or new acquisitions, but they do give everyone a chance to earn their spot. That being said they've got to be spectacular to unseat a current player.  A good example is this year with Elam. We're still running Dane Jackson out there opposite of Tre when we've got Elam healthy. Another example has been the return of John Brown and Cole Beasley. Both are vets with significant time in the system, but it's changed some and it took weeks for them to bring them back up to speed. We also don't rush players back from injury as we're seeing with Micah or Tre earlier in the season. Trust has to be warned with this staff, and sometimes it makes our staffing choices appear slow to react.

Another aspect of our FO mentality is if younger players get hurt in camp and can be stashed on IR that's where they go. Hodgins had an ankle injury his first year and spent the season on IR so he wouldn't take a roster slot or a practice squad space. Similar thing happened year two.

He's not the only player we've seen this pattern with as Stevenson and McCloud had similar situations.

We‚Äôve had a lot of time to prepare for this. Struggling against the Browns and the Lions and going 1-1 with the Jets were major red flags. Then, yes, while divisional playoff games are tough, we really struggled with Skylar Thompson‚Äôs Dolphins. Cincy looked vulnerable against the Ravens, but I had a sinking feeling in the back of my mind Sunday would be it. I was just hoping I was wrong or we at least went out in a blaze of glory like last year.

But we got screwed with injuries. We lost Miller and Hyde, Josh had to play through a throwing arm injury, and then of course them seeing what happened to Damar had to be traumatizing. No excuses for losing, but this is just reality. And the window doesn‚Äôt have to be closing. Four consecutive playoff appearances with no SB is certainly upsetting, but we have Josh for the foreseeable future. Anything can happen when we have a franchise QB. Fire Dorsey and Frazier or keep Dorsey and Frazier, the management has to know changes need to be made. I have faith that they will. 

I need a break from football. Bills games in the back half of the season were always edge of your seat stressful.

I felt the same way when the Chiefs lost to the Bengals last year... so many Bills fans were delighted out of spite, I thought it was concerning. You should, logically, want a team you went life and death with - and lost - to succeed, because it makes you look better. Chiefs winning the SB last year would've made our divisional performance look better, instead them losing to the Bengals foreshadowed our own downfall this year. Our best moment was losing to a team that lost the next week... yikes.

But ya know, on the other hand, Bills fans were complete dicks to Dolphins fans this year. We couldn't give you your hard-earned win in Week 3 (as if the heat wasn't affecting you guys at all) and then acted like our razor-thin snowstorm win was a shutout. And then struggled against your third string but acted like we beat Marino. We deserve the shit after how we got fucking killed yesterday.

Buffalo-Miami is a fun rivalry. Disappointed that we're out but excited for good divisional games moving forward. Great trilogy even though tons of bad officiating for both sides.

Third and 10+yards in general? Don't care about his DVOA.Cap issues. Yes, the Bills could make some moves and free up by my tally about 60M. However, they are already 20M in the hole and I truly don't think Beane is willing to kick as much down the road in salaries as he could. We also will need about 10M to sign rookies and have a small nest egg for in season moves next year.The list of areas we need to improve is not small. Yes, we won 13 regular season games last year. So what? The Titans had the #1 seed the year before and missed the playoffs this year. I think the Bills right now fall more into the category of the '21 Titans (Solid players on defense, winning on offense because of 1 physical freak albe to will enough points for victory in Allen/Henry).

26688,189468,189468,UberHansen,"Let's dive into a few of your points here.

1. You ended this point with ""Don't care about DVOA"" in an attempt to block the primary argument to your point, that the Bills Offense AND Defense were statistically elite. There are for sure concerns with recent postseason performances but the fact of the matter is that the Bills Offense remained elite in 2022, despite their QB dealing with a significant elbow injury, while their defense was one of the best in the NFL despite 10/11 starters missing games due to injury. The arguments for the Bills being elite on both sides of the ball are more plentiful than the arguments against (This doesn't mean criticism is not allowed).
2. The reason Beane has been pushing money via restructures is because of the expected MASSIVE increase in Cap coming in 2024. With the new TV Deal expected to apply to the NFL's books  by then you could see the cap increase by as much as $50m next off-season. Will the Bills restructure every deal? No. Will the Bills restructure plenty in order to re-sign and or add talent? Of course. You won't see a Von Miller-esuqe signing this off-season but don't be surprised if the Bills add a few high upside vets this off-season in order to revamp the OL and/or add depth.
3. How can you possibly compare the current iteration of the Bills to the 2021 Titans? There is a significant different between a team which was heavily reliant on a 28-year old RB to win games and one that relies on a Top-3 QB to win.  I would argue the Chiefs have separated because they built the trenches well but to imply the Bengals have clearly separated from the Bills makes little sense. I'll wait until the regular season game against the Bengals next season to make the decision on clear separation. Oh yea, and the cap issues the Bills have...the Bengals are about to have them 10-fold.
4. We were told the schedule was ROUGH coming into this season. The Bills proceeded to go 13-3 and finish the regular season with the 2nd best point differential in the NFL. Schedules year to year are impossible to analyze. Did anyone expect the Rams to be atrocious this season? I don't think so. This is all to say, the schedule going into 2023 is no more difficult, on paper, than the schedule coming into 2022. As for the division getting better, we also said the same coming into this season. The Bills would go on to win the East by 5 games, the most they have won it by in their 3-year run atop the division.
5. People's inability to look at the draft the past few seasons with any semblance of unbiased has been jarring this off-season. Yes there have been some misses but the Bills have drafted better over the past 5 seasons than nearly any other team in the NFL (Bengals & Cowboys the 2 exceptions). From this draft in particular, James Cook looks to be the Bills RB1 moving forward after posting a 5.7 Y/A, Kaiir Elam looks to have the physical prowess to be CB2 (albeit more improvements are needed), Khalil Shakir projects to compete for the Bills Slot1, and Christian Benford looks to have been a steal that the Bills may try and flex to Safety. There are just as many IFs that the Bills draft may not progress as they will progress. Historically speaking for this Bills team Year 2/3 is when their draft picks tend to take off, that trend is something they will rely on in 2023.

I understand people want to react to how the season ended against the Bengals and have this desire to scream from the rooftops that the sky is falling and the window is closed. Fact is, the Bills still will have one of the best rosters in the NFL going into 2023 and as long as #17 is on Center there is no reason to believe that the Bills can't compete for a Super Bowl. People can lower expectations if they would like however, there is just as much reason to remain optimistic moving forward.",3.0,buffalobills,t3_10pzy9z,False,0.0,:still-bill:,2023-01-31T08:38:53Z,buffalobills,0.0108926044618132

27899,195843,195843,Why_So-Serious,"This is not meant to take pitchforks and torches against anyone named. 

We don‚Äôt do a good job of self scouting. 

Above Average QBs look for #49 in coverage and throw behind his back. Continuously. You can watch it happen time and time again. 

# #49 is great at a lot of things. We keep asking him to cover above average players against above average QBs. Our opponents, not just in the action of game read that #49‚Äôs coverage assignment is open, our opponents actively look to create the matchup and know they can exploit it whenever they need. 

For 4 years it happens and for 4 years we do nothing about it. 


Burrow multiple times went to the #49 well in coverage. Cover 1 could do a whole session on Above Average QBs looking for #49. 

Additionally Self scouting on running doesn‚Äôt appear to happen. We are very susceptible fo big runs from pulling guards/centers. 

Bengals had almost 10 yards a carry and you can see time and time again they run some type of counter-ish play. Get our fast active finesse D to attack and commit one way. Pull Guards the other. Wham Bam 10 yards. 

It didn‚Äôt just happen against the Bengals. It happened all season. The premise of the D is ‚ÄúJosh go Brrrrr‚Äù get a lead and then our opponents go pass happy and play to our bend don‚Äôt break pass coverage. I would always wonder why our opponents would abandon the run. Teams that stick with the run especially their 2nd running back (Perine) in what looks like pass plays then run a guard pulling play. Boom 10 yards. 

Bengals were very well disciplined and didn‚Äôt scrap the plan. Run on pulling plays, Pass to 3rd and 4th options make the Bills D rally to the pass catcher underneath and rack up tons of RAC, and when in doubt look for #49 in coverage. 

The formula is so obvious and we have done nothing in 4 years to sure it up. 

It‚Äôs predicated on ‚Äúcomplimentary football‚Äù So when ‚ÄúJosh DONT go Brrrrrr‚Äù and we don‚Äôt get a lead. The defense just gets plowed over.

Tremaine is an imposing force, he has improved in coverage but is still a liability out there against elite QBs. You saw Burrow look for #49 and throw to his assignment. 

Of the two I think you can find a LB that can fill holes and cover closer to Tremaine than a Safety that QBs are afraid of in ‚ÄòPo. If Damar and Hyde were healthy then Yeah let ‚ÄòPo go but now I think you have to sign ‚ÄòPo and hope Hyde returns to form. Po‚Äôs injuries will be healed up by Pre-Season they aren‚Äôt long term injuries. People get banged up tackling fools and his career shows he makes it to game day. 

Find a LB to fill in with Milano seems like an easier fit.

The market will be there if the contract gets ugly this year. He has all the leverage. 

Best case the Bills work out some kind of elusive trade and sign deal in the NFL. Which is unlikely based on the nature of NFL contracts. We have to take on a bad NFL contract where the cap hit is too high to cut and they would get Tremaine‚Äôs rights with the Franchise option.

27908,195862,195862,Why_So-Serious,"Thoughts on the game: 

1.) The Bengals were very well coached and attacked our weaknesses extremely well. We have a bend, don‚Äôt break defense. They basically said fine, ‚ÄúWe will just bend you down the field.‚Äù They threw short to 3rd and 4th options and made the Bills D rally to the ball, while they got YAC. 

2.) Our O-Line is terrible and masked by Josh‚Äôs escapibility. The Dolphins and Bengals both overload blitzed and got in Josh‚Äôs face with DBs on stunts. Josh doesn‚Äôt look at the dump off so they threw off timing on continuous deep shots that Josh chooses to take. 

3.) We can‚Äôt road grate run because our O-Line is weak. 

4.) We can‚Äôt stop road grate running because our D-Line is finesse players. [We scratched DaQuan Jones a stout run DT and they just ran right down our throats against pass rushing DTs]

Thoughts on the off-season: 

1.) Rebuild the O-Line, or more accurately build for the 1st time an elite O-Line. Mitch Morse is probably going to retire. #26 is a great place to draft a Top Guard, #58 is great for the a top C/G, #90 is great for another guard. We have invested a ton of picks in the D. It‚Äôs time to go back and build out the O-Line from scratch. Josh is in his 6th year. The escapism isn‚Äôt going to increase. Build an elite O-Line. 

2.) Sign some vet D-Line that can stop the run. The formula the Dolphins, Jets and Bengals exposed is going to the recipe our opponents follow. From a macro trend perspective 9ers, Eagles even Bengals are showing running is important in the NFL, backs matter again. You‚Äôll see team‚Äôs reinvest in running.  Our opponents will Run at the D and dump off short. You can find vet Run stuffers for cheap. Load up this off-season. The off ball players are pretty solid on the Bills D. 

3.) Sign Po‚Äô. Damar was an incredible understudy. You can‚Äôt lose both. With the Google money use it on ‚ÄòPo. 

4.) Tremaine probably can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt fit. He will get 100M+ contract. Bengals went to Brady‚Äôs well and just picked on his coverage assignment all game. I think we can get a LB in FA.

Hodgins was heavily injured his first few years. 

What would you suggest we do different? The Giants signed him when we moved him up to active and back down to practice squad? 

Daboll had a ton of WRs go down and traded Toney away. He grabbed someone he knew and knew the system. Hodgins made an immediate impact. 

The right way to think about is, We only have 53 roster spots. I‚Äôm happy Hisdgins is getting his shot.

27956,195943,195943,Why_So-Serious,"1.) Why would you think the Bills would win by 30 points when every game was close with Dolphins including a loss? Tua wasn‚Äôt doing anything special. He threw it in an area where Hill or Waddle were and they put in the work. The delusion of ‚ÄúWe shoulda crushed them‚Äù is a problem with certain parts of the Mafia. I don‚Äôt know where your expectations come from but you should look inward and adjust them. There are  no easy wins in the NFL. 

2.) Daboll/Dorsey isn‚Äôt responsible for preventing the Dolphins from scoring. The Bills O scored 34. 

3.) This is the same exact shit people that believe they are being thoughtful would post about Daboll. ‚ÄúIn my expert opinion the offensive play calling is laking and preventing Josh Allen from growing.‚Äù Has been posted for the last 5 years. 

STFU you‚Äôre not an OC and don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. It sounds like it‚Äôs a thoughtful topic but really it‚Äôs just pouting because the Bills didn‚Äôt win by 30 like they wanted. 

Josh Allen is choosing to throw bombs on these plays. If anything Dorsey needs to talk to Josh about taking what the defense gives you more often. Which is what Daboll had to do the last 4 years as well. 

Josh is a gunslinger and is going to go long. The Dolphins had 8 men in the box on blitz the whole game with no deep safety help. So Josh said fine, I‚Äôll throw to my 1:1s deep. 

This worked like a charm in the second half of the Patriots game. We had a lot of drops and mis connections in this game. 

So the Dolphins said ‚ÄúF it, we‚Äôre in this game let‚Äôs keep going with the same strategy.‚Äù They basically just went on a crazy full house Blitz every play and Josh countered with a bomb every play. 

Dorsey/Daboll/You wouldn‚Äôt be able to change much of what was going on in the field. 

Multiple times you can see Dorsey called a play where Diggs runs short and stays near the LoS. Diggs was wide wide wide open with no one near him. Josh wasn‚Äôt even trying to look short or look at the hot routes. He is like ‚Äúfuck it I‚Äôm throwing it over those mountains‚Äù.

There is a shot that shows the 1st down marker on the field and for some reason the yellow marker is waaaay off on that play. It‚Äôs usually closer in my experience. 

If you watch the broadcast copy you can see an angle where you see where the yellow line starts on the field. 

So basically it‚Äôs not even as close as it seems if you‚Äôre looking at the yellow line.

28647,199329,199329,Xplayer,"Players *want* to take a restructure for several reasons. They get money that they were (usually) entitled to anyway right away. A player's salary is paid out in weekly (or bi-weekly) game checks, but the total salary counts against the cap for the entire year. A restructure turns part or all of this salary into some sort of bonus (signing bonus/roster bonus etc.) which can be spread out over up to 5 years over the length of the contract. They would receive this money as a lump sum as soon as the restructure happens (e.g. Allen would receive his entire $21M salary for the year once he signs on the dotted line for the restructure, but it could also reduce his cap hit by that much this year). Also, of course, they free up cap space in the short term which helps their team get under the cap and sign players.

You might ask then why didn't the Bills just spread out Allen's cap hit more when he first signed? Flexibility. You can restructure contracts to move cap to future years after the fact. You can't restructure it the other way around (use cap this year to free up cap in future years).",8.0,buffalobills,t3_10q0xzv,False,0.0,UBBulls,2023-01-31T10:10:09Z,buffalobills,0.0427496111325441

Edmunds will almost certainly get signed. He's only 24 years old and really came into his own alongside Milano this year.

Oliver we might let walk unless he takes a huge step up on his own next season. He only seemed to be better this season when the majority of the focus was on Von.

Philips, Lawson, Klein and Poyer will walk. The biggest loss there is Poyer the rest are relatively replaceable and were cheap-ish contracts anyways.

The phrase was widely used by Saints fans in 1983.
A variation of the phrase was used by some Louisiana high schools and colleges in the 1970s and seems to have been used by some Saints fans in the late 1970s (probably a small number, and possibly a very small number). Is it possible that it was then copied and adapted by Bengals fans? Not clear. Did the popularity of the Bengals‚Äô chant in 1981 lead to the wider adoption of the Saints‚Äô saying in 1983? This seems likely, but also is not clear.

30921,220537,220537,bogboom,"Until this team commits to surrounding Allen with a proper offence they will continue to come up short. 

MCDermott being a defensive HC has steered this team into investing everything into the defence. Twice as many 1st and 2nd rd picks into the defence and sadly those picks haven‚Äôt made a difference when it counts.

Meanwhile Allen is left to be 95% of the offence. No run game, a pretty weak WR room considering they brought in Brown and Beasley off their couches to start a playoff game.  O line has been ignored almost completely. Washed up guys like Safford get brought in to patch together a line that isn‚Äôt good at really anything. 

Lastly a OC that does even use the tools they do have properly.  

Then we have a DC who seems to have forgotten how to do anything but run out a base nickel D playing soft zone. Watching how the Bengals were disguising the pass rush yesterday just infuriates me. All this draft capital on defence to do nothing to disrupt the Bengals passing while at the same time letting Mixon rush for 5 yards a carry.  All they do is rush 4 drop into zone and get torn apart over the middle because our pass rush creates no pressure.  They only positive play on Defence all game was Milano spying and making a coverage sack.  


Lastly what is with this coaching staff and rookies. You spend a 1st  and 5th Rd pick on CBs, then refuse to play them. You spend a 2nd on a RB and barely use him.  You draft a promising young WR and bring in guys off their bloody couches before you will use him.  It just makes no sense.

30923,220540,220540,bogboom,"Guy hit the nail on the head. We have a Defensive HC and DC and every playoffs the defence shits the bed. McDermott is 100% behind the problems this offence has. 

He‚Äôs pushing Beane to load up on Defence instead of focusing on giving his MVP caliber QB the tools he needs to succeed. An O Line that can give him more than 1 sec before he‚Äôs scrambling for his life. A run scheme that can take all the pressure off Allen and makes defences stop the run. Some quality targets and a an play book with some screens, crossing routes and proper running plays, not this constant RPO bullshit that every team is all over. It‚Äôs not 2016 anymore, teams defend the RPO pretty well now. 

Up until week 6 and Cook finally got a rushing TD Allen was 100% of the offence. If he didn‚Äôt throw it or run it in himself they didn‚Äôt score. That is more than Any QB ever can take on and succeed. The fact the Bills won 13 games when the Bills scored 53 touchdowns and Allen was responsible for 42 of them and scored as many Rushing TDs as the two RBs combined is actually amazing. Without Allen this team is maybe .500 but probably not even that.

36927,261890,261890,highinsulacentrality,"Offense:

- Seemed like we had the classic ""more film = less success"" issue you see with rookies.
- Offense seemed to lack wrinkles (e.g. Bengals faking bubble screen they knew we would key on and throwing deep), or at least they weren't used as much as last year
- Sort of related, am I correct in thinking we ran zero trick plays all season?  That suggests we were not efficient enough at getting the basics down.
- We really need to focus on keeping drives alive.  I like the 'go for the throat' attitude and to be honest teams that *never* do that are more frustrating than teams who do it too much, but efficiency and splashiness need to have some balance.

Defense:

- This horse has been beat to death but who cares about regular season stats. The defense needs to be able to perform in the postseason.
- I assume we're keeping Frazier at this point which IMO will *require* some more hands-on input from McDermott.  Our base defense is okay but we 100% need to trust our guys, we need to ~~be able to~~ play more cover 1 and man to compete vs the best.
- Pretty much all our blitzes are from the LBs or Taron, which means the offensive line is prepared for what's coming.  We're rarely in a situation where our rush scheme just beats the opponents' blocking scheme, we need our guys to win rather than our coaches to win.
- The amount of third and longs we gave up was actually pretty close to league average, but they seemed to always be given up at key points in the game.  A few could be lack of execution but a pattern seems to point at a bigger problem.

Head:

- I'm not thrilled that I'm getting Dungy vibes from McDermott lately.  Great guy but I'm not sure he's able to get us in the right place for these big games.  The only times we've been good in the playoffs is when Josh went god mode, the vast majority of our games were struggles to execute.

That's one of the basic tenets of Tampa-2, you need your Rice/Sapp/Freeney/Mathis/Jared Allen pass rushers to win.  I don't really think that's McDermott-specific, if he's got a Tampa-2-style coordinator that's a necessary piece.

Tbh that's my biggest complaint, you need way too many pro bowl-level players to pull it off.  When it works well it's suffocating but it's just *so expensive*.  The Colts' version of it was cheap-ish everywhere but the DL which kinda worked but if they got behind it was horrible.

We don't know for sure who's really behind the scheme, but McDermott at least in the past ran some aggressive 4-3 schemes.  In my opinion the spirit of the scheme is likely more Frazier with some McDermott input.  Ultimately the head coach is responsible for the overall gameplan, so I'm not saying he's blameless at all. A change in DC almost certainly means the defensive scheme will change with it to at least some degree, so unless you want to blow up the whole coaching staff that sounds reasonable.  Our scheme is just static, which is frustrating.  Between Frazier and McDermott there's a lot of experience with different styles, but we're pretty much only seeing one style.

The Vikings notably got tired of that style of defense (which heavily relied on Jared Allen being a superstar at DE).  The philosophy of our defense is still Tampa-2 at its core, just modernized to not be literally exactly the same coverage shell every play.

With the Eagles McDermott was pretty creative, there's a story out there that against Peyton Manning his plan was to show a totally different scheme on each drive. He was known for having an aggressive 4-3 philosophy. He ran a pretty conservative 4-3 in Carolina when the roster was weak but got much more aggressive once he got Josh Norman.

We have one of the best QBs ever to play the game.  We spent a couple years building around him, extending him, finding ways to scheme for him, building a defense to help him.

Then this year, we stopped doing that. We went into the season with an average-at-best o-line, handed the keys of the offense to a QB coach, didn't surround him with receiving talent, refused to rely on a run game that could help steady him and keep him healthier.

In spite of all of this and the ridiculous adversity this season brought, we managed to be 8 points away from an undefeated season. Allen looked like Superman, despite injury and mental exhaustion.

Then in the Divisional Round we just.. shit the bed. Uninspired and uncreative play calling, stubbornness and ineptness in the defensive coaching. Stupid game management from our HC that showed motivation to try to not lose rather than to win.

Frazier needs to go. Dorsey probably needs a year behind an OC that knows how to call plays. McD needs to find a way to be more aggressive in big games. But it sounds like none of that will happen and it makes me feel like we're headed for a similar season again next year.

Our defense was absolutely decimated by injury. Our best cornerback missed more than half the year and never really regained form, our best pass rusher and best defensive player was lost on Thanksgiving and our defensive line fell apart afterwards, I halftime of this game we were on our fourth string safety while the other one played on one leg. Despite all that, they still finished with the top five ranking in adjusted DVOA and kept us in every game of the season. If Tre comes back to close to what we know he can do, Von returns to form for the back half of the season and we address the safety position we can be in good shape. 
Offensively, I feel like although we put up really similar numbers to last year‚Äòs team we were far less consistent. I think Josh needs to improve his decision making and be more willing to take things underneath. I think Dorsey needs to do his part in reining Allen in, and commit to the running game more consistently like we saw in the back half of the year. I‚Äôm excited for what James Cook can bring to the table next season, I also think will see a bit more of Khalil Shakir. 
Our offensive line however is atrocious. Dawkins is our best lineman and even he was pretty average all year. Mitch Morse has played his best football and unfortunately I think is on the decline, we thought we might‚Äôve caught lightning in a bottle with Roger Saffold but he appears to be done. I like Spencer Brown, but he‚Äôs consistently graded out as one of the worst lineman in the league and Ike Boetger and Ryan Bates are pretty much replacement level. We don‚Äôt have the money to overhaul the line so we‚Äôre gonna have to hit on a bargain bin player and draft pick or two. Dorsey is also going to have to adjust his playcalling so the ball gets out of joshes hand quicker. Josh has got to be more decisive when it‚Äôs time to run the ball.

My point is that, therefore, the teams that hold out against the trend will essentially become head coaching pipelines for the rest of the league. Teams now basically have to find who they think is the right guy to run the offense and make him the HC to avoid another team poaching him.

* forced into being essentially the sole symbol of hope for a city that suffered a domestic terror attack and a once-in-a-generation storm that claimed dozens of lives (and caused a home game to be moved on short notice)

* multiple season-ending injuries to key veteran leaders

* seeing their teammate literally die on the field before the heroics of medical professionals brought him back

Emotional fatigue is real, and that's on top of all the physical fatigue. 

That all being said, it feels like we are further away from the Super Bowl than we were after 13 seconds last year. At this point, I want Beane to stop investing early picks on defense; his evaluation of D-line talent is particular is a huge weakness. We should throw everything at the offense and shoot for a replacement-level defense that a good coordinator can elevate in key moments (essentially the KC model).

Both coordinators need to go, and McDermott's seat should be getting warm. When the going gets tough, McDermott regresses into the poor game management decisions that plagued his early years. The continuity from Daboll to Dorsey seemed flawless after weeks 1 and 2, but with the benefit of hindsight it's clear that handing him the keys to an offense in a Super Bowl window was a mistake. It sucks to make a star QB change schemes, but we need someone who can both maximize Josh's strengths and most importantly reel him in when he indulges in his bad habits.

\^What needs improvement here? This is as balanced as modern NFL offenses are ever likely to get. Remember balance doesn't mean 50% passing and 50% rushing. No coach thinks that way any more, not ones with jobs anyway. 

Also just a side note: why did we invest in all these fleet footed athletic O-linemen? Because when a PASS play BECOMES a RUN play in the blink of a Josh Allen eye, they can turn up field and try and get some blocks on the backers. The best NFL offenses are instantaneously dynamic.

Would've been nice to know that we were sharing the bye with the Chiefs yesterday when we were all having a collective heart attack against Miami. And I'm definitely looking forward to sharing the field with them against 9-8 Jacksonville this week. So glad we're playing them instead of the 12-4 Bengals like we would've had to as the 2 seed.

Look at Baltimore. They almost took out Cincy without LAMAR - an arguably top 5 at least top 10 qb! How many wins do you think we get w/o Allen?? (No disrespect to GOAT Keenum.)

We all thought we were going to have a hard schedule this year, but if you look at how the teams ended up, I would argue it was as easy if not easier than than last year! 16 games we played. Only 2 teams I would argue would be considered ""tough"" teams to the league (Chiefs w/ healthy Pat, Ravens w/ healthy Lamar). 14 of those games were with teams that either didn't make the playoffs or were frauds (maybe Fins being the exception but their EOY collapse makes that suspect) - and we lost to 3 of them! This same team does not squeak by 13 wins next year, full stop.

So how do we do it w/ cap, etc.? I vote we do it at the cost of our D. Chiefs are a perfect example. #1-3 offence in the league; mid D. One game from the SB ... for the FIFTH year!  Let Frazier get his HC gig he deserves; sell off our D talent. Get us a cement wall for an O-Line. I want so many WR1s they have to set up a fashion boutique at Highmark. Defense wins championships, but your mere-game-winning Offense is what gets you to that 'ship. Build our O. Let JA17 get his confidence back knowing the world is no longer on his shoulders. Yes, our D will lose us some games. Use the time for the O to figure things out and get comfortable. Build the D afterwards.

This ain't happening, but is it *crazy* crazy? Under Whaley we were ALWAYS ""right now"" ... always got us the *names* (T.O., Shady are probably the biggest two) but it never amounted to anything long-term. The injuries this year showed how poor our depth was.

Even with the woeful OL, lack of weapons and questionable playcalling and sometimes decision making from Josh, I think we can all agree that he can always make something out of nothing. As long he has that ability the opponent needs to respect our offense whenever it steps on the field (doesn't matter if the ball is on our 20 or we are driving into the redzone).

So if we have a QB like that, who can literaly make any throw and can conjure big plays out of thin air, shouldn't we give him as many possession as possible and as many chances as possible? Wouldn't it be better if we ran ultra aggressive defensive scheme to maybe gamble a bit more, try to force the issue and get big splash plays (sacks, INTs) instead of sitting in our nickel D shell most of the time and letting our opponents to kill us with long methodical drives?

2) Great Coaching

We can talk all we want about the talent differentials but we are top a top 5 roster bottom to top. The disparity between us and the other top teams in terms of talent is negligible.

What is massive is the coaching gap. 

We didn't have a gap on offense with Daboll. He was great at attacking teams' weaknesses and scheming guys open. That's why you saw Davis catching 4TDs and going for 200+ yards. He was WIDE OPEN. Davis is no different this year to last year. The difference is that Dorsey can't get him open and he's having a much harder time with contested catches. Dorsey seems allergic from doing anything but deep patterns. Where were the Beasely type option plays over the middle? Why couldn't he get the fucking RB involved in the short passing game? Why did every play take 5 seconds to develop??

That is why these other teams are killing us in these games. 

You all watched the game. These WR weren't winning jump balls over tough defensive plays. They were WIDE FUCKING OPEN. It's not talent that makes Tre play 8 yards off on 3rd and 2!

People complaining on this board I think are a bit different. They may see it as more of a bigger issue that he's developing a habit of vs just in the moment.

Last year, Josh managed to right the razors edge perfectly of when he should decide to go for it, but he only did it rarely. This year, the offense was struggling in nearly every game causing the pressure to mount. I honestly believe he was incredibly stressed this year during the second half as the offense struggled more and more during games. The pick of him at the end of the Detroit game really sticks in my mind.

So I think we should distinguish between the casuals and the fans who are thinking about it from a different perspective.

That's just really bad for the mental health of your players.

While I may argue with you about the talent, what is certain is everyone is familiar with Josh. That allows them to play together well and make plays out of nothing. And therein lies my issue. It seems like all the time we are having to make plays, instead of the play calls working. Or we hear of Josh saying no, run this route instead, or Josh directing during the play.

Literally the players are the only reason we are doing so well IMO. I hope if we ever change our OC again we get someone who is dedicated to running the football.

Dorsey just seems to lack the creativity and game sense, that Daboll had due to his years of experience. Daboll clearly knows how to scheme open players, while it very much seems like Dorsey relies on his players to get open and for Josh to be superman all the time to win.

As for decision making, yes Allen is in the game and making those decisions but Dorsey is clearly not CORRECTING Allen.
