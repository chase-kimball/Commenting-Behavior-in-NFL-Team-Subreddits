No they're not. What's dumb and thoughtless is spending $1 billion on one of the lamest advertising campaigns I've ever seen rather than human services. A fucking Reddit series and a Super Bowl ad don't represent God's work. 

> I suppose you think it's bad for Frito Lay to spend any money on a football ad instead of spending that money on producing their corn chips too

Frito Lay is a for profit enterprise. I don't give a shit what they spend their money on. A tax exempt group dumping a billion on advertising like they are too sits way more uncomfortably with me.

> Redditors will find any reason to bash Christianity and it's frankly pathetic.

Name any part of my comment, or anything in my entire comment history, that suggest I'm ""bashing Christianity"".

I'm not a Christian, personally. I used to be, and a pretty devout one, but now I'm not an anything. I grew up in the rural Bible Belt and I've seen people motivated by Christianity to do amazing things, and act in amazing cruel and selfish ways. It's an ideology like any other, though I'd give it credit for being more virtuous *in theory* than most. And of all the Christians I've ever met, the ones with a passion for loving their neighbor and performing mission work garner enormous respect from me even if I don't subscribe to their answers to the universe.

There may not be an example of a mobile QB's career being ended by an injury, but considering Lisfrancs alter players ability to jump, run and change direction, you'd be a moron not to think it could have an impact on his long term ability to be an effective mobile QB.

>Rhule signed an eight-year contract with Nebraska that pays $74 million in base salary along with $4 million more in deferred salary if he remains employed by the school across various vesting dates.

>Whereas Rhule's contract with Carolina had a consistent base salary of $8.5 million each year, the Nebraska contract escalates each year -- from $5.5 million in the first year to $12.5 million in the final year of the deal.

>It's unclear how much money the Panthers paid Rhule to this point, but from Feb. 1, 2023 through Jan. 31, 2027, he was due $34 million in base salary.

What I didn't like about CJ Stroud is his arm strength. Look at the balls he throws. They have a lot of air under them. I don't think those balls are as effective at the NFL level.

That's what I like about Levis. Look at how the ball looks coming out of his hands. That's a pro ball right there. The same thing is true of Young.

AR15 can throw the ball too but obviously uses his feet more. His processing speed is better than Stroud's too (as the videos show).

I think the videos above are fair to all QBs in the discussion. There's no question that there are things that CJ Stroud does well. By all accounts he eats seam routes, for example.

Sure, we could give up an unheard of amount of picks, but there are quite a few holes on this team (especially regarding depth) and our cap space is limited for FA resolutions.

> **Findings:** In the aggregate, stronger gun policies were associated with decreased rates of firearm homicide, even after adjusting for demographic and sociologic factors. Laws that strengthen background checks and permit-to-purchase seemed to decrease firearm homicide rates. Specific laws directed at firearm trafficking, improving child safety, or the banning of military-style assault weapons were not associated with changes in firearm homicide rates. The evidence for laws restricting guns in public places and leniency in gun carrying was mixed.

> **Conclusions and relevance:** The strength of firearm legislation in general, and laws related to strengthening background checks and permit-to-purchase in particular, is associated with decreased firearm homicide rates. High-quality research is important to further evaluate the effectiveness of these laws. Legislation is just 1 part of a multipronged approach that will be necessary to decrease firearm homicides in the United States.

There are some definite success stories out there. There's a guy in Utah who owns a fleet of 3D printers and he makes a living off having a mini factory in a barn essentially. He takes orders that are too big for individual fabrication but too small to justify outsourcing to china (think small plastic items, between 1k and 10k items) and he's doing great for himself.

The idea of organ printing or whatever (which I'm currently researching) hasn't overcome some of the technical and chemical limitations.

One of the hard things about the field is that it requires members who are very well versed in chemistry, materials science, mechanical engineering, optics (in the case of photopolymer printers), and spectroscopy (again for photopolymer systems). It's rare to find a team who's well versed in all of those things. And then after that you need to get your manufacturing capabilities sufficiently uniform, and then you need a business plan.

That said, I saw a talk this morning that says the market for 3D printed materials is in the many billions, and several 3D printing companies have >$1billion valuations.

* The game this weekend should not alter your perception of whether or not Joe Burrow is better than Mahomes. If it does, you're being reactionary and silly.

* The Lions desperately need a QB upgrade. Goff had 29 turnover worthy plays but only 7 recorded INTS - meaning this year is lucky. Further, he throws short of the sticks on 43% of 3rd and 4th downs, which is the 4th highest rate in the league. He's also near the top of the league on turnover worthy plays on 3rd and 4th downs despite being that conservative. He's still the same guy he was that LA needed to get rid of in order to get over the hump.

* I'd be fine with Carr in CAR but only for <$25M APY and no more than $10M guaranteed beyond year one. He's not worth it if those aren't met.

* If I'm Chicago, I'm desperately trying to trade Fields for a pick in the top 20 (Jets, Bucs, Falcons, Panthers, Tennessee, New England, and Washington are all >0% chance suitors) and then drafting Young. We haven't seen enough from Fields to *know* he's the guy, and the rookie contract QB window is one of the biggest advantages in modern sports.

* Related to the last point, Chicago did themselves a major disservice by not getting any offensive help this year, because a better supporting cast would make the Fields/Young conversation easier to pick a side on.

10907,62787,62787,Hefty-Association-59,"First is all their several things wrong with this fairly surface level argument. Yes he does rank 21st with the contract. However he set the market from the ground up so last year we saw a ton of TEs either get a bunch more money or get franchised tagged. Uzumiah was forced to walk with the bengals and got overpaid with the jets. Evan engram got a bag with the jags despite up and down production. Gesiki and Schultz both got franchised tagged. We either saw a bunch of TEs leave their teams since they couldn‚Äôt afford them or get tagged so that teams can prepare for them to walk since the market got reset for a mediocre to bad TE from the ground up. 

Second yes ian is the 21st paid TE. But that doesn‚Äôt make his contract good. It makes it look good when you look at actual TE salaries that got reset after him. But ian is a blocking TE and not much else. Blocking TEs should be making Chris manherts contracts at best. 2 years 6 mil. Not 6 mil per year. The league doesn‚Äôt value TEs that block. The league places a higher emphasis on paying pass catching TEs. Which is why every single one of the guys ahead of Ian are better pass catchers and like half the ones behind him in terms of salary. 

Overall I understand why we want to support Ian. He has his moments of good. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the reaction from the league and his production make this a bad contract. I mean we paid 6 mil per year when we could‚Äôve gotten him for half of that at worst. Possibly even lower. And I get that when you get towards the bottom of the salary you can try to justify it. But a bad contract is a bad contract. It‚Äôs like saying cam Erving isn‚Äôt a bad signing. It‚Äôs bad considering you plan on rolling him out as a starter last year and he‚Äôs a vet minimum player.

Also we need to drop this idea that Ian is going to magically improve into a dynamic dual threat. He‚Äôs in year 5. And he can‚Äôt catch. Plus isn‚Äôt a great rotate runner either. Sure he has flashes. But he‚Äôs just an inconsistent player. I mean he wouldn‚Äôt even be starting on most teams.

10908,62788,62788,Hefty-Association-59,"Fields and stroud are completely different players. I‚Äôll preface by saying this. I like fields a lot. I liked him coming out. I like him now. I‚Äôve been downvoted in another thread today for defending fields. And I believe that he has the upside and eventually will run the nfc north. 

Now coming out of Ohio Justin fields should not have dropped as far as he did. But he did have weaknesses. That Ohio state offense did help him a lot. He struggled reading coverages. And most importantly he held onto the ball for a freaking long time. He still does honestly. He likes to head hunt. He likes the big play. And he can get locked into his first read. 

Stroud on the other hand is better at progressing through his reads. He doesn‚Äôt hold onto the ball as long though it‚Äôs certainly not ideal where he‚Äôs whipping it. Him reading defenses though it‚Äôs not as bad as fields it‚Äôs a work in progress. He‚Äôs still learning like how to do things post snap where he sees certain rotations. And that‚Äôs fine. He improved as the year went on at Ohio state in my opinion. 

The biggest knock in stroud though is his inconsistent pocket presence. He struggles under pressure. And that‚Äôs something that once again can get better. But it‚Äôs just intrinsically hard to know when to run. When to hag tall and push etc. that being said during the last game of the year against Georgia I thought he had great pocket presence against the best front and defense he ever saw so that‚Äôs encouraging.  

The final knock on stroud is he doesn‚Äôt really test man coverage. Which is fair. Everyone at Ohio state screams open so he doesn‚Äôt have to. Like he‚Äôs done it and made good throws. Just not enough. Especially for how often he‚Äôll see it at the next level. And his athleticism isn‚Äôt as monsterous as fields so he doesn‚Äôt have that to fall back on. Which means that it‚Äôll be harder for him to develop compared to monster athletes like fields or Richardson where you have to change your game plan to account for the legs. 

Once again I like stroud as a prospect. I think he‚Äôs good. I think he has a lot to learn at the next level and he‚Äôll have to be very attentive to detail. But I do believe in him as a QB. Enough to trade up for him. Yes.

10909,62789,62789,Hefty-Association-59,"Mac also had a great defense though. That‚Äôs a major difference. That front in NE is not talked about and I think next year it will be. Bill had found very good pass rushers and their cheap too for now. And on the back end their growing and are underrated. 

Meanwhile chicago traded away their best LB. A top 5 LB in the league. Who was the final piece of duct tape holding together flus defense before it crumbled. They have a couple good pieces in the secondary to build off of. But that front 4-7 is easily like the worst front I‚Äôve seen in my entire life. It‚Äôs so terrible. Like words cannot describe it. They can‚Äôt rush the passer. They can‚Äôt stop the run. They were just absolutely abysmal. Which forced fields to put up insane numbers for them to even have a chance. 

I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into them not winning as a knock on fields. He has plenty of knocks and areas to improve especially when it comes to whipping that head around. But when I see people criticize the bears almost nobody goes after the defense which was easily worst in the league. It‚Äôs just not an environment conducive to growth.

TE. We have Ian Thomas and Tommy tremble. And that rhule nepotism guy who I can‚Äôt remember. They‚Äôve got brate. Otton. And the remains of Rudolph. Even though that room isn‚Äôt impressive I mean we‚Äôre fielding Ian Thomas. They‚Äôve got it. 

Rb. Raschad white. And fournette. We‚Äôve got chuba and foreman. I‚Äôll give us the better Rb room. 

QB. As of last week it wasn‚Äôt close with Tom. As of this moment it‚Äôs up in the air. They both suck lmao. 

Line. They‚Äôve got mason. Whirfs. Who are both amazing. And JC tressed got hurt. Donovan smith is fine too I guess. Meanwhile we‚Äôve got of course icky Moton Brady corbertt and boze. I‚Äôll give us the line. 

Now let‚Äôs flip over to the defensive side. Let‚Äôs start with DT. We‚Äôve got brown and Matt. A good duo. Borderline great. They‚Äôve got vita vea who‚Äôs elite especially in the run. And akiem hicks. Who‚Äôs a beat too. I think they take us here. 

Edge they‚Äôve got Barrett great. And they‚Äôve got joe tryon shoyinka who‚Äôs fine. We‚Äôve got burns and ygm. I‚Äôll give it to us here because I just love burns. I think he‚Äôs amazing. I don‚Äôt think he gets enough credit on this sub. 

Now let‚Äôs do LB. We‚Äôve got Shaq who I think is like the 12-10th best in the game. And then we‚Äôll say luvu. They‚Äôve got Devin white who‚Äôs okay. Terrible kn coverage. Great at blitzing. And Lavinte David. Who‚Äôs just insane. Top 5 LB. They‚Äôve got LB. 

Now let‚Äôs do corner. Carlton Davis. Jamel dean. And Sean Murphy button. I love Horne. But that corner room is better and it‚Äôs not close and if you can‚Äôt see that you don‚Äôt watch the bucs. 

As for safety we‚Äôve got Chinn coming off the down year and woods who‚Äôs fine. Sean Murphy button is like insane as a safety. Top in the league. And Mike Edwards just like woods is kind of fine. Safety easily goes to them again.

Also I listen to that franchise guy on YouTube and each year he does a break down in depth of each team. And he watches the film too from the previous year in preparation.

I just tend to value proven young players over draft picks in terms of compensation. And the league tends to back that up. The reason why they trade them is because either their cash poor, the player is disgruntled, old, overpaid, or a new regime comes in and wants to go a different direction.

I'm not pounding the table for us to draft one of these guys, but there are very obvious benefits to adding a borderline elite talent at the position, of which there are many this year. To act like drafting a quality TE in the 2nd round is a waste of a pick is equal parts ignorant and dismissive of the actual value of the position lol.

It's a garbage year to be looking for off-ball LB help in the draft, same with Tackles and, to an extent, Guards (though Center is surprisingly deep). Filling holes is for free agency; the draft is where you add upside talent that can turn your roster from average to elite, and the best way to have a bad draft is to chase perceived needs at talent-shallow positions while ignoring the inherent value in taking someone from a position group with a deeper talent well.

Plus, let's not ignore the fact that as a franchise, we've had amazing success when we've added talent to a position of strength; we drafted Jon Beason when we still had Dan Conner, took Luke when we still had Beason and Thomas Davis, took Shaq when we still had Davis & Kuechly, took J-Stew when we already had D-Will and created double trouble, signed Jeremy Shockey the year we traded for Greg Olsen (and had a ton of success with 2 TE sets), and more.

Skipping over a quality player at a position bc you're ""all set"" there is a great way to miss out on creating an elite position group. Doubling down on high-end talent at the same positions is how the Eagles created an OL factory, how the Bengels put together the best WR room in the league, and how the Niners built a legendary front 7.

Those goals may seem high, but the reality of the situation is that if your new HC isn't making the playoffs by year 2, the odds he ever will are relatively minuscule. There's been a ton of statistical analysis done on this.

* Take last year's coaching carousel. 10 new HCs hired last year, 5 of them made the playoffs their 1st year. And 3 of those 5 were 1st-time HCs. Sirianni was the only rookie HC to make the playoffs in 2021, and look at the Eagles now

* [Based on data since 2008](https://www.the33rdteam.com/category/breakdowns/deep-dive-evaluating-success-rate-for-first-year-head-coaches/), new rookie HCs are about *41.7% more likely* to make the playoffs than new HCs who had prior head coaching experience. Aka, the favoritism towards first-year HCs has statistical merit

* Coaches who [don't make the playoffs](https://the-cauldron.com/nfl-head-coaches-hired-during-the-last-ten-years-a-look-at-the-data-a41e2e68a1b6) last an average of 2.1 years

* I can't find a link to the exact stat, but I remember a tweet or something that said if a new hire at HC doesn't make the playoffs in either of his first two years, the odds of him *ever* making the playoffs with the team that hired him was like 9%, to expand on the above point.

I get what you're saying here. To me, the reality of the QB position these days is that the top QB prospects are going to be coming from loaded programs far more often than not, and that's only going to be moreso the case now with NIL and free transfers.

- QBs drafted since 2017 who've shown flashes that came from loaded offenses (10): Deshaun Watson, Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray, Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Justin Herbert, Jalen Hurts, Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields, Mac Jones

- QBs drafted since 2017 who've shown flashes that weren't surrounded by NFL talent (3-5): Mahomes, Lamar, Josh Allen, Daniel Jones (maybe), Trey Lance (maybe).

And before y'all say ""that's 3 of the 4 best QBs in the NFL, that's my point,"" here's the list of the rest of 

- the QBs drafted since 2017 in the top 64 who didn't come from blue blood ""loaded"" offenses (6): Mitch Trubisky, Josh Rosen, Drew Lock, Jordan Love, Zach Wilson, Kyle Trask, Kenny Pickett. That's not including Sam Darnold and DeShone Kizer.

Avoiding guys who played with a bunch of 5*s in college isn't the silver bullet people think it is.

The only real thing Levis has going for him is a loose comp to having similar physical tools to Josh Allen...who is arguably the most unexpected QB success story in modern football history. He made unprecedented improvements in his mechanics and processing ability in order to become who he is today. That's not the comp you want your potential #1 guy to have.

But his natural talent would shine through and he'd still succeed enough to show promise that he could be great. Maybe even wins MVP with his mediocre surrounding cast and coaching and makes it to the super bowl. Maybe he is forced to use his athleticism more to make up for that cast and gets hurt. Maybe injuries pile up for him and his throwing talent diminishes, ending his career. The Cam Newton playbook is right there.

Richardson has elite speed but doesn't jump the gun on using it. In my opinion pocket presence is one of those things you can't teach. His main knock is accuracy which we've seen is fixable, and he would instantly have a top 5 arm in the league power wise. Levis on the other hand makes terrible decisions very similarly to darnold, which we've seen is much more difficult to teach someone out of.

It's not good for a rebuilding team to come in last when we list the value of the rookie classes in 2022, but here we are. It didn't help that the Panthers had no second-round pick, sending that to the Jets in the Sam Darnold trade. Almost all of Carolina's rookie value came from one man, first-round pick and starting left tackle Ikem Ekwonu. He was unspectacular (46th out of 63 qualifying tackles in PBWR, for example) but started every game and still has plenty of promise for growth. The only other rookie worth more than two Total Points in SIS metrics was undrafted running back Raheem Blackshear, who was useful as a receiver with 10 catches for 93 yards.

- No way Evero is fine with being turned down by the Panthers for a HC spot only to turn around and take their DC spoy

Rebuttal: It was common knowledge that the Panthers were not hiring a defensive head coach anyways. Chances are maybe we brought Evero in as a HC interview, but used it for both sides to get feelers for him being DC instead

- Wilf will absolutely not be out-bid, the Vikings ownership has and will continue to spend money

Rebuttal: Yes, they're both billionaires, but Teppers near $20 billion net worth absolutely trumps the Wilf's $2 billion combined

- It's better for Evero getting a HC spot by taking a bottom of the league Vikings defense to top half than taking an already good Panthers defense to a slightly higher level

Rebuttal: There is, unfortunately for the Vikings, no guarantee that would be the case. Their defensive roster may not even be in shape for even a small improvement, much less a large one. Meanwhile, the Panthers are going to likely look good, and that just plays better for Evero when he's showing off his 2023 work

- Ties to their HC and GM

Rebuttal: We learned this, actually, that ties aren't everything. Vic Fangio has ties to Charlotte (his first ever DC job) and Reich (Panthers QB when Fangio coached for us), but still passed over the Panthers for Miami.

Demeco Ryans would never allow third string DBs to get roasted over and over again in man coverage when they should never be put in that position in the first place. He made Mitch Tribusky look like he was still playing for UNC because he refused to give help in obvious passing situations. Tribusky actually converted a 3rd &18 because he refused to stop playing man with scrub DBs. Same thing happened in the TB game. Go watch the  highlights.

Um, this is a criticism of the o-line for collapsing which will hinder any QB. Also, you clearly haven't seen him escape pressure and create plays off of it which he did well when he started playing again this season.

This doesn't make sense. Shit coaches lead to shit play from the entire team. He looked really good this season when he came back against some fairly good opponents. If we get a good coaching staff and some more offensive talent he can use other than just DJ Moore I'd bet that'd elevate.

How many seasons do you really want to waste on this obvious bust of a QB?

You really think you can accurately gauge his potential for playing under a shit Jets team and RhuleMacaDoodoo? Nobody is going to look good under those conditions.

>None of you knows what we'd have to sell to get him. The QB evaluation process hasn't even started yet. Remember when Justin Fields was the consensus #2 prospect before Lance and Wilson leapfrogged him in the pre-draft process and he fell into our laps?

We pick 9th. I seriously doubt he's gonna fall that far with the Texans, Colts, Raiders, and Falcons picking ahead of us.

>If he's sitting there at #3, I want to go get him. Hell, if the FO is convinced he'll be a franchise QB, I want them to go get him at #1. But the reality is that the pre-draft process hasn't even started yet, and nobody knows how this will shake out. There are risers and fallers all the time.

Again, we pick 9th. See my previous response to your quote above. We'd had to sell so much and cripple ourselves just to get him.

23663,154113,154113,TwoDimensionalCube83,I honestly have no idea if Darnold is the guy or not. PJ is definitely not the guy. I want to see a full season of Darnold with come competency in the coaching staff and someone else besides DJ Moore to throw the ball to. I think Foreman can fill the RB1 position for us well enough but ideally we get someone to take on that position within the next few years. I know everyone on this sub disagrees with me and thinks I'm an idiot for saying this but I don't think Darnold has ever been given a fair shot to see what his ceiling actually is. He was on a garbage Jets team that was still garbage after he came here and he was on a garbage Panthers team coached by the worst HC in franchise history and had one of the worst possible OC's that the game has ever seen in Macadoo. Bundle that up with having only one receiver that is a threat and a running game that was dead until Foreman started to give it some life again and you have an offense that nobody can succeed in. I stand by that position too. Maybe I'm wrong and everyone else is right but I just don't see how you can come to that conclusion about Darnold given what he's had to play for.

1) He's a quick learner. Maybe not *within* a game, but he studies. What works against him one game doesn't in future ones. He doesn't have perfect field vision - he'll often miss the 1st read coming open, bounce to the second, and then bail out. But he seems like the kind of guy where if you pull that clip and show it to him, he gets it. Darnold could never.

2) His shittier throws are a function of trusting physicality more than scheme and sound mechanics. Sound like another quarterback you know? It's something that can overcome when your QB is trained to be more thoughtful.

3) He's not that ""raw""! Raw means unrefined instincts. Good traits, sloppy mechanics, intuition over strategy. Richardson learns his playbook. He's growing every game. He would probably take a while to be ready for the pros but that's just because those aren't concepts he's using right now. He's not a year-3 project, he's a year-2 project, like most rookie QBs.

Look, being a team owner is like getting offered the opportunity to buy like, Coca-Cola. It's blue-chip, the margins are all but set in stone, it generates an extremely high ""floor"" of profit. You will always pay 100% of your cap in the long run, and you will always get your share of the league's national broadcast revenues. Getting a great head coach and watchable QB that leads teams into the playoffs consistently is about the only thing you can do to make those profits go up, through stadium revenues and logo licensing, which you get more of if the team is winning or the fanbase is devoted, or both.

It makes complete sense to reward a guy who made those extra revenues possible.

Ellis Williams article from today with some interesting tid bits from a guy I think has a good read on the organization. Article specifically states that both Reich and the organization want to avoid a retread at QB and that Carr would benefit more from the panthers than the panthers would from him (I agree).

It's worth noting that both of these QBs were on rookie contracts at the time of their Super Bowl seasons. That allowed the team around them to be substantially better because the cap space could be allocated in other areas. 
Afterward, they both signed massive contracts that they didn't even come close to living up to, which actively hurt their teams.

It's hard to argue the ROI on them was good, although the Eagles did somehow fleece the Colts for a 1st and a 3rd while dumping most of his contract. That doesn't seem like a repeatable strategy.

Also /r/panthers: Why don't we have any cap space next year?

I'll tell you why!

1. Taylor Moton - (restructured) - $24.5 million cap number - $18 million salary
2. Shaq Thompson - (restructured) - $24.5 million cap number - $13 million salary
3. Christian McCaffrey - (restructured, traded) - $18 million dead cap hit
4. Robbie Anderson - (restructured, traded) - $10 million dead cap hit
5. Matt Ioannidis - (void year) - $4 million cap hit

Between those 5 players alone that's $50 million of ""borrowed"" money. And yet we have NOTHING to show for it. That's 5 straight seasons with a losing record, and every year the Panthers had tens of millions of dollars in dead cap. There's a time to mortgage your future, like the Bills did signing Von Miller, but that should be a ""break glass in case of emergency"" tactic reserved for teams who have a legitimate shot to win the Super Bowl.

The Giants have the playbook for what the Panthers need to do. They took their medicine last year and refused to kick the can down the road any more. They ate their bad contracts and hit the reset button on their salary cap. And they still managed to make the playoffs!

As far as Levis going 1.1, I think he's QB3 but nothing would surprise me at this point. I think it's likely the Colts will trade up to 1 to get their guy, and it very well might not be Bryce Young.

It's also too early to judge the draft. Corral never got a chance to show what he could do. Cade Mays looks like a steal. Smith / Barno are both developmental players who could have a bigger role moving forward. Smith already played significant snaps on special teams. Overall it wasn't a bad draft considering the Panthers came into it with exactly one top 100 pick.

The reason everyone is high on Fitt is his really good 2021 draft. The first 5 picks were all hits. Then there are 3 more guys who are at least backup-level players (depends on how you view Shi Smith). Fitterer could have another really good draft with a full deck of cards this year.
