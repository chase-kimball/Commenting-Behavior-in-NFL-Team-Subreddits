I am not saying we should draft a QB this year in the first round or even the second but I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement above.


2017: Mitchell Trubisky(bust), Patrick Mahomes(Great), Deshaun Watson(talented)

2018: Baker Mayfield(meh), Sam Darnold(Bust), Josh Allen(great), Josh Rosen(bust), Lamar Jackson(Great)

2019: Kyler Murray(Above Average), Daniel Jones(above average), Dwanye Haskins (r.i.p) 

2020: Joe Burrow(Great), Tua(Above average), Justin Herbert(Above Average), Jordan Love(Might be decent? idk)

2021: TLaw(Good), Zach Wilson(Bust), Trey Lance(Might be good), Justin Fields(I would say above average), Mac Jones(probably the median NFL QB)

Beyond that I went into this mock assuming A.) we cut Lenny and Smith B.) we bring Stinnie back to compete with Hainsey/Goedeke for LG and C.) we sign a vet QB to be the starter next year. 

R1: 19 - Trade. Sent 19 to the Vikings for  pick 23, 87, 160 and a 2024 *fourth. I thought about staying here for Witherspoon, but ultimately I felt that we have a lot of needs at a lot of positions without a lot of cap or picks so I moved down. 

R1: 23 - Broderick Jones, OT UGA. Smith replacement. He’s a great athlete and was a solid starter for the Dawgs. 

R2: 50 - Keion White, EDGE GT. He had an excellent senior bowl and has a size/speed combo that would let us use him all over the DL. 

R3: 82 - Sean Tucker, RB Syracuse. He had a down year compared to expectations for sure, but he has an endearing twitter (check it out sometime) and a three down skill set. I think he could be a great 2 or 1B with White with 1A upside. I especially love that a Tucker/White backfield leaves us with two backs with good size, speed, and pass catching ability. It keeps teams from keying in on what we're trying to do offensively based on which RB is in the game (Martin/Sims, Lenny/Rojo, this entire year). 

R3: 87 - Jaquelin Roy, IDL LSU. He's a good athlete that could contribute as a member of the IDL rotation early on. He offers some theoretical pass rush upside if he can become a full time player next to Vita. This hopefully stops the carousel of Vita Vea adjacent vets that we pay 10 million for 5 million dollars worth of production. 

R4: 121 - Trey Palmer, WR Nebraska. He has a case of the drops, but he has good size and speed and managed to produce despite the drops. The way I see it, there's a 0% chance we get 17 games out of Mike/Godwin/Gage, so drafting a guy with good tools who can develop and serve as an injury fill in can't hurt. 

R5: 155 - Trey Dean III, S Florida. I realized it was the fifth round and I hadn't touched the secondary. 

R5: 160 - Mekhi Garner, CB LSU. See above. 

R5: 175 - Deuce Vaughn, RB Kansas State. I almost took him at both of the above picks, but I just couldn't pass on him here. Is he tiny? Yes. Is he an absolute baller? Also yes. He could be our starting punt returner day 1, push Tucker and White for snaps between the 20s, and has the receiving chops to make some 2RB sets very very interesting if we have a creative OC. 

R6: 196 - Luke Schoonmaker, TE Michigan. Kieft is more of a FB than true TE, and Schoonmaker has the size/receiving skills to be a versatile TE2 behind Otton (assuming we move on from Brate). 

R7: 232 - Carlton Martial, LB Troy. BPA. 

R7: 238 - Cameron Mitchell, CB Northwestern. BPA. 

R7: 253 - Max Duggan, QB TCU. I was stoked he was here. Duggan is likely never a full time NFL starter, but he is mobile and a team leader. Watch the guts he played with while clearly hurting against both Michigan and UGA during TCU's playoff run. I think he could be a solid back-up for a long long time just based on those intangibles.

Hooker will be a 25 year old rookie. He’ll also miss most of the season with his ACL injury.

Does it work like your old cable box DVR where you had SuperBowl XXXVIII on there taking up a big chunk of the space, but you can watch it forever?  And you can never upgrade your DVR, because if you do you lose it?  No.

When you want to add an episodic show you just add it to your library.  So you search for spongebob, and add it.  You immediately get access to VODs, which often will have unskippable commercials, and you may not have access to all episodes.  But as shows air, you get access to the broadcast versions of the show, and you can skip through commercials on these.  These stay available for about a year.

If you search for a live event, like 'NFL Playoffs' it will show you the upcoming games and then you can add one particular game, games on a network, any game for a team, etc.  It does this for most categories of sports... So if you're a big NCAA Women's Volleyball fan, you just tell it to record all the games, or games for a particular team.   It will keep any event whether it was aired on FSN/ BIG / SEC / whatever.   

Now obviously there's some plusses and minuses.  On the plus side, it's super easy to just tell it what you're interested in and it keeps all that.

Is it accurate enough to be useful in those super hard calls to make?  How often does it need to be calibrated, and is at the beginning of the game enough?  What can cause it to become out of calibration?

Did the runner have possession, were they down, were they in bounds all has to be be taken into account.   For a chipped ball to really work, it needs to take the full ball into account, be aware of orientation, and you'd have to have information between video  and ball location sync'd nearly exactly.  

It's a tough problem to solve, with a lot of little details that have to be worked out, and it has to be perfect otherwise it won't be trusted.   It's a really big ask.

I think for now, the chips can provide some interesting stats and data, because that's their purpose at this point.   I think you'd want to see this work well in something like hockey or soccer first where there's less complications on determining a score. 

The biggest mistake could be implementing something like this, and having it fail horribly with visual evidence.

I like Mafi as well but I think Broaderick Jones (if he falls to 19) is wayyyy too good to pass up. The problem is that the positions we need are not very deep in this draft. This draft class in general is a little weak across the board. So outside of probably the first 2 rounds it’s kinda a crapshoot hoping some of these picks pan out. 

The injury concerns of HH are fair and not unpopular. But if he’s healthy he’s gonna be a hell of steal down there. He grades out as an elite prospect with great character that can lead a team. Not sure some teams with an older qb won’t take a shot on him.

6448,49021,49021,Fbgotschman,"Interesting mock. I have serious doubts we go with Edge as our 1st pick. Even given the need. If we trade at all I think we try to trade to secure an OL (whether a LT or a LG). I love the Darnell pick. I get what everyone is saying about Cade but when you have a guy with his measurables, the upside is too great to pass up if he’s available here. I have doubts that Hendon will fall low enough for us but if he’s there in the 3rd he’s a must get. And I’m not sold Trask isn’t the guy yet. 

What’s interesting to me is that you have us waiting until round 5 to get a corner knowing we are likely going to have to replace 2/3 DBs due to free agency. I like Riley moss and I think he’s a little underrated in the draft but I think we’re gonna have to try to get someone sooner to replace SMB, Edwards, or Dean. 

To’o To’o will be a steal that low. But only if we let Lavonte David walk. We have decent guys to step in behind him so replenishing that depth would be nice. If we resign, pass on the LB need to a future draft. 

Lastly, idk if you have Stockholm syndrome and want to watch Donovan smith get 65 holding calls again next year, or if you are just high on TJ bass but we HAVE to get a replacement for that clown. I hope we try to offload him in some way but we’ve got to get an upgrade if we don’t plan on wasting Godwin and M1K3’s careers.

Play calling sucked all year. But Bowles didn’t pick his play caller on offense. Yet he gets all the blame. He lost BA, who hid Leftwich from being outed as a bad OC. But he’s a defensive minded guy who’s already functioning as DC and HC. And he has no viable alternative to Leftwich because again… it’s not his staff.

A team can theoretically forfeit. And the refs can rig every game by awarding the team they want to win 100 points. So we’re both right!",1.0,buccaneers,t3_10bxy7d,False,0.0,:RedJersey13: Mike Evans,2023-01-15T14:01:44Z,buccaneers,0.0093501352136799

No team is going to forfeit and not field a team. The NFL would punish them. This is just the reality. If you disagree, you really don’t understand the game. 

Every ad buyer would be pissed. The NFL is a business. If you think shutting the down the business entirely is something that will ever happen, I don’t think you understand the game. 

Refs can also give points to teams. They don’t need to score. We never see it happen because there are unwritten rules in the game. If a team breaks those, they’re going to be punished. 

Sure, you can forfeit. But, if a team actually did that, the NFL would take away draft picks at the very least. Games are played no matter what. The exception was when a guy nearly died on the field.

* Aaron Rodgers is the ONLY starting QB who has been with his team 8 years. If he moves to another team, he would lose this benefit, and Jordan Love wouldn't be eligible for it for another 4 years.
* The next closest would be Dak Prescott, who will play his 8th season next year. So any extension he signs in Dallas after 2023 would be eligible. Mahomes has 6 years of service, Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen have 5, all others who were drafted by their current teams have 4 years or less, so they're no more than halfway to eligible --- and all would have to sign a contract extension between now and then, which is not a guarantee.

\* We don't have any idea who will start for Las Vegas, but we know it won't be Derek Carr, so I omitted him. He would have also qualified this year, but would lose the benefit if Vegas cuts or trades him.  


\*\* 20 if Trask starts, but he's still a long way from 8 years.

In this example, instead of telling Evans, we can't afford to go above $20m for the cap, instead they can say ""we will go to $21m and use the legacy tag on you"" and then if he agrees to the $21m, it only counts $20m against the cap because of the tag.",1.0,buccaneers,t3_10vj6ua,True,0.0,:buccobrucewhite: ,2023-02-07T11:06:21Z,buccaneers,0.114425

9693,64730,64730,JaedenStormes,"Starting over doesn't mean 100 percent of the team leaves. There is still a pretty decent nucleus here, just need to fill a couple of very large holes.

We know this year is going to be rough anyway because we are in cap hell, So go ahead and give Trask the year to see what he does. Use this year's draft on as many OL, DL, and CB as we can get. 

In 2024, if Trask did well, we don't need a quarterback. If he didn't, we will have a very high pick to be able to draft one. We only ask Evans and David to sit through one bad year, maybe two while the rookie QB does rookie things.

Looking at other positions, if David is one of your ""keep at all costs"" guys, I'm okay letting White walk. Might need a cheap FA there for a year. Still have our safeties for now.

IMO, Succop can go and be replaced with the kid we always have in camp. Camarda isn't going anywhere.

Rachaad White is the truth, and we have Vaughn there too. Wouldn't hate getting a more fullback type guy, but Kieft might be able to do some of that.

At WR, you let Julio and Perriman walk. Miller you can resign cheap. Deven Thompkins is staying. Bring back Cyril Grayson. Could potentially even trade Godwin. Gage is under contract for two more years, though I might cut him depending on the cap ramifications. He's overpaid and way injury prone.

Otton and Kieft look pretty good at TE. Might have to let Brate go for cap. 

This team would be thin as fuck on the depth chart and injuries could torpedo us, but other than QB you have at least a mostly decent starting group.

Essentially, it's to help prevent guys like Evans, Lavonte, and Brady, and Montana and Favre and Rodgers, and John Lynch and Warren Sapp, from having to leave the only team they've been with and have been a fan favorite for, for one or two more years in the league over cap money.",36.0,buccaneers,t3_10vj6ua,True,0.0,:buccobrucewhite: ,2023-02-06T16:48:56Z,buccaneers,0.21065

“Play action doesnt work when the running game isnt working.”

We know this to be factually inaccurate. Theirs been tons of statistical analysis done. On top of that when the team rarely did run play action they were 4th best in the NFL.  

Our receivers were covered 65% of all plays. Highest in the league including the Chargers. Simply put, he did not scheme guys open on play calls. There was made little to no adjustments. 

Injuries happen, its on the coaching staff to be productive with what you have. Leftwich didnt have the ability nor the interest in growing/challenging his frame of thought.   

Bad run play design, we consistently pulled tackles loke Donovan Smith who clearly isnt built for that. We consistently ran at players we had no business running at. Poor fundamentals on who should block
Who, none of it was good and players would constantly make mistakes on who their assignment was. Thats mainly coaching to work out those kinks. 

Bad redzone designs- Bradys throwaway interception against the cowboys is the epitome of how poorly designed our offense was. Why in gods name would be have our top 2 receivers, tight end, and running back, run to the same spot in the endzone. It legitimately made no sense and tons of our play calling was like this. 

Simply put, this is because Arians understood how to put players in a position to make plays, Leftwich did not. Thats why he redlined the game plans and was hoping Leftwich would learn it.

>Do you think they're going to try to clean house this year then? 

No, I think theyre going to let Bowles hire a ""competent"" offensive staff that he likes and theyre going to empower him with his vision.

I think when Bowles got promoted he had to coach with a staff that didn't necessarily fit what he wanted to do and be offensively.

This depends on how the cards fall, if Bradys not back and we dont get an alternative QB whose a star, we will rebuild. If he decides magically to give it another shot with us, we will retool somehow. I dont know how, but Licht is brilliant at making things work contractually. 

>Maybe they go one more year with Bowles (maybe with more influence from BA)?

BA will be an advisor, he wont give opinions unless asked, because its not his team anymore and hes good at letting things go like that. They'll give Bowles another shot, Not leftwich though, he will be gone, we will either fire him now, or fire him by mid season for not being able to do the job effectively. I have no faith in him based on his interview answers about play action etc. He fundamentally doesnt understand playcalling when he thinks play action doesnt work without the run.

>I'm sure he came in on Fridays and fucked with the gamelan when he was coach. I'm also sure that at least had a part to play in why he is no longer head coach after 2 very successful seasons in a row.

Health and the idea of him leaving a legacy of good coaches in his tree/installing them. BA has always been a major mover for the black community having coaching positions. 

I think what did BA in was more so him realizing he would be leaving Bowles and Leftwich with a shit situation if he didnt retire sooner. I believe that was genuine. What made Brady and BA such a phenomenal pair was their differences in philosophy. Brady was more aggressive than he ever had been with downfield passing with us, once it clicked, it was beautiful after the bye week ( we did adjust to bring in some more of what Brady liked that super bowl year after the bye week if you remember.)

There was none of that this year, because Leftwich was in over his head. He reminds me of McDaniels, someone who seems to on paper have all the tools, but as a person just isnt someone who can get the job done. Hell man, Mcdaniels won a bunch of super bowls with Brady. But everyone still thinks hes an ass head coach, and rightly so. I feel like Leftwich is that same way, but people were afraid to bash him in the media all season because 1. He got propped up by media because of a push to get more black representation at head coach and 2. Saying anything about his performance negatively will bring out the ""racism"" argument without looking at the facts. 

I hate that, because objective truth in performance, lack of adjustments, inability to have a competent game plan around weaknesses, its a failure on a coach. Protecting him wont make the product better, it will actually make him worse off because he will be unaware of how he can get better.

We got our asses put over a knee and spanked like children because of poor coaching, poor gameplanning, and frankly besides their defensive end we out talent them and out match them at almost every position besides running back.

> Brady unretires and comes back... coincidence?

Probably not, but you can clearly see a massive difference between what Leftwich tried to do versus what Arians did. 

Takeaway:

Brady thought we should run the ball more, he got an OC who did that, with an Oline that isnt built for it. Arians tried to tell Brady that it wouldnt work with who we have. What you see is the evidence that Arians knew his players and their strengths better than Leftwich did from a coaching perspective, and Brady was hoping we could functionally run the ball without leaning on the pass. 

Every game we had to come back because we would start out more run heavy, and never establish the pass in a way that made us a threat, all short passes to players who are not good in tight space. We didnt have the personnel.

18955,127155,127155,TheFencingCoach,"Yeah this firing might make a difference next season, but in all likelihood it won't. My thoughts are: 

* I'd put Brady's chances at returning to the Bucs at ~25% or less. I don't know if he's going to retire or go to a contender, but I think we've seen the last of him in a Bucs uniform. 

* With our playoff appearance, we're not really in a position to draft a franchise QB in this upcoming draft. That leaves us with the Blaine Train and the Trasilisk or a free agent journeyman like Jacoby Brissett, Geno Smith, Baker Mayfield, or Jimmy G. With or without Leftwich, whichever OC comes in is probably going to realize that: this isn't a long-term job prospect in Tampa (Bowles is definitely on the hot seat at this point) and he doesn't have a lot of QB talent to work with. Not ideal. 

* We have a million guys about to become free agents and we're about to be $55M over the cap. Brady's cap figure next season (whether he's with or not) is massive. This team as we know it is about to get gutted like a fish, and I'm of the belief this team now needs to go into tank/rebuild mode. Hate to say it, but some of our guys like Shaq Barrett (coming off torn Achilles with a $21.M cap figure), Donovan Smith ($15.2M savings if cut after June 1), and even Lavonte David are going to be on the chopping block this coming offseason.

I figured out that the Bucs' falloff this year is the 27th greatest since 2000 from EPA/play, out of the 373 teams that regressed for one season since then. So 93rd percentile regression!

Since I found that I decided to make some figures.

I was curious if Bowles would get fired (couldn't do the same for OCs) so I made this:

https://imgur.com/jnAPNMn

As you can see, it doesnt seem like a regression from last season is actually a huge predictor of whether a HC is fired or not. This makes sense broadly, if your team is really good and stayed good, who cares? If you did improve a lot, congrats, your job is safe! It is not the same if you regress a lot, however. If you make a line to show all the teams that regressed about as much as the 22 Bucs, I believe it was 53% got fired.

Now I know it definitely looks like Bowles won't get fired, I basically made this right after the regular season ended but it took me awhile to make it look pretty haha.

> So yesterday after the Day of Accountability saw several Bucs assistants retire or get fired, a curious name seemed to have survived the bloodletting.

> At least for the time being.

> That name is Keith Armstrong, the Bucs’ special teams coach. And unfortunately for Armstrong and more so the Bucs, the special teams since he’s been with Tampa Bay have been anything but special.

> Rich Gosselin, former Chiefs and Cowboys beat man for the Kansas City Star and the Dallas Morning News, as well as a former NFL columnist, has long had annual special teams rankings each year that are lauded for research and accuracy by NFL types, including Bill Belicheat.

> Since Armstrong came on board with the Bucs in 2019, the Bucs’ special teams have never been ranked higher than 22nd.

> In 2021,Gosselin ranked the Bucs’ special teams at 29th. In 2020, they ranked 22nd. In 2019, the Bucs special teams were ranked by Gosselin dead-last in the NFL, No. 32.

> This really isn’t anything new for Armstrong. In his last two seasons with Atlanta, Armstrong’s special teams struggled as well. In 2018, Gosselin had the Dixie Chicks at No. 20. In 2017, Gosselin’s numbers had Atlanta at No. 22.

> (Gosselin’s previous special teams breakdowns are stashed behind a paywall at the Dallas Morning News.)

> So in the past five seasons (not counting the 2022 season), none of Armstrong’s special teams were ranked higher than No. 20.

> To paraphrase “The Church Lady,” that’s not very special.

> Contrast this with the jettisoning of kicking coach Chris Boniol. The Bucs’ kicking game was the only thing decent about the special teams. It was good.

> Succop is one of the more reliable kickers in the NFL so long as you don’t ask him to kick 54-yard field goals. Punter Jake Camarda, as a rookie, has become one of the NFL’s better punters.

* Devin White takes a couple bad angles and is out of position on a few big runs.  Were in the right spot (a matter of just a foot or so) he has some TFL's or short gains.
* SMB playing 10 yards off but still looking like he is playing man.  This is more scheme than play, but still WTF.
* Mike Edwards looking lost in coverage.
*  Fournette cutting back right into a tackle when he had two blockers and lots of green if he keeps running to the outside.  Easily at least a 3-5 yard (at minimum) difference.
* Julio Jones putting in zero effort to make a block on a screen to Godwin.
*  Julio Jones throwing his hands up pre-snap indicating he doesn't know what the play is.
*  Julio Jones going in motion and Brady immediately telling him to go the other way.
*  Brady throwing into quad coverage across the field to Brate.
*  If Mike Evans was Gronk on that same throw to Brate, it would have been a TD.  I feel Gronk would have saw what was going down and cut to the right to be WIIIIDE open for a walk in score.  Mike just stops his route and watches the rest of the play.
*  WTF were Evans and Gage doing on the Brady INT?  If you rewatch that play, they both loaf to the same spot in the field, which is also the same general area was who was hustling.  The only other receivers on the field were Otton who was engaged in blocks and White who looked like he was just a dump off option to the right.

25085,153561,153561,dragonsky,"Oh, we are sharing memories of the Super Bowl?

Cool, let me share mine, which is very  dumb and not at all cool like yours LMAO.

As you can see from my flair, I am one of the foreign fans in this subreddit, and I have told my story before, but I think this is a good chance for me to repeat it.

I started watching the NFL that season and naturally I knew NOTHING  about the league. Just a dumb idiot watching something.

But, my philosophy was that I should always find a team to root for since I was in my ""watch every sport"" phase.

In football (european) i chose my favorite teams based on the shirt color and that kinda stuck to this day.

I know in America it's different because you have bunch of local teams and you'd choose your fave team based on where you live.

But here it can be random. You liked one player, or you liked the logo, or you liked the city, or maybe you grew up with your father watching the sport and you wanted to be the opposite(or the same) of your father.

Well, when I was watching the NFL, I don't remember many games. I know that I was watching them random at start, trying to figure out the rules and how the sport goes.

Then, around december or so I was like ""Ok, let me start figuring things out, I should have a favorite team""

So, I found a Buccaneers game on TV. Naturally I loved the logo and I decided to cheer for that team during the game I watched.

Next game.... another Buccaneers game! ""Hey,this is the same team from last week!""

Next week...no Buccaneers game on TV, but I wanted to watch the same team I watched last two weeks! Now I started to bond with this team that I knew NOTHING about (what team is good in the NFL? Idk. Do I know what are the best players? Nope. But I knew what I was looking for on my TV whenever there's an NFL game!)

Fast forward and it's January.

I had no idea it was the playoffs actually since European football goes deep into May, and I knew the NBA also was going deep into May/June, so I figured out the NFL was similar to the NBA. I had no idea I was watching the playoffs!

I found the badass skull logo on my TV again. I watched the game. THEY WON! Yey.

Next week...ANOTHER BUCCANEERS GAME.

Now my fandom is solidified. This **is** my favorite NFL team! 

And then... I started seeing ads on TV.

THE BIGGEST GAME IN SPORTS. THE SUPER BOWL. DON'T MISS IT! WHO WILL WIN IT ALL??

...holy shit that's the logo I liked! OMG THEY MADE IT TO THE FINALS???? 

OMG as a new fan..I MUST WATCH THIS!! I HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE THAT GOOD AND THEY MIGHT WIN IT ALL! I HAD NO IDEA THE FINAL GAME WAS PLAYED IN JANUARY! 

But there was a problem.

American timezones are messed up and I was a young idiot that knew nothing.

I didn't even though at what time the game is going to be since the ads just said ""Don't miss the Super Bowl"" they didn't tell me the time or the date!

But I knew one thing:

NFL was shown on TV EVERY SUNDAY. And I remembered the usual timezones.

So this Sunday, I am going to sit in front of my TV until the game starts!

So the usual early time (1 PM ET for reference, the early Sunday games) comes... no Super Bowl (Ok, yeah, they wouldn't do the game this early)

Then another time (the 4PM games for reference, the later Sunday gamaes) comes..still no NFL. (Yeah, ok, it would probably be very late..)

I wait for another hour..and another hour..and another hour....no games on TV...eventually, I fall asleep.

When I woke up, I immediately checked the channel to see the sports news and see if my favorite team won or not!

...they didn't say anything.

Now I am bummed out, thinking I missed the big game.

But then....NFL ON TV!

They say it's a ""re-run"" from the last weekend!!!

""Wait...last weekend?? There was a game last weekend??? But...but...I waited all day...there was no football!!!""

And........it was the Pro Bowl game.

At the time, I  had no idea what the fuck was a Pro Bowl. I had no idea there was a big weekend of waiting between the Playoffs and the Super Bowl. 

And I definitely had no idea what the fuck was the Pro Bowl. I knew it wasn't what I wanted and waited for.

I gave up. I thought that I missed the big game and that i'll never watch it.

After the day passed and I didn't see any news about the NFL i decided that I missed the game and that I'll have to wait till next autumn for the NFL.

I gave up and lowkey forgot about it.

But....

One week later. Monday afternoon. They're showing a ""re-run"" (again, idk the word to use for this lol) of........the game last night????

""Wait...what??? I thought the season is over??? Is  this maybe a game from earlier in the season??? Hmm... Ok, idk, i'll watch it either way""

I watched the Super Bowl thinking it was a game from earlier in the season.... and as the game went on...I realized that it actually was the Super Bowl!!!

And I thiink I still wasn't sure that the game happened last night, I thought it happened a week or two ago and I just missed it back then lol.

I think I was lowkey disappointed it wasn't a close game.

And that's it.

Luck.

Not Andrew. But.. luck.

Trade some of the more expensive players, and keep the key players. This means that we may have to get rid of guys like Shaq or Lavonta for example.

Keep the key players like Godwin/Evans/Jensen/Vea

And then get lucky with the draft.

The team should look like this:

1/3 = Key players playing very good, players that would be important in every team.

1/3 = Rookies and younger players.

1/3 = Veterans that can still go and want one last shot at proving their worth.

This can work only with good coaching.

You swap a couple of veterans in the next 2 years.

Then, by 2025, the rookies should enter their 3rd season, and at this point you should know which ones of them are good and  you'd know if they can keep the team moving forward. If they're good...you continue with a similar project.

This time, guys like Evans and Godwin will be the veterans. Guys like Vea, White, Otton and the others would  be the Key players for us. And at this time you'd  have new young players and rookies.

It's all about luck and finding the right pieces.

What I'd say?

Well... i'd try to play on his legacy. How would  history remember him? Is it better for him to be remembered as a QB for 3 teams or someone who played for 2? I know this sounds stupid to you, but I think the legacy and the rememberance of Brady is a big factor for him. His childhood heroes didn't go from one team to another.

Other than that - he knows the team, he knows the franchise, he knows the place. Familiarity is a big thing.

I'd fire any coach he wants and i'd let him have a big say in that.

Also, we have a good squad. That's a big part of the pitch. ""Hey, we have guys like Vea and Evans and Gowdin and...you know they're one of the best in the league, with you..we'd be SB contenders. Going to another team? Learning a new team and all that? It's a gamble! 45 year olds can't allow to gamble this late in their careers""

Injuries - last season we had a lot of injuries. Next season we'd be healthier. We'd invest in some new players too. We'd rebuild.

Idk, I don't hink it can help...but I really think this is the approach to try to get him to stay. 

If he disagrees with me that this team can still be a SB calibre team+him ...then he will leave.

But I think Brady is smart and he knows that Godwin-Evans are one of the best WR duos in the league that he wont' get elsewhere.

Get Gronk back too! Godwin+Evans+Gronk? Brady would have to be an idiot not to think that this O would be better with a new Offensive coordinator. The D was decent this year. And he saw that White is a good RB, so he'll get even better.

How many teams out there can say they have a solid D and a great WR duo?

..probably one or two, but  the familiarity factor? The legacy factor? The fandom and the love for Brady?

That's my pitch for him. Don't gamble, let's try one last time. NFC South is shit. What other team has a shittier division??? Going to AFC? It's death!

Last game vs Falcons (we rested players), vs Bengals. We played well, and we fell apart in the 2nde half.

People that would free up the cap space and put us in a good position.  There are some players that are often injured or players that may not be worth the sallary. 


Also, in peak ""hey, I did this on Madden and it worked"" fashion.. I think the #19 draft pick would be perfect to trade.  Replacing injured, average, or overpaid players with cheaper free agents and draft picks would be a gamble that I think is worthy of trying. 

With, or without Brady, there are a couple of players that should get traded in the name of cap space and the future. I think the Pats approach of ""stock up on bunch of average players and use them to the max"" would've helped us this season. (Hypothetically...4 Tyler Johnsons probably would've done the same as Gage and Julio..for example). 

I hope we make the smart choices. I don't think a team with Vea, Jensen, Godwin and Evans paired with guys on rookie contracts like Shoyinka, White, Otton etc. should tank. We definitely have a very solid team that can be competitive in a shit NFC South division. With, or without Brady.

Coaching and good GMing can bring this team to the playoffs again.

27122,166352,166352,idaho22,"I am extremely active in this industry and was just clarifying your clarification was not completely spot on, albeit more true than the fake news headlines. He will still have to pay taxes on that income and hacked/stolen funds in crypto are not able to be written off via the IRS. This is at least true for on chain funds.. I'm not sure how custodial funds work in this situation. The bigger piece is Brady's money there is likely with FTX US which is solvent but going through a process so it may be some time before he sees it. This is a plus for Brady although he cannot access it. 

Plus - regarding FTX credit.. I have to wonder if that is in equity which is written down to worthless now (much better for his taxes) or the FTT token itself (which his income would show as the higher amount and if he has access to sell then that's when he would realize gains/losses. So I'm sure Brady has better lawyers than me but it's not that simple to assume he won't be left holding a potentially 7 or low 8 figure bag that comes out of his bigger pockets later. They could realistically make the claim that he never actually held any of the BTC/ETH if that was the credit because Sam was taking in customer deposits to pump FTT and never even bought the BTC/ETH in the first place.

So while you are correct that he didn't invest his entire net worth or 60% of it into FTX.. he still absolutely is going to take a hit financially and reputationally. Like I'm sure that he won't be doing advertisements for Well Fargo or Bank of America (or any financial service) anytime soon.

Add to that the class action lawsuits that people like Brady, Shaq, etc. are receiving for being involved in failed crypto projects as well as fines from the SEC (Kim K), and it rolls up to not being a nothingburger. 

However, I think the OP comment that he lost a ton of money.. he still lost $20m and will have to pay taxes on top of that (most likely) and going through the bankruptcy process and additional legal/tort fees are going to be a bitch as well.

27135,166379,166379,idaho22,"My main takeaways are everyone we are losing and how many of these people drastically underperformed their pay grade this season. It leads to this longer post I keep making but most of the players going out the door simply didn't perform well in this game or in the second half of the season:

Hicks, Julio, LVD (sadly), Brady, etc.

William Gholston and our cornerbacks look like priorities to bring back but we didn't even play Jamel Dean in that game and he was torched left and right at the end of our season.

I can't see how we can afford any of these players and most of who I think played ""well"" in that game and through the end of the season are already locked up to long term contracts. 

Who played ""okay:"" really just Vita Vea, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Ryan Jensen, Wirfs, and Winfield.

We have quite a bit of dead money in Brady so it's impossible to think we don't tear it all down and rebuild. We are $35m in cap hell AFTER losing all of these players with the majority of that being Brady. This was our year.. we pushed most of his contract into next year and it all counts as dead money. 

I can't think how in hell we can ask Mike Evans to restructure again, however, Evans Godwin and Shaq Barrett are all players who restructuring helps. 

Restructuring:

Shaq Barrett seems primed for a restructure if we know his achilles rehabs properly.. a 31 year old coming off a drastic injury is going to have some devaluation in his market value. However, if we signal we are willing to lock him up to finish his career here.. I think it could be a win win for us.

Underperformers (for salary): 

Akeem Hicks couldn't stay healthy. He looked nothing like the $8m we paid for Suh.

Julio Jones couldn't stay healthy and similarly was not AB this season for us.

Sean Murphy Bunting/Jamel Dean - I simply don't see how we can afford to pay these guys unless we move Devin White and cut our abysmal left tackle.

Performed for Salary (we take them back if we find a way): 

Tom Brady should be someone we sign no matter what if he wants to play for us.

Lavonte David dipped off consistently in this season and it was hard not to notice. I love him anyway I hope we bring him back.

William Gholston has always been underpaid for what we got out of him. He's every bit as good as elite players. 

Trade Targets: 

NOT Devin White even though he honestly looked terrible during the season. He's young, and seems like a player we'd get the most trade value for after seeing Roquan Smith get moved. You can't build an entire defense around a middle linebacker unless they are ELITE. Devin White has ELITE speed but he hasn't looked the part. A team who sees him as the final piece could move for him. The issue is we don't really save much by trading him. 

Mike Evans ironically because of how he restructured his contracts so many times he ends up being the best money on a trade target. If we do this I'll probably flip the fuck out and say I'm not a Bucs fan anymore but I'll eventually come back around.

Cut Targets:

Donovan Smith is a player who just straight up sucks at this point. He's the most expensive player next year and we save quite a bit cutting him with only a $3m penalty. I think he will be gone.

Tldr: I can't look at this cap table situation and know how we can keep remotely any of our star players who are set to leave. And we are set to lose A LOT:

He can do a “make good,” as one final act on his way out.

So, could the Bucs and the Patriots work out some sort of deal, where the Bucs get their cap savings and Kraft gets his moment with Brady? Who knows. I personally don’t think its needed, because he’ll have far bigger moments like being inducted to the Patriots Hall of Fame, and of course, Canton.

Look, I recognize my own bias, but I’m going to try and objectively break this down to show why this just won’t work:

- Tom’s children live on the east coast, and San Fran is one of the furthest places he could go to play… he has stated numerous times that he wants to be around his kids, so any potential divorce or “daddy day care” jokes aside, that is a huge factor (if he is being truthful).

- The Niners, and Kyle Shanahan’s offense, now show a *consistent history* of getting their QBs injured. They also need to be somewhat mobile to execute the offense efficiently. Brady is going to be 46, and is NOT mobile.

- The Niners also will have holes to fill, or decisions to make. Niners fans can correct me if I’m wrong, but while the major pieces are still in place, it just doesn’t take the core. Filling those gaps will be just as important, but may be harder to do if Brady commands a ~$25m deal.

Any one of those things aren’t a dealbreaker, but I can’t see that all three of them together won’t stop him from coming. Shoot, Shanahan hasn’t shown he can keep a QB healthy for an entire year… and on top of Brady’s cost, age, and family concerns, Shanahan would likely have to tweak his offense to make it work for Brady. It can work, of course, but then you’re risking the future of both Lance and Purdy because you’re NOT running the Brady version of the offense with those guys (so don’t say “QB x can learn under Brady for a year”…).

Hooker also has some impressive stats but did have an injury issue so that could cause him to drop which could play to the Bucs.
