11573,59762,59762,DownvoteFarmingLibs,"The entire offense wasn't dogshit though? We had an elite running game, and Herbert was fantastic one of the best runningbacks in the league when healthy. Our OL graded pretty well in most metrics with run-blocking which lines up well as most our guys were known for being good run blockers but poor pass blockers. 

To your point though he was nothing special in 2019, 2020, or 2021. The same problems show through- behind the volume stats you see a lack of explosive plays & just simply not getting enough yards b/c of his speed. 

For YPC:

2021/2020/2019 he was 3.8, 4.3, and 3.7 which ranked 24 of 30, 14 of 23, and 25 of 29, respectively. 

For Rushing Yards Over Expected/Carry:

2021/2020/2019 he was -0.14, -0.02, & -0.38 which ranked 19 of 30, 16 of 23, & 24 of 29 respectively.

For Carries / Explosive Carry:

2021/2020/2019 he was 24.1, 23.2, and 21.5 which was 21 of 30, 21 of 23, & 27 of 29. Better than this year no doubt but still consistently in the bottom tier out of all qualified RBs in the NFL.  

As far as Carries / Broken Tackle 

2021/2020/2019 he was 14.1, 8.5, and 8.6 which was 14 of 30, 3 of 23, and 6 of 29 respectively.

Yards after Contact/Carry

2021/2020/2019 again he was 1.9, 2.4, and 1.6 which was 19 of 30, 8 of 23, and 27 of 29. 

So what does this all mean? He was still an inefficient back in 2019-2021, ranked solidly in the upper half of broken tackles *but despite that* didn't turn those into extra yards as much as the average back in that year did. Throughout those years he generated significantly less explosive plays than the average RB, and got less yards per run compared to the vast majority of backs. To put it simply- he's consistently been elite at breaking tackles but subpar at virtually everything else & because of various reasons (his speed is a huge one) those extra broken tackles haven't turned into as many extra yards as even an average back.",2.0,chibears,t3_110l9f3,False,0.0,None,2023-02-12T17:34:28Z,chibears,-0.0192175542295973
11574,59763,59763,DownvoteFarmingLibs,"Is broken tackles the only thing that matters to you? Do you not get my point- he has to break so many tackles because he's slow. He gets explosive plays at a rate MUCH lower than the average running back, gets less yards than he should on big plays (combination of slow speed + mediocre vision), gets less yards than expected compared to the majority of backs in neutral situations, doesn't get an *elite* amt of yards after the contact despite the tackles he breaks, & is a worse back against a stacked box than Herbert and the majority of RB's in the NFL. 

Here are some stats:

In 2022 compared to other 48 RB's with at least 90 carries, Montgomery was

-4.0 yards / run, good for 36th (Herbert was 5.7 for 1st)

-40th in rushing yards over expected, -29 on the year 

-3 explosive runs in 2022, meaning an explosive run every 67 runs. The average RB had an explosive carry every 22 runs, which is ~3x more often. 

-total of -7.33 EPA on the year (meaning he was a net negative by that much) compared to Herbert's +9.21. 

-42nd in yards before contact, 2.0 (compared to Herbert's 3.1 which was 8th-- so it's not just the OL)

-faced 24% of his runs w/ 8+ in the box which was 15th in the league (so no it's not just a product of facing more stacked boxes)


The only notable thing he was top of the league in was breaking tackles. The problem is he doesn't turn that into enough yards after the tackle-- again, because he is slow.

The free agency tackle market is rough outside of Orlando Brown, and we don’t even know if he’ll hit the market. McGlinchey and McGary are average at best pass protectors. McGary also has heart problems. Jawaan Taylor is a good pass blocking RT but is literally the worst run blocker in the NFL. Would much rather see Braxton at one of the tackle spots than any of these guys (if we traded for Tunsil) 

Big fan of double dipping in the IDL in free agency. It’s a solid class for it. Our d-line needs so much talent. Adding Hargrave + Payne + Carter at 4 overall immediately makes our d-line a top half of the league unit.

If it's all teams, I'm going with an incredibly boring top 5 of Chiefs (Mahomes), Bengals (Burrow), Bills (Allen), Eagles (Hurts + stacked offensive and defensive lines), and Niners (QB is a question mark but they'll probably figure it out + Deebo/McCaffrey/roster talent).  Unless I'm missing something, Mahomes, Burrow, and Allen seem like perennial playoff guys.

Bears spent about $140 mil of the $220 mil this year on their actual roster.  That was ~$20 mil less than any other team.  A lot of that was dead cap, some of that was Poles stripping the roster down, knowing the team didn't have the resources to compete this year.

Bears oline was one of the worst pass blocking lines, if not the worst, in the league.

Bears #2 and #3 receivers in playing time was Equanimeous St. Brown and Dante Pettis.  When Mooney went down, they were the #1 and #2.

Despite all that, we still get clowns like you citing his passing yardage as proof that he's bad.  His pass yardage was affected by the roster around him, his propensity to run, and the play calling which was oriented towards handing the ball off.

There's a lot of negative consequences that would occur if the Bears did trade him which I think affects the value he's worth to the Bears as opposed to other teams.  For starters, he's the leader and star of the team, on a team that has basically zero other potential superstars, and players in the Bears locker room would be really unhappy if he was traded.  He's also already well-regarded around the league, and it might even be a red flag to free agents for coming to Chicago.  Plus, fans would be pissed.

19714,89244,89244,Hooze,"> ...and why did he have more attempts? Maybe because he is a better passer than Fields? 

Uh, no.  Some of that is Fields's propensity to run on pass plays, some of that is his propensity to want to throw the ball deep instead of check downs.  None of that makes Pickett a better passer than him.  It's ok for QBs to run, yards are yards and TDs are TDs.  

All that being said, the biggest factor in his pass attempts this year is that's the personnel of the offense this year, and calling run plays, even when we were down in games, was an intentional decision by Getsy/Flus.  It was covered a lot in the first half of the year in Getsy press conferences when the run/pass play calling ratio was extreme.  Bears oline was pretty successful in run blocking, struggled in pass blocking.  PFF or whatever metric you want to look at supports that assertion.  Bears WRs like Pettis and ESB were actually pretty good run blockers as well, but they're obviously lower on the WR depth chart for most teams except the Bears because they don't consistently get open.

Have a 32 year old quarterback who's had exactly one above average season.  I like Geno Smith and think they should franchise him, they'd be insane with the extra picks to not look at qbs too.  


>Lions

Same reasoning for the Lions.  Goff is a good QB, one of the best football minds in the NFL (McVay) gave 2 1sts to get rise of him and grab Stafford to win a super bowl.  If a high end QB falls to 6 they should absolutely grab one.  Goff is good, but it's okay to hope for elite.

Cousins is on a 1 year 40 million deal.  They are about to extend Justin Jefferson to one of the largest contract extensions ever for a wide reciever.  Can they win paying cousins + Jefferson 80+ mil of the cap?  I don't think Vikings are in a place to move up, but yeah don't think they are locked in with cousins by any means.  It's why they gave him the contract they did.

Schoen comes from Buffalo where his first year as assistant GM they saw the bills make a surprise playoff run led by Tyrod Taylor who was really good, but not great.

All 4 are 4/5 highest paid positions in the NFL.  It all means little without a good coach and good QB, especially a QB on a cheap contract.  You can fill out a great roster at other spots with cap space and 2nd/3rd day picks.  You're also in a very weak division that a team should be able to dominate with a great QB.

With trading the first pick I think he wants to get as many picks over the next 2-3 years as possible.  

At pick 9 we could get one of Murphy, Wilson, Paris Johnson, or Skoronski.  

If the offer includes both of your seconds, 39 and 61, that's the equivalent of pick 19 in the first round.  Bears could get the #1 olineman in Johnson at 9, use the seconds to get back to pick #19 to draft a receievr like JSN Addison or Quentin Johnston, and still have another 2nd, Panthers 24 1st and some other picks.

To me Poles holds all the cards.  If it were me at the combine I'd set a price and say whoever wants to trade the pick here's the cost based off where you're at.  Lets +1000 over draft pick  value.  For the Texans thatd be picks 2 and a 2024 1st.  The colts would be picks 45, 2024 1st, 2024 3rd, and 2025 2nd.  The Panthers would be picks 9, 50, 24 1st, 25 1st and a few more seconds. 

Now every GM knows the asking price and every day that goes by it's a mind games based off which GM will be crazy enough to pull the trigger and get their QB. Can colts be patient at 4 and allow the Panthers or raiders or some mystery teams to move up.  They may feel good about sitting at 4 with one QB going to th Texans but can they afford 2?

I like Pittman, I just don't think Pittman makes sense in a number of ways.  For the Colts why include the only good pass catcher you have when taking a QB and trying to develop him.  I just think they'd prefer to give up another 2nd or number of picks over that.  For the bears we are already likely extending Mooney, Kmet, and Jaylon Johnson from that draft  class, Pittman would require a similar extension at the same time making it somewhat difficult, not even mentioning if Claypool earns an extension.  

Though Colts fans hate mention of this in a trade of that scenario with a player I think Buckner makes a lot more sense.  Was traded to Indy to fit Flus scheme, and with them going rookie QB idk if Buckner's prime matches indys timeline anymore.  No dead money and a player Flus knows is great.

If he had clear development as a passer there would be clear evidence of it.

27251,143418,143418,Petricorde1,"Great video overall. I'll give my two cents on it:

**The good:**

&#x200B;

Trading back with the Colts would, of course, be fantastic and the haul we got is great.

&#x200B;

The draft is legitimately about as perfect as possible. Now if I'm being realistic I don't think half of those players will be there when we pick, but he legit drafted half of my draft crushes. I mean getting all of these players in one draft would be legitimately unbelievable:

Jalen Carter - Pretty clearly the best prospect in the draft imo. No brainer.

Zay Flowers - Everyones favorite ""underrated"" prospect. It's pretty clear why he's amazing and getting him with a second would be fantastic.

John Michael Schmitz - He would be our center for the next decade. That's something I'd be confident in. Fantastic, fantastic player who's easily the best iOL in this draft class in my opinion. Very comparable to Tyler Linderbaum from last year who had a great rookie year with the Ravens and he would be an absurd upgrade to the nightmare center rotation we have with Lucas Patrick and Sam Mustipher right now.

Xavier Hutchinson - My personal favorite underrated prospect. I think Hutchinson has legit potential to become a dominant X receiver in the league. He's got all the measurable and all the domination you would hope and expect from a player with the potential be one of the best in the league and really his only downside was his competition.

Tyjae Spears - In my opinion I think Spears would have been a top 3-5 RB in the class last year. The only reason we have any chance of getting him in day 3 would be because this is the best runningback draft class since 2017 (which is a remarkably similar reason to why Alvin Kamara fell). Just an absolutely electric player who would instantly become a difference maker.

B.J Thompson - Not much I can say here that Kollmann didn't say, but unheard of measurables that Poles would surely love to gamble on.

&#x200B;

**The bad:**

&#x200B;

The Laremy Tunsil trade. If we were to get the Colts 2024 first round pick we would be holding a literal winning lottery ticket. For us to trade it away right after getting it would be malpractice. Especially for a 29 year old left tackle who we would have to give 96 million (!!) 55 of which is guaranteed over 4 years. This is all for a tackle who only graded 5 PFF points higher than Braxton Jones. Is Tunsil better than Jones? Yes, of course he is. Is he so much better than 2nd year Braxton Jones that he's worth giving up a potential top 5 pick and the highest offensive tackle contract in the NFL too? Not at all whatsover. And guess what - if we run it back with Jones and Jones does suck, then next year we draft the best offensive tackle prospect since Penei Sewell with the Colts pick.

&#x200B;

Signing Da'Ron Payne, Javon Hargrave ***and*** drafting Jalen Carter. Do two of the three. Simple as that. Sign Payne and draft Carter? Fantastic. Sign Hargrave and sign Payne. Wonderful. Do all three? Insane waste of resources. Unless we were to convert Jalen Carter to a defensive end (which at that point just take Will Anderson) it makes no sense to put so much capital towards three players who won't be able to share the field at the same time. And trust me, none of these players deserve to be just a rotational piece.

&#x200B;

Not signing another left guard. Cody Whitehair just had arguably his worst year of his career and even if I do think he'll bounce back, not singing at least one other guard just in case (instead relying on a 5th round rookie to be his backup / competition) would certainly scare me. With the Laremy Tunsil trade and Kaleb McGary signing as done in this mock offseason I get why Kollmann didn't put more resources into the offensive line, but the risk of it being a major hole on our team would be ever present.

&#x200B;

**The mixed:**

&#x200B;

I have mixed thoughts about signing Kaleb McGary to a long term contract like that. While he is only 27 and he is maybe the best run blocking tackle in the NFL bar Trent Williams, I don't think he's proven to be anything more than an average pass blocker. And trust me, I'm all for signing McGary (90 million for 5 years would be an absurd overpay but 44 guaranteed over 5 years is pretty decent) but our pass blocking would still worry me.

&#x200B;

Similarly to McGary, I like Ebukam a lot, it's just the projected contract that worries me. I get we're in the Jaguars phase right now where we have to overpay for talent (although that's already coming back to bite them as they are 32 million in the hole this offseason), but PFF and Sportrac project his contract to be half of what Kollmann gives him. He's a good player for sure, but he has yet to prove he can be more than just a rotational player and after getting burned by Trevis Gipson, I don't really want to risk it again.

&#x200B;

My final mixed thought is in how he approached the offseason as a whole. A lot of big name players signed to big contracts is flashy, but I don't think it's sustainable. I want to compete for the playoffs this year, obviously, but I don't know if I wanna tie us down to a few year championship window as these contracts would be doing. It'd be a lot of fun no doubt, but 2-3 years down the line I think we'd start becoming strapped for cash real quick.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Overall the effort put in was fantastic and I loved hearing a different voice and how they would approach our offseason. I just disagree with how many assets we gave up in places we didn't need to. Do we need two new DTs? Yes. Does it make sense to get the *three* best DTs available? No. Do we need a new offensive line? Yes. Does it make sense to trade a future top 5 pick for a position we don't really need while ignoring more important positions (ie. not signing a guard and risking draft to get a starting center)? In my opinion, no. He did absolutely nail the draft though so I can't complain too hard.

Either way, the offseason will be a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to what Poles will do.",1.0,chibears,t3_10s2ej0,False,0.0,Roquan Simp,2023-02-02T16:45:09Z,chibears,0.0077090730840666

27306,143599,143599,Petricorde1,"Damn I was writing a comment and it got erased lol

I'll just briefly sum it up

1.) I don't think Carter had particularly bad games. To break it down - vs OSU he had 5 pressures on about 30 pass rushing snaps. That's a higher pressure percentage than any DT in the NFL today and that's playing against OLinemen who will all start in the NFL. Vs TCU he had a pretty dominant first quarter before being quiet the rest of the game. In the first few minutes of the game he forced a Duggan interception and he repeatedly clogged the middle and took on double teams that made the fantastic TCU run game go nowhere.

2.) You have to look at it with some context as well. As of now Carter is a guaranteed top 5 pick and him getting injured could result in losing literally millions of dollars. He's risking generational wealth by playing and its why so many NFL draft prospects (eg. Jaxon Smith-Ngijba) didn't even play). Him playing shows a level of commitment to the team that I like, and I can't blame him for not going 100% all the time this close to the draft.

If I was in Carters position and we were up 4 scores vs TCU early in the second, Idk if I would go 100% this close to the draft. Then he got rested for most of the second half so his lack of impact can also be explained by limited snaps in a blow out.

3.) Chris Ballard, the Colts GM, has a quote that goes something along the lines of ""if I've seen a player do it once, I know he can do it. It's up to my coaches now to get that out of the player."" I like that quote a lot and it matches my draft philosophy - if a player has a fantastic game where he shows something he hasn't shown prior (eg. CJ Stroud escaping pressure and playing fantastically against Georgia) then I'll view it with some weight. If a player has a bad game however, I tend to ignore it in favor of season long trends. Justin Fields looked horrendous vs Northwestern. AJ Terrell was dominated by LSU in college. Justin Jefferson was erased by Vanderbilt. etc etc. Every single college prospect has bad games and if that was used as a reference point, no player would be taken highly ever. That's not to say Carter had two bad games, as I mentioned in my first comment, but even if he did, I wouldn't hold it against him too much. Especially considering he has some of the most consistent college tape throughout his career of any prospect in this draft.",1.0,chibears,t3_10fi4em,False,0.0,Roquan Simp,2023-01-19T10:13:51Z,chibears,0.0105141492080413

27312,143606,143606,Petricorde1,"The thing that scares me about Anderson is he doesn't have any elite traits which most successful pass rushers in the NFL do. He has very good but not elite speed. He has good but not great strength. He's undersized and he doesn't have the single most important trait to overcome low size - elite bend (something Von Miller does have).

Although I do believe his get-off and instincts are certainly elite. Take with that what you will. 

He also almost set CFB sack records and was the best pass rusher and run defender in the country at the same time last year and it's pretty impossible to argue against that.

To me, Anderson and Carter are inverse players. You see Anderson's stats and you're absolutely blown away but then you go to the tape and you can't help but feeling slightly underwhelmed. The tape is fantastic - of course - but does it match the tape of a 17.5 sack, ***31 TFL*** player? My gut says no. 

Vice-versa is Carter where, open up his box scores and you'll be underwhelmed. Frankly, you won't see see a player worth the top 5. But open up his tape? You see the tape of a generational player. No player I see impacts the game play in play out as Carter. It's significantly harder to name traits that Cater is *not* elite in than ones he is.

36) New York Giants

Original pick: Breece Hall, RB (NYJ traded up)
New pick: Braxton Jones, OT

The way this re-draft worked out, the Giants didn't get an offensive tackle with either of their picks in the top seven. Jones played better than Evan Neal this season, anyway. In fact, Jones -- whom the Bears drafted in the fifth round -- had the best pass block win rate of any rookie tackle (92.8%) and was second in run block win rate (78.7%). -- Jordan Raanan


39) Chicago Bears
Original pick: Kyler Gordon, CB
New pick: Jaquan Brisker, S

The versatile safety was Chicago's most impactful rookie -- it landed him with its pick at No. 48 -- and showed early signs of becoming a mainstay in the secondary. Brisker stood out on a defense that struggled, particularly with its pass rush. He led the Bears with four sacks, becoming only the second defensive back in the past 10 seasons to do so, and was second in team tackles (104). Perhaps Brisker's biggest contribution came via the resurgence of Eddie Jackson in his move back to free safety while the rookie played up in the box, in the slot and was called on to blitz. -- Courtney Cronin

48) Chicago Bears (via LAC)
Original pick: Jaquan Brisker, S
New pick: Skyy Moore, WR

The receiving corps around quarterback Justin Fields lacked considerably in 2022. An ankle injury forced Darnell Mooney to miss the final five games and he finished as the leading receiver, with 493 yards and two touchdowns. Moore was far down the depth chart in Kansas City due to an abundance of playmakers around Patrick Mahomes, but he still had more catches (22) than six Bears receivers. His 250 receiving yards would have ranked third in Chicago. Addressing the wide receiver position in the draft could have saved the Bears from sending their own second-round pick to Pittsburgh for Chase Claypool at the deadline. -- Courtney Cronin

51) Philadelphia Eagles
Original pick: Cam Jurgens, C
New pick: Kyler Gordon, CB

Gordon had three interceptions, six passes defended and 71 tackles for the Bears this season. He would be a good option if the Eagles lost James Bradberry in free agency this offseason. Jurgens was drafted as Philadelphia's potential replacement for Jason Kelce, but he played 31 offensive snaps this season. -- Tim McManus",27.0,chibears,t3_10w9f4x,False,0.0,Deep Dish,2023-02-07T12:41:12Z,chibears,-0.0006569355564624

I mean, I get that everyone is laughing at Dak/Cowboys and Cousins/Vikings for once again blowing it in the playoffs, but c'mon, Derek Carr is not *unquestionably* a better QB and teams like the Dolphins, Giants, and Seahawks probably prefer their current guy anyway.  While a team like the Titans ultimately don't have a QB better than Carr, they're still kind of stuck and can't afford another expensive QB until 2024.

When you look around the league and carefully consider the teams that make sense, aren't in a position to take one of the top QBs in the draft, and are more likely to go with a veteran QB over a rookie due to their current coach being on the hot seat -- you're left with the Panthers, Commanders, Jets, Buccaneers, Falcons, and Saints.  I would probably rule out Washington and Atlanta since they both have second year QBs who showed some promise in 2022 and want to see what they have with them, too. 

So that leaves Carolina, New Orleans, Tampa Bay, and the Jets.  Does Carr have interest in going to any of those teams?

Then why are you commenting other than to be rude?


> WRs outside the first round will have less production. This is incredibly obvious

It's not about less production.  People don't realize how little production rookie WRs in general produce, 1st round or not.  


> First round picks are generally more talented. That's why they're picked first.

My post goes into how it's not just the first round, it's everyone outside of the top 10ish.  WRs drafted 12th to 32nd have a 25% chance of putting up 650+ yards.  

It's not incredibly obvious.  For example on the Chiefs sub you consistently see people saying the Chiefs should let Juju walk and just draft someone in the late 1st or 2nd.  My stats say that's a bad idea.  There's a wide misconception about rookie WR production.  People see players like Pickens and Amon-Ra being selected later in the draft and assume they can do the same.

Now maybe it's obvious to you, it's clearly not obvious to a lot of people.  


>Add to that the fact you only went back a few years

Unless he trades the pick super early, or isn't willing to trade down, or trade down past 2nd.

Personally I'd sign the best DT, OT, ILB to long term deals. Then I'd sign a average to slightly below average center to a 1 year contract.  Assuming reasonable contracts, resign Monty and Morrow. Then either trade for a WR or sign a 3rd guy to a short term deal. 

That allows us to do nothing at all in a worst case senario or if the pick is a major bust. It also take best players at each pick.  The only positions that would be too crowded to add an additional first two day pick would be QB, RB, S. 

Not getting an elite edge would be unfortunate in this situation, but it would be okay. Maybe we trade for someone who's still good, but not living up to a big contract after the draft.

If we take an Edge we cut Muhammed and let the best two edges start, or rotate situationally all season keeping our guys fresh. 

If we take a DT, we cut Jones or have a monster 3 man rotation. 

If we take a LB Morrow or Sanborn become a top tier backup. 

If we take a OT/G, obviously it would be tricky, but if we take a guy who can play guard as well we can put the rookie or Braxton at guard and trade Whitehair. In a year or two if they look like they would be a better tackle, trade Braxton or the free agent. 

If we take a TE then Kmet will likely still be the starter, but who's ever regretted having two good TEs? 

If we take a WR things only become an issue if the FA/Trade WR, Claypool, the rookie and Mooney are all looking great. At which point we can say that's great and let one of Claypool or Mooney walk in free agency. Or we can trade one of them at the deadline. 

If we take a corner we play the rookie or Gordon at slot and Vildor is excellent depth. 

If we take a center they either win the starting job or take a redshirt year.

Not sure what you looked at to say he's a bad passer. Was it his stats and only seeing his running highlights? 

The bears passed the ball 1/3 of the time. Which means most times he's around 20 throws for a whole game. You're not going to be putting up the yardage numbers other qbs are if you are throwing that little.

But to get an idea of what he can do is take the stretch from when bears trusted him and opened the playbook to until the game before he basically was beaten to a pulp and had to be taken out (week 7 to week 16), he had over a 68% completion and 7th in CPOE (basically, he's making the type of completions only 6 other qbs are making over avg). So he's taking chances and pushing the ball downfield and is being accurate with them.

Unless you're watching his film, You aren't going to see the big dropped pass plays that should have been easy huge plays, see him working in and around the pocket, seeing him read the field, etc. 

Again, he needs to make improvements. He needs to work on the short quick game and pulling thr trigger when he makes the right read. He gets a second year in the same offense, for once.

This year, Higgins put up similar numbers to last year, while starting a couple of games and leaving them early, as well as missing games straight out. 

So, when brown and Higgins had same target numbers, they put up similar stats, although brown had more TDs. But at the same time, brown was the only real WR the titans had so him.getting better TD numbers isn't surprising.

So, again, I think Brown is a better WR, comparing Higgins to him just isn't fair,  when Brown was the only main guy for titans.

Brown busted out this year due to

1. Bears only passed the ball about 1/3 of the time.

3. Fields needs to.do a better job of taking the mid route throws. When he did, it was fine, but he, like in college, looooved waiting for the downfield route to get open and threw it. Which is great, but, bears just didn't have that consistent type of WR to make the plays. 

4. The oline was incredible in the run blocking, but the pass blocking made him force throws way too early or immediately bail out and forced him to make things happen with his legs. 

5. When he read man coverage, he was taught to check his immediate main routes and if not there, tuck it and run. That's not a red flag to place on him, it's something he would read and then run to take advantage. 

But yeah. Overall, he made the throws other QBs wouldn't make, but, was, eh, on throws he should have made.

My friend is a huge Browns fan and is from Ohio. Hes also an OSU fan and loooooovvvves Fields from his college days (and still does).

So when we found out the draft was in Cleveland, a bunch of the guys made it a boys trip there and we went to the draft.

So, here I am, out in the freezing cold, watching each pick go. All the QBs, other than Fields, go. Then, QB needy teams (think CAR, DEN etc) pass on Fields to get other positions. 

One of our friends that is there is a huge Giants fan. So, we are all anticipating what the Giants are going to do. Had no idea a trade might happen, let alone the bears. 

Then, all of a sudden, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

Kidding!

Then, its announced. The giants have made a trade. We basically all knew it was the bears moving up. Me and CLE guy are like hugging and jumping all crazy. Then, the trade is announced and the bears are involved. Then.... ""bears select, Justin Fields.""

Holy shit, we all went fucking bonkers! One of the other guys that was there is the kind of guy who shits on OSU and Bama qbs for their poor history and even he is excited and just we are all in disbelief.

I dont think another draft pick will ever live up to that.

EDIT: Shit, I forgot my least favorite. I think im going to have to go with Mitch. And I love the guy, knowing the kind of person he is. But, I was out with some friends for dinner. I kept refreshing my phone to see who we would pick. See that we made a fairly big trade to move up. Then, bears gets Biscuit. I wasnt disappointed, just, was, MEH.  I wanted Watson tbh. He was the obvious choice with the big game performances, but wanted to give him a chance. 

I still do think, with a small part of me that, if he was put in a position to use his strengths, instead of Nagy forcing shit on him, hed be atleast an avg starter. We saw what he could do, when Lazor took over the play calling. It was much more focused on what he was good at.

39735,238297,238297,dafoo21,"Its not really a sporting icon anymore from the fuck up of the last update. And its severely outdated in terms of fan experience. HThe Bears have tried many times to work with the city to renew Soldier Field properly and they have basically said ""tough shit"". So, bears finally got serious with Arlington and now Lightfoot tried to work with bears again, but its too little too late. Even the video of their offering wasnt accurate to how the city is currently set up. I think it was just a ploy to have Lightfoot not look like hte mayor that ran the bears out of DT. She severely fucked all of this up for proper Chicago.

Bears want to own their own stadium, thats the simplest part of the discussion. Also, they basically want to do what LA and Minn did and not just have an incredible stadium, but have an entertainment district around it. If you look up the models of the surrounding area, it would have housing, business offices, lakes, ponds, parks, restuarants, and so on. Arlington wasnt the bears idea, Arlington came to the bears about it. Arlington also wanst to upgrade the area for public use for the surrounding communities. This would also help fix whatever issues the city currently has in the areas (admittedly, i am unsure of what they are, but cities need to be maintained too). 

As for the financials, the bears will fully fund the stadium (around $2 billion). The surrounding areas will need public funding. Its not just a blank check to the bears, though, the areas will generate tax dollars that will go back to the state, Cook County and the city of Arlington. 

Thats about all the details that are out there right now. Its still not set in stone that the Bears, once they close on the land, will actually build on it, but the writing is on the wall, especially with hiring Warren as CEO. 

So, unless Warren can negotiation bears owning Soldier field and being able to build around the area (which still can happen I guess, since he brings a heavy reputation of getting things done that he wants to get done), almost 400 acres of land to basically do whatever the hell they want is really too hard to pass up.

Also provide affordable housing, parks, much better looking areas, business centers, entertainment, etc that are positives for the residents.

Tax dollars will also be generated and would be going back to the governments. Itd goto Arlington, Cook and the State.

I said, McDaniels offense uses the QBs mental strengths that accentuate the lack of their physical talents, which allow the QB to spread the ball around and find the proper player to get the ball to and make plays. This makes the QBs job easier instead of having to rely on physical traits the QB might not have.

Hurts carves up their defense amazingly well in the intermediate passing game. Goedert leads the team with 2 receiving touchdowns. Neither team really gets momentum running the ball, which impacts the 49ers far worse than it does the eagles. 3 different eagles pass catchers finish with 7+ catches. Purdy gets sacked 3 times by Haason Reddick and is abused all day. Plays adequately at first but crumbles late into the game. Deebo is a complete nonfactor. Eagles cruise past. Score is less indicative of competitiveness due to a garbage time TD from SF, which is their only points in the second half.

Chiefs 40-38 Bengals 

Absolute chippy shootout. Multiple fights break out. Mahomes and burrow take turns tossing absolute potshots back and forth. Defense still makes plays in the game despite the high score. This game is kind of like Chiefs Rams game from 2017. Probably gonna be a better game than the Super Bowl ends up being. Quieter first half, 2nd half really kicks into overdrive start of the 3rd quarter. Two 80+ yard touchdowns occur. Bengals almost get in range to set up a GW field goal but come up short kinda like in the SB. At some point the Chiefs do a crazy trick play that is executed perfectly to gain like 4 yards lol.

41882,255100,255100,g0dzilllla,"I super super agree with this. Football games in general are so much more “flukey” than people realize. By flukey I mean so many little invisible factors can affect a team or player on a given day and totally cause them to lose to an inferior team. 

There’s an element of human randomness that’s present in all sports to varying degrees, but in football it’s most prominent imo. One reason being the massive 14 point swing a single touchdown can have. Another being only 17 games in a season. Within the game itself, there are only around 120 snaps. There are 22 moving parts on the field at a time. There’s only about 12 actual minutes of play time. Each individual play is only used a couple times at most in a game. 

Like you can go on and on and on, there’s so little room to actually try and see true deliciously meaningful patterns. Its part of why this league has the parity it has. It makes sense that TDs are fluky in general given how few are scored by a player in a season. I do think this stat generally has a good bearing on how the QBs did this year, though.

41887,255105,255105,g0dzilllla,"Very good point. To be honest, somehow I didn’t even consider how much luck factors into fumbles being lost or recovered. Perhaps you could instead use (total fumbles / 2) instead of fumbles lost, if you assume each fumble has a 50% of going either way that is. 

However, one thing I will say that a good few, more than most QBs, of Fields’ fumbles occurred as a dumb error behind the line and were immediately recovered - which speaks to why the recovery rate was so high. Other QBs also probably experience this, but I wanted to give some context to the 14/16 stat. 

Thirdly, I’m not really pushing an agenda here, I originally searched up the stat to see where Fields ranked but thought it would be interesting to post anyway.

It’s only important because I see a lot of people mentioning that a team like the Commanders can’t afford Payne because they only have $3 mil in cap space. 

But it looks like they can get to $47 mil with simple restructures that won’t hamper their future too much. Idk if the Bears will restructure guys like Cody Whitehair or Eddie Jackson, which are our biggest contracts, so it’s more likely we’re closer to that effective cap space number.

Remember, Nick Siriani’s intro press conference was a disaster. Like, so bad. Now he’s coaching in the Super Bowl. 

Small anecdote, when the Bears revealed their current throwbacks George was so proud of them, talked about the 1930s throwback, completely unaware of the fact that this was an era where the league was segregated (thanks in part to his namesake) and it really rubbed players the wrong way. 

When he found out, he could have just dismissed it or said, “oh it’s just history and heritage it’s not about that” but instead he met with the players to learn and understand their perspective. That type of humility and willingness to understand others (from a wildly wealthy family and the most powerful person in the organization) goes a long way with me. 

The Bears now have a black CEO, black GM, black assistant GM, and a black QB, all of whom are incredibly qualified, mind you, but that’s a pretty rare setup in the NFL. Both from the outside and from stories I’ve heard, he was just genuinely sheltered and ignorant, but once he learned more about the players’ perspectives, the team’s history and reputation in regards to race, but he genuinely wanted to learn and understand and change the way he conducts business to create opportunities for more diversity in NFL upper management. 

I don’t think he’s perfect at all. By contrast though he’s way better than his predecessor pretty much across the board. And I genuinely think he wants to learn and get better. He wanted a football guy at CEO. He wants a coach who wins. He wants to find and empower the right people. 

Maybe he’s dumb. Maybe he’s just awkward like the rest of his family. But since he took over things have slowly improved on a lot of levels.

I’ve followed the NFL long enough to trust my intuition on these things. I find I’m right more often than wrong at tracking rumors. Honestly I think they might have moved on sooner but it’s really, really ballsy and career-defining to move on from a reigning MVP, let alone a back to back MVP. So the team did what they needed to do to keep him, but left themselves an out this year. 

Trading a reigning MVP vs trading an aging QB who missed the playoffs *feels* a lot different. I think people underestimate that a GM position is a job, and these folks sometimes make professional decisions instead of necessarily the best decision. If they’re going to do it, this is the season where it’s justified on several levels (and fans are sick of it too; there will be way less pushback than a year ago). And the longer Rodgers draws things out, the easier it gets to justify to the fan base.

Rodgers said at one point last season that he would understand if they were eliminated from the playoffs and the team wanted to start Love to see what they have. There have been reports that the Jets are interested, and rumors the Packers are at least taking calls. And Rodgers was his typical passive aggressive self last week on McAffee’s show, saying something along the lines of, “I haven’t made my decision yet but apparently there are people making some moves anyway” with respect to the Packers front office, who he clearly does not get along with. 

I think starting from about mid-season last year there’s been enough steadily building drumbeat about him being done in GB that I think it is definitely a strong possibility. 

The thing about his contract is that if they’re going to move on, it has to be this year. They can trade him now, but if they don’t then they have to keep him for 2 seasons. I forget the exact structure but it basically sets them up to trade or commit multiple years.

I think he fits the personality and culture the team is trying it build, and there are more options at DT in free agency.

These are all correctable issues, but in order for the game to slow down JF can't be thinking about his mechanics. That quick - efficient - consistent motion needs to be second nature.
