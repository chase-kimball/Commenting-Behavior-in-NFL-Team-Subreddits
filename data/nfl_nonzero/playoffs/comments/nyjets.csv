130,287,287,09-24-11,"The Saints often restructure contracts of their good players such as Cam Jordan (twice). During the restructure the player benefits because base salary is converted to guaranteed money, so the player is happy. The team is happy because it allows the GM to move cap hits to open space, but the cap hits don’t disappear. They increase in later years. Example: 

> Jordan restructured his contract with the Saints on March 6, 2021 for cap purposes. We are estimating that Jordan will receive a $1.1 million salary and a $12.7 million signing bonus. The move will create $9.525 million in cap space for the Saints in 2021 and increase Jordan's salary cap number by $3.175 million in each of the 2022 to 2024 seasons.

The Saints have done this with Jordan, Kamara, Thomas, Ramscyk, Davis. 

This is not “cheating” the cap and the cap is not a myth as some like to think. The Saints have lost Marcus Williams and Trey Hendrickson and many others as cap casualties. 

“Why don’t more teams do this” they do all the time and we have as well. We did this with CJ Mosley this past offseason. The key is that you need good players you reasonably want to keep around for a long time, the Jets have no had this until recently. Some GMs also want the flexibility to their books clean. Cap manipulation is objectively a negative thing for the GM to do, it’s a desperation move. The Saints get the call outs from fans because they’re typically in the negative every year pre-restructures so it looks like magic but it’s not.

There are constantly posts not related to the Jets, memes on game day, and jersey posts not mandated to the game thread. One of my pain points with the low effort posts thing, is that it is one example of rules not being followed and that is the bigger issue.

138,315,315,09-24-11,"A few things: 

1.  If the answer from mods is to downvote/hide, then just remove the rule for “low effort/duplicate posts”. It’s almost never enforced and you yourself just said that hide and downvote is the answer. Fine, then have the rules reflect what the sub is supposed to do. Remove the low effort rule entirely. 

2. I feel this way because it is the same questions or topics being discussed with little effort with no new flavor of discussion. I especially feel this way due to the lack of effort. If fans posted in depth self post content about player reviews, contracts, game film, etc that is different because there is quality and effort being put into the discussion and that’s what makes Reddit, and sometimes r/nyjets a great place. 

3. You are saying that removing low effort posts won’t improve the quality of the posts. Disagree. I think when people have their low effort posts removed; they will be persuaded to bring low effort comments to the daily thread or the QB thread. And if it stops the low effort content all together, then so be it.

2) Pep Hamilton for Senior Offensive assistant.
      - 20 years of NFL coaching experience         
      - Herbert’s QB coach his rookie year
      - Offensive coordinator for Luck’s first couple years


3) Accept that the Zach experiment is over and trade him for whatever you can get. 


4) Trade up for a QB in this upcoming draft or take one at 13. 
     - Ideally Stroud or Richardson

     - Is Derek Carr really beating Pat Mahomes in the playoffs? 
     
     - Every QB in the playoffs right now was drafted by their respective teams and is under the age of 30.
       


5) Jacoby Brissett. 
      - Inexpensive 
      - Serviceable vet
      - Can hold it down till the rookie is ready

When the Jets hired Saleh to be head coach in January 2021, LaFleur was an easy choice for offensive coordinator.

Saleh and LaFleur had been fellow assistants on the 49ers under Kyle Shanahan — Saleh the defensive coordinator, LaFleur the passing game coordinator — and had known each other for years. Saleh worked and lived with Mike’s brother Matt at Central Michigan, and would annoy a teenaged Mike by hogging the TV when he visited the LaFleur family home in Mount Pleasant, Mich.

LaFleur’s hiring was praised by many around the league. “It’s the West Coast system,” he said in his introductory news conference. “We’re trying to run the outside zone and do the play-action stuff off of it, but we fit it to our players.” But some players found the system to be needlessly complicated.

“We’ll have one route but it has a bunch of different names depending on the concept,” said a former Jets receiver who spent time with the team in training camp this year. “I’ve been on multiple teams, this is the first time I’ve experienced that.”

Calvin Jackson, an undrafted rookie wide receiver who spent the offseason and training camp with the Jets, said LaFleur spoke with him one-on-one after Jackson had a tough time learning concepts in OTAs. “He’s one of those soft-spoken guys that won’t say much,” Jackson said. “But if you need help, you can always go to him and ask for it.” By training camp, Jackson said he had the concepts figured out.

As a rookie, Zach Wilson struggled with the complexity of the scheme and went 3-10 as the starter. Over the offseason, LaFleur and quarterbacks coach Rob Calabrese studied what worked for Wilson in 2021 and what didn’t. There was some level of frustration. LaFleur would tell people how much more effective the offense looked with quarterbacks Flacco, Josh Johnson and especially White. The stats backed it up.

But Wilson was the Jets’ future, so LaFleur adjusted the scheme, reduced the volume of plays and tried to make things more digestible. Wilson seemed to have a better handle on the offense in OTAs and went into the rest of the offseason committed to building chemistry with his wide receivers.

He spent thousands of dollars flying to Florida, Arizona and Tennessee to work out with teammates. Wilson invited most of the team’s skill position players and quarterbacks to Idaho for a getaway right before training camp, a fun weekend relaxing in the company of celebrities like Wayne Gretzky and Justin Bieber. Some of Wilson’s teammates appreciated the effort he was putting in.

“I never hung out with him outside of the building or anything, but from my experience he was a cool, down-to-earth dude,” said the wide receiver who was with the Jets in training camp. Jackson said when he was first signed to the Jets, Wilson told him: “I’m happy you’re here.” And when Jackson was cut, Wilson called “to make sure I was in the right headspace.”

In New York’s first preseason game, Wilson started things off by sailing a pass over Garrett Wilson’s head and throwing a bad interception. On his second drive, his right knee buckled on a scramble, a non-contact injury. He had suffered a torn meniscus and bone bruise and was forced to the sidelines for six weeks while recovering from a procedure to repair the meniscus. Wilson said afterward he did not anticipate any long-term effects from the knee injury, or from the PCL sprain he suffered as a rookie to the same knee that forced him to miss four games.

Wilson made his 2022 regular-season debut in Week 4 against the Steelers and struggled for three quarters, though he did catch a second-quarter touchdown on a trick play. In the fourth quarter, the Jets trailing by 10, Wilson pulled his teammates aside and told them, in so many words, to “man up.” He completed 10 of 12 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown that quarter while playing through an ankle injury, and the Jets won 24-20.

“The young man doesn’t flinch,” Saleh said after the game.

It never got better.

LaFleur’s directive to Zach Wilson when he returned to game action wasn’t complicated: If the first read and second reads aren’t there, run.

The strategy worked against the Steelers and again in Week 5 against the Dolphins, a 40-17 win. In Week 6, the Jets won in Green Bay, even though Wilson completed only 10 of 18 passes for 110 yards while playing through a separation of the AC joint in his left shoulder.

The Jets’ simplistic approach to the passing game wasn’t sitting well with some wide receivers, who weren’t seeing the ball as much as they had with Flacco starting the first three games. Garrett Wilson had one catch against the Packers. Elijah Moore wasn’t targeted at all while running 14 routes. Moore reportedly first expressed his displeasure to teammates after the Packers game, questioning his future with the Jets. That night, he also responded to a tweet about his lack of targets by saying: “If I say what I really wanna say … I’ll be the selfish guy … just know I don’t understand either.”

His frustration spilled into practice that week. That Thursday, Moore surprised teammates and coaches by blowing up on LaFleur, telling him to “go f— yourself” and “you suck,” according to multiple people who witnessed the interaction. LaFleur and Saleh ultimately decided to send Moore home to cool off. That night, he requested a trade.

He was the second highly drafted wide receiver to do so — Denzel Mims, a second-round pick in 2020, wanted out in August, once it became clear he was buried on the depth chart. Both times, the Jets made it clear they didn’t intend to trade either. Publicly and privately, Saleh supported both Moore and Mims, and his compassion resonated with other Jets players. Moore and LaFleur hugged it out. Mims and Moore didn’t cause any issues the rest of the season.

The Jets won their Week 7 game against the Broncos, though it came at a great cost. Hall, averaging 5.8 yards per carry during his rookie season, suffered a torn ACL. Star offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker, selected 12 picks after Wilson in the 2021 first round, suffered torn triceps. Both were lost for the season.

The next week, Wilson threw three interceptions in a 22-17 loss to the Patriots, and his relationship with LaFleur started to sour. NFL legend Steve Young, who Wilson said he called in November for advice, shed some light on their relationship in a radio interview earlier this month.

“Zach doesn’t need tough love. He doesn’t need somebody to see how tough he is. He needs a big brother — a young, knowledgeable innovator, someone who he can trust and says to him, ‘You know what, despite everything that’s happened, Zach, I believe in you. You can get this done.’ Zach needs that,” Young said. “Mike kind of kept him at arm’s length and gave him the tough-love aspect, and I don’t think that’s really useful for Zach.”",13.0,nyjets,t3_10g2z3a,False,0.0,None,2023-01-19T09:32:00Z,nyjets,0.0089612379368876

on the defensive side, Ahmad ""Sauce"" Gardner is a rookie cornerback who just had an incredible all-pro season and will almost certainly be the defensive rookie of the year. we've also got defensive tackle Quinnen Williams who's entering his 5th season and coming off the best season of his career, where he also was an all-pro

on offense, we've got rookie wide receiver Garrett Wilson who just had an incredible year, as well as rookie running back Breece Hall who looked unstoppable until he got injured week 7 and was out the rest of the year. Alijah Vera-Tucker is also a very good offensive lineman entering his 3rd season, who also just got injured week 7 and missed the rest of the season. that was a rough game

the biggest piece we're currently missing is a quarterback. a couple years ago we drafted qb Zach Wilson with the 2nd overall pick, and he turned out to be a complete bust (this is a few years after drafting qb Sam Darnold with the 3rd overall pick, who was also a bust). many of us are hoping we can grab someone decent in the offseason so we can maybe compete next year. our defense was elite this past year so whether we can compete next year really just comes down to whether we can get a good qb. but as a team we've historically had a lot of bad luck at that position, so who knows

13710,98190,98190,NYJKNJD,"The AlterG anti-gravity treadmill contains NASA patented technology that allows you to reduce your body weight by as much as 80%. Military, professional sports teams, universities and leading medical facilities across the nation all use AlterG treadmills. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill helps a broad spectrum of people – top level athletes, orthopaedic and neurologic patients, pediatric, geriatric, and those looking to lose weight or to achieve their personal health and performance goals!  
  
AlterG treadmills offer an unique unweighting process utilizing a differential air pressure technique that NASA developed. The original use was to help astronauts exercise and maintain conditioning while in space. The air pressure comfortably lifts the user and allows him/her to walk or run at a fraction of their body weight.  
  
**AlterG treadmills allow patients to rehab from a lower extremity injury or surgery with less pain. Allowing for early weight-bearing exercises without the risk of injury to the healing tissue, the AlterG is ideal for joint rehab.  The AlterG assists in correcting gait mechanics and promoting a normal range of motion by reducing the demand on the affected joint.
Athletes of all sports and ages find the AlterG to be ideal. The AlterG creates a low impact, pain-free environment that allows athletes to increase their training volume, decrease downtime, and reduce the likelihood of training injuries that will cause a delay in getting back to their sport. The athlete can then return to their sport sooner and in better condition.
Lower body conditions that benefit from the use of the AlterG:
Total Hip or Total Knee Replacements  
Meniscectomy (Meniscus Repair)  
ACL Reconstruction  
Achilles  
Bunionectomy  
Arthritis (OA, RA)

13851,99397,99397,NannigarCire,"Actually I’m coming back because one thing you said here kept bothering me more than the others- “brady is number 10 and Fitzpatrick is #2”, this statement misses the point. You can’t make a bad player good. The product of the NFL would be worse if they tried to. Fitzpatrick given the volume of passes he takes, is unsurprising to be ahead of Brady because he’s a worse player. He’s more likely to throw into tight coverage where holdings and DPIs are happening, more likely to get hit during a play to get unnecessary roughness, he’s a worse player. Brady isn’t going to get more calls because he doesn’t play like shit. Even if it was the other way around, where Brady gets more calls that wouldn’t prove that the league does anything to tip the scales. It’s not actually refuting the concept. The idea and the reason why this point is so bothersome and wrong to me- is whether players are qualitatively (not quantitatively) getting favorable calls in situations where lesser players would not. Does Tom Brady on 3rd and 6 throwing to Wes Welker from the slot on an out route get the holding call when the safety makes a ticky-tacky hip touch while the patriots are up 3 late in the 3rd? When comparing it to all similar qualitative situations, are those calls even or is there a pattern towards particular players getting the calls? Who are those players, and what is their relationship to the league brand?

13853,99399,99399,NannigarCire,"the view of it as a scripted contest would require that but not a view of moderate favoritism. like you don't need more than regular exposure to specific players and personalities to do that. i also don't agree that the nfl would've loved to have sanchez and rex and hard knocks in the superbowl imo- it's arguing they are creating narratives for the sake of narratives instead of creating positive reciprocal relationships with those that forward the brand. And the Jets are not even close to one of the major teams that do that. I think it's either misguided or a misunderstanding of what i'm saying. Like it's almost undeniable when watching QBs that the ones with more tenure, exposure, and popularity get better calls than the ones that don't have any of those. 

i brought up the WWE metaphor because its a fully scripted show but the script is 100% earned by the people involved. You don't just win Championships because they decide it, you build up loyalty within the brand, show your skill and talent as an exciting actor in the ring, and then get rewarded for it with better matches, better stories, better etc. The NFL can't do that, that's impossible for them. But they can tell the refs to protect their biggest assets like Brady, Peyton, Brees, Mahomes, etc. They can't make them play well, but they can choose to be more loose with holding calls not just for certain teams but also for certain matchups. Like the NFL can request the refs to keep the flags only for the most egregious calls in marquee matchups on primetime if they want to. Or for whatever leads to the highest scoring game. They're doing what they perceive as being good for the brand and it's marketing. There's nothing to suggest they can't. The risk/reward factor is intangible, it's unclear- because other sports exist but not all of them are even nearly the cultural product likely because partially a missing compelling narrative that is culturally bigger than the game being played.

It's essentially what they do when they change the rules to make it better for QBs and the passing game, they're not focused on some internal competitive fairness- they're deciding based on what they think makes the game more marketable and expands its cultural relevance. Peyton was the main lobbyer for this version of the game and he was a massive brand ambassador for the NFL.

>And now that there is so much gambling involved , it would be a federal crime that would put a lot of people in jail.

i'm sorry to accuse you of this, but this particular statement is a little naive considering how illegal insider trading is but how regular it is. It's likely that the majority of the owners involved in the league even do some insider trading through all sorts of dark accounts, along with many other illegal things. 

The idea of ""making things a little more exciting"" on the field, is even lower effort than that. There's a relevant quote from Chomsky that's sort of related here- where he's talking to a BBC interviewer and they ask him- ""you think i'm being told by my superiors what to write?"" and he says, no of course not. that's ridiculous, its likely that your thoughts are your own but your viewpoint is one that already aligns to the position they want. The filter happened when you got the job. There's no need for anyone to be directed, they've already chosen people who understand the point.

Because this leads me to something i don't personally understand too well- how were the referees able to strike? I've participated in a lot of labor organizing so usually strikes are based on leverage. But what is a referees leverage exactly? Like it seems to be a pretty high demand job with a lot of potential replacements who (if not all thrown in at once) would probably ease in without much issue. It pays well (200k per season) and there's tons of potential guys who can and want to do it. The guys who aren't on the field in sports are about as replaceable as the guys in the arts, where no matter how well trained you are from juliard or berkeley, they'll find someone else to put in the spot with ease.

13856,99406,99406,NannigarCire,"alright so under the new context maybe its unnecessary for me to do the stat analysis i wanted to do BUT i still did a little bit of it because i wanted to really make my point- the thing for Adams vs Cooper is that the game Adams plays is one that doesn't impact defenses compared to the way Cooper plays. Adams is a very heavy underneath receiver who mostly works his best in the short game compared to all the other all-time great WRs who are intermediate players + have some amount of deep threat to them. Like you mentioned Adams being doubled etc but this is only important if Adams was going for deep routes, which isn't really his thing. It's a very ideological statement on my part because there is no objective point to make here, but IMO a legit top WR should be playing the big boy game of intermediate + deep ball profeciency and Adams is a short yardage specialist more-so. He's like a powered-up slot receiver. Like his two killer seasons with Green Bay had 60% and 67% of his targets either short or behind the line of scrimmage. Whereas like Julio never went past 47% of his targets in that area. Cooper's also usually below 50% in the area, although in 2020 he had like 60% in the area, which was the season where Dak got hurt early and Dalton+Ben Dinucci became QBs so that explains that. Davante plays a much different game than the all-timers is what i'm getting at, and i'm guessing you don't disagree


*i'd like to go even more in depth by breaking down the variance +luck aspect of adams vs other top WRs but..downloading this data from PFF is impossible bc its too many columns

But anyway, in relevance to Carr- i did a long dive into Carr and the thing with him is that although he had weapons they were not in the areas he is best at. Carr is a short-passing specialist, his best seasons were when his best players had average depth of targets before the first down marker (Waller at around 8.something + Renfrow at 6.something) and then supporting targets that went deep (Agholor, Ruggs, Zay). His bad seasons are when his top targets have their average depth of targets deeper down the field (both Crabtree/Cooper were above 10+). Davante should've been another one of these short yardage guys, but for some reason McDaniels decided to send Davante way deeper than he normally goes this year. In the last two years with GB Davante's ADOT was 9.7 and 8.7, but with the Raiders this year it was 12.8 which is his career high. So the thing with Carr is that he was in a talent mismatch by being asked to throw farther a lot more often than he's supposed to.

But i think in any case the thing i wanted to deep dive onto isn't going to be a disagreeable point, however i do think Amari is very valuable to a level that isn't much worse than Adams because he is an intermediate/deep receiver that opens up the rest of the offense. Whereas Adams, because he's not really that type of player, doesn't have the same overall impact on the offensive scheme + defensive reaction. Adams skills will get him a lot more counting stats though, in the right situations. Honestly i'd be curious to see what his volume is when he's in an offense that has other targets because i think given his speciality he wouldn't get the heavy usage he has received since 2018.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10shocp,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-02-04T18:58:03Z,nyjets,0.0282955181502271

13861,99414,99414,NannigarCire,"sorry ot throw myself into this conversation but it's a pretty good discussion. I want to add that Davante has faced very weak target competition throughout his career. As a third year receiver playing alongside Jordy's penultimate Packers year, he was a distant second. But in most of his high performing seasons he's been far and away the only true target on that offense and way above the guys around him, and he's not exactly the most talented NFL WR. Looking at the guys on those teams from 2018 onwards, i don't even think some of them would've been able to start on the Jets teams. The ghost of graham? Allen Lazard? Equanemous St. Brown? 

also just can't imagine putting Davante on the all-timer scale. Davante was never dominant like Julio, so it feels very box score heavy to say he's the best WR at any point in the NFL. It's sort of like arguing Diggs as the best WR because he once led the NFL too, but neither Diggs nor Adams are so scary that defenses have to totally adjust for them the way they have for Julio, Calvin, and now Chase and Jefferson. Davante and Cooper are both hall of very good players for very different reasons, and to bring it full circle Cooper's had a lot more competition for targets and with a significantly downgraded QB. Carr isn't a guy who forces the ball to his man the way Rodgers does, and he had few opportunities with Prescott or Watson. Plus on the Cowboys his target competition was way harder than anything Davante has had to compete with. Amari's still young enough to have that big blowout year that his career hasn't given him yet too if he gets the entire season with Watson next year.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10shocp,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-02-04T00:00:28Z,nyjets,0.0001222558809358

That's the thing about reddit. it fucking sucks to post high quality content here. There is no payoff. And reddit's functionality with the upvotes/downvotes acting as agree/disagree just make having more interesting conversations really difficult here. Even when i did the Zach Wilson or Mike White breakdown, the majority of posts relish the content (which is appreciated) but there is no back and forth- very few users here can actually talk to you about the topic when you go into depth. And as much as i like being right, actually discussing something on the level that i want to discuss it- is the whole reason why i would personally post it. Partly praise, partly to garner discussion.

The payoff is very low. And unless your goal is to be picked up by some low-end blog that will expect you to churn out high quality content to legitimize their website, there is very little to gain. You just do it for yourself. And i don't think raising the standard for what counts as a post will change that.

Hackett ran the Jaguars offense that had Keelan Cole, one of the most impressive UDFA WRs of the last 10 years, who only got onto the field as a rookie due to injuries and exploded for 400 yards in 3 games. And after he had 300 yards in his second season through 5 games, Hackett was likely part of the decision to bench him in week 8 because the Jaguars went on a 3 game losing streak where Cole wasn't playing well in favor for 4th round pick Dede Westbrook -who put up 300 yards over the last 8 games total, and is now out of the league.

The chance of filling all these holes youre pointing out using these picks is astronomically low. and what you're actually giving up is 1.5 starters for a QB.

Another contender for one of the teams top players is Alijah Vera-Tucker who seems to be a god at all of the offensive line positions.

The Jets are outside the top 16 contenders for the superbowl almost entirely because they are missing a quarterback. If they find one of at least top 16 quality, they probably jump into the top 10 for Superbowl contenders and will be a force in the upcoming season.

Dak has been given good weaponry for most of his career, that's undeniable but this year his weapons are worse. and Burrow's weapons are incredible for every year he's played since his first. Top 5 WR in Chase, top 15 WR in Higgins, one of the best slot WRs that's underused in Boyd (who used to be a 1000 yard receiver when before all the other WRs joined), plus great receiving backs. Like the only thing they lack is a top 15 Tight end. Dak's had good weaponry in the past when he had the Lamb/Cooper/Gallup crew but he barely got the chance to play with them. Most of his luck has been in having good OL but you can't accrue big numbers just by having time to throw and yet, his numbers are still in a rare group of high efficiency players who also have high volume of production. and then on top of that he has a 70% win rate for his career.

Like if the cowboys had 1 of those interceptions purdy got lucky on caught and dak's unlucky tip intereception not caught, he's continuing to the NFC championship and might even had his superbowl run this year.

13941,99511,99511,NannigarCire,"This year was a bad year for him, but even with this years stats, his career production and efficiency is above average. But the concept you bring up- of 'should be able to transcend a weak supporting cast'- he did. He did when he won MVP in 2019 by throwing to Mark Andrews, Rookie Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead. He did in 2020, and he did again in 2021 although his interception rate that year was way higher than any other. He didn't do it in 2022. But the concept of turning water into wine constantly over and over again, isn't even proven in the accepted elite quarterbacks. Aaron Rodgers has two years in his career with some of the worst supporting casts imaginable and both years his numbers take nosedives in passing efficiency, just like Lamar, just like Carr this year, just like many other players. Lamar being unable to raise a sub-par offensive cast into a strong offense is already disproven by 2019-2021. Go look at those teams. They are not filled with talent. For his career, the best situation he's had is one good tight end Mark Andrews, one solid receiver Marqise Brown, and rotational pieces.

If the argument is then ""well his most recent season is the only one that matters"" then i'm sorry, it's a bad argument. It's going to fail historically, it's going to lose when i show other great QBs bad seasons, it's an easy argument to show as poor.

13943,99513,99513,NannigarCire,">I hate this kind of assumption. There's also a possibility that Lamar is the limiting factor in an offense with better weapons and his passing numbers don't jump significantly. Until you actually see what happens you can't assume that 30% better receivers equals 30% more production, for example.

​i'm not assuming it, you can look through his year to year and see the worse receivers correlate with worse production. And this is the case for almost every QB in the league, but to a degree that is limited by their individual skills and sometimes by skill mismatch (Carr with Cooper/Crabtree was worse than he was without them, for example). But even so, bad QBs will still improve with better talent. And Lamar Jackson has two seasons that are above 75th percentile with below average talent. It's not going to scale 30% to 30% like you said, but it improves almost always.

IMO what this argument has to say in order to make sense is not that ""the improvement doens't scale"" but that Lamar Jackson is actually not talented enough. And that argument isn't going to make sense.  He is clearly talented.

There is no way the MVP of the 2019 season throwing 66% completion (76th percentile amongst all QB seasons from 2012-2022), 7.8 YPA (78th percentile), 1.5% interception rate (86th percentile), and a 5.4% sack rate (66th percentile) to top four receivers Mark Andrews, Rookie Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead while setting the record for all-time QB best rushing season is not talented.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10gya3b,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-20T15:56:46Z,nyjets,0.0274804574521417
13944,99514,99514,NannigarCire,"I'm saying, he can. He did in college. He ran a pro-style offense. He will still run even in a pro-style offense. But the Ravens built their offense around what they did because they don't have the ability to do anything else. Their roster does not allow for any other offense to be used. They're not going to get much out of a receiver room containing an injured Rashod Bateman, Devin Duverney, and James Proche and then one good quality talent in Mark Andrews. If he's an above average passer with that situation, he will likely be a significantly above average passer in the Jets situation.

As far as resources, the majority of the jets team's cap is tied in veterans that aren't useful. The money is better spent on a QB, and most competitive teams with QBs have no problem having both the competitive roster + the QB on it. Like to put Jackson on the roster you're selling Corey Davis + Carl Lawson + Jordan Whitehead this year. That's an easy sell. And FA rarely has good players on it regardless, because good players aren't usually allowed to walk. And as far as picks go, i've already posted it several times but whats one more- i made a draft pick roulette in excel that takes 3 random 1st rounders and 2 random 2nd rounders from the last 5 years. no filters, so even first overalls are in here to skew the results. Here's 10 runs of spending all those picks:

Kaleb McGary, Brian Burns, Saquon Barkley, Rondale Moore, Ezra Cleveland

Taven Bryan, Alex Leatherwood, Rashaan Evans, Marquise Blair, D'Andre Swift

Rashawn Slater, Saquon Barkley, DeVonta Smith, Courtland Sutton, DJ Chark

Kolton Miller, Kenneth Murray, Clelin Ferrell, Pat Freiermuth, A.J. Epenesa

13945,99515,99515,NannigarCire,"mildly above average while having a below average supporting cast. His support is 1 good tight end and a bunch of rotational parts that are pieced together through injuries and bad luck. Even when he won MVP his supporting cast was very not good. It's a sign of his talent to be that good with that weak of a support.

I don't know if he'd be the same passer if he can't run, but teams are always putting a spy on the field for him and he's still outrunning them while also being an above average passer under a below average circumstance. This year it was even worse because they were using guys like Demarcus Robinson off FA, 36 year old Desean Jackson, and then horrible offensive line play due to trading away one tackle and losing the other to injury.

I genuinely think people are not doing any sort of analysis of Jackson and placing everything onto 1 player when the circumstances are clearly bad, something that also affects all the other potential QBs in this years market from Aaron Rodgers to Derek Carr to Daniel Jones just feels silly to me.

13946,99516,99516,NannigarCire,"if you take away his threat to run by having to commit defensive resources, then yes he'll be an above average passer. That's the point of adding more dynamic players onto the field, it forces the defense to pick their poison. if you're asking if he'll still be that when his body starts to wane, IDK but that's 3-4 years away at least.

looking at the last two years, because he has mostly the same offense during them, only 4 times has a team managed to keep him under 40 yards rushing. he won 3 of them going 62% completion (average), with 6.8 YPA (below average), 5 TDs and 3 INTS. and this on a team that's offering weak passing weapons outside of Mark Andrews, the one year of Marqise Brown, and Rashod Bateman when he's not injured.

I used to fucking hate Derek Carr. Derek Carr was my fucking enemy. From 2014 to 2018 Derek Carr was viewed as the next Aaron Rodgers. I don't know how many of you remember this. It was very common to say he looked like a young Aaron Rodgers and had all the same talent and could make all the throws. Derek Carr even came 3rd in MVP voting in the 2016 season. [He was ranked #11 by NFL players in the NFL top 100.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lile9z7i9yM).

Lets see how Derek Carr's career compared to the average QB season and Aaron Rodgers career over the period of 2014-2018. That's five seasons.

Stat|25th Percentile|50th Percentile|75th Percentile|Aaron Rodgers 2014-18|Derek Carr 2014-18
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
YPA|6.8|7.2|7.7|7.4|6.7|
Completion %|60.3|63.4|66.1|63.7|62.8|
TD %|3.4|4.4|5.4|5.9|4.4|
Int %|2.9|2.3|1.8|1.1|1.9|
Sack %|7.5|6.1|4.6|6.6|4.8|

[Look at this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/017/thumb.png). Carr is either average or worse at anything other than not throwing interceptions or getting sacked. This was supposed to be Rodgers heir?

Here's what Carr's numbers looked like the year he was 3rd in MVP voting:

* 7.0 YPA
* 63.8 Comp Rate
* 5.0 TD Rate
* 1.1 INT Rate 
* 2.8 Sack Rate 

There ain't a damn thing here to celebrate. Below average completion. Below average yards per attempt. Just pure conservatism.

I fucking hated Derek Carr, man. The accolades were unbelievable. And there's no good reason for it. The offensive line was considered one of the best in the NFL. He was playing with Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, two college superstars. Crabtree was already having a career renaissance already when Colin Kaepernick took over for Alex Smith but a foot injury that took more than a year to recover made it seem like his career was taking a downturn too soon. There was no excuse for being this ineffective and inefficient. By the 2018 season the tide would turn on Carr, and he was no longer viewed as the elite QB in waiting. And some weird shit started happening late in 2018.

Michael Crabtree leaves the Raiders for Baltimore. Amari Cooper gets injured. The rest of the team is Jared Cook, Jordy Nelson (his ultimate season at 33 years old), UDFA Jalen Richard, and UDFA Seth Roberts. Carr's efficiency stats suddenly improve.

In 2018 he has 7.3 YPA, 68.9% completion, 3.4% TD Rate, 1.8% INT rate, and an 8.4% Sack rate. His passing effiiency improves. He gets worse at taking sacks, and his touchdown rate goes down (i think this is a dumb stat TBH anyway) but his actually per play passing improves. Why? Because he starts throwing shorter. Carr from 2014-2018 averaged about 8.5 yards per attempt. The NFL average for any QB season from 2012-2022 is 8.0. Carr is throwing at a depth around the 75th percentile on average. That year he starts throwing at...6.9 average depth of target. That's about 13th percentile. And he improves.

The next season the Raiders would drastically reshape their offense by luckily finding Darren Waller and adding slot receiver Hunter Renfrow to the offense. You know what's good about slot receivers and tight ends? They're good at taking short passes. With Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree- their game was mostly deeper down the field. With the Raiders Amari Cooper averaged an Average Depth of Target around 10.7 yards, and Crabtree around 10.8 yards. Darren Waller has averaged 9.1 and Hunter Renfrow 6.8 average depth of target. The Raiders completely revamped the focal point of their offense into two shorter passing targets. Carr's average depth of target returns to 8.5 and 8.4 in 2020 and 2021, but because the focal point of the offense is the short targets, it gets different results.

Carr's 2019-2021 are sick:

from 2019 to 2021 amongst QBs:

* 7.8 YPA
* 68.7% Comp Rate
* 4.3% TD Rate 
* 5.4% Sack Rate
* 1.9% INT Rate


Here's where those rank across those 3 years of play amongst all QBs to throw at least 400 passes from 2019-2021

* Completion % - 3rd
* YPA - 10th
* Sack Rate - 14th
* INT Rate - 15th
* TD rate - 22nd

His passing efficiency is so much higher. He becomes generally above the 75th percentile. The Raiders offense for these three years is top 8 in yards per drive twice, and once is top 8 in points per drive.

And he does this without a lot of talent. It's just Waller and Renfrow and a bunch of ancillary WRs whose career he keeps reviving. Nelson Agholor was first, coming off a terrible 400 yard season he was thrown out of Philadelphia after being a short redemption story, and has 900 yards with Derek Carr before getting a big contract from New England. Zay Jones left Buffalo as a complete and total bust. in 2021 he puts up 600 yards with Derek Carr including a 120 yard game near the end of the season and has his career revived. This year, Carr got Mack Hollins- a player who had 700 receiving yards in 5 years and Carr gets him 700 yards during the regular season. Likely reviving his career too. Henry Ruggs is here too, but he ends his own career by being a fucking moron. But it sets up the ideal situation for what Carr needs- short focal points with a deep support.

What happened this year then? Davante Adams is brought in, shouldn't that be good for Carr? It should've, but then Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow got hurt. And McDaniels decided to send Davante Adams deep. Really deep. Davante Adams career average depth of target (ADOT) is 10.7, the same place where Carr struggled with Crabtree/Cooper. In Adams best and last two years with the Packers, he had 9.7 ADOT and 8.7 ADOT. This year with the Raiders his ADOT was 12.8.

Carr is a great short passer who is very careful with the football. And the thing is, he is talented but has the mindset of a significantly less talented guy. And on top of that, he's just now hitting the peak of his career- you'll find a lot of QBs really hit their best seasons after 30. Carr is a massive buy low with upside to gain. He's in the same area of players that guys like Matthew Stafford and Kirk Cousins belong to as being in tier 2.5- guys who are not talented enough to ever challenge elite status (like tier 2 players such as Burrow/Allen/Jackson) but are far more talented than tier 3 players (Goff/Tannehill) and can sometimes perform as well as those tier 2 players. They're guys who can win a superbowl, even have a run where they are the engine for the superbowl. But just as importantly, they are engines for winning the regular season. They don't get in the way of that.


I like the idea of Carr now. I think people have highly overcorrected for their early career perception of him, and he's now deserving of actual credit and re-evaluation. It's been said before, but most of his W/L record can easily be attributed to being on the team with the 32nd ranked defense multiple times. If Lamar and Rodgers are out, Carr is the easiest buy in the world. And if the Jets are unsure whether Rodgers has more than just 1 good year left in him, Carr can easily challenge him for #2.",12.0,nyjets,t3_10eigeh,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-19T18:43:33Z,nyjets,0.0067778918591168

13968,99540,99540,NannigarCire,"I'm going to put it this way- i don't think Leftwich is special but he's worked with two very different style passers and made both offenses work (even if some of it had to do with Arians tutelage) and him being bad in a season where Brady is probably declining and the laboring Fournette is your main ball carrier feels like it's not surprising. I think a much better OC could be out there and could have found a way to make this offense work, but i don't think Leftwich's OC career is officially dead/bad/over just because of this year. Especially in comparison to Hackett, more than anything. Hackett's coaching season might be the most digusting misuse of resources, talent, and scheme ever put on display. And the only thing Hackett's resume has that's positive is two good seasons with Aaron Rodgers.

Like i follow a theory that for coaches, 99% of them are about the exact same. The remaining 1% are horrifically bad or incredibly good. Mostly because so many people in the NFL coaching system are there out of nepotism.

>poor feel for the game (running the ball on 1st down at an astronomical rate despite having probably the worst rushing offense in the league).

I'm using stathead right now on PFR. The Buccaneers ran the ball on 226 first downs compared to 290 passes on first down. 56% pass rate. They were 2nd in the league in passes on first down, and 4th lowest for runs on first down. They were #1 in the league in passing rate on first down. If we add a scoring margin to -14 to +14 (two score game), the bucs were 4th in passing on first down, and 7th least on running on 1st down. 4th best passing rate in the league on first down when the game is within 2 scores.

IDK so much about the routes thing, maybe that's true- but also Brady was undeniably given a good passing situation by being a top leader in passing on first down. And he's also 45. And he didn't look very good this year.  His balls sailed and he kept throwing short. They probably should've ran it more given that.

13990,99566,99566,NannigarCire,"Another writeup for me, let's talk Aaron Rodgers. Already posted about [Lamar](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/10eigeh/qb_weekly_megathread/j4r67v3/) earlier in this thread.

Aaron Rodgers is turning 40 next year. Despite that, two of his best ever seasons came in the last three years at 37 and 38, and he won MVP in both of them. Even this year, with Rodgers putting up his worst season since 2015, Rodgers was still Rodgers-esque. You don't watch him and see a player who can't do it anymore.

And there's a lot of similarities between his 2015 and 2022 seasons. In 2015, the Packers lost Jordy Nelson before the season started, and were left with Sophomore Davante Adams and Randall Cobb. They'd eventually pick James Jones back up off Free Agency. This was the season where Davante Adams was dreadful. It was almost certain that he was a complete and total failure of a player. His performance was so unbelievably bad. James Jones at 31 led the Packers in receiving yards. It was just an awful team. Rodgers put up the lowest YPA of his career (6.7, lower than Geno Smith's 2 seasons with the Jets and less than Zach Wilson this year) and one of the highest sack rates of his career. Rodgers was even less efficient at moving the ball that season than he was in 2022. And just as similarly, this season the Packers gave him Allen Lazard, rookie Christian Watson transitioning from Division 2 (or 3?) football, and rookie Romeo Doubs from the MWC conference, along with Randall Cobb as his main weaponry. This is a setup for failure.

Also note that if one of the greatest QBs of all time has had two awful seasons as a result of poor supporting cast, it deserves considering for every other QB. Including Lamar Jackson who people claim ""is regressing"", or Derek Carr who is claimed to be ""regressing"" or whoever. You can even dig further and deeper into it to really separate when it does and doesn't matter, but if one of the greatest QB talents of all time is affected by it, it matters. 

I'm under the belief Rodgers will bounce back next year easily, as long as he's given a better supporting cast. I think a lot of people see that too. The question for Rodgers is how many years does he have, and how worth it are they? If the choice is between 1 good year of Rodgers and 3+ years of Derek Carr, it's almost a coin flip. You have one chance to get everything and very little time to make a transition plan. But 2 years or more of Rodgers makes him a nearly automatic get. That's why personally, he's my #2 option after Lamar. You can easily transition from Rodgers if you have more than 1 year to do it.

Also, unrelated as part of evaluating Rodgers, but out of all the Quarterbacks the Jets can get Rodgers seems like the one that would be the least capable to handle the NY media. He's defensive, childish, kind of pretentious and some of his actual ideas/beliefs will run into backpages and backlash. It's sort of hard to imagine a 9/11 truther QB for the Jets. I don't care, i don't look for football guys to be anything more than football guys. But I think it's strange how i've seen posts about Lamar's social media tweeting or Carr's ""good christian"" act as signs of their inability to handle NY Media, but not this guy.

14005,99583,99583,NannigarCire,"i'm gonna post a bit about each QB as i figure out what i want to say about them. I wrote these up in context of QB seasons from 2012-2022, starting with 2012 bc that's when the Read Option transformed NFL QBs and defenses.

Lamar Jackson is most peoples #1 pick as a mix of being immediately impactful, extremely talented, and a likely long-term option. Lamar’s still young at 26, and has yet to hit what is commonly QB peak years of 30+. However, those are usually the peak years for guys who are known for their passing. Jackson’s career as a passer has been inconsistent, with his first full season as a starter having his best performance of 66% completion with 7.8 YPA while also breaking the record for most rushing yards in a season for a QB that same year. Rushing wise, he followed it up with another great year with similar efficiency (6.9 YPC vs 6.3) and in his most recent season has again been very efficient as a runner at 6.8. He’s yet to show any signs of decline in his athletic abilities. As a passer he hasn't been able to meet the 7.8 mark again (the following years were 7.3, 7.5, and now 6.9) but even so, with additional context, the 7.8 mark is hard to believe he ever hit. For the majority of Lamar Jackson’s career his supporting cast at receiver has been sub-par with exception to Mark Andrews, a strong tier 2 tight end. So to hit 7.8 with top 4 targets Mark Andrews, Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead is absolutely lifting the quality of your offense. Same for 7.5 with a similar cast (Andrews, Brown, Rookie/injured Rashod Bateman, Washed Sammy Watkins). What’s even more surprising is that he’s around NFL average for his completion % career despite being one of the deepest constant passers in the NFL, never dropping below 8.3 ADOT in a season. So he throws far, and is still more accurate than 50% of NFL QB seasons since 2012. And his overall career YPA is above the 60th percentile when compared to individual seasons from 2012-2022, his CAREER is above 60% of individual seasons. He's efficient, effective, and dynamic. Plus he might be the best rushing QB of all time.

Lamar hasn’t had an impressive cast to work with but, as is common with any team considering extending a passer they aren’t sure about, the Ravens began to invest heavily in the position in 2021 by adding Sammy Watkins, and spending a first round pick on Rashod Bateman. Unfortunately Sammy was already dusted, and Bateman was mostly injured but they were an improvement over prior receivers and brought Lamar back to the 7.5 mark, steadily above the NFL average in passing. In his latest season, marred with contract negotiation issues, the supporting talent around Lamar took a nosedive again due to injuries and a lacking investment in WRs and Lamar regressed as a passer again. Some of the questions around Lamar remain whether he can transition into his 30s as a passer once his rushing skills began to wane, but there’s not a lot of doubt that the next three years of his career are likely to showcase the best of both worlds for him.

I'd grab Lamar in a heartbeat, even for the cost of 3 1st rounders and 2 day 2 picks. If you think that's too much, i just created a random pick generator that looks at years 2018-2021 and takes 3 random guys from the first round, and 2 random guys from the second round. No filter for picks, so 1st overalls are in here despite how unlikely the Jets are to ever have them in the next 3 years, Lamar or not. Here's 10 totally random runs, no redos.

Daniel Jones, CeeDee Lamb, Derrick Brown, Marlon Davidson, J.K. Dobbins

Payton Turner, Montez Sweat, Austin Jackson, Connor Williams, Marlon Davidson

Mekhi Becton, Zaven Collins, Trevor Lawrence, Deebo Samuel, Taylor Rapp

Rashan Gary, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Daniel Jones, Trayvon Mullen, Jawaan Taylor

Alijah Vera-Tucker, Brian Burns, Frank Ragnow, Lonnie Johnson Jr., Sean Murphy-Bunting

Derrick Brown, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, Noah Igbinoghene, Kyle Trask, D.K. Metcalf

Not counting the one that involves Lamar Jackson, only 2 runs are better than trading for Lamar (the DJ/CeeDee/Derrick Brown/Dobbins and Lawrence/Zaven/Deebo run). 2 out of 10.

If you believe the cap is too much, Jets can probably expect about 36m hit this year for Lamar. That's Carl Lawson + Corey Davis + Jordan Whitehead. If you'd rather have those 3 players than Lamar Jackson, idk what to say. At some point you gotta get good players, and Lamar is one of the goodest at his position.",13.0,nyjets,t3_10eigeh,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-17T12:17:49Z,nyjets,0.013662207451587
14006,99586,99586,NannigarCire,"for a young long-term QB 3 firsts is fine. jets are unlikely to have any 1st round pick in the top 10 with Lamar and probably even outside the top 16. Those picks each have less than like 30% chance to hit for an average GM so they're at most giving up 2 starters (who may not even be elite, just starters). You can throw in 1 day two pick if you want as well since that's like a 20% hit. I think he's likely to net 2 firsts and probably a day 2 pick or two. Russell Wilson got 2 firsts and 2 2nds and i think he was, at the time, perceived a lot better than Lamar is right now.

i swear to god someone is going to reply to this with something like 'Russell Wilson!! now i definitely don't want lamar"" and i'm going to go joker

*to fully extrapolate this idea, i just created a small random draft pick thing where i took the last 4 years of draft classes from 2018-2021 (no 2022 bc unknowns) and took the first round players, and second round players and randomly selected 3 from the first round and 2 from the second round. This is like a worst case scenario trade. No filters at all, so even top 10 picks (that the jets are unlikely to have) are still in here. So heree's what you're potentially missing out on, five runs:

First run: Derrick Brown, Kenneth Murray, Josh Rosen, Ben Benogu, Deebo Samuel.

Second run: Trevor Lawrence, Rashaad Penny, Noah Igbinoghene, Levi Onwuzurike, Nasir Adderley

Third run: Justin herbert, Eric Stokes, Isaiah Wynn, Javonte Williams, Shaquille Leonard

fourth run: Rashaan Evans, Austin jackson, Justin Jefferson, Dante Pettis, Nick Chubb

fifth run: Kaleb McGary, Eric Stokes, Javon Kinlaw, Asante Samuel Jr., Darrell Taylor

There is only 1 run in here that is better than having Lamar Jackson.

*ran it 5 more times for my own pleasure:

sixth run: AJ Terrell, Mekhi Becton, Joe Burrow, Drew Lock, Jawaan Taylor

seventh run:Joe Burrow, Jordan Love, Travis Etienne, Azeez Ojulari, Jalen Hurts

eighth run: Noah Fant, Najee Harris, Terrell Edmunds, Greg Little, Carlton Davis

ninth run: Sony Michel, Javon Kinlaw, L.J. Collier, Samuel Cosmi, Walker Little

tenth run: Brandon Aiyuk, Greg Newsome II, Josh Allen, Walker Little, Nick Bolton

14007,99587,99587,NannigarCire,"i was referring to the relationship between QB Talent to rest of team talent, elite QB talent means you can afford less talent elsewhere, and as you go down in QB talent you need more talent elsewhere etc. I don't prefer Jags and lamar, but this also isn't an either/or. Any team that pays their starting QB has to continuously draft well, play contracts intelligently, and continue bringing in talent. I don't want JAGs and Lamar, but having Lamar is also how you get veteran FAs to want to come here as a last effort to go to a superbowl- which is a highly valuable thing the Jets have not been able to get.

and you're not forgoing the chance to have either, what you're giving up is 2 chances of doing so out of 6 picks the Jets have this year and some amount of FA that would've otherwise been spent on a random guy. In the first round that's the 13th pick, which is well otuside the elite prospect range (so like a 35% chance of them being a hit maybe?) And in FA that's probably not an elite guy either, but an above average to below average starter- because very few good players are even in FA to start with. And if a truly good FA is there, and they're looking at the Jets without a worthwhile QB, why would they come here instead of the chiefs/cowboys/whoever has cap space that is also coming out of the playoffs?

14008,99588,99588,NannigarCire,"But you're screwed in a different way, because they're less talented. They're worse players. You need a higher threshold of talent supporting them to be a year-in, year-out playoff/SB competitor than you do with Lamar, as is shown by the Ravens roster.

>O Line is no longer a disaster. We improve the safety spot, and augment the coverage ability of our LBs. We take more shots in the draft, theoretically augmenting our cost controlled core. You have signifigantly more cap space in the Summer '24, when once again there will be a qb musical chairs situations again, and you have less glaring holes on your roster.

how? Like, how would the team suddenly fix all of these holes in one offseason without accruing any new ones? is there some history or proof that teams just get better every year and never get worse or stay the same? In this scenario you're hoping that something like 7 new player acquisitions all turn out for the best with 1 of them being a first round, probably 1 big FAs and thats the only ones that Lamar Jackson's contract stops. And that's without even accouting for the talent the Jets will lose over the next 2 years due to aging out/contract disputes (Elijah moore will near certainly be leaving and need replacement) And in that scenario, you're hoping for a 80% hit rate on those players just to what? grab the next veteran who is worse than lamar?

I think that's far less likely than paying off Lamar to get a 100% certain hit at the most individually impactful position, while using all the other resources to still attack the same positions. Like what exactly is the %age loss for a competitive jets team to choose at pick 13-24 for the next 3 years vs not picking there and just having lamar jackson?

to me, i can't get behind any of this idea because it's a boat vs mystery box scenario. like this is an idea i understand for Carr/Garappolo, or even Rodgers due to age concerns. There's a big trade off there, but for Lamar? Unless you think Lamar is outside the top 12 QBs and is extermely unlikely to be a top 5 QB, it's hard to agree with any of it- and personally i think he currently is top 8 and very easily could be seen as top 3 in a situation that is very good around him.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10dolj5,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-16T16:29:04Z,nyjets,0.047626430526528

And i don't know what they figured out, Lamar last year put up 7.5 YPA which is just around 75th percentile for league YPA with 64% completion which is just around 65th percnetile while having an awful supporting cast. And then this year, with an even worse supporting cast, his passing efficiency went down but his rushing efficiency returned to the same levle it was when he was MVP.

If 'catering an offense to him' is making guys like Demarcus Robinson and Patrick Ricard play >50% of the snaps then this is a very bad catering job imo. it's more likely they were hitching their wagon to Lamar saving an offense that was lacking the talent to do anything else",1.0,nyjets,t3_10dolj5,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-16T15:50:10Z,nyjets,0.0229565013885498

The idea that a guy who is used to playing hero ball for an entire season would suddenly turn it off when it's carried him all the way there because in a surprise turn of events, some of his players were actually performing for once, isn't very realistic when you can bet the entire week of practice leading up to it was likely based on Lamar being a hero.

I also think it's obvious that Lamar is not in the tier 1 of QBs (the one that used to contain all the elite QBs but now only contains Patrick Mahomes and no one else), so the thought of him having flaws is not an issue. All the tier 2 Qbs, Lamar, Allen, Burrow, and Herbert if you want to include him have significant flaws in their game that keep them out of elite, cause them to have drop-dead awful games sometimes, but also have strengths that allow them to be extremely competitive and SB hopefuls year in and year out. In the past guys like Rivers, Romo, Roethlisberger all fell into this group and all of them were prone to some of the most boneheaded 4 INT games ever seen.

If the goal is to wait for a tier 1 QB to be available, it is never happening.

all of this is just...so not good at evaluating whats happening. How is Lamar playing hero ball if his starting receivers in the playoffs the last time he played were Mark Andrews (good), Marqise Brown (good enough), and then Willie Snead, Miles Boykin, Patrick Ricard, and the ghost of Dez Bryant. What is the methodical non-hero approach to running an offense like this? Lamar had to rush for 140 yards for the Ravens to take out the Titans that year. Without the hero game, they lose. Has Lamar been in a situation with the Ravens to be able to not play hero? He had as many carries in that playoff game as the Ravens RBs.

The jets are not deciding between Q and Lamar, at worst they're deciding between Corey Davis and Lamar and that's an easy trade. Beyond that, the jets are currently running bargain bin player sfor C, S, LB, and are getting a good run out of both ends of the ball without it. And further, the FA is not a place to find great players in those positions, it's a place where you overpay for teams castoffs and are taking high risks regardless. Almost every player we have paid for at these positions off FA has been underwhelming.

Yes, you'll have to lose first round picks to get Lamar and that will make some of the team-building more difficult but the Jets are currently stacked with young talent and alternatively, not getting a QB at all will just waste them altogether. So you can either try to win by grabbing a great QB, weather the storm of not having mostly mid-to-late first round picks to work with (its not like we're giving up top 5 picks) and just roll with 2nd rounders and later on an already talented team while running cap magic to shed bad contracts (Davis, Lawson, eventually Laken and Mosley when he ages out) to replace them with other FA castoffs to fill in holes and so on.

The Ravens have not given him an incredibly talented cast, and he's over *65th percentile in YPA and over 50th in completion %. The Jets current O is miles beyond what the Ravens gave him and on top of that, just being around more talent would inherently mean he'd run less often, be less likely to get hurt, and probably be more effective when he does. Like the year Lamar won MVP his top 4 targets were Mark Andrews (good), Marqise Brown (good enough) and then Hayden Hurst and Willie Snead. Like take a step back guys and really think about it.

I'm confused how Jets fans can not see what is very obvious about Lamar. is this a defensive move to just not be disappointed if we fail to get him? because i've never seen ""he's good but what if he's not elite??"" as a reason to not pick up a QB before.
