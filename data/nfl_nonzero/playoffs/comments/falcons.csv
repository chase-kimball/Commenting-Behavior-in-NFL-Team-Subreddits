233,4077,4077,ARmaxs,"It all started with how poorly we drafted in 2017. That draft class didn’t work out very well with Kazee being the only semi decent player. The 2017 season actually was pretty well with how inconsistent we played (some fault being Sarkisian the other being bad execution)

But the 2018 season is ultimately what ended that regime. The injuries and how much that messed us up for years to come. Freeman was never the same, Ricardo Allen was never the same, Keanu Neal was never the same, Deion Jones was nicked up, losing guys like Andy Levitre hurt a lot. Ryan had a great year but the defense was filled with guys who were practice squad players that it didn’t matter. 

Season altering injuries, plus lacking the drafting ability just to have able bodied players is what set back Dan Quinn and Dimitroff. We always say we wish the Falcons would invest in high draft capital in offensive and defensive line….

>The Atlanta Falcons are arguably one of the most underrated teams in the NFL. While they have had their ups and their downs, they have never really been in the spotlight. Outside of the city of Atlanta, they have a small fan-base, but that doesn't mean that we aren't strong. Dan Quinn knew that when he was going to be our head-coach, he had to both inspire this team and demonstrate that they were capable of greatness. He started a, ""BROTHERHOOD.""  
>  
>To be an Atlanta Falcons fan, means that the sport is beyond you. It is everyone collectively coming together, to cheer as one and bring each other up. Not only do we push each other to limits that were once unknown, but we are also there for one another when we get knocked down. We are each others support system. Matt Ryan embodied this when he put out a, ""thank you,"" video to the fans after his Super Bowl LI loss. Matt Ryan had the biggest season of his career. On the field he posted career bests in completion percentage (69.9), yards (4,944), touchdowns (38), and finished with a QB rating of 117.1. He was also the first Atlanta Falcons player to win MVP, and had the incredible opportunity to take his boys to Super Bowl LI. Most of the Falcon players, including Ryan himself, had never been to a Super Bowl before, and while the heartbreak of Super Bowl 51 resonated amongst all fans, I could not even fathom what it must have felt like to have been him; YET , him being the man and the leader that he is, took the time and made a video to say, ""Thank You.""  
>  
>Being a fan comes with great pride. The group of men that come out on the field every practice and every game represents that pride for us. Julio Jones never stops. He defies the laws of physics, and makes these unbelievable catches that will make you jump out of your seat. Devonta Freeman is such an explosive player who will constantly blow your mind how he gets the yards that he does. I remember when he first got drafted, no one in fantasy football leagues wanted him. Fast forward to 2 years later, he is arguably one of the most coveted running-backs you could have on your team. This year, our offensive line opened up allowing Matt Ryan to have more than one target, making their plays even more exciting to watch- you really never know who was getting the ball.  
>  
>This should demonstrate to you why you should cheer for the Atlanta Falcon's. We never stop, and we never give up. This sport is beyond us, and as I said we are a brotherhood. While, ""we got our ass knocked down on the canvas \[we are going to\] get back up and go fight again. That's what this off-season is about for us."" We are a team under one. In brotherhood we strive, and in brotherhood we rise.  
>  
>**History**  
>  
>From 1965-Present overall the Falcons have a losing record of 312-402-6 since the franchises creation. Rankin Smith was the first owner of the Falcons and was granted ownership by the NFL to prevent an AFL team from forming in Atlanta. The Falcons inaugural season ended in an abysmal 3-11 record. The Falcons would continue to have disappointing seasons until 1971 when they went 7-6-1.  
>  
>The next few years were full of ups and downs and in 1975 the Falcons selected QB Steve Bartowski with the first overall pick of the draft. Lacking competent coaching however (a theme that would continue for years with this team) they were unable to put together any seasons of note until 1978. In 1977 however, although they finished 7-7 and did not make the playoffs, the Falcons defense set an NFL record for fewest points scored against in a 14 game season. 1978 marked the first time the franchise made it to the playoffs where they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round but lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the next round. In 1979 the Falcons would finish a disappointing 6-10.  
>  
>In 1980 the Falcons would finish the season 12-4 and would feature their first NFC West title. However in the playoffs the Falcons would once again lose to the Dallas Cowboys, albeit in a far more painful fashion. In front of a then record Atlanta crowd of 59,793, the Falcons surrendered a 20 point lead including a last minute game winning TD to the Cowboys. This loss would be ingrained in the hearts and minds of Atlanta natives for sometime because of how dreadfully painful it was. The rest of the 80's would be of little consequence for the Falcons with bad seasons and the eventual departure of the franchise QB Steve Bartowski in 1985. Mediocrity was the theme of team for rest of the decade but in 1989, there was a glimmer of hope that once again appeared for the franchise.  
>  
>In 1989 with the 5th overall pick of the draft, the Falcons drafted Deion Sanders, Defensive Back, Florida State University. Deion provided a face for a franchise that had been severely lacking one since Bartowski's departure. Deion, if you have never heard of him, is one of the greatest athletes of all time playing both professional Baseball and Football. He used his pro baseball career to leverage a big contract from the Falcons and in his first game ran a punt back 68 yards for a touchdown. What made this all the more remarkable was that Deion had participated in his first full practice the Friday before the game AND had hit a home run earlier in the week with the New York Yankees, becoming the only modern athlete to score a TD and hit a HR in the same week. The rest of the season was a disappointment though as the Falcons finished 3-13.",3.0,falcons,t3_10efd9a,False,0.0,None,2023-01-17T09:45:52Z,falcons,-0.0097815944835829

Eventually left to pursue becoming a QB coach. That didn't pan out until he had 3 more years as a RB coach with da Bears that had one fruitful season then came to Atlanta and got the QB coaching job he was looking for.

2. They picked Ridder as a flyer in the third because he was there still, and they liked him but didn’t love him, and decided to roll with Mariota to salvage this lost year. Ridder was showing exactly why he wasn’t a first or second rounder in practice all year, and mediocre Mariota provided the veteran experience to keep him off the field. They gave him a few games late when we were out of the race just because, and still didn’t see anything concrete to include him in their future franchise QB plans, because the plan all along has been to get a bonafide guy like Lamar or draft a stud in the first round that they actually like.

Owners aren’t logical. They want a franchise QB as soon as possible because that’s not only the most important position in sports, but a franchise QB sells jerseys, tickets, puts butts in seats, and single-handedly changes the trajectory of success for your franchise.

You don’t call them franchise receivers or edge rushers or running backs. You call them franchise QBs. 

Kyle Shanahan gave up 3 first rounders for an FCS project. 
The Broncos gave up major capital for an older Wilson.
The Browns gave up 3 first rounders and a guaranteed contract to a potential sex offender who they knew would do very little this year due to a suspension.

Watson was the big fish last offseason and he’s a dual threat guy. 
Lamar is Vick 2.0 and I mean 2.0 in a “better” term. 

He’s a perfect fit, when healthy, for this offense. A power run style with Allgeier and CP in the backfield, strong run blocking line, big targets like London and Pitts and whoever else they bring in as WR2? 

Best offense he’s ever played in. 

I just think Blank demands winning now, and he’s gotten TF and AS on that page as well, and this is the way to do it. They didn’t draft Fields for a reason. They added the offensive weapons first and then will add the veteran QB now.

Blew 2014 and 2015 drafts and that’s how they ended up in the needed position to get Wentz then returned to 1 or 2 guys a year that sticks. Actually hitting on FA signings helped with sustained success and good development. Something Atlanta has yet to prove to do under this regime. 

We are especially poor with pass rusher production period yet have spent often trying to get someone as we can’t develop. Further beyond that WR has actually been one of the most important efficient uses of money for these large contracts in terms of production after. Our WR core is weak, not spending money on it while we have Pitts and Drake on rookie deals would seem foolish as we don’t have a lot of production from it. There were 21 WRs and 1 TE who exceeded 1000 yards. 44 players exceeded 750 yards, 39 WRs 5 TEs. Our team leader had 866 ranking 30th. Ranked 44th in yards per game of players playing 8 or more games, only 4 didn’t play 12 or more games so that’s not cherry picked. 

Higgins possess all the qualities of sustained production that can still ascend he was drafted at 20 and is only just turned 24. Has one of the most efficient profiles despite injuries this year limiting him. I’d be curious who you consider getting drafted who can replicate this production? In particular when you use Atlanta’s offence as an example we don’t use our outside WRs, we used our elite athlete at TE as a decoy to open underneath routes and threw it downfield to feign our ability to pass downfield with Mariota. In reality would likely cost our 1st with maybe a late pick back like a 5th or 6th if moved whcih we have other more pressing needs period. 

This is all to say everyone saying he’s not worth it, he’s more than proven to be worth it. He’s also proven he is that guy. Chase is simply a generational talent but VERY few are ahead of him. 

Jefferson, chase, AJB, with him and lamb being a 4A/B as both can be a cornerstone at WR for a decade with multiple seasons proven now.

13495,128345,128345,Wayne93,"I don’t know if this is a serious take ... not proven as a WR1.

Rookie year: 67-908-6 

Before burrow tore his ACL that year he 43-729-4 through 10 games so a 69-1166-6 pace with burrow over 16 games. 

In 14 games last year he had 74-1090-6 as a line or a 90-1323-7 17 game pace. 

This year had 74-1029-7 missing 1 game (2 if you include when Taylor let him play 1 snap after lying about him all week on the injury report or 4 games he got injured or was faked and played less than 25% of snaps - 2 being 1 and done plays. 

The last 2 years this is playing in compliment to chase who is viewed as their 1. Fact Cincinnati ranked 5th this year, and 13th last year for percentage of passing. They’re 22 passing plays above 10th for perspective on how close it is to they pass but not an absurd amount. 

Higgins in 4 games without chase this year was 26-371-2 those are weak numbers eh? On a 17 game pace that’s 110-1577-8. Not really that good I guess, doesn’t prove much that he’s good with or without chase probably.

Became the second rookie TE in NFL history to surpass 1000 yards. Made it to the Pro Bowl. He had a rough season last year due to a mix of poor play calling, chemistry with Mariota, and lack of effort on routes not immediately going to him. He got a knee injury and only played 10 games.

He has fluid route running and quick after the catch. Good hands and he's a fucking albatross. He's an underrated blocker--no Kittle, but he's not a liability and does a lot despite his frame. Great character--he seems quiet but a leader by example. Overall, he has the potential to be the best TE in the league, but it's a case of putting him in positions to succeed and him improving his effort when he's not immediately getting the ball.

Highly recommend watching his [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDFisPo_No); when he gets targets he's really fun to watch.

As someone mentioned, Jimmy made $7 million this season. That's nothing for a QB. That's not QB1 money. And it's definitely not elite QB1 money. For reference, the Falcons paid Marcus Mariota $14 million this season. Mariota is not very good. Patrick Mahomes made $35 million. Trevor Lawrence is on a rookie contract and it averages $9 million a year.

When people talk about the advantages of QB rookie contracts, they are talking about the years where you get an elite QB for cheap before you have to pay him $40 million a year. It only works if the QB is elite (Jimmy is not) and would be in line for a monster contract.

18319,194292,194292,nerdyintentions,"Thats true but its hard to put that on them when they played almost a perfect first half.  TLaw had a 0 passer rating for the bulk of the first half.

I think the offense scored something like 10 points when the drive was preceded by a JAX kick off/punt.  And 20 points when the drive was preceded by a JAX turnover.  The Chargers offense was not great.  They were gifted points all first half by the defense and special teams.  And when JAX cleaned up their offense and stopped coughing up the ball, the Chargers offense went to sleep.  Only 3 points in the second half.  I don't think its too much to ask an offense to score 1 TD in a half of football.  If your offense can't do that then its not playing well.

My general philosophy when it comes to these big blown leads is that it's a team effort because they only happen if the defense and offense both stall out at the same time. I think this one is a bit different though because the defense did so well in the first half and was the main reason the lead was so big to begin with.

So let's say the first 4 picks are Anderson, Stroud, Young, and Carter.  Who needs what?

If the Bears are open to trading the pick, then they aren't taking a QB.  Which is not a need for them and if they took one, it would create a big rukus in Chicago.  Yes, Fields hasnt been great, but putting Young or Stroud in the room, it would harm his development.  Fields deserves another year of development before passing judgment.  Opposite view: they want Stroud or Young and are willing to turn around and trade Fields (this throws a wrench at things) but then why trade the pick?

If CHI actually does want to trade the pick then they aren't taking a QB, AT 1, and they arent taking one at 2 either.  So Anderson or Carter is off the board.

So, if I am TX, why do I need to trade with them?  I can stay at 2 and get the QB I want and if CHI surprises me, I still get Stroud.

Now, at 4, if I want a QB, which I desperately need, I only need to worry about TX and AZ.   AZ is tied to K Murray, even though he is injured.  It makes more sense that they sign a FA QB and take Anderson or Carter.

So, now, at 4, unless CHI surprises everyone, I still get Stroud, or the remaining of either Anderson or Carter, without losing my draft capital, and I can still go sign a vet QB.

19534,215778,215778,ueeediot,"Why?

At 2, the Texans can get a franchise player.  Who are the Bears taking that the Texans are locked in on?

The Texans want a QB, right?  Are the Bears expected to take a QB?

Why doesn't TX just keep their draft capital and take the next best QB?  They wouldn't be wrong to do this.

So. What really is going on here?

Is it possible, at all, that the Bears GM is putting out this trash so the Colts will think they need to pay more to get to 1 than they really do?

The Colts definitely want Bryce Young, because if they wanted Stroud, they can probably get him at 4, unless AZ takes him, which wouldnt be a bad idea, but it would be smarter of them to take J Carter or W Anderson and sign Jimmy G or Jacoby B.

So, sitting at 4, you will have a choice to get a high-quality player, and there are enough quality free agents Matt Ryan can back up.

Tl;dr: The Bears are not getting the trade traffic and offers they were expecting, so they put this propaganda into the universe.",0.0,nfl,t3_10njrfj,False,1.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-28T12:58:40Z,falcons,-0.0202475584708831

AFC SOUTH

The Texans or the Colts.

Both teams have good draft status, but the Texans are going to get a premeir QB.  The Colts are tied to an agkng QB they need to move and make moves to get a new one.  But neither team is hamstrung.

AFC EAST

The Pats are in probably the worst place with Miami a close second if Tua cant stay healthy, but at least they made the playoffs.

AFC NORTH

Everyone has direction here.

AFC WEST

The Broncos are adrift.

NFC SOUTH

The Saints are close to 60m over the cap, have no real options at QB, and almost all of the specialty positions are aging and have bad contracts.  It looks like Saints are going to be their pre Brees selves for a minute.

NFC EAST

3 playoff teams and the Commanders.  Are the Commanders adrift?  They have cap space and a good coaching staff.  If they can keep Dan Snyder locked away from the team l, they could be ok.

NFC NORTH

Agree with it, or not, all the teams in this division have direction.

NFC WEST

A question for 49ers fans.  Are you trading Purdy or Garrapalo this offseason?  (Never mind, I was reminded that Jimmy G is a FA)

Rams are in dissaray, but 1 year removed from a championship, so its understandable.  

Cardinals are in a really bad place, too.  But have the 3rd pick.  

NFC WINNER

Saints.  And its not even close.  60m over the cap leaves them with nothing.  At least the Cardinals and Commanders have cap space and young players.",1.0,nfl,t3_10ikjai,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-22T12:01:35Z,falcons,3.610119470683775e-07
