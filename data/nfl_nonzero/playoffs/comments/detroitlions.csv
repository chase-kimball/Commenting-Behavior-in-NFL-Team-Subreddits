Same deal with Philly, they've got as good or better OL, better WR/TE, significantly better QB on a rookie deal, and a *way* better defense. They can afford the more ""luxury"" type pick of RB because of these differences. 

These situations don't seem comparable to me cause they aren't just in the playoffs or on the verge, all 3 are/were legit SB contenders.

The entire Brad Holmes approach is to build through the draft for *sustained* success as a consistent winner. That means carefully balancing the short-term and the long-term in all decisions.

And a mid-round QB *can* be a great move for the long-term. We’ve seen it work out for plenty of teams, and *not* work out for plenty more.

I’m not advocating for or against Hooker specifically, because that’s a different discussion altogether (he’s old). But if Brad Holmes sees a high-floor prospect (solid QB2 at worst) with some upside, then I don’t think a 3rd-round pick is out of the question. At worst, you’d have a steady backup, which the Lions haven’t had in years. At best, you’d have a franchise QB making 1/10th of what Jared Goff is. Low-risk, potentially high-reward.

For those without a subscription:

6: Tyree Wilson, Edge

15: Devon Witherspoon, CB (trade 15 for 18+48)

55: Mazi Smith, DT

His blurb on the Tyree pick is interesting: 

""Detroit’s in a weird spot and probably wants some equally weird stuff to happen in the top five, so that either Carter or Anderson falls to No. 6. The Lions could take a cornerback here, but I’m not sure Christian Gonzalez is defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn’s cup of tea. Are the other corners worthy of this spot? Tyree Wilson’s length, agility and motor made him one of the most productive pass rushers in America last season. Pro Football Focus actually had him graded slightly higher than Anderson in its pass-rushing productivity stat (albeit on fewer attempts).""

Ideally trade down or Carter/Anderson slipping is best case scenario. If those don't happen, Tyree definitely makes sense since he has the versatility to play SDE and slide inside on passing downs. Would give the d line a healthy rotation of pass rushing monsters. The pick would still maintain positional value.

One of the most eye-opening experiences I ever had was when I first started teaching as a change-the-world novice. I was working with a high school student who didn't understand what I was trying to explain and we eventually figured out that she didn't know how to round numbers. That was my ""oh, this is going to be more challenging than I thought"" moment that every teacher has at some point.

I put a lot of the blame on colleges and the way they instruct future math teachers. I remember having a meeting with an advisor going over classes that I would have to take for my certification, and as we got to differential equations (which I had already taken) I kind of sarcastically joked about how ""that will be super useful teaching high school math."" The advisor, who was a math professor, got really offended. He defensively snapped out ""well, you would want your math teacher in high school to know that, wouldn't you?"" I backed off and said ""Yeah I guess so,"" but I got to thinking about it later, and I really don't think that I would have cared. Having taught math now for close to 20 years, I'm even more convinced I was right - what matters far more than deep field knowledge is empathy and understanding, and unnecessary math knowledge can interfere with that.

University academia tends to be a fairly insulated environment, with an awful lot of echo chamber self-congratulation going on. There's a reason the ""ivory tower"" stereotype exists - while I would never buy into the conservative narrative that their subject areas don't apply in the real world, I do think academics develop an exaggerated sense of their importance and of their own intellectual abilities.

A high school teacher doesn't need to know the math above what they teach in high school, they need to be able to understand what they're teaching enough to break that information down and recognize when and why kids don't understand it. At no point in all of my years of teaching have I needed to know what rings and groups are. The ONLY value I got from those higher level classes is the ability to emotionally relate to a student that is trying to learn something that's difficult. But I didn't need a dozen difficult math classes to do that, I just needed one, and for that one to also make the connection between my struggle at that level and the struggle that my future students would feel. The rest of those classes, I feel, are because math departments are made up of math lovers that have a bit of a distrotrd sense of the importance of the more esoteric knowledge in their field.",24.0,detroitlions,t3_10rqz2t,False,0.0,None,2023-02-02T11:18:19Z,detroitlions,0.0388698779356005

Remember when he was 1st hired he was asked what he learned from Sean Payton.  The short of it, was that every player has something to offer.  If a WR can give you 20 plays where he is a dominant blocker then on play 21 he is going to be wide open.

Ben Johnson has been a mastermind at that.  He sets things up all game for when he needs a big play, not always on a 4th and 1 but whenever he feels the offense needs some juice.

We saw this early in the season with St. Brown on jet sweeps, but also the play with Sewell and the Vikings, with Brock against the Jets.

It's not some genius X's and O's we do a lot of play action and variants from the same look.  Not just the same look pre-snap, but the players are very disciplined to show the same play design.  You can watch film of a sweep to the right, an inside slant, and a TE screen to the left and the 1st 3 seconds of the play look exactly the same.

The defense has to literally just guess and hope they guess right...

As for our defense, to be honest we don't have an identity.  That is part of the problem, we keep trying things and it doesn't work.

Have you ever had a moment where someone you've known for a long time, has a trait pointed out by someone else and your eyes are opened and you can't see them the same way again from then on? (Good or bad) that's kinda how it was for me. I had liked a lot of his bluster but something had rubbed me wrong but couldn't put my finger on it. Then he comes out as insinuating that His time is more important than a coaches time (who had been on before, fairly recently) and he got butt hurt and showed his true colors. He thinks he's God's gift to podcasting and his claim that only he had been praising the Lions came off as, see I did you guys good now you owe me. Others had been saying that the lions were better than what they looked like and that they had been playing well at the end of the season. So that rubbed me wrong too. On top of that he tends to talk over his coworkers. Idk if there is a hierarchy and he's top dog but that just came off as rude to me. I can't stand others that don't let those around them finish bc they Have to say their thing asap. There are a few times that someone gets Excited and Adds to what's being talked about. So that just reinforced the, I'm the most important guy here, mentality. Now, to succeed maybe that's what's needed. But guys like that rub me the wrong way because I've seen it done the other way where everyone counts. Also I apologize to the second guy with the big forehead but he seemed to just nod along or agree. And having yes men around you doesn't help you be a well rounded, in tune, person. You need some people that have slightly different opinions to see things from a different side or else it comes to just being one guy talking padded out with yeses and mmhmms. That being said, most podcasts won't Truely have different opinions bc the reason they came together is they see eye to eye. 

This being said, I have Mainly only seen clips of his show. To truly know for sure I know I'd have to listen to Everything bc I know in short snipits, not everything comes across. But for now my podcast listening is full so I can't squeeze in another thing to listen to. For my non Lion's outlook on the NFL I listen to Mina Kimes. And I'll only catch pat if I see clips with DC. I can't seem to get enough of listening to our head coach. Something about him drives me to try and listen to every press conference and I Never did that before.

In 2021, we did pretty bad at the start of the year. Toward the end, when Goff got some weapons - Reynolds off waivers and Sun God became his favorite target - Goff did better. This year, we had the leagues top offense for like, the first 5-6 weeks. That momentum carried. But our defense was severely lacking. But then toward the end it picked up. The offense stayed relatively stable throughout save for a few tough games (which happens to every team every year by the way). 

I see no reason for the offense to regress. If Jamaal walks Holmes will find a replacement. If Chark walks, Jamo steps in and we will find a replacement.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept insisting and saying “come on” and grabbed my phone to take the picture. Afterward, I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off “I love these people in this city” I heard him say. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands after paying and giving the cashier a tip. 

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, thank you so much for the generous tip.” He said no problem, and walked gingerly out the store.

While I agree with your overall point, the Chiefs actually ran a very similar offense to what we ran this year. Mahomes' stats in regards to deep ball throws and relying heavily on receiver YAC were very similar to Goff's.

Of course Mahomes is able to play more effectively than Goff when a play is outside of structure but if Goff comtinues to have a dominant OL, he doesn't need to be Mahomes for his offense to be effective. 

My concern moving forward with Goff is that if we end up having to pay him top 5 QB money, will we be able to keep our OL intact long enough for us to make a run. Our starters are mostly great but we also need to add more depth and a better option at RG.

31109,180908,180908,Skraxx,"The biggest flaw with this argument, is that it assumes that DJ Chark's absence was the *sole reason* why we struggled with the deep ball. While DJ Chark was out, so were other key receivers: Josh Reynolds and Jameson Williams.

Josh Reynolds isn't a deep threat, but he does come in key for something later. The main one is Jameson Williams. 2021 proved that while Kalif Raymond was a solid target in short to mid passes, he was never really a reliable deep threat. On the other hand, Jameson Williams throughout his college days was a consistent deep threat and in his limited 2022 time showed that he could be at the NFL level. I too, am a massive Goff truther, but I could see that it was just simply chemistry between the two that prevented a couple more TDs.

Now, let's go back to Tyreek Hill. He's mainly known for his speed, but beyond that he's just a great receiver. What the Chiefs did after trading him, was effectively rebuild his characteristics. They got back his speed by acquiring MVS and later Toney. But to keep the reliable receiving ability, they went ahead and also got JuJu. Of course, Mahomes is gonna make anyone work, but the Chiefs scheme can do a lot of the same things they did previously without Tyreek, by instead subbing him out for guys who can fulfill the same roles.

So let's go apply this to Detroit. What are DJ Chark's main characteristics as a receiver? Well, he's a fast enough guy to be a very reliable deep threat. I have already reasoned that the role can be filled by Jameson Williams, with more chemistry between him and Goff. But the other key characteristic Chark has, is size to be able to make contested catches. That's where Josh Reynolds comes back into the fold. If you remember in 2021, Reynolds was a key target in Goff's bounceback for this reason. He had reliable hands and the ability to make contested catches guys like Kalif Raymond couldn't. Even in 2022, Reynolds was less efficient than Chark, but it's a yardage (and efficiency) gap that Jameson Williams could easily make up. Chark and Reynolds only had a 23 yd gap between them, and Jameson Williams sure is more than capable to fill that.",3.0,detroitlions,t3_10z0y4s,False,0.0,CornDoggyLOL,2023-02-10T14:09:44Z,detroitlions,0.0291366236493661

It's a WR class where he's one of the best options for a lot of WR-needy teams. If Holmes believes he can get that same production out of Jamo and WR depth behind him, I'd rather use that Chark money elsewhere.

His performance as a DC is TBD. He took a 2021 defence that was probably considered the worst into the league heading into the season, and made it like... 29th. 32nd to 29th is an improvement, but still pretty rough.

2022 came a similar poor defensive unit but at least with guys like Hutchinson added. The defence started like, generationally bad. And then it rebounded to become one of the better units in the league for a couple weeks. Then it all balanced out.

Really it's to say, I don't think I can definitively say that Aaron Glenn is a bad DC. I can't really say he's a good DC either. It's more likely that Aaron Glenn is a HC candidate due to his personality, where this locker room LOVES him. This archetype is what got Mike Vrabel hired despite being a pretty awful DC for the Texans. Hilariously, it's also what got Dan Campbell hired for us despite not even being a coordinator.

2. The weakness of the CB depth of ours actually makes me fine with the 2nd rd CBs. While Okudah-Jacobs isn't amazing, they are at least capable enough to buy time for guys to develop in that range. Most CBs aren't good immediately anyways.

31228,181071,181071,Skraxx,"My counter to this argument:

1- They were only 2nd round picks due to the recent devaluation of RBs. Had they been in prior draft classes, they would have likely gone much higher. This contrasts TE, which has never been a highly valued position.

2- The TE position has completely different expectations than RB and the reason why the two are devalued are for completely different reasons. The ""typical"" TE that's able to be drafted is there for solid blocking ability, maybe some receiving ability. They are not expected to make a sizeable impact. On the other end, a RB who isn't expected to make a sizeable impact will not be drafted. The average draft RB will extend the team's ceiling a lot higher than the average draft TE. RBs are only being devalued nowadays because of injury concerns, as a high-risk high-reward pick like a RB does nothing to help an *offence that is more than a RB away from winning.

Bijan Robinson is not a Jahvid Best tier RB. Bijan Robinson is a Todd Gurley, Christian McCaffrey and Saquon Barkley-tier RB. If you add Bijan to a bad team, then you'll likely get what you saw from early Barkley and CMC. Really good talents that ultimately don't change much for their bad team. But if you add that tier of RB to a team that's ready for it, you get how Todd Gurley was instrumental in the Rams super bowl run (which flamed out when he got injured). McCaffrey on this SF run. Arguably, Barkley was the only reason why the Giants offence got this far in the first place.

While I somewhat agree with RB devaluation, the degree to which it has been, is kinda insane. I no longer think it's probably worth it to draft a RB if you finished bottom-10, risky even if bottom-15.

2 boxes of stovetop (or your favorite stuffing)

1 cup chicken stock 

1/2 cup white wine

1/2 cup sour cream

1 bulb of garlic 

Preheat your oven to 350. Mince the garlic and sauté for about two minutes on medium heat, add sliced/chopped onions and mushrooms. Cook until the moisture is gone from the mushrooms and the onions are starting to stick to the bottom. Add wine and chicken stock. Render down until the liquid is at about a quarter of a cup, remove from heat. Add soup and sour cream with salt and pepper to taste, mix throughly, set aside.

Prepare the stuffing 

Take your preferred casserole pan, chop up the raw chicken into large bit sized pieces. Line the bottom of the pan with chicken until covered. Pour soup concoction over the chicken and top with stuffing.

34831,208159,208159,Therooferking,"I get it and I agree with you on your points as well to a point I suppose.   It's not even that I don't think he had a great year. He did a lot of scoring and to me that's the entire point of the game. 

I think I have a hard time getting past the fact that he only threw for like 3100 yards or something like that. It hurts them as a team to not put up 4k to 5k because I just don't think you can consistently move the chains in a passing league if you don't put up some numbers. I honestly think the passing tds was a bit of a fluke. He did it so I shouldn't hold some of these things against him and it's probably my bias against running qbs as a whole. 

I think hurts is a better passer than Lamar. If he doesn't limit his running tho he's gonna suffer the same injuries year after year and miss time. 

Kyler is trash imo. 

Mahomes does it right. He limits his rushing to only a necessity. 

Fields sucks. 

Allen is the next cam if the bills don't find a run game. 8 - 10 good years and body to damaged to continue being great.

If he was anyone else, people would be clamoring that he is a bust. I'm not a fan of running qbs because I think it dramatically reduces their career, and it 75% pointless. If Lamar doesn't take those carries, a rb would get them. Instead, they run him, and he gets hurt, missing time every year. Then they got no one who's worth a shit behind him. The rushing yardage record doesn't mean anything to me tbh. It isn't 1 for 1 adding to his passing total. Just hand the ball off instead of destroying your qbs career.

34836,208165,208165,Therooferking,"I think for me, it was just a few different things. Montana, I think, was a given, although I should have said him. Young is iffy. Marino is a no for me. 

It's hard to compare eras statistically. If you throw Montana into today's nfl, does he play 20 years and not miss time? Because of the rules? Does he throw for 80k? 

Also, it's a difficult thing where players land. Brady and mahomes, young and Montana, were gifted great coaches. It matters. Is mahomes a champion if he was drafted by the Texans?  Probably not. I'm sure he'd still be a great player, but we just don't know what happens. It's not just coaches either. Marino was in a tough position in Miami. They threw the ball a lot, which was good statistically, but they either didn't have a run game or had bad defense. Elway carried a lot of those Denver teams until he was at the end of his career then he had a great supporting cast. If you put Marino as a 49er instead of Montana and young, do you get the same result? I'm not so sure. I think Danny would win some rings because he was super talented, but his decision-making was always suspect to me. Or maybe it was just his big game trouble. I don't know, but Joe was much cooler headed. Joe would stand in there and get it done in the biggest games.  Other guys were gifted trash coaching and trash teams. Stafford is a great example. A carousel of coaches and coordinators.  Terrible defense and no run game at all. Yet he still found ways to make it interesting and win some games. Then he gets out and lands with a good offensive minded coach, a defense and weapons. Lights it up and gets a ring. Stafford is a lock for the hof imo. 1st ballot if he plays a few more seasons.

There are 2 incidents I've seen. The 1st one was in high school and it apparently never even happened.  The girls father (Hernandez) said this. 


It was also noted Mixon denied that allegation.

After Rapoport's report, Hernandez's lawyer Blake Johnson gave Florio a statement from his client in which he said in part: ""I do not believe Joe ever did anything to hurt my daughter.""

Hernandez's statement also gave more context to the incident:

""Once, when they were in school together, my daughter had a minor disagreement with some of her classmates that got blown out of proportion. Like any father would, I reacted emotionally. Unfortunately, I did so before I had all the facts. Now, having talked to my daughter and investigated the whole story, I realize that I was mistaken about Joe’s involvement. I definitely overreacted, and I regret that my words might have given some people the wrong impression about Joe. I know that Joe did not hurt my daughter, did not intend to, and would not do so.""

The 2nd was in college. He punched Amelia Molitor and broke her jaw. She assaulted him. She hit him twice, and she got punched. In my personal opinion, she got what she deserved.

The inconsistency is the problem, and that's an issue that goes back to the state of officiating in the NFL. It is a BIG PROBLEM, and the commissioner is completely TONE DEAF about it. Goodell has demonstrated that he's a craven coward and absolute bitch on numerous occasions, but claiming that officiating has ""never been better"" amongst a record number of blown calls, no-calls on obvious penalties, mistakes made with the clock (including one in the Super Bowl), substitution issues and outright dysfunction among game crews where they're literally swearing at one another is beyond preposterous and may be the single defining example of how spineless this ""man"" is. 

If this call is a catalyst to address the elephant in the room that is bad officiating, more power to it. Was it a particularly bad call? I wouldn't say so. I think that the ruling on the [Miles Sanders ""incomplete pass"" that was knocked loose for a second Chiefs fumble recovery/TD](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-catch-rules-super-bowl-57-controversy/q6xmgnhrbjax2s7bsnu2wsro) was much worse, as was the [DeVonta Smith catch where he had two feet down in bounds](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2023/2/12/23597102/devonta-smith-no-catch-refs-super-bowl-nobody-knows-what-a-catch-is), yet was still overturned even after getting another play off (""deFeNsE wAsN'T GiVeN EnOuGh TiMe fOr SubS!"" - when the hell did THAT become a thing!?). 

Bottom line: I knew the Eagles lost when Sirianni made the decision to punt on 4th and 2. You had the announcers talking ALL GAME about how aggressive Sirianni is, and then on the most critical play of the game, he just hands the ball back to the offense that had been kicking his ass all through the second half, rather than trying to pull out his best punt fake. Of course, the bad punt and return to the 2 mean that the Chiefs offense didn't even have to work to score again. If Sirianni had gone for it, I believe in my heart of hearts he would've got it, and this ""bad call"" wouldn't have even been an issue.

They had shown time and again throughout the season that they were soft. They beat the finesse teams like the Cowboys and the Vikings but they could not win in the trenches against the stronger offensive lines nor did they have answers for the stronger defensive lines. 

I hold that Detroit would've walloped the Cowboys had Swift and Chark been in there. As it is they couldn't move the ball because St. Brown had a lock-down corner on him all game and the rest of the receivers couldn't really get open, either. Raymond had himself a good game but they really missed Chark and Swift in the red zone, IMO. Swift's impact on the offense is immensely underappreciated, in my opinion. He's a potential home run hitter that defenses have to account for. Chark played the role of Mr. Reliable outside the numbers. My hope is that we hang onto him while doing our best to turn Jameson Williams into a similar reliable deep/outside threat. We already saw this coming to fruition against the Packers on the TD that was called back. I'd be all for giving Chark another 2 year deal at this point. 

I'm digressing - either way 80% chance to win for the Packers was wishful thinking and dismissal of facts by analysts going into that game.

36216,217888,217888,Wiggymaster,"That one was pretty good. Goff actually had a few like that this season. 

Here are the plays he made that impressed me the most:

[TD pass to St. Brown vs. Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HNa8IQRNw#t=1m21s). Goff was under insane pressure and had to wait for the play to develop. He had to scramble a bit to his right to evade defenders and wound up eating two of them as he threw. Kept his eyes downfield the entire time and did not flinch. He kept his feet planted until the last second and ended up throwing off his back foot on the run. The throw was a bit wobbly but still had some good speed on it and not a very steep arc for a pure arm throw on a scramble. 

[Escaping and running for a first down against Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HNa8IQRNw#t=6m55s). This was a great scramble. He straight matador'd the blitzing cornerback, Kyler Gordon, still paused a bit for a receiver to develop, then saw he had nothing but green grass infront of him and ran for the first down. He wisely dove out of bounds and drew the flag after being pushed into the bench (not clear whether or not he was really pushed that hard but if he wasn't, that's an even more heads-up saavy play on his part). 

[Red-zone TD to Chark vs. Bills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HNa8IQRNw#t=7m31). This was straight-up his most impressive throw of the year as far as I'm concerned. That was a Stafford-esque absolute laser to a receiver under fairly tight coverage. He put that ball where only Chark would have been able to get it, and he did it on a developing play that wasn't his first read. Beautiful pass. 

[Touchdown to Swift vs. the Bears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HNa8IQRNw#t=14m07s). This was Goff basically lampooning himself. He pump fakes a screen a second after the ball is snapped and continues to drop back to more than 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage, waiting for something else to develop. I believe the screen was the likely call here and that Goff actually audibled out of it after seeing the LB on St. Brown. Needless to say Swift gets open right around the LoS and the audible got the linemen in just the right position to give him some help. Result: a play that may well have only been a 2-3 yard gain ends up going for a touchdown.",1.0,detroitlions,t3_10q3n5f,False,0.0,90s logo,2023-02-01T10:33:57Z,detroitlions,0.0351316970454751

I feel like this is where Goff and Stafford are both super similar yet different in approach. During the first four or five years of his career, Stafford would get a bit panicky under pressure, too, and try to find his safety valve and open it whether it was a true safety valve or not. Usually this meant taking a sack or throwing an interception. With Goff, the approach was to throw the ball away even though there might be a guy wide open on a route development that wasn't anticipated. Goff was too quick to dump while Stafford was too squirrely and would hold onto the ball too long. I saw Goff make some huge plays this year that obviously developed from breakdown, which shows some promise.

If our offense is 20% less efficient next year it'll still be in the top 7 and that's enough for a playoff push.

Ramsey is one of those players I wouldn't mind trading for just because what he does for the impact. He's had some degree of playoff success everywhere he's been. Bringing him in would do a lot to say we're serious about contending, especially to other players out there who are looking to join a squad getting ready to go on a run.

36236,217912,217912,Wiggymaster,"People did this to Stafford, too. ""Stafford is only good because Calvin!"" <-- Remember this? 

People will do it to any Lions quarterback, basically. Eventually, the narrative shifted after the trade, and Stafford became ""too good"" for Detroit. He went from him being portrayed as another Phillip Rivers or Derek Carr to being portrayed as Peyton Manning, held back by a terrible team. Nevermind all the interceptions he threw. Nevermind that he really didn't start to understand defenses or become cool under pressure until the later part of the 2010s. 

Don't get me wrong - from 2016 onward, Stafford was fantastic. He started getting creative on the field. But that comes down to veteran awareness vs. his natural talent. Bear in mind that I'm not discounting Stafford's arm talent here - from that perspective, he's better than 90% of the quarterbacks in the league, including Goff. But we have to be real about him. He has the arm talent of Mahomes, but nowhere near the athleticism.  

Goff was scapegoated for a Rams team that didn't know how to move the ball without an all-pro running back. When Suh was calling Goff ""the best quarterback he ever played with"" in 2018 and the collective sports media was riding his dick along with that of McVay's, I scoffed. I saw what Goff was at the time - an efficient and accurate quarterback who had not yet developed into a true difference maker like Stafford was. That team was UTTERLY EXPOSED by Bill Belichick, and they didn't lose because of their quarterback. They lost because they were thoroughly outcoached. Bear in mind that Goff wasn't extended until AFTER that Super Bowl. 

Over the next two years, as McVay ran out of creativity for his over-85%-11-personnel-schemes, as more and more defenses caught on, the offensive line became weaker and the running back room never even came close to having someone as talented as Gurley, Goff became the convenient target. He looked more like he did in his rookie days then, panicking under pressure. The fact of the matter is that McVay's schemes were too stale for a guy like Goff to effectively run them. Rather than accept that his schemes needed to evolve and deviate from his ""genius"", McVay lamented that he didn't have a veteran quarterback like Stafford, who could audible his way out of an obvious jam that Goff hadn't yet learned to recognize. Cue the trade.

Goff has every chance of becoming an even better quarterback than Stafford. He's Tom Brady like in both efficiency and quickness to get rid of the ball when he's in a jam. This is something Stafford never did and would cause him to eat dozens of unnecessary sacks. He'd also try to do Favre-esque throws across his body off his back foot and wind up tossing pick six after pick six because of it. Most of Goff's interceptions, historically, have been on underthrown/overthrown balls or miscommunications with receivers. We're seeing less and less of this as Goff matures. Goff has improved his footwork, pocket presence and ability to make plays out of the pocket, too. Moreover, we're seeing what he can do with a REAL offensive mind, who gets creative not just with 11 personnel but with tackles as tight ends.",2.0,detroitlions,t3_10modiw,False,0.0,90s logo,2023-01-27T18:46:55Z,detroitlions,0.0002983471222338

That status lasted all of half a year before other QB contracts started coming home to roost. The fact is, how good your quarterback is does not determine what he gets paid. If he's in the top half of the chart, what determines his pay is the market, and when he signs his contract. 

I'm hoping Goff would take a team-friendly deal with lots of guaranteed money toward the back end of his contract - say right around where he's getting paid right now.

I really couldn't care less what some model predicts as to whether or not a receiver is going to make a catch or a quarterback is going to make a throw - I just care that the throw and catch are made. As a weather enthusiast who actually uses computer models to make my own forecasts, I know how silly it is to rely on one model or method to try to predict the future even with very sound, reliable mathematical figures that track observations and update every few hours. To paint an accurate picture, you often have to use an ensemble of models that use different methodologies to plot solutions and try to find what's the most likely based on what the ""spaghetti plot"" gives you. Even then, it's rarely on point, especially more than a few days out. Either way, the object of weather forecasting is to try to figure out whether or not you should take an umbrella, or whether or not damage to life and property are possible in a region due to atmospheric phenomena. When it comes to ""sports forecasting"", the obvious motivation is gambling. 

The bottom line is that Goff completed X number of passes out of Y number of throws. His receivers dropped Z number of balls. Opposing defenses caught I number of bad/tipped/missed throws, and our receivers made it into the end zone T number of times after making a catch. As long as T is a relatively high value, I is a relatively low value, and X is fairly consistent/high as it relates to Y, chances are I'm going to be happy with the quarterback in question. There are other numbers I like, such as D yards gained and A average yards per throw. Goff is high in all of these *very real* figures.

He cared nothing for the on-field product; if anything, he reveled in the identity of the Lions as losers, because he was still making money hand over fist with the attention. It was all a huge joke to him; a club for his buddies to spend weekends and have a job if they needed one.

36269,217953,217953,Wiggymaster,"But it wasn't even close to rock bottom in this franchise's history. Again, we're comparing this to a GM who didn't even have enough sense to follow the Rooney Rule and wound up costing the team $200,000. We're comparing this to literally dozens of these empty-stadium moments when fans stopped showing up and the games weren't even televised because, back then, you had to sell out to have your game broadcast. No global pandemic was necessary when your football team sucked *that* bad. The look of disgust/shame/embarrassment on Sheila's face was something to give you hope. WCF's response to the second-highest-paid GM in the NFL going 13-51 over a 4 year period was to extend him on a five year contract that made him the league's highest paid GM. 

I want you to think about that for a bit. The descent started when Barry retired in 1998, pre Millen. The descent continued when Millen was hired. The team was 2-14, 3-13, 5-11 and 3-13 during his first four years. He was then extended. We were not free of him as fans until *true* NFL (not Lions - **NFL**) rock bottom came in the form of a 0-16 season. He was fired midway through.

There was no true Lions fandom in 2008. At that point, we were merely guys getting together and making fun of something too horrible to take seriously anymore. Some of us truly thought the team was going to be disbanded or moved to London. There was ZERO hope, ZERO indication things would improve, and ZERO reason to tune in unless you were just looking for laughs. I believe there were only 3 players left on the team from 2008 as of 2011, which was the Lions first winning season in over 10 years. One of them was Megatron. 

Think about that statistic alone. 10 years without a winning season. We just got done going through 5, and it felt like an eternity. I graduated highschool in 2002. I was 28 years old the next time the Lions had a winning season. This is why I don't get negative as much anymore.

36276,217961,217961,Wiggymaster,"Here's the deal: As a Lions fan, all I've EVER wanted a quarterback who could go 10 games without an interception while running an offense that can average 25 or more ppg. As of right now, Goff is one pick-free game from being that guy. Growing up in the 90s and watching Barry Sanders pillory opposing defenses only for the endless quarterback carousel to turn the ball over and lose us games, this is a dream come true. 

If Goff can keep this up, he's the guy. This is prime Tom Brady level play. You remember him? The guy gets rid of the ball quickly without turning it over. He doesn't have the true gunslinger mentality - he's playing much too smart to simply launch balls out of a cannon and put them up for grabs. That means he's probably not going to have 400+ yards per game, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO IF WE'RE STILL SCORING MORE THAN 30 POINTS. That could be Goff.

All we need to do to win football games at this point is get stops. Period. Everyone is obsessed with the next Patrick Mahomes when Patrick Mahomes has won *one Super Bowl*. Know what set the Patriots' dynasty apart? **It was their defense, stupid.** Tom Brady is known as the GOAT simply because he knew how to lead the offense and took care of the football. The Patriots did not run ""the greatest show on turf"" at any point - they ran simple, hyper-efficient offenses which, when combined with strong defenses, just won the law of averages. Brady is not and never has been Mahomes-ian, yet like Sonic the Hedgehog he has [Seven Rings in Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md6q9EYsbAM).

Other than maybe one IOL (& that’s a thin position in this draft) the entire draft should be defensive.

44782,273826,273826,jimmyslamjam,"Picture this: ​


The year is 2049. Dan Campbell just finishes his shift as a milkman. He loads his empty milk crates back into his truck and takes it back to the depot, before picking up his own two bottles and heading home. ​
Campbell pushes the door open - it's 04:48. His wife, Jennifer, is still asleep. ​


Campbell sits down on his sofa. He peels the foil off the top of the milk and gently brings it to his lips, pausing briefly. Is someone watching him? No. Of course not. ​


With a sigh, Campbell pushes himself out. He's older now than he cares to recognise, not what he once was. ​


Moving over to the bookshelf, he moves a dusty metal mouthpiece from the top of a slightly cleaner book. A photo album. Memories. Campbell sighs again. ​


Peeling the pages apart, like how sweat would later stick himself to the bedsheets, he grins. Resting between the pages were the still faces of those who had once tried to stop him. ​


New clippings - headlines - internet posts. All of the fighting. All of the drama. ​


And what for? ​


Campbell slumped down into the privace of his chair - his body clicked and a grimace followed each shaky movement. ​


The chair itself rattled as he pressed his weight into it - the Honolulu blue and silver metal shooting light across the room, into Brad Holmes' line of sight - though partially blinded, he could see the chair clearly enough to tell it was made of metal kneecaps. ​


Campbell coughed - a hollow, haunting noise. His bald head hit the back of his makeshift throne. Movement came from upstairs - Jennifer was up. ​


In pain now, and through a raspy breath that sounded so familiar, he called: ​


""Jennifer?"" ​


She came into the room - her long pink night gown trailing behind her. ​

Jennifer had a chiseled face. Stubble spread across her chin and decorated her neck, trailing off until the hairs disappeared under the soft, pink fabric. ​


Her short blonde hair stood with the weight of an expensive gel. ​
Brad Holmes watched the scene in Awe. Jennifer - Jared Goff - walked over to Campbell and held his head up gently, caressing his neck with adoration. He was old now. ​


Brad Holmes turned around. Campbell was dying. It was no place of his to intrude. And so he left.

I am actually really high on Murphy and Hyatt too, so it’s great to get your feedback. My comp for Murphy is actually Michael Brockers (although Brockers is a DT). He went 14th overall in 2014. They are/were long freak athletes that are smart, but whose stats and technique were not as impressive in college compared to their athletic ability. I think Brockers only had two sacks the year he came out of LSU. I think Holmes (a national scout for Rams at the time) values that type of athleticism in the Dline, even if it is raw. I think his first choice would be to get a DT in the first that matches that type of athleticism (like he tried to do with Levi two years ago), however I only see Carter in that category this year. So Murphy is the next best thing.

As for Hyatt I see him being very similar to Jaylen Waddle and Jameson, all three similar height and weight and can play in the slot and outside. Although to be fair the first two were better coached and better all around players in college. I just don’t think he is going to come off the board where the Lions will be able to pick him (Late 1st to mid 2nd rd). Unfortunately that Alabama game clouds my judgment on him, so I am really enamored with him and I am probably projecting his potential based on better coaching rather than his current ability.

I think you could put Witherspoon in the Nickel Corner spot for his first few years but if the Lions don't plan to have him as an outside corner I am not sure it is worth the investment. In that case I would go for Gonzalez and let him develop under Okudah and a FA Corner.

I don’t think that Bresee will be the Lions selection at 6 or at 18. I only see Myles Murphy and Devon Witherspoon  likely/worthy of the 6th pick. If Murphy tests crazy at the combine I can see him going top 5. We just have to hope the top 3 QB’s play lights out on their Pro Days. If Witherspoon is our selection at 6 then I don’t see us picking a Cb at 18. However, if Murphy is our selection I would see us targeting someone like Christian Gonzalez with our 18th pick. Only problem is that I am not sure Gonzalez will be there at that point in the draft. In that case it’s BPA. I can see the tackle from Northwestern dropping (because he will be looked at as a guard instead of as a tackle), Holmes selecting the 3rd best CB (I am just no sure who that is right now), Trenton Simpson (LB from Clemson), Smith-Njigba (If Chark leaves I can see us going after a top flight WR, although I like Jalin Hyatt more right now, but I am not sure if he will drop as far as 48).

Breece Hall was ridiculous before he got hurt. He was averaging 5.8 yards per carry, which would have ranked #1 among all RBs this season. He was a good weapon in the passing game too. As good as Wilson is, Hall was running away with OROY and it wasn't even close. If Hall can return to form, he might be the best RB in the NFL in a couple years.

Teams hiring head coaches have to abide by the Rooney Rule and must at least interview one or more minority candidates for positions.

Honestly, I think if I had to pinpoint a moment it would’ve been the opening press conferences Where Brad and Dan were introduced because for the first time I saw in Dan head coach with humility and (not to be cliché) but grit, who truly understood what kind of team this city needed, and Brad came in with the same level of humility, but also an eagerness to create something wonderful here.

I think in Matt Patricia’s opening press conference he said that he wanted to build a blue collar team but clearly had no idea what that meant or how to do it.

Seeing Sheila bring in old players, watching how she has taken so many peoples advice, seeing the trust and patience that she has in her staff, and clearly listening to the fans makes me feel like this isn’t just a cash cow for her, but rather a legacy that she wants to build for Detroit.

Violations of NFL's personal conduct policies

In 1996, Favre was temporarily banned by the NFL from drinking alcohol,[251] after he admitted he was addicted to Vicodin,[252] and spent 46 days at a drug rehab clinic before the start of the season.[253] His condition was serious enough that he had a potentially deadly seizure.[254]

Sexting allegations and investigation

In 2010, the NFL investigated Favre for allegedly sexting and leaving inappropriate voice messages for Jets ""Gameday host"" Jenn Sterger during the 2008 season.[255][256] According to the NFL, forensic analysis failed to prove Favre sent the objectionable photographs to Sterger.[257] Favre was found not to be in violation of the NFL's personal conduct policy, but was fined $50,000 for failing to cooperate with the investigation.[257]

Mississippi welfare funds scandal

Main article: Mississippi welfare funds scandal
In 2020, Favre's involvement with the development and promotion of a concussion treatment drug, Prevasol, by the Prevacus corporation, came under scrutiny. The nonprofit Mississippi Community Education Center (MCEC) received $2.5 million in federal grant funds diverted from Mississippi's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families welfare funds (TANF), as well as tens of millions in public funds as an element of the scheme. The Mississippi state auditor has termed the scheme ""the largest public embezzlement case in state history"". A grand jury in Hinds County indicted MCEC founder, Nancy New, and her son Zach in the scheme. Favre had introduced MCEC's founders to top state welfare officials.[258] Former Governor Phil Bryant is also involved in the scandal.[259]

No-show speaking fees

On May 4, 2020, an audit in Favre's home state of Mississippi alleged that state's Department of Human Services misspent $94 million intended for at-need residents, including $1.1 million paid out to Favre's company for two speaking appearances he did not make.[260] The Mississippi auditor later announced that Favre intended to repay that money.[261] On October 12, 2021, the Mississippi State Auditor notified Favre that he could face a civil lawsuit if he did not pay the state $828,000.[262] Favre paid $600,000 on October 26, 2021.[263] The Mississippi State Auditor said Favre still owed $228,000 and referred the matter to the state attorney general's office.[264][265] Favre was questioned by the FBI over the misappropriated funds. His lawyer has stated that Favre did not know the money was misappropriated from funds used to assist poor families and has not been charged with a crime in these matter.[266][267]

Diversion of funds for volleyball facility and biotech venture

A lawsuit filed by the state of Mississippi alleges Favre orchestrated the diversion of federal welfare funds to non-welfare related causes.[268]

On September 13, 2022, Mississippi Today published text messages between Favre and former Mississippi governor Phil Bryant showing Favre's involvement in a plan to divert $5 million of the money toward a cause championed by Favre, a new volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi, his alma mater and where his daughter played volleyball.[269] The text messages had been entered as evidence as part of a civil lawsuit.[270] In one of the texts, Favre asks, ""If you were to pay me is there anyway the media can find out where it came from and how much?""[271]

Favre helped arrange for $2 million of the funds to be invested in a biotech startup in which he had already invested.[268]",9.0,detroitlions,t3_10haiaw,False,0.0,DETROIT -VS- EVERYBODY,2023-01-20T17:24:16Z,detroitlions,-6.292314995589308e-06
