Packers will win against the 49ers with leading most of the time

Rams put the pieces together and win in a close match against the Bucs

Bills overcome their shadow of past playoffs and beat the Chiefs

14406,14406,Bacun,"In the NFL, a single change in possession is a massive change in the game. Tiring out the defense, managing the clock, scoring points, keeping your defense fresh by keeping them off the field (to better close the game towards the end), these things can only be done if you have possession of the ball. There are NFL stats out there that strongly tie possession/turnover with how often teams win. 

The average number of possessions a team gets in an NFL game is around 10-12. If you compared that to Rugby which has around 90 (from Google), you can see why NFL teams don't want to risk laterals unless truly necessary.

I will also say that laterals aren't used because no one really practices it. Maybe a change in the game that incorporates high risk high reward lateral plays will be used, but there are already things like screens (uses a sideways pass to set up the play) in the league. But yea, it is still very risky and players aren't used to the idea of it. Although there are some great lateral plays that have happened, but more often than not stupid laterals end up with the defense getting the ball.",3.0,nfl,t3_zgxme2,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-12-09T11:16:09Z,falcons,0.0839626064224497

The only reason this is a thing to begin with is because the NFL asked the Marriott to let them know of any issues with their employees (Irvin was there on assignment). Once notified, the NFL removed him from the Super Bowl show and then Irvin sued for damages.

With Ridder, London was targeted 36 times, catching 25 of them for 333 yards, 13.32 yards per catch. On average, he received six targets per game with Mariota as quarterback compared to nine targets with Ridder under center. Moreover, London had a 69.4% catch percentage with Ridder, compared to 58.7% with Mariota.

>In every metric, London’s connection with Ridder was much stronger than the one he had with Mariota. Granted, Kyle Pitts was healthy during most of those games before the Falcons made the quarterback change. If the unicorn tight end had been healthy with Ridder, you’d expect London’s production to take a dip, even if it was marginal. Still, it’s very obvious that Desmond Ridder and Drake London have something special brewing in Atlanta.

He also has created 3 straight years of [30 defensive stops ](https://twitter.com/pff/status/1135958411139604480?s=21) And he also lead the team in [run stops](https://twitter.com/pff/status/1102596319313649665?s=21) 

He’s able to do that because he combines strength with great hand/arm placement which he gets better at each year, again check his stats. He lead our team in [QB pressures](https://twitter.com/pff/status/1125774047025991680?s=21) which is just as important as a sack.

In fact his pressure rate is third among DTs in the NFL, behind Aaron Donald and Cox.

Having a DT that can rush the passer and stop the run is something ever NFL team really really wants, and we got one who is consistently improving, and has the most sacks in a Super Bowl game.

77351,77351,LifeTableWithChairs,"Could  I remove intentionally tackling other players without making football a different sport?  No.

If I were trying to reduce the number of tackles that occur in a game while still keeping the closest thing to current football as possible, here's what I would do.

All players are designated as either Tackle positions or Flag positions.  Tacklers cover all trenches and RBs.  Flags cover QBs and Receivers.  They are discerned by the fact that Flag players wear flags.  Tacklers can advance the ball by the ground and only the ground.  Flag players aren't allowed to get hit intentionally.  To 'tackle' a flag player, pull the flag.  TEs need to be declared Flag or Tackle positions in advance.  On defense, Safeties and CBs wear flags and are the only players who can advance an interception.  All other players are immediately downed with the interception at the spot of the catch.

This way you can still have run plays and throwing plays.  You still have a fight in the trenches and the potential for sacks.  You can still have trick plays where a RB takes the ball and throws it sideways to the QB who makes a forward pass.  But you don't have scrambling as much or YAC as much as 'tackling' flag players is a lot easier.

It's much closer to the current sport than Flag football.  The main benefit is that if a kid wants to play football, weary parents can easily say 'you can play QB, WR, Kicker, or CB' rather than the current situation where Kicker is the only 'safe' position.",-1.0,nfl,t3_102evhm,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-03T13:35:26Z,falcons,0.04613741898617892

If football becomes viewed as equally dangerous as boxing by parents, the number of kids interested in playing football may not be enough to put together a 53-man team at many high schools.

Sure, you have plenty of people who become boxers with the financial incentive, and you have plenty of fans who watch boxers pretty often, but the number of boxers in HS are nothing compared to how many currently play Football.

I don't mean that *no one* will want to play football.  I just mean that the potential recruit population will shrink from 900k HS players to less than 50k.  Colleges will feel this first.

“We’ve talked about trying to get over the hump in some of these close games and where we’re trying to push the offense,” Smith said. “We feel like it’s the best decision where (Ridder) is at and where the team’s at. I wouldn’t have made this decision if I didn’t think it was in the best interest of this team, not only short term but probably long term as well.”  
  
Ridder, who was 34-for-56 passing for 431 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions in the preseason, has made enough progress in the last month that the Falcons believe the offense “can operate at full capacity” with him in the game, Smith said.  
  
“We would have had to adapt if he had had to play early in the season,” Smith said. “I feel really good about where he’s at right now. If I thought we had to restrict him, that wouldn’t be the best move and that wouldn’t be fair to this team.”  
  
Falcons running back Caleb Huntley said he was surprised when he learned of the news via social media on Thursday. Huntley’s and Ridder’s lockers are side by side in the team’s practice facility, and Huntley said he thinks Ridder is ready for the challenge.  
  
“He’s a cool guy, funny, I feel like he can command the huddle,” Huntley said. “I knew his time was going to come sooner or later. I think he’s ready for it.”  
  
Ridder looked sharp during Atlanta’s walk-through on Monday, Huntley said.  
  
“He’s always looked pretty good at practice,” Huntley said. “He makes the throws that he needs to, and he’s always confident, so I know he’ll be ready.”  
  
Monday was the team’s first official workout since a Dec. 4 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Falcons had a bye last week. Smith made the decision to change quarterbacks last week, but the team didn’t announce the decision until Monday.  
  
Running back Tyler Allgeier, who goes to dinner with Ridder and fellow rookies Drake London and John FitzPatrick the night before every game, spent part of his off week catching passes from his friend to help build on-field chemistry, he said.  
  
The team’s more veteran players will take plenty of time with Ridder this week as the Falcons get ready to face the Saints (4-9) on Sunday in New Orleans, wide receiver Damiere Byrd said.  
  
“Just go out and work with him, get our timing down, get his trust in us, get our trust in him, just kind of get in that routine with him,” Byrd said. “I’m here for whatever our coaches feel is necessary to help us win these next few games so we can get in the playoffs.”  
  
Atlanta is one game behind division leader Tampa Bay. The Falcons’ top priority is to maximize this season’s potential, Smith said, but the coach at least acknowledged the fact that evaluating Ridder now could have future benefits for the team.  
  
“There is risk anytime you make a move, but you have to be willing to take that if you want to break through,” Smith said. “We have been in a lot of close games, made a lot of progress, but our objective is to get over that hump. If it benefits us in the long term, that’s a really good thing for us.”

Ridder has yet to play in a regular-season game, and the only other player on the Falcons’ roster who could reasonably play the position is Feleipe Franks, who was 0-for-1 passing with one interception last year before being moved to tight end in the offseason.  
  
Smith informed Mariota of the decision to make a change at quarterback on Thursday morning. The Falcons learned Friday that Mariota planned to step away from the team. This is the second time Mariota has been benched while playing for Smith. The first came in 2019 when Mariota was Tennessee’s starting quarterback and Smith was the Titans’ offensive coordinator.  
  
“Those (conversations) are never easy,” Smith said. “You try to be truthful, whether they agree or not, those are the conversations you have to have.”  
  
The Falcons signed Mariota to a two-year, $18.75 million deal in the offseason. If he is cut after the season, they would save $12 million worth of salary-cap hit and have to count only $2.5 million worth of dead money to the cap.  
  
The decision to elevate Ridder was “performance-based,” Smith said. Mariota was 184-for-300 passing for 2,219 yards, 15 touchdowns and nine interceptions this season. His 88.2 passer rating is 21st in the league and his EPA per game (.66) ranks 20th among quarterbacks.",60.0,nfl,t3_zl0fl2,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-12-13T12:21:10Z,falcons,-2.8738686119781438e-06

Keep Ridder/sign a vet.  This is the least risky option it won't mortgage our future at all. Low risk all around it's possible he balls out its also possible he's a career backup that we've only spent a 3rd round pick on.

Trade for Lamar. This is high risk/high reward. I'd only want if he's on the non exclusive tag where he goes for two firsts. If he stays healthy and balls out then he's worth the contract. We're gambling with our draft picks, hoping the cap goes up, and LJ to stay healthy.

One part I like to point out about Lamar's contract is that in the near future we've got deals coming to Herbert, Hurts, Mahomes, Burrow, and Lawrence that may look LJs deal look like chump change.

Our last real option is to trade up for a QB we love. This may mortgage our future draft picks but won't hurt our cap room during our most important year of a rebuild. This will likely cost us as much or more draft capital than an LJ trade. This is also high risk/high reward.

We can go ahead and sign any other vet to compete with or take the starting job from Ridder but thats low risk/low reward and eats up cap for no reason.

 Pickett was the most pro ready of the QBs he lived up to that. He was thrown into the thick of it and was asked to do the most he has shown he can be a serviceable starting QB in the NFL.

Ridder was next up in line with being pro ready he knows how to run an NFL offense and has the intangibles but he has to work on his throwing mechanics and accuracy. He was given the best chance to succeed and showed improvement with every game. He did not show enough to say he is anymore than a backup yet.

Willis had a great build, speed, and arm strength but is all raw talent that needs a lot of grooming and even that may not be enough. He was not asked to do much and only really showed off his legs as being effective.

Purdy is propped up by a good system, coaching, and a strong team around him. I would have to watch more film of him to make a fair assessment.

Theyve seen him running the scout team and that means they've seen him play in a lot of different ways. He will certainly lack chemistry with the starters early but to suggest they don't have a good assessment of his strengths and weaknesses is not something I'd agree with.

My friends liked the following teams the Vikings, Chargers, Lions, Titans, and Rams. 

Being in Northeast PA I had to deal with many Eagles fans, Giants fans, and Steelers fans as well they were almost all quite a bother.

That eliminated so many teams to pick from. I then narrowed it down more from there and decided between the Falcons, Ravens, and the Texans. 

I liked the Falcons colors and being a weirdo I thought the Ravens being a spooky bird was cool as well. The Texans being the newest team in the league also made me think twice about them as they would be forever the underdog and everyone loves a good underdog. Almost made sense being a new fan to pick the newest team so no one could call me out for a bandwagon pick.

Mariota is arguably playing worse than Fields with much more experience and better surrounding talent.

Fields is built for Arthur Smiths run heavy game. He wants a QB to take some shots downfield. I watched him put a few nice deep balls out there. He missed a couple made some bad reads as well but we got big receivers with stronger hands.

In the past we have drafted QBs well but there's too many busts to assume we're gonna hit our next franchise QB in one draft. If we are honestly looking to set ourselves up drafting Willis gives us two chances to hit on a franchise QB. 
Our only other chance is paying out the ass in FA for a franchise QB coming off of their rookie contract. 
Personally I prefer to have the rookie contracts tied to us rather than paying a fuckload for a QB that's gonna hinder our rebuild.",1.0,falcons,t3_u0m2fp,False,0.0,It puts the lotion on the Rid...,2022-04-11T23:56:09Z,falcons,-0.004451540040969849
82956,82956,Motor_Rub_4848,"I mean really you just get a bunch of young busts and pair em with the Jerry rice type veterans this kid is talking about who are just trying to play ball. Sign them to short terms deals. You expect to suck for a couple years probably get the first pick in the draft your first year in. 2 to 3 years after drafting and playing around in FA with a huge salary cap available to you ought to make for a good team. Gonna take some time to draw high profile players without paying out the ass or drafting them as an expansion team so I wouldn't expect that to work. 
You have to pick up a veteran QB early and stopgap them into your franchise QB. This is where I wanna go draft and get a QB on that rookie contract. Don't want to overpay here just for a big name to come in and eat up your cap space as that is gonna be all this new team would have to influence players to join. 
I don't think your RB is gonna matter they burnout quickly you can easily draft a good one without expending much capital that still has his health. 
WR room you need at least 1 veteran in this group and I'm trying to spend big on at least 1 up and coming receiver coming off their rookie deal in FA. 
I want a veteran TE that I'm spending a bit on it so my QB has a chuck down option in case of emergency. 
Realistically it's gonna take some time for your O line to mesh so the draft with some veterans in front of them is how you're building here 
 I'm gonna stop now defense is trenches as well but you need a general of a linebacker and/or safety.

TLDR 
I take the hit and build a young team with a handful of veterans to teach the newbies and win through FA and draft capital in a few years .",1.0,nfl,t3_tyu6jn,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-04-08T00:31:48Z,falcons,0.04847296990146821

But we basically didn’t have any cap space so we had to settle for the players we could afford, hence the team having many holes that need to filled with better talent on both sides of the ball. The front office did make cuts to players to get back into a reasonable salary cap situation, hence the trading and cutting of players when they first showed up and only 2 players took up a huge chunk of that cap space we needed.",0.0,falcons,t3_11ombu0,False,0.0,:Juliostare:,2023-03-11T10:56:08Z,falcons,0.0171824

Being called losers obviously hurts as first, but now everyone does it, everyday. So we make some changes. Our parents get us a new car for our birthday, but its a used Camry with a bad accident history. It isn't flashy, but our parents told us this should be a reliable option. Doesnt seem to really seem to help, though. The ridicule continues. So we decide to buy a couple new outfits. Only, no one told us that Beyblade isnt cool anymore, and that honestly, it never was, so that new t-shirt with Gingka on it isnt winning us any new fans. Despite telling ourselves that our new improvements in our life might help turn the tide in our favor, we're still that loser. We dont even make good enough grades to graduate and go off to be an engineer or some shit to return at some far off reunion where we can rub it in everyone's faces that we made it. Still that nobody. Still that kid who gets caught staring at the pretty girl we'll never actually talk to while we walk to our lonely corner of the cafeteria, until we run into one of the basketball players and drop our tray of food in front of everyone. They all point, they all laugh, they all call us a loser. But it no longer upsets us. We just accept that this is our lot in life. This is the card we were drawn. We always will be what we are.

*sigh*

Soon we'll think we're free of this hell. But then we get to start it over again after we graduate, because all that awaits us in our future is a job as a janitor at the very school that has consumed all of our happiness.

The Falcons are a pro team in a transplant metro area, where you’ll see a ton of Cowboys and Steelers and Patriots and Raiders and all sorts of team jerseys and hats and gear around.

Atlanta United became huge because they’re a team in a league and sport that people that come to Atlanta don’t bring allegiances with. And they were new, so anyone could latch on to the hype and claim them locally. 

The Braves are a regional team as well, dominating the south across many states so they’re always well represented as well.

> toxic troll

He's not toxic, or a troll. He posted this in the discord and a bunch of us laughed, so I told him to post it here.

>posts a low content post

This is not something that would fall under low content. Low content is to prevent stuff like title only posts or things that would be better suited as a comment in a GDT or PGT.

>calling one of our own players a clown

Bro if I removed every comment that could be taken as a personal attack against a player, there wouldn't be a subreddit. We have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/yo4iyk/i_fucking_hate_jonathan_vilma/) which could be taken as a personal attack against Vilma. We have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/yo2q78/mf_fumbled_a_fumble/) which is also making fun of Graham, and also has tons of comments going after him. And lord knows theres 87 posts about hating Mariota, shit there's even been posts specifically calling him a clown. 

This was something made in jest, not an actual attack like most other posts.

>maybe do your fucking job

As for this, this really doesn't warrant this kind of response. You want to have a constructive conversation about the state of the subreddit or the rules? You guys can always DM me about it, just can't make any promises about a quick response. But this? This doesn't accomplish anything but further spreading toxicity.

There is no evidence to support this claim.

Literally everyone does this shit and hates it. Really not an indication of ""drama behind the scenes""

> ""I literally realized I really don’t forgive people like the sh!t people did to me replay in my head over and over… I can be around them and be fine and then out of no where I think about it and I’m mad all over again because I just be thinking like why would you do me like that?""

You cherry picked just some of the lyrics from the song to make it look like there is drama. The tweet actually said:

Just you and the guy who is upset he was banned for personal attacks. Both of which are conversations that are going in circles, but I still see it as necessary to be open about this stuff.

Was trying to give you a better method to have an open conversation. It takes me a bit to see the responses on here, discord would be faster and easier to send pics of specific parts of automod.

You are aware that none of us were mods when you were right? Like it's a 100% different team from when you were a mod. 

> You all collectively take it way too seriously. Like all of this is unnecessary.

Dude I failed this subreddit for like 2 years, sorry that I'm trying to fix the mess I created. Added a whole new team, and I'm letting them call the shots behind the scenes.

> I would hate to see how you handle actual personal attacks because calling someone trash and telling them to fuck themselves is pretty tame.

We'll have to agree to disagree, because the majority of the people we've asked about this stuff agree that stuff like that needs to be removed.

Now if you want to have an actual open conversation about automod and stuff that should be relaxed, I'm all ears. But almost all of your comments seem to be ""you guys are too strict and that's why I quit as a mod"" which is odd because this is a completely different mod team from when you were a mod.

Nick Bonitto-I will admit I haven’t seen much games of him but from what I’ve seen on the scouting report from pff and NFL he seemed like good value

Drake Jackson- Had sky high expectations but never fully fulfilled them but he’s still really talented and had a productive year

Metchie-good route runner and would be our WR2 of the future probably 

Austin- very good gadget guy who’s good after the catch which is what we need, I think he’d make a great duo with Patterson having 2 really versatile players in the same lineup

He’s always given himself up and ran out of bounds or even ran sideways to avoid hits. On the first drive of the year vs the Eagles he took a shot from a linebacker and looked really shaken up and I got really worried looking at him on the sidelines(I was at the game) he looked very distressed tbh. I think right now he doesn’t want to get injured or hit as he’s a smaller guy. Arthur smiths playcalling needs receivers that take contact as he uses a lot of routes over the middle. Ridleys style of play is to get open on the outside or when he’s the only one on the deep middle not when there’s 1-2 other guys near that area.

Gage is a slot reciever and obviously our 2nd best receiver in terms of talent. Instead of calling more slot plays for him he’s forced him to play on the outside which is exactly what koetter did last year when Julio was out and the exact same result has happened. Gage is invisible. He’s a playmaker but he can’t play on the outside and AS doesn’t seem to want to adjust. Just like koetter last year, he’s also misutilized Hurst. Hurst has great speed and change of direction ability but sub par hands, he’s a vertical threat and doesn’t fit as a TE2 in smith’s scheme. All season he’s used hurst as a safety blanket which like I said he’s just not that. 12 personnel heavy offenses do work but our team is not suited for that. The teams that used 12 personnel the most last year were the Titans, Eagles, and Browns. All of these teams had great run blocking and had strong running game and play action.

He doesn’t trust Matt Ryan’s arm and is overall being too conservative evidence of Ryan having his lowest yards per attempt since 2010 and is not throwing the deep ball enough. Our offense is dysfunctional and the only teams we’ve beaten are also dumpster fires. Yes this is our best start in a while but we’re still just 2-3.

I hate to be a Debbie downer but I just don’t see Arthur Smith as a successful head coach with the way our team is built. I hope you see my reasoning.

**if we’re going by stats we have a clear winner in** *Calvin Ridley*!

Julio Jones has only ever scored more than 8 touchdowns in one season his whole career, Calvin Ridley in three full seasons has done it twice, I’m not sure I see the points you’re trying to make. 

Last season without Julio Jones, Ridley put up Julio Jones numbers, 90 1,374 15.3 9

Ridley finished the year tied with Green Bay’s Devante Adams for the fifth-most receiving yards in the league. He also had eight 100-yard games, which led the NFL. Ridley averaged 91.6 receiving yards a game in 2020, ranking third among wide receivers.

I’ll go back even farther if I have to julio Jones, alabama stats 179 2653 15. Calvin Ridley Alabama stats 224 2781 19. 

Before you go and say well of course Ridley did good his first three years he was playing with Julio, Julios first three years he was playing with Roddy White, Calvin Ridley is elite, our coaching and management is not. Calvin Ridley is one of 14 players in NFL history to have 3,000 receiving yards thru his first 3 seasons of their career and top 25 all time for most touchdowns in the first 3 seasons of a players career. Before Julio’s injury, despite not being able to score for whatever reason, he WAS(past tense) one of the top receivers in the league, which I won’t say Ridley is that high in my regards because there’s a clear difference in raw physical ability, but I’ll repeat Julio couldn’t score.. so really in the game of football it’s all about production.

Roddy White was great, Julio Jones was great, and believe it or not Calvin Ridley is great. I don’t think his payday will come anywhere near Julios, and Julio wasn’t replaced by Ridley, he was replaced by Pitts which was a genius move by the organization, if you watched the game you’ll have noticed Pitts lined up at WR considerably often, and he’s a generational talent, he’s 6’6” 240 pounds. He ran a 4.44 40 yard dash compared to Julio’s 4.39. Unnoticeably slower. He has an 83 3/8 wingspan. Pitts' wingspan is the longest of any tight end or wide receiver of the past 20 years. He’s literally uncover-able, truly. If Ridley’s has outperformed Julio up to this point, at every level of his career, college and the pros, and year 4 is when julio and Roddy white actually showed up and reached their true potential, what makes you think Calvin Ridley is going to regress?? If anything he clearly has room for improvement, and guess what buddy he definitely isn’t getting traded this year, and I highly doubt he gets traded next year, his cap hit this year is only 3,468,000 and 11 million next years is a steal, I could see us getting a really good deal on him with a contract extension too. It’s clear to me that you have something **personal** against Calvin Ridley, you are the definition of a toxic fan, let me guess you also want to get rid of *Matt Ryan*???

And also take a few minutes to research online who the greatest TE of all time is, I guarantee every post you find will have Tony G at the #1 spot. It’s almost unanimous that he’s the greatest, you have to realize before Tony G the TE position was almost just an extra lineman, he was a revolutionary player who changed the game of football and the position of TE forever. Gronk may have been more physically gifted at the peak of his career but he’s no Tony G, and for the Stats, just remember he’s played every game of his career with by far and wide the greatest QB of all time.

Julio Jones has only ever scored more than 8 touchdowns in one season his whole career, Calvin Ridley in three full seasons has done it twice, I’m not sure I see the points you’re trying to make. 

Last season without Julio Jones, Ridley put up Julio Jones numbers, 90 1,374 15.3 9

Before you go and say well of course Ridley did good his first three years he was playing with Julio, Julios first three years he was playing with Roddy White, Calvin Ridley is elite, our coaching and management is not. Calvin Ridley is one of 14 players in NFL history to have 3,000 receiving yards thru his first 3 seasons of their career and top 25 all time for most touchdowns in the first 3 seasons of a players career. Before Julio’s injury, despite not being able to score for whatever reason, he WAS(past tense) one of the top receivers in the league, which I won’t say Ridley is that high in my regards because there’s a clear difference in raw physical ability, but I’ll repeat Julio couldn’t score.. so really in the game of football it’s all about production.

Michael Thomas didn’t even break top 5 most yards by a player in a season at his own position, so let’s see where does that leave us, McCaffrey had 667 more yards on the season, and **10** more TD’s.",-7.0,nfl,t3_exe7qo,False,1.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2020-02-01T17:57:40Z,falcons,0.028150718021262008

Watson seriously benefited from horrible defensive play in Houston, which forced the offense to rely on passing to “keep up” with other teams and padded his passing stats (similar to Matt Ryan and Matt stafford’s situation for years). 

Lastly, the Browns offense relies on Chubb and hunt and I don’t expect stefanski to completely ditch his offensive scheme.

132540,132540,airodell13,"4. Stay with Kyle Pitts (Best Player in the Draft other than Lawrence, Can’t miss HOF Talent) Although the Idea of getting QB sounds great, I feel Matt will have some of his best years in Arthur Smith’s scheme and I love the 2023 NFL Draft class which will have QB’s DJ Uiagalelei and Bryce Young, who will be future NFL superstars, and the idea of making a run for one of those players via trade. They also fit the timeline for which Matt will be here for the end of his career which will probably end around the time the two prospects declare for the draft.) 

40. Trevon Moerhig (Grant is a great safety, but his age suggests his upside won’t be as high as Moerhig will be in the next 5+ years. Moerhig might be the best safety in the class and his potential is sky high for the future. Also very versatile and can play Slot and Deep. )

68. Ronnie Perkins (Great Edge Rusher and Run Stopper, provides immediate value to the DL, and is a plug and play starter Day One)

108 and 114: Keep Darren Hall and Drew Dalman (I like the potential which Hall can bring to our secondary, and is a high IQ player who also is a ball hawk on the boundary. Dalman was probably the best remaining interior lineman left, and has a good chance of starting on the OL in the next 2-3 years) 

148: Jamar Johnson would’ve been a steal at this point of the draft and even though Ta’Quon Graham should be a good rotational piece on the DL, Jamar Johnson is a safety you can trust can give you quality snaps from day one. He and Moerhig would be a great duo, and solidify your safety group for the next decade.)

182: Deonte Brown would be a high upside pick here at interior OL, and coming away with him and Dalman would be one hell of an outcome for the draft) 

183: Khalil Herbert would be too good of a player to pass up in this situation, and gives you a reliable RB2 who would fit well in Arthur Smith’s system, while also bringing more upside than any other RB currently on the board.)

187: Marvin Wilson would’ve been a home run pick at this point of the draft, and would’ve given the Falcons a quality DL who could challenge for the interior DL spot next to Grady in the near future, still don’t understand how he was undrafted in a weaker DL class.)",25.0,falcons,t3_n4anst,False,0.0,:Juliostare:,2021-05-03T19:04:29Z,falcons,-0.06168425342217025

Seems that Ryan and the Colts are making halftime adjustments that work at least somewhat. However, if his receivers don't get open right away, he has trouble getting anything done. Ryan's sack percentage when he has >2.5 seconds in the pocket is 13.9% (unsurprising with an older pocket passer).

148766,148766,d1dOnly,"A few reasons for the improvement after moving on from Matt:

1) The OL is playing better. We replaced 2 OL (Center & LG) and while the new guys aren't world beaters, they have played better. For example, last year's starting Center, Hennessy, had to start at LG against Carolina and the entire OL played worse. Also, our starting RT, McGary, is actually playing well for the first time in his career.

2) When things do break down for the OL, Mariota can use his legs. I love Matt, but he can be a bit of a statue in the pocket, which is harder on the OL. Mariota has 347 rushing yards in 10 games, Ryan has 370 rushing yards in his last 56 games.

3) Despite giving up more YPG this season, the defense is actually allowing fewer points. They are giving up roughly the same amount of first downs per game (22.5 in 2021, 22.3 in 2022), but allowing 2 fewer points per game.

4) Were actually one of the least penalized teams in the league, so we're not giving up free yards.

I've said on r/falcons before, but I think we're 4-6 or 5-5 with Ryan this year.

Julio did take a parting shot at Matt when traded, however I get the feeling their relationship soured over the years.

He's already getting praise from players on the Colts for both his leadership and his accuracy throwing the football.

Whenever I point to the Julio Jones trade, I always get the same response: ""He's not even on a team right now."" Rewind the clock 1 year. It's 2 weeks before the 2021 NFL Draft. If I told you that all of the following happened, you'd say the Falcons got robbed.

* Julio Jones traded for a 2nd round pick.
* Matt Ryan traded for a 3rd round pick.
* Drafted a TE at #4 overall with both Justin Fields, Mac Jones, Penei Sewell, & Micah Parsons still on the board.
* Attempted to court a QB with sexual abuse allegations, thus burning the relationship with the current franchise QB, and then failing to close out that trade.
* Saw projected starting LG Josh Andrews go down with an injury, and instead of trying to acquire a vet to fill the hole, was convinced to let 3rd round rookie Jalen Mayfield start in the spot, where he was rated as the worst OG in the NFL.
* After losing starting WR1 to gambling suspension (can't blame him there), he let the next best WR on the team leave in free agency, and instead signed a 29 year old journeyman WR and a WR that looked promising in 2019, but in the last 2 seasons has played 16 games and caught just 17 balls.
* After trading away Matt Ryan, he went out and signed a QB that worked with the current HC for 1 season and was benched that year. Mariota got to watch the team go 7-3 while he rode the pine (they were 2-4 with him).

Right now, I have a very low opinion of Terry Fontenot as a GM.

149092,149092,d1dOnly,"Looking at Corral and the other QBs in this draft, I still hold steady that I would not take any of them prior to the end of the first round.

* Willis - Makes some questionable decisions, has a tendency to miss open receivers, and the competition level frighten me off. Needs to go to team where he can sit and learn for a year or two, otherwise you're just throwing him to the wolves and he'll never progress.
* Pickett - Feels a bit like a 1 year wonder to me. Something about his throwing style just feels off to me. I think he's the most pro ready in this class, but the team that takes him needs to have a good OL already in place or he's going to be hearing footsteps by the end of year 2.
* Ridder - Honestly, my favorite QB in this class. However, that doesn't mean I would take him early on. I feel like the football IQ is there, but that throwing motion is concerning. I feel like there's a chance at the NFL level that DBs could start hawking on him with how long his windup is. Honestly, if I'm drafting Ridder, I'm going to consider sitting him for a year and working with a specialist to see if his throwing motion and time to release can be improved.
* Corral - He looks like a strong breeze would blow him over, and at the NFL level he'll need to show he can take getting hit. Add to that a problem with throwing easy picks and I'm skeptical of his future prospects.
* Howell - This time last season, Howell was viewed as an near lock for first QB off the board, and probably was going to go in the top 3. Now, there's a possibility he's the 5th or 6th QB off the board and most don't see him as more than a long time NFL backup. Short and stocky, a slow release, and a problem with overthrows, Howell will likely take 2 seasons to make it to starter level, unless a team has no other options. I think the 2020 Howell is still in there somewhere, but he'll need a coach that can really help draw it out.

For my team in particular, I want them to go DL-DL-WR with their first 3 picks, and then see what is available.

Blank: 8. He lets the GM and HC do what they want and doesn't get too involved like Jerry Jones. Whether you like some of his decisions or not, when you look at Snyder, Ross or Brown, I wouldn't want to move on from Blank. I don't think any owner cares about their team as much as Blank.

Terry: 9. Great cap work and has made some solid FA moves. Fleeced the Titans with the Julio trade and, imo, the Ryan trade was a decent haul. It's just the drafting side he needs work on and D line investment, but last year was a big improvement. Can definitely see him staying around for years.

AS: 7. He's improved *a lot* since his rookie year. Gave us one of our best rushing seasons ever. And I love his attitude compared to Quinn. However, we've been inconsistent and it's hard to tell if he's the guy until we're contenders. Personally, the fact Pees (who's worked with 3 COTYs, two of whom have won it all) came out of retirement for him speaks volumes to his potential.

He had a rough season last year due to a mix of poor play calling, chemistry with Mariota, and lack of effort on routes not immediately going to him. He got a knee injury and only played 10 games.

He has fluid route running and quick after the catch. Good hands and he's a fucking albatross. He's an underrated blocker--no Kittle, but he's not a liability and does a lot despite his frame. Great character--he seems quiet but a leader by example. Overall, he has the potential to be the best TE in the league, but it's a case of putting him in positions to succeed and him improving his effort when he's not immediately getting the ball.

Lawrence was on the worst team in the league with Urban, who will go down as one of the worst coaches ever. Fields had Nagy and no O line. Lance barely played. There's also Mac Jones, who was really good for a rookie. But even if they had bad rookie years, they are sill more talented on average and will likely do better than 2022's class.

No one thought this QB class was going to be great, and it hasn't. That's not pessimistic, that's realistic.

Players: as far as young talent goes, Anderson is one I'm looking forward to.

FTS: for the most part it's just petty rivalry, especially since we've both been historically bad.

To many fans that probably solved the questions they were asking, but according to others -Tinfoil hat alert- he had done this to accrue the minimum amount of active games of 7 before getting put on the NFI list in order to not have to repeat a season and get the year over with to move on.

The Chargers offense was not great.  They were gifted points all first half by the defense and special teams.  And when JAX cleaned up their offense and stopped coughing up the ball, the Chargers offense went to sleep.  Only 3 points in the second half.  I don't think its too much to ask an offense to score 1 TD in a half of football.  If your offense can't do that then its not playing well.

My general philosophy when it comes to these big blown leads is that it's a team effort because they only happen if the defense and offense both stall out at the same time.

194837,194837,nerdyintentions,"I know that it definitely appears that way but I'm not so sure.

You have to remember that we changed both our GM and coach in the 21 offseason.  They basically inherited an aging, declining QB with the worst contract in the league  and no succession plan in place.  My theory is that the new regime was not happy with Ryan at QB but that it was the least bad option.  I don't remember all the specifics (and I'm not a cap expert to begin with) but I believe Ryan's cap hit was way worse last offseason than this offseason.  It was harder to justify moving on from him back then.  

But we do know this for a fact:

1. They kicked the tires on both Lance and Fields prior to the 21 draft.  Rumor was that they really liked Lance but the 49ers jumped the line.  Apparently, they didn't like Fields so it is what it is.
2. Arthur Smith's offense is radically different this year than it was last year.  It is way more run heavy.  Given that his claim to fame is unlocking Derrick Henry then I think its safe to say that this year's offense is closer to his preferred offense than last year's.  I believe he adapted his offense to play to Matt Ryan's strengths last year and that wasn't an idea situation for him.

Because of this I think its plausible that internally the Falcons had already decided to move on from Ryan but hadn't made their intentions obvious.  Then Watson basically fell in their laps. IIRC Watson's people reached out to the Falcons and expressed interest and we were frontrunners to sign him until Cleveland offered the crazy contract.  Once that happened, it became de facto public that the FO was looking to move on from Ryan.  Of course, Ryan wanted out after that so they put the plan in motion.",14.0,nfl,t3_ycko6d,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-10-24T17:58:20Z,falcons,3.1257777244812235e-05

Rather than go line by line with what I agree and disagree with regarding what you analyzed, I just want to point out a confounding factor that (I think) plays a huge role in OT games, especially in playoff games: fatigue. It's no secret defenses generally get worn down faster than offenses just due to the nature of game flow and the physical demands of each position. A tired receiver running a sloppy route doesn't have nearly as much consequence as a blown coverage by a tired corner, for example. By the time a game reaches OT, defenses are at a particular disadvantage for both teams. And while both teams on average would (theoretically) be just as lopsided in terms of exhaustion by the time OT comes around, pairing an offense that is likely less tired with a defense that is likely more tired is inherently biased in favor of the offense under the current system. Ensuring that the other team has a chance to exploit the exact same difference in fatigue makes for a much more even comparison of who ""should"" win, at least in terms of the logic of it all.

That's not to say the current system is entirely unfair. Its weaknesses just go on full display when the team that wins the coin toss has Tom Brady, who is notoriously experienced not only in the playoffs but also with the ins and outs of NFL rules and the schemes of basically all teams. As a salty Falcons fan myself, I get that I'm biased against anything that lets Tom Brady continue doing Tom Brady things. I knew the game was over the second the call was heads, but I didn't think that was the case just because it was Brady. I knew it because Brady is an experienced QB. I would have had the same gut feeling with Matt Ryan, Big Ben, Rivers, or really anyone who's been successful at QB for a while, since they have the most to gain from a Golden Goal-type situation.

tl;dr. Solid research. I think defensive fatigue and QB experience play a bigger role in this than the numbers would suggest. Change the system.",1.0,nfl,t3_aic4gt,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2019-01-21T14:14:45Z,falcons,0.00042175762398935116

But up until that point, they never deviated from the game plan. The play that was called was the play that was run. 

Not only have they explained this, but there were reports of Matt yelling to the sideline to “run the damn ball.” So despite him reportedly wanting to, Shanahan did not call those plays.

A great foil to Shanahan’s scheme is the scheme we run now. In this scheme, the play is designed for the QB to option multiple ways sometimes without changing the alignment.

So let's say the first 4 picks are Anderson, Stroud, Young, and Carter.  Who needs what?

If the Bears are open to trading the pick, then they aren't taking a QB.  Which is not a need for them and if they took one, it would create a big rukus in Chicago.  Yes, Fields hasnt been great, but putting Young or Stroud in the room, it would harm his development.  Fields deserves another year of development before passing judgment.  Opposite view: they want Stroud or Young and are willing to turn around and trade Fields (this throws a wrench at things) but then why trade the pick?

If CHI actually does want to trade the pick then they aren't taking a QB, AT 1, and they arent taking one at 2 either.  So Anderson or Carter is off the board.

So, if I am TX, why do I need to trade with them?  I can stay at 2 and get the QB I want and if CHI surprises me, I still get Stroud.

Now, at 4, if I want a QB, which I desperately need, I only need to worry about TX and AZ.   AZ is tied to K Murray, even though he is injured.  It makes more sense that they sign a FA QB and take Anderson or Carter.

So, now, at 4, unless CHI surprises everyone, I still get Stroud, or the remaining of either Anderson or Carter, without losing my draft capital, and I can still go sign a vet QB.

At 2, the Texans can get a franchise player.  Who are the Bears taking that the Texans are locked in on?

The Texans want a QB, right?  Are the Bears expected to take a QB?

Why doesn't TX just keep their draft capital and take the next best QB?  They wouldn't be wrong to do this.

So. What really is going on here?

Is it possible, at all, that the Bears GM is putting out this trash so the Colts will think they need to pay more to get to 1 than they really do?

The Colts definitely want Bryce Young, because if they wanted Stroud, they can probably get him at 4, unless AZ takes him, which wouldnt be a bad idea, but it would be smarter of them to take J Carter or W Anderson and sign Jimmy G or Jacoby B.

So, sitting at 4, you will have a choice to get a high-quality player, and there are enough quality free agents Matt Ryan can back up.

3 playoff teams and the Commanders.  Are the Commanders adrift?  They have cap space and a good coaching staff.  If they can keep Dan Snyder locked away from the team l, they could be ok.

NFC NORTH

Agree with it, or not, all the teams in this division have direction.

NFC WEST
