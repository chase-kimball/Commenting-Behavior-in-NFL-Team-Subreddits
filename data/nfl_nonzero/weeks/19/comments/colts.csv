D. Kelly isn't getting re-signed 

Pryor definitely isn't getting re-signed unless he takes a cheap back up contract 

Yannick probably gets an offer from us (2-3 years). He's been our best EDGE player in a while. Him and Paye on opposite ends could be dangerous next year since Paye will be able to rest up. 

Banogu might be a surprise re-sign because he'll be dirt cheap and can be decent depth/vet presence with the scheme we run. But it also wouldn't surprise me if he doesn't get anything from us either 

Lewis probably walks unless he takes a cheap deal from us. He has potential but he's blown out his knee two years in a row. I'm concerned that he's one more injury from retiring 

Okereke is gone, we can't pay him what he's going to want, we'd have the highest paid LB Group otherwise. Bears or Seahawks will take him. 

Speed will get re-signed. He's made a name for himself since his rookie year when he was solely on special teams. He'll be a lot cheaper than Okereke too. 

Facyson will get brought back if Bradley is still our DC, otherwise he's gone. 

McLeod has been amazing for us this year. He's getting up there in age but I hope we re-sign him.

Colts GM Chris Ballard, who was previously a scout in Chicago, is very familiar with Bears GM Ryan Poles — the two worked together for four years in the Chiefs’ front office. This would mark the third time over the last 25 years that the Colts held the No. 1 pick. It worked out well the other two times: Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck.  Bryce Young is a complete outlier from a size perspective and would be somewhat off-type for Ballard, but Young’s instincts, vision and accuracy as a passer are the traits worth betting on at the position. It won’t be a driving reason behind a trade up, but sniping Young ahead of division foe Houston would be an added benefit.” -Dane Brugler, The Athletic.](https://theathletic.com/4097059/2023/01/17/2023-nfl-mock-draft-dane-brugler/?source=user_shared_article)",89.0,colts,t3_10edhfw,False,0.0,Touchdown Jesus,2023-01-17T08:24:47Z,colts,-0.0064089919578311
