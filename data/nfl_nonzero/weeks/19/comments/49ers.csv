2966,30243,30243,CSGOW1ld,"> You want wins? Purdy is one of only three rookie quarterbacks since the merger to start five or more games and go undefeated as a starter. The two others played for the Steelers: Mike Kruczek in 1976 (6-0) and Ben Roethlisberger in 2004 (13-0). Both rookie quarterbacks’ teams went on to play in the conference championship.

.

> Are touchdowns more your thing? Only Deshaun Watson had a better TD rate in his rookie season (9.3 percent vs. 7.6 percent for Purdy), and Hall of Famer Dan Marino checks in at a distant third (6.8 percent). 

.

> Perhaps you prefer a measure of overall efficiency? Purdy’s passer rating of 107.3 is the best ever for a rookie with 50 or more pass attempts. Or maybe you don’t like raw passer rating (I can’t really fault you). Purdy is also tops all time in rookie Passer Rating Index,1 which adjusts for player era, beating out Marino by 3 points (128 vs. 125). He’s also first in adjusted yards per attempt index, besting Roethlisberger by 1 point (127 to 126).

On top of that, CMC very publicly praised Purdy for spending so much 1 on 1 time with him after he got traded so he could pick up the offense quickly. CMC said he was extremely impressed at his work ethic but also knowledge of the offense as a rookie. 

I’ve been an advocate for moving on from Jimmy for a while for a lot reasons, and I praised the trade up and idea behind the Lance pick but the farther removed we get from it the more I’m souring on it. 

Obviously the injury wasn’t Treys fault, I definitely can’t fault him for that and I’m sure the team doesn’t either. But I think a huge difference between Purdy and Lance that’s extremely apparent is that Purdy has been a 4 year starter at a big school(over 1400 pass attempts) and by the time the ‘23 season starts Lance will have played a year of FCS football since 2019 where he had 317 pass attempts.

And how exactly does Deebo not get credit for that play again? He does get the credit, as a receiver.


So tell me, is the touchdown only legitimate for the quarterback if they throw it in the end zone? At what level does the quarterback get credited for throwing the ball? 


It's also interesting you say this because ""the tape"" also shows Purdy scrambling to get open when the pocket broke down and also him making a high difficulty would-be TD to Aiyuk that only a handful of NFL QBs could physically do yet none of that is reflected in the stats.

Saying that he's not as good as his stats is an opinion, not an objective truth. Very strange you don't understand that.


>Not even worth addressing here, I guess an 80 yard touchdown pass dropped 55 yards on a rope through two defenders is the same throw as a dump off falling backwards to a HB for an 80 yard touchdown? I don't understand how you can sit here and say all stats are created equal.


Definition of strawman and another thing I didn't say or argue. Point to where I said any of that.

Seems like a go-to move for you is to immediately strawman an argument and hope someone doesn't figure it out.


>Brady and Warner both played better than the information teams had on them in college, yes. Same with Purdy.


But I'm only using your logic. Your argument has been that tape itself is objective.


How is it that right now I can find videos right now on YouTube where some scouts say that a prospect will be a bust while another is a hidden gem **from the same tape**?


That's my entire point. You're saying that this analysation of the tape is somehow the objective truth of how good a player was but you're refusing to acknowledge that people have different ideas and opinions on the same material. 


Very strange how you can't get that simple concept through your head. 


This part is also strange:

Except that I never mentioned ever that it needed to be malicious since that's just another strawman you're putting in. A ""put-down"" doesn't need to be malicious. The definition is literally in the name: it's ""putting down"" or ""downplaying"" someone's accomplishments. You can put down someone without it being malicious. You can just simply be ignorant or wrong.


>They are pointing to factual things that happened in game and saying that while he played pretty well, his stats are not as good as the performance. It's literally an objective analysis. It's what PFF does as well, do you complain about them? 

But his stats **are** good as his performance states because those are his stats. He accomplished those stats. He wasn't bailed out by another player, nor did he have anyone else perform them.

And to say that his performance wasn't as good as his stats would indicate there's a baseline relative to other quarterbacks here. So his stats are not legitimate but other QBs are?

The fact that you mention PFF is funny because they have issues since they're not transparent with their methodology and there's **numerous** complaints about them on a number of forums, including here.


>The tape...is...objective...?


""The tape"" - no I'm talking about the analysation which you clearly skipped.

There is no objective analysation of ""the tape"". You're taking one person's viewpoint and making it out to be objective truth.

16936,122534,122534,Nickppapagiorgio,">then why wouldn’t the first team go for it on 4th every time?

Under normal circumstances, a turnover on downs and the opponent gaining possession of the ball with good field position is too great a risk. Teams normally elect to punt as a result, and they maintain a roster spot for a punter for that reason. In overtime specifically, if you are the first team to possess the ball, electing to go for it on something like 4th and 4 from your own 31 is too risky. That play has about a 55% chance of success at conversion. If you succeed, your odds of winning the game increase, but not by that much. If you fail, your odds of winning the game plummet below 15%. The reward simply does not match the risk, and most coaches would elect to punt in that circumstance.

However if you're trailing in overtime that calculus changes completely.  If it's 4th and 4 from your own 31, punting has a 0% win probability. You will lose if you do so. You have to use the 4th down play to attempt to convert. More importantly, both you and the defense know on 1st down that you will have to use the 4th down to convert if it comes to it. Your team has now entered ""4 down territory,"" and the play calling changes accordingly.

Ideally, your defense doesn't give up a touchdown at all, but if they give it up on the first possession, your offense at least has all 4 downs to respond. If you give it up on the 2nd possession, after you punted or kicked a field on 4th down on the first possession, you just lose.

This is why college teams always elect to go 2nd in their overtime format, and why the coin toss winner in college wins slightly more frequently than the coin toss winner in the NFL does. Up until now, with sudden death or modified sudden death, this simply wasn't a thing to consider in NFL overtime.

That advantage exists in college overtime, and it makes the college coin toss even more indicative of who will win than the NFL one which on its face doesn't make sense. That advantage is just huge. However, for the NFL format, the advantage only exists in one possession. Additionally the 2nd possessing team could elect to attempt a 2 pt conversion to win it, rather than give the opposing team the ball back with the chance to win on a field goal.",15.0,nfl,t3_10bfkcn,False,0.0,:49ers: 49ers,2023-01-14T00:17:25Z,49ers,0.187923136

As a life long Niners fan, I grew up watching Montana, Young  win super bowls like it was simple as can be. 

Then came the mix of the “almost years” of Garcia, Kap, Jimmy G intermixed with dark years of Grbac, Dilfer and the vastly unfair circumstances of Alex Smith.

We’ve seen Norman, Baalke, Chip Kelly, Singletary with his pants down, the poor fool of a head coach Tomsula, and others wreck havoc on this team.

Yorks drove Harbaugh out of town and Kap went political.

We’ve seen some shit, 9ers fans!

Defensively Parsons is a problem and he'll get some stops. VanderEsch is playing hurt and Kearse might not play at all. Injuries not withstanding I like our chances because Kyle and Demeco have neutralized better defenses before: First Miami this season. They did it on the fly too after Jimmy got hurt and McDaniel brought the house at Brock. And not to bring back bad memories but Kyle neutralized KC in the super bowl for 3 quarters until a certain CB got a PI flag, a certain QB overthrew or didn't see a wide open Kittle and the refs forgot their flags when KC held Bosa. Purdy sees the open guy more often than not. He had one hiccup against Seattle iirc, didn't see wide open Deebo, but the man knows how to play the position. There's not much tape on him either.

31117,208778,208778,bhfroh,"here's a better example:

A few years back, in the Harbaugh days, the 49ers played against the Saints. We sacked Brees, forcing a fumble that we recovered and would have ended the game. Our guy hit him in the chest with his facemask. It was a textbook tackle. Instead he got flagged for RTP, put the Saints into FG range, and they kicked the game winning FG. Had that flag not been thrown, the 49ers would have won the number 1 seed by way of tiebreaker with Seattle. Instead, we were the 5th seed. League officials backed up the refs instead of holding them accountable even though the footage is as plain as day.

This is what Joey is talking about when he says there's no accountability. The league can NOT admit that their officiating is sus because it would call into question the legitimacy of the sport. And with more and more people starting to feel it's looking more and more rigged, the last thing they wanna do is confirm those conspiracies.

Me, personally? I think the referees officiate with a heavy bias towards making the NFL look good. They make calls that would favor the higher scoring teams that have weekly highlight reel players. So that when the refs next CBA comes up, they can go to the league with: See, we could have called 3 or 4 guys on that Mahomes touchdown for offensive holding, but you see the highlight reel viewership, jersey sales, ticket sales, and other league revenue skyrocket because of that?

With that said people also make it seem like Brock is near his peak, I doubt he is.  It remains to be seen but even great players like Lawrence take a while to get adjusted to the NFL.

The chiefs skill guys are definitely not as good as last with Hill leaving but still a very solid group.   Chiefs rbs are solid but still not Cmc level.  Bills have a good group but i don’t love their backs as much as CMC.  Eagles have a good group especially their top 2 wrs and te.  Miles isn’t that great but their OL when healthy is amazing.  Remains to be seen how healthy Jalen is right now.

Dallas has 2 excellent backs and an excellent TE and WR1, the rest of the guys aren’t great but good enough.  Giants have Saquon whose excellent but their wrs are easily the worst group remaining and possibly the worst group in the nfl.  Bengals have 3 good/great wrs—likely the best 1-3 in the league, mixon has been good but I think he’s lost a step.  Burrow should be worried about their OL situation.  Jags have a solid group led by Etn, and a few solid wrs but nothing amazing.  Engram has stepped up.

If I had to rank the overall skill positions I’d have it something like this of the remaining teams.

4. Bengals
5. Cowboys

40334,286999,286999,phoenixremix,"Mina brought up an interesting point about man coverage and the simplicity of it countering this offense.

I wonder if Trevon, Parsons, etc have it in them to emulate that, and I frankly doubt it. Parsons is insane, but Aiyuk was torching Diggs last year and Woolen last week in man. 

My only major concern is the Dallas pass rush. From last game, 1) don't leave Parsons unblocked. That was stupid of the Bucs. But also 2) Purdy rolling left might bite him back this time if one of their guys goes for a delayed blitz; he'll be blindsided, and the Dallas defense is MUCH better than the Seattle one he constantly escaped from.

Our OL had a hell of a task, but they're a top 5 unit. They'll slip up sometimes but not often. 

On defense: pass rush has to play HARD. Against a weak Seattle OL, Omenihu and a few other guys did well, but Bosa didn't even make the stat sheet. I know that's never the whole story, and they actively scheme against Bosa, so I'm not super scared or anything. But Dallas has a good OL, and if he pressure Dak and don't let him scramble much we'll be golden. Our secondary also has a hell of a task now imo, but they're capable. I think Mooney goes extra hard this week to make up for last game, and if Demo keeps up the way he did on Saturday, our secondary will be able to make splash plays all game. Finally, our linebackers.
