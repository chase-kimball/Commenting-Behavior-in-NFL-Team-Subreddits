Going all in on defense with Goff still as your QB just makes you the first team missing the playoffs in the regular season to the first team to lose in the playoffs wild card.  If you think you're good with Goff, congrats you think you understand football better then super bowl winning head coach Sean McVay.

Stop letting Aaron Rodgers Ayahuasca journeys determine your offseason.  Jones trade is just to help with the cap a little bit and allow Dillon to be a featured back.

This makes the QBs job easier instead of having to rely on physical traits the QB might not have.
