20396,90304,90304,HopLegion,"DET: Draft a QB in the 1st to Develop behind Goff.  He's a good QB, he's not the reason you're losing, but he's not an elite QB.  You don't need to trade up, just take whoever falls early on and let him develop a year or 2 behind Goff. Going all in on defense with Goff still as your QB just makes you the first team missing the playoffs in the regular season to the first team to lose in the playoffs wild card.  If you think you're good with Goff, congrats you think you understand football better then super bowl winning head coach Sean McVay.  

MIN: See DET with Cousins.  You're about to extend Jefferson to a record deal.  You had a fortunate year record wise.  Get aggressive moving up like KC in 2017 and Buffalo in 2018 did a few years back and plan for the future when you can't afford Cousins contract anymore.  Cousins isn't your biggest issue, it's your DC, but I think this is the peak you ever get with him.  

GB:. Basically blow it up.  Trade Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Jones for whatever picks you can. See if you can get someone to take Bakhtiari while he's coming off a good year. Take the dead money now and get the most picks you can in the future.  See what you have in Jordan Love this year/next and rebuild with a young (cheap)skill group while suffering through the major cap hits of this year.  Stop letting Aaron Rodgers Ayahuasca journeys determine your offseason.  Jones trade is just to help with the cap a little bit and allow Dillon to be a featured back. I do understand your GM said he'd be back next year. Also think Jones and Rodgers trade value will never be higher again after this season.

Although I do believe his get-off and instincts are certainly elite. Take with that what you will. 

He also almost set CFB sack records and was the best pass rusher and run defender in the country at the same time last year and it's pretty impossible to argue against that.

To me, Anderson and Carter are inverse players. You see Anderson's stats and you're absolutely blown away but then you go to the tape and you can't help but feeling slightly underwhelmed. The tape is fantastic - of course - but does it match the tape of a 17.5 sack, ***31 TFL*** player? My gut says no.
