2644,9395,9395,ArcadianDelSol,"> 1) Some metrics have Lamars accuracy as almost as bad as Zach Wilsons

Which is why every team in the NFL passed on him in round 1 - including us.

This entire sub is in denial about this fact. Lamar's only value is (was!) his ability to scramble out of a sack and gain 15 yards. Even before injury, he's not been doing that for 1.5 seasons now. He scrambles for 2 yards, or worse - he is now trying to pass his way out of sacks.

and he's pretty shit for pass accuracy. We're now losing games *BECAUSE* he wants to prove he's a passing QB, abandoning the SOLE reason he became a sensation early on.

Watch his first rookie season - he was breaking huge gains because even when he scrambled out, defenses didn't know what to do with him - they charged at him and he would juke away and have an open field ahead.

Since his 2nd season, they've all decided to park on the scrimmage and make Lamar come TO THEM - and that pretty much eliminated his SOLE THREAT as a quarterback. They forced him to, at best, 3 yard gains and then forced him to pass.

He had 2 seasons to fix that pass game and he didnt. He misses wide open players, he throws 10 feet over them and 4 feet below their hands. The throws behind them on cross routes and no team can win consistently when their QB is that wild.

I love what Lamar brings to the Ravens, but what he takes away might be too much considering he wants, literally, the 2nd fully guaranteed multi-year QB contract in the NFL.

A - at the start of the year, I would've said a B.  But he has really come into his own at the back half of the year, graded out as the best overall safety.  Loved this pick on draft night and love it now.
>
>Tyler Linderbaum 

A - God, it feels so good to not worry about center anymore.  Tyler has been phenomenal, he's struggled against the truly elite DTs - Quinnen Williams and DJ Reader, specifically - but he still held up much better than a rookie center has any right to.  After an offseason of conditioning, I think he will establish himself as a top 5 center next year.
>
>David Ojabo

Can I say incomplete? Feel like we didn't see enough.  I'm encouraged by what we did see, especially a strip sack against the notoriously difficult Joe Burrow, but the reality is that we just didn't see enough of him.
>
>Travis Jones

B - Didn't get as much playing time as I expected he would when Pierce went down, but the unforeseen breakout of Broderick Washington led to him getting limited snaps.  Still, he played well and stuffed the middle of the field when he was out there.
>
>Daniel Faalele

B - Had some very early struggles, but showed if nothing else that he is a capable swing tackle, which is huge for us and our personnel planning for the future. 
>
>Jalyn Armour-Davis

D - I'm slightly coloring this opinion by saying that we could've had Tariq Woolen here and that really, really pisses me off.  But nonetheless, JAD was hurt early in the season and looked unimpressive in his debut.  Hope to see some growth and improvement in the offseason
>
>Charlie Kolar

This one I'm saying incomplete.  Barely played at all, I liked what I did see, I expect him to slide more into the Nick Boyle role while Likely fills a Slot TE spot
>
>Jordan Stout

C - Was outperformed by Camarda, but the hangtime he was drafted for started to show up later in the year so I'll give him half credit here.  Hopefully he can keep working with Koch to refine his punts and carry on our special teams legacy.
>
>Isaiah Likely

A - this might be a bit of a generous rating, but for a 4th round project TE he has drastically outperformed my expectations.  He had at least two games where he was the most productive passing target, almost singlehandedly winning that Tampa game.  Hope to see him much more involved next year.
>
>Damarion Williams

C - Whereas I lowered JAD because we could've picked Woolen as an outside corner, I'm slightly higher on Pepe because I think we weren't expecting Kyle to fill the slot corner role as well as he did.  Pepe will have lots of opportunities to make plays this incoming year as Kyle's role transitions to starting strong safety

That's not really a possibility under the new CBA. If Lamar sits at home he not only doesn't get paid, he incurs massive penalties that the team can't forgive even if they want to once he returns. If Lamar sits the entire year, passing on 45 mill fully guaranteed, he wastes a prime year of his career and the tag carries over giving us the same amount of control the following season.

*If* Lamar wants to take the Kirk approach and play until the tag runs out(he won't) his cap numbers would be 45 mill in 2023, 55 mill in 2024, and 75 mill in 2025.

Now, most people would look and say 75 fucking mill no shot they can tag him 3 times but when you look at cap projections for the next 3 years the overall percentage of the cap would look like 20% in 2023, 21% in 2024, and 26% in 2025.

He can will this team to a Super Bowl. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs thinking about it that way. ‚Ä¶

> ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs got an opportunity to win a Super Bowl. I hope he hobbles back out there. ‚Ä¶ Put him out for the pass plays, and don‚Äôt run him at all. But you never know. That could be wrong. I‚Äôm being very selfish right now, just to want him to be out on the field. But, man, what a great thing it would be to see [No.] 8 touch the field this Sunday, and we go out there and blow them out. But that‚Äôs for Lamar and everybody else to figure out. Hope miraculously something happens, somebody reach out to him, whether it‚Äôs a coach or somebody, and he decides to play. But that‚Äôs a question if he‚Äôs healthy or he‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt know. I haven‚Äôt been watching him.‚Äù

31387,177812,177812,ZombieFeedback,"* Marcus Peters - I honestly don't know. He looked slower this year, and he's 30 trying to bounce back from an ACL tear. He's only just 30 last week though, and while he was slower, he's still a clear-cut CB2 on this roster. A lot of it imo depends on how much money he wants. 80/20 rule, if you think Pepe or one of the other young CBs can grow and step up, it's a consideration given all the money you're going to have tied up in guys like Lamar soon. This is the toughest one I think.
* Roquan Smith - Bubble guy, not even considering an extension /s
* Justin Houston - I think you bring him back. It depends how much money he wants, if he's asking for a lot then it'll be hard to justify with Bowser and Ojabo both back to 100% and Oweh hopefully over his sophomore slump. That's three big ""ifs"" though, and even then you're thin there.
* Kyle Fuller - Much like Peters you've got the uncomfortable situation of a 30 year old cornerback coming off an ACL tear. (Happy birthday btw Kyle, yesterday was the day!) Fuller is going to be a lot cheaper though so I think you can make that call a lot easier. He's a local guy so I imagine he wants to play here too. This becomes a given imo if you don't re-sign Juiceman.
* Lamar Jackson - *Gestures vaguely at the 7,000,000 threads about whether Lamar gets signed*
* Ja'Wuan James - Cut him loose. It was worth a shot, but the reclamation project looks like a failure. Other than 24 snaps in the season opener, it will be four years since he last played in the regular season by next year. Eight since he played a full season. Stanley looked great, Mekari is the ultimate reserve, and I feel very good about Faalele as depth given how he handled spot duty as a rookie, and he'll only get better.
* Sammy Watkins - Ask your new OC what he thinks. Sammy's big advantage was he already knew the system, but with Roman likely departing, that is out the window. You can do a lot worse for your WR3/4, but he's really not worth too much more than vet minimum at this point.
* Jason Pierre-Paul - See what happens with Houston. If Justin stays, I think you let JPP walk. If he leaves, another OLB you can trust would be wise.
* Brent Urban - Keep. Unsung hero on the DL. Hope no other teams noticed.
* Steven Means - Let him go. He was having a great preseason, but recovering from a torn Achilles at 33 is tough.
* Josh Oliver - As with the Lizard King, ask your new OC. For me, it depends what you think of Kolar. I liked the potential he flashed, but that was one game. Do you feel comfortable with him as TE3? In either case, don't pay too much. Someone will probably want to jump on him as a revitalization project a la Hurst in Cincy, and let them overpay.
* Vince Biegel - Cheap prove-it deal. Torn Achilles, but he's on the right side of 30. Will he bounce back? Who knows. I'm willing to extend a low-cost offer to find out. If he doesn't want it, fine, no need to get into a bidding war.
* Kenyan Drake - Walk. JK and Gus are back, Justice had a good season, if someone throws megabucks at Hill then sure, but I don't see that, so I see no reason to bring Kenyan back. Hell, I'd probably be down to grab a mid-late round RB like Devon Achane or Kendre Miller before bringing back Drake. Late-round RBs are not exactly an unheard of thing, especially as RB3 to develop for a year.
* Daryl Worley - Offer him a deal but don't overspend. I like him as a depth corner, but you don't spend starter money on depth.
* Demarcus Robinson - Offer market value, don't go bidding. He was utterly overmatched as WR1, but with Bateman and Duvernay back - and hopefully another WR added in the draft - I think he can be solid as a WR3/4. Obviously depends on Watkins too.
* Kevon Seymour - Re-sign. He's not a very good depth corner but he's acceptable. He *is* a very good special teamer.
* Tyler Huntley - I don't know how original-round tenders work for UDFAs. If you can potentially get a pick out of it, even a seventh, then tender him and see what happens. Don't go any higher than that though, and if you can't original-round an UDFA and your cheapest option is a third, just skip it. Anthony Brown didn't honestly look that much worse and he's at his base as a rookie. You could do worse as a backup though. If someone pays the tender, pocket the draft pick.
* Trystan Colon - Offer him fair money for a backup. You can never have too much OL depth.
* Kristian Welch - Offer him a contract with a $1m hit. He and Malik Harrison are basically the same player, Welch is a little faster and Malik is a little more sure of a tackler, and both are special teams guys at this point. Malik's locked in here for another year, but you would save $1.1m cutting him and re-signing Welch. If you can save money getting a roughly identical player, do it. Otherwise, no reason to spend on a special teams linebacker.
* Geno Stone - Keep keep keep. He's not on-par with Williams or Hamilton but his play was invaluable when Marcus went down. Fantastic depth safety.
* Del'Shawn Philips - Probably just a camp body. He's here, he knows the defense, give him a chance, but he'll probably be gone by the time pads are coming on.
* Nick Moore - Do not break up the Wolf Pack 2.0. Sign him. Man just made all-pro, he earned it.
* Justice Hill - Re-sign. He's never going to eclipse Gus or JK, but he's a very good RB3, *and* he plays everywhere on special teams.
* Ben Powers - Depends on if you think Cleveland can take over LG. He played LG last year, and this year he gave Zeitler breathers at RG. If you think Cleveland is ready to be the guy - which I assume is why we drafted him - put him in and let Ben get overpaid. If you're not confident in him, try to re-sign him. Don't get into a bidding fight though, this isn't Yanda or Zeitler.",39.0,ravens,t3_10ephpq,False,0.0, :19:,2023-01-17T19:04:20Z,ravens,-0.004713064327351

31389,177815,177815,ZombieFeedback,"Since returning from the scope, Dobbins is averaging 6.6 yards per carry. Do that for the full season and you're #3 in the league in YPC, right between Lamar and Josh. You're a clear-cut #1 amongst RBs, nobody else is above six. Do it for 250 carries - a reasonable count for a #1 RB - and you'd be leading the league in rushing yards in 2022. He was killing it. Could he keep that pace up for a full year? We'll find out in 2023. But was he doing it right now and by all appearances keeping it up in the playoffs? You bet!

We gave him 13 carries all game. In a game where the largest deficit was nine points, and where nearly the entire game was a single-score game. With a backup QB and practice squad WRs, we have a guy who's an absolute force on the ground, and was averaging about five yards a pop tonight, who stretched ten miles to get us a touchdown, and we couldn't even get him up to the 14 carries he's averaged in the other games since his return. Think about that: We used him *less* than we typically do tonight! Arguably our best weapon other than Andrews, and we used him *less than average* in a win-or-go-home playoff game.

There's no game to save him for after this, it's do or die. You sat him last week specifically so you could lean on him tonight. And then you didn't. In spite of never being behind by double digits.

Harbaugh gets a lot of passes for stabilizing the organization that was pretty inconsistent from 2001-2007, following the Super Bowl win. The team hasn't been outright bad during his tenure unless injuries were involved, but a lot of people fail to realize that pivoting to Lamar in 2018 literally saved his job. 

I'd say Harbaugh has three main tendencies which really work against him. 

1. His clock management is not great.
2. His failure to acknowledge and address issues from the coaching staff. 
3. The team repeatedly plays down to competition. (2019 is an outlier)
