Most Improved: Juwan Johnson, Cesar Ruiz, Kaden Elliss

Biggest Surprise: Rashid Shaheed, Kaden Elliss

No one needs to tank nor is this team planning on it, but okay let's hear.

> Best case scenario: 

> we keep Pete Carmichael and Andy Dalton in 2023, get Kamara and Mayes suspensions over with, Thomas works his way back from injury, and we backfill depth

> After the 2023 season, we fire Allen, draft a franchise qb, and hire a new coach with a qb and a much cleaner cap

I understand it's skewed because you want this team to lose but this doesn't sound like best case scenario. Also Michael Thomas will not be back next year so this is fantasy.

>Worst case scenario: 

> we get a decent OC, trade/sign Derek carr, sign overpriced free agents, and go 6-11, 7-10, 8-9 for three more seasons before realizing Dennis Allen is a shitty coach

I'd say worse case scenario is we don't add any QBs, Kamara gets a long suspension, we don't add any DL, and we don't add any WRs.

I'd be willing to wager that barring another season of constant injuries, so long as we address positions outlined above we'd be in better shape than we were this season, particularly if Carr is QB.


> Mickey Loomis is a NUMBERS GUY, he has said in many interviews he asks the coach who he wants and goes for that player

Mickey is a numbers guy. The flip side is he has said and demonstrated in the past: the team decides what they're willing to pay for a guy, and if the player asks above that value, they move on. This is important to remember for later.

> Dennis Allen chose to let Marcus Williams walk, 

This contradicts what you just said on the basis that the team offered Marcus Williams a new contract and he wanted more. Our two safety signings this past offseason cost a couple more million per year combined than the contract Williams got.

> not put CJGJ in as SS.

Breaking: Defensive coordinator turned head coach decides he wants to keep top nickel corner at nickel.

> Allen was the DC and then HC, he clearly failed in his evaluation that Maye/Mathieu was better than Williams/CJGJ

It was also a lot cheaper. And it failed so hard we ended up with the 2nd best pass defense in the league.

> If you’re trying to say “CJGJ wouldn’t have played SS”, well he did with the Eagles with no new contract. Had Dennis Allen told CJGJ he could be our SS for the season before signing Mathieu, CJGJ would’ve realized he could make bank in an elite secondary

There's a couple assumptions in here: 1) that I was gonna say ""CJGJ wouldn't have played SS"". That's not exactly what I was gonna say. More along the lines of ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". I wouldn't recommend moving Juwan Johnson back to WR just because he had a career year and entered the league as one. 2) That CJGJ would've realized he could make bank in an elite secondary. He seemingly already knew that being that he played in an elite secondary and wanted to make bank. I don't think DA moving him to SS would've been an epiphany for him.

He wanted top 10 safety money despite not having played safety for us. It wasn't just about the position, it was mainly about the money. The team (included numbers guy Mickey Loomis) decided he was asking more than they were willing to offer. His refusal to participate in camp after talks broke off meant there was no need to keep him, as he wasn't going to play.

Once he was traded, his leverage was gone. Nothing to lose by playing.

> Dennis Allen mishandled many injuries. 

I don't think DA has the medical license to clear someone for playing.

> Why wasn’t Lattimore on IR?

Should've been, yeah.

> Why did Winston play 2 division games with a broken back and a torn up foot?

Shouldn't have, yeah.

> Why did our top tier backup Dalton not start against the Panthers in week 3??

Should have, yeah, but Jameis was apparently cleared.

> Why didn’t Winston get a chance to start again if he was “healthy” per Allen??

Because the two times Dalton's job was most in jeopardy he put together he put together his best games of the season. Otherwise he wasn't losing games for us.

> Just so many bad decisions. Either Allen was not smart enough to ask the right questions or he botched the whole situation 

He probably asked the medical staff ""is he clear?"" and asked the players ""are you good to go?"" which is enough for me to make decisions but yeah if he didn't that'd be pretty poorly managed by him.


> SO MANY FANS DONT REALIZE ALLEN APPROVED EVERY CARMICHAEL OFFENSIVE GAMEPLAN

> Saints fans think Carmichael and Allen don’t have long discussions all week about the offensive game plans

Sure, DA has a part in the overall gameplan, but not the script as the game goes on.

> You really don’t think Dennis Allen wanted to run on 2nd and 10s?

No. Why the fuck would he comb over the play sheet and tell Pete you have to call runs on 2nd and 10? That's not how game plans work.

> You don’t think Allen told Carmichael to build a 10 play offense that was super conservative 

Well the play sheet was bigger than that, so I'm sure whatever game plan they agreed to had more than 10 plays. But again DA doesn't breathe on Pete's neck and  murmur ""it's 2nd and 10...run the damn ball"". If they did put together a big play sheet with copy and paste of the same 10 plays then yeah that's bad, but I don't think that's what happened.

> Dennis Allen CHOSE Andy Dalton OVER Jameis Winston 

Yeah. Seemed alright for the most part.

> Dennis Allen wants to run a 1985 bears offense, and Pete tried his best

That's super presumptive, on both counts. You said these were facts but now you're just assuming things.

> Pete isn’t amazing, but he was trying to use race car parts (Olave, shaheed, Winston, juwann, etc) to build a truck offense (ground and pound , etc) that Dennis Allen wanted

Again, presumptive. Isn't Pete paid to gameplan and actually call these plays? Why isn't he doing his job in your fantasy land? Pete probably saw our QB was our weakest point, and wanted to commit to the ground game because our best, most reliable player is our RB, and the hallmark of Saints offense over the past decade and a half has been strong OL play. In 2021 our leading receiver had 700 yards and couldn't separate. Of the 3 big offseason additions to the WR corps (CGM included) only Olave played more than half the season.

> Dennis Allen is WAY TOO CONSERVATIVE,

Agreed. Not enough risks on 4th down or in plus territory.

> no self respecting OC would ever want to come here.

Disagree. A new OC would have a solid OL, a fun toy in Kamara, a Taysom, a couple young WRs, and an opening for a QB they might be in love with. There's clay in place and a nice paycheck. No self-respecting OC would turn down a job where your starting expectation is to be better than 20th. 

> Why would any QB like Derek Carr want to come here either?

$$$ and a job. Any QB like Derek Carr is immediately the starter.

> Dennis Allen couldn’t even figure out how to use Kamara, Taysom hill right. 

You've breached over from saying DA signs off on the gameplan to suggesting DA has blackmail on Carmichael and is forcing him to misuse Taysom and Kamara. You can take off your tinfoil hat and acknowledge Pete didn't call good plays at good times.


> Oh and he didn’t realize mark ingram had a busted knee on that late dump off vs the Bucs

Pretty sure he was cleared to go in. Also DA doesn't play QB so he didn't check it down to Ingram on that play either.


> Besides the Maye and Mathieu mistakes above, Dennis Allen made several other mistakes in 2022 on his own side

Correct. Elaborate.

> Allen didn’t seem bothered to bring in any interior DL, even when guys like Malcolm Brown were free agents

Yes his trust in the current DT crop was bad. I've said this since last season. Malcolm Brown ain't that guy though. If he's any guy, he's JAG.

> Allen played Davenport the entire year when Granderson outplayed him the entire year

Davenport was among the highest at getting pressures early in the season when all our DL was doing was getting pressures, no sacks. The sacks never came for Davenport and he lost snaps to Granderson got more in every game after Baltimore, so half the season. Plus Granderson is more prone to getting swallowed up along the edge in the run game.

> Payton turner had great games when played, but almost never played 

He had great moments. Would hardly call them great games. 

> Allen let Chris Harris continually blow games, including the late hit out of bounds 

Harris stopped getting snaps when Roby came back. Who else were we gonna play at nickel when Roby, Lattimore, and PJ Williams were all sidelined?

> Against Minnesota, Jefferson was burning Lattimore all game, and Allen never adapted. Jefferson was the reason the Vikings won

True. He had a little too much faith in our top 10 CB against their top 10 WR. 

> Against Cincinnati, Allen didn’t double cover JAMAR FREAKING CHASE and had little man Mathieu as the closest defender to help

You double cover Chase and then Boyd and Higgins singled up against the remainder of Harris, Adebo, and Roby. Do you want Harris single covering people or not? Not super simple.

> Chase probably has 50+ pounds on Mathieu

10 pounds actually

> Overall, Allen completely failed with a good roster 

Disappointed, yes. Failed would imply we didn't have a lot of young guys step up (Olave, Shaheed, Ruiz, Taylor, Werner, Elliss), that our defense sucked (interior run defense sure but the rest was elite), and that the locker room was lost (no indication it has been).

> Give us Daboll, OConnell, or McDaniel and we make the playoffs 

Dang so having someone else in charge of the offense would've been better? Wish I would've thought of that.

> DENNIS ALLEN, 2023 TANK COMMANDER. (Hopefully)

Hopefully not. I like it when the Saints win, personally. Half the people who want to tank just would just complain about how poor we play anyway.

Let's say a defensive tackle mauls the QB about 3 full seconds after the ball is thrown. It's a blatant penalty. No argument from anyone there. Instead of gifting the offense 15 yards, simply boot the DE from the game (after a review of course) and suspend him for X games. For less severe examples, like reckless but not blatantly foul play like a DB colliding with a WR the wrong way, you can apply less severe penalties, but do NOT change the outcome of the play unless the infraction directly influenced the outcome of said play. In other words, a sack is still a sack and it's still 4th down. If the defender hit the QB dangerously, then punish the player directly and maybe the team indirectly (off the field - see below) if they do it too often.

You can also grade teams on how many instances of dangerous/reckless play they had in a given year to rank them by ""clean"" play level overall. The cleanest teams get the extra 9th home game and will get more primetime games than the dirty teams (the NFL doesn't want horrific injuries on primetime national TV... right?). You could also take draft picks from the dirtiest teams and award them to the cleanest teams on a sliding scale if you really wanted to punish them. I'm sure there could be more ways to reward/punish too - those are just off the top of my head.

Doing some or all of these things would eventually encourage the teams to emphasize clean play because a heightened level of dirty play will quickly become a dead weight on the organization.",2.0,nfl,t3_10fb5ao,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints :Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-01-18T13:20:43Z,saints,0.0295026872327596

Didn't know the Donald was a Rams fan. Neat.

But to your point, as long as there are threads asking about sore spots or worst calls or bad officiating in general, this will come up.  

And you are right: bad calls went both ways.  But the bad calls were not equal. You get the Goff facemask, you get first and goal, hell, let's say you even get a touchdown.  Cool.  There's still 6 minutes left in the game, we still drive down, and we still have a chance to win the game. That doesn't even account for the hands to the face/roughing the passer on Brees in overtime on the pick, but you probably don't want to talk about that.

However, if you go back through the comments in this thread, no Saints fan was ""crying"" here or really saying much other than ""yea, that sucked"" until you felt attacked and butthurt and the need to ""defend"" your team.  

Imagine being so sensitive, salty, and attention whorey that you go into a thread about ""most painful moments"" for each team, knowing 100% what Saints fans will bring up, see that they are talking about it in a pretty normal manner, and then decide that you have to jump into that sore wound and twist a little knife in it just for the fuck of it *after you benefitted from it* and then call the fans ""crybabies"" after you instigated them responding to you. What a painful fucking person to be around you must be.
