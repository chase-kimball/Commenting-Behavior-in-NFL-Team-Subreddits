Personally, I always thought he was more of a big ass Honey Badger than an LB, so I'm glad they've finally moved away from forcing him into an LB-only role, even if it took two years.

> I'm very confident this is different than the Reddick situation because Reddick was plain used in the wrong way.

Cards fans always say this, ignoring that Reddick was used primarily as an edge his rookie year, started as an edge his 2nd year, and ended his 3rd year as an edge, too.

Similarly, when a coach is fired, they continue to get paid unless they are hired by another team, and then the contract can be offset with how much the new team is paying them. Because coaches are continuing to be paid, their contracts essentially keep going as normal, and expire at the end of their term. Peyton has 2 years left on his contract ~~that he is likely getting paid on~~, and the Saints own his rights until then. If he continues to sit out for those next two years, then after that, a team can go after him without owing any compensation to the Saints.

If coaches scouted and drafted, you wouldn’t have area scouts and personnel men.

Position coaches help with things like private workouts teams hold and sometimes help at pro days etc. And surely they do give their opinion when asked about specific players, but it’s a small part of the personnel equation. Jerry Sullivan, the Cardinals WR coach in 2020, was privately coaching Justin Jefferson and was on record saying that Justin was the best WR he’d ever coached in his 40 years in the league.

Did the Cardinals draft Justin Jefferson?

I’m saying be realistic as in this blind belief that he immediately instills a “culture” and elevates the Cardinals defense by bringing over some of the niners staff isn’t a given like you claim in your post.

He has a ton of question marks just like any first-time HC we hire.

The roster doesn't have holes all over it.  Even if they trade DHop, they have a solid receiving corps plus likely a first round pick they could use to fill a position need.  The only real hole is D line.  Secondary has become above average at worst.  James Conner is a solid back.  2 solid young linebackers and the aforementioned receiving corps.  O line had holes this year, mainly because 3 starters missed most of the year losing the previously highest paid lineman on our team will be good since he was one of them and it gives us more money to spend on a more reliable player.
