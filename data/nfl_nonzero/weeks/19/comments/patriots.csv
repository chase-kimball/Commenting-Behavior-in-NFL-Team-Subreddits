But if you're holding out hope like me there are a lot of good excuses like his OC being a complete bum and having a log jam of vets ahead of him in the lineup.

True. Maybe one day Tyquan will be that guy if he develops into and is allowed to (equally important) become a more complete receiver. Liked what they did with him against the Dolphins putting him in a stacked formation so his #1 weakness getting jammed off the line is mitigated and then he went for a TD (albeit against Noah Igbinoghene who has been kind of a 1st round bust for the 'phins).

19886,184950,184950,ThermoNuclearPizza,"Tua got a concussion that they didn’t catch, where he couldn’t walk after slapping the back of his head on the turf. He finished the game. The next week he slapped the back of his head on the turf in the exact same spot but harder. This time his hands locked up all fucked up and he was taken off on a stretcher. People were like “fuck football, is he gonna be ok at all?”

Fast forward 3 weeks and Tua is starting again.

Fast forward 11 more weeks and once again Tua absolutely slaps the back of his head into the turf a 3rd time in the exact same spot and has a 3rd concussion. 

Now people are wondering if Tua will ever play again because 3 concussions in such short succession is like *reeeeaaalllyyy* bad for your brain and can cause serious permanent damage and suffering another concussion ever could be an existential threat to his being. 

Some will argue the first hit was not a concussion because doctors checked him after the game or whatever but that’s essentially the basis of the debate. Some say it’s totally fine since in their mind it was only 2 concussions and he was out 3 weeks after the first. Some say it was clear he had 3 and the second of which was obviously a severe traumatic brain injury and there’s no way anyone should have let him back on the field this season and it’s a total fuck up by the Dolphins org and the NFL.

I think Mahomes is in a somewhat similar situation now as well as far as great QB, great coach, front office bringing in some quality talent.
