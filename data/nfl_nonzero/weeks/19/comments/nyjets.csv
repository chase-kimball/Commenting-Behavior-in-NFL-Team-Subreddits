13990,99566,99566,NannigarCire,"Another writeup for me, let's talk Aaron Rodgers. Already posted about [Lamar](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/10eigeh/qb_weekly_megathread/j4r67v3/) earlier in this thread.

Aaron Rodgers is turning 40 next year. Despite that, two of his best ever seasons came in the last three years at 37 and 38, and he won MVP in both of them. Even this year, with Rodgers putting up his worst season since 2015, Rodgers was still Rodgers-esque. You don't watch him and see a player who can't do it anymore.

And there's a lot of similarities between his 2015 and 2022 seasons. In 2015, the Packers lost Jordy Nelson before the season started, and were left with Sophomore Davante Adams and Randall Cobb. They'd eventually pick James Jones back up off Free Agency. This was the season where Davante Adams was dreadful. It was almost certain that he was a complete and total failure of a player. His performance was so unbelievably bad. James Jones at 31 led the Packers in receiving yards. It was just an awful team. Rodgers put up the lowest YPA of his career (6.7, lower than Geno Smith's 2 seasons with the Jets and less than Zach Wilson this year) and one of the highest sack rates of his career. Rodgers was even less efficient at moving the ball that season than he was in 2022. And just as similarly, this season the Packers gave him Allen Lazard, rookie Christian Watson transitioning from Division 2 (or 3?) football, and rookie Romeo Doubs from the MWC conference, along with Randall Cobb as his main weaponry. This is a setup for failure.

Also note that if one of the greatest QBs of all time has had two awful seasons as a result of poor supporting cast, it deserves considering for every other QB. Including Lamar Jackson who people claim ""is regressing"", or Derek Carr who is claimed to be ""regressing"" or whoever. You can even dig further and deeper into it to really separate when it does and doesn't matter, but if one of the greatest QB talents of all time is affected by it, it matters. 

I'm under the belief Rodgers will bounce back next year easily, as long as he's given a better supporting cast. I think a lot of people see that too. The question for Rodgers is how many years does he have, and how worth it are they? If the choice is between 1 good year of Rodgers and 3+ years of Derek Carr, it's almost a coin flip. You have one chance to get everything and very little time to make a transition plan. But 2 years or more of Rodgers makes him a nearly automatic get. That's why personally, he's my #2 option after Lamar. You can easily transition from Rodgers if you have more than 1 year to do it.

Also, unrelated as part of evaluating Rodgers, but out of all the Quarterbacks the Jets can get Rodgers seems like the one that would be the least capable to handle the NY media. He's defensive, childish, kind of pretentious and some of his actual ideas/beliefs will run into backpages and backlash. It's sort of hard to imagine a 9/11 truther QB for the Jets. I don't care, i don't look for football guys to be anything more than football guys. But I think it's strange how i've seen posts about Lamar's social media tweeting or Carr's ""good christian"" act as signs of their inability to handle NY Media, but not this guy.

14005,99583,99583,NannigarCire,"i'm gonna post a bit about each QB as i figure out what i want to say about them. I wrote these up in context of QB seasons from 2012-2022, starting with 2012 bc that's when the Read Option transformed NFL QBs and defenses.

Lamar Jackson is most peoples #1 pick as a mix of being immediately impactful, extremely talented, and a likely long-term option. Lamar’s still young at 26, and has yet to hit what is commonly QB peak years of 30+. However, those are usually the peak years for guys who are known for their passing. Jackson’s career as a passer has been inconsistent, with his first full season as a starter having his best performance of 66% completion with 7.8 YPA while also breaking the record for most rushing yards in a season for a QB that same year. Rushing wise, he followed it up with another great year with similar efficiency (6.9 YPC vs 6.3) and in his most recent season has again been very efficient as a runner at 6.8. He’s yet to show any signs of decline in his athletic abilities. As a passer he hasn't been able to meet the 7.8 mark again (the following years were 7.3, 7.5, and now 6.9) but even so, with additional context, the 7.8 mark is hard to believe he ever hit. For the majority of Lamar Jackson’s career his supporting cast at receiver has been sub-par with exception to Mark Andrews, a strong tier 2 tight end. So to hit 7.8 with top 4 targets Mark Andrews, Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead is absolutely lifting the quality of your offense. Same for 7.5 with a similar cast (Andrews, Brown, Rookie/injured Rashod Bateman, Washed Sammy Watkins). What’s even more surprising is that he’s around NFL average for his completion % career despite being one of the deepest constant passers in the NFL, never dropping below 8.3 ADOT in a season. So he throws far, and is still more accurate than 50% of NFL QB seasons since 2012. And his overall career YPA is above the 60th percentile when compared to individual seasons from 2012-2022, his CAREER is above 60% of individual seasons. He's efficient, effective, and dynamic. Plus he might be the best rushing QB of all time.

Lamar hasn’t had an impressive cast to work with but, as is common with any team considering extending a passer they aren’t sure about, the Ravens began to invest heavily in the position in 2021 by adding Sammy Watkins, and spending a first round pick on Rashod Bateman. Unfortunately Sammy was already dusted, and Bateman was mostly injured but they were an improvement over prior receivers and brought Lamar back to the 7.5 mark, steadily above the NFL average in passing. In his latest season, marred with contract negotiation issues, the supporting talent around Lamar took a nosedive again due to injuries and a lacking investment in WRs and Lamar regressed as a passer again. Some of the questions around Lamar remain whether he can transition into his 30s as a passer once his rushing skills began to wane, but there’s not a lot of doubt that the next three years of his career are likely to showcase the best of both worlds for him.

I'd grab Lamar in a heartbeat, even for the cost of 3 1st rounders and 2 day 2 picks. If you think that's too much, i just created a random pick generator that looks at years 2018-2021 and takes 3 random guys from the first round, and 2 random guys from the second round. No filter for picks, so 1st overalls are in here despite how unlikely the Jets are to ever have them in the next 3 years, Lamar or not. Here's 10 totally random runs, no redos.

Daniel Jones, CeeDee Lamb, Derrick Brown, Marlon Davidson, J.K. Dobbins

Payton Turner, Montez Sweat, Austin Jackson, Connor Williams, Marlon Davidson

Mekhi Becton, Zaven Collins, Trevor Lawrence, Deebo Samuel, Taylor Rapp

Rashan Gary, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Daniel Jones, Trayvon Mullen, Jawaan Taylor

Devin White, Leighton Vander Esch, AJ Terrell, Drew Sample, James Daniels

Ed Oliver, Devin Bush Jr., K'Lavon Chaisson, Kelvin Joseph, Yetur Gross-Matos

Kwity Paye, Lamar Jackson, Damon Arnette, Will Hernandez, Levi Onwuzurike

Alijah Vera-Tucker, Brian Burns, Frank Ragnow, Lonnie Johnson Jr., Sean Murphy-Bunting

Derrick Brown, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, Noah Igbinoghene, Kyle Trask, D.K. Metcalf

Not counting the one that involves Lamar Jackson, only 2 runs are better than trading for Lamar (the DJ/CeeDee/Derrick Brown/Dobbins and Lawrence/Zaven/Deebo run). 2 out of 10.

If you believe the cap is too much, Jets can probably expect about 36m hit this year for Lamar. That's Carl Lawson + Corey Davis + Jordan Whitehead. If you'd rather have those 3 players than Lamar Jackson, idk what to say. At some point you gotta get good players, and Lamar is one of the goodest at his position.",13.0,nyjets,t3_10eigeh,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-17T12:17:49Z,nyjets,0.013662207451587
14006,99586,99586,NannigarCire,"for a young long-term QB 3 firsts is fine. jets are unlikely to have any 1st round pick in the top 10 with Lamar and probably even outside the top 16. Those picks each have less than like 30% chance to hit for an average GM so they're at most giving up 2 starters (who may not even be elite, just starters). You can throw in 1 day two pick if you want as well since that's like a 20% hit. I think he's likely to net 2 firsts and probably a day 2 pick or two. Russell Wilson got 2 firsts and 2 2nds and i think he was, at the time, perceived a lot better than Lamar is right now.

i swear to god someone is going to reply to this with something like 'Russell Wilson!! now i definitely don't want lamar"" and i'm going to go joker

*to fully extrapolate this idea, i just created a small random draft pick thing where i took the last 4 years of draft classes from 2018-2021 (no 2022 bc unknowns) and took the first round players, and second round players and randomly selected 3 from the first round and 2 from the second round. This is like a worst case scenario trade. No filters at all, so even top 10 picks (that the jets are unlikely to have) are still in here. So heree's what you're potentially missing out on, five runs:

First run: Derrick Brown, Kenneth Murray, Josh Rosen, Ben Benogu, Deebo Samuel.

Second run: Trevor Lawrence, Rashaad Penny, Noah Igbinoghene, Levi Onwuzurike, Nasir Adderley

Third run: Justin herbert, Eric Stokes, Isaiah Wynn, Javonte Williams, Shaquille Leonard

fourth run: Rashaan Evans, Austin jackson, Justin Jefferson, Dante Pettis, Nick Chubb

fifth run: Kaleb McGary, Eric Stokes, Javon Kinlaw, Asante Samuel Jr., Darrell Taylor

There is only 1 run in here that is better than having Lamar Jackson.

*ran it 5 more times for my own pleasure:

sixth run: AJ Terrell, Mekhi Becton, Joe Burrow, Drew Lock, Jawaan Taylor

seventh run:Joe Burrow, Jordan Love, Travis Etienne, Azeez Ojulari, Jalen Hurts

eighth run: Noah Fant, Najee Harris, Terrell Edmunds, Greg Little, Carlton Davis

ninth run: Sony Michel, Javon Kinlaw, L.J. Collier, Samuel Cosmi, Walker Little

tenth run: Brandon Aiyuk, Greg Newsome II, Josh Allen, Walker Little, Nick Bolton

14007,99587,99587,NannigarCire,"i was referring to the relationship between QB Talent to rest of team talent, elite QB talent means you can afford less talent elsewhere, and as you go down in QB talent you need more talent elsewhere etc. I don't prefer Jags and lamar, but this also isn't an either/or. Any team that pays their starting QB has to continuously draft well, play contracts intelligently, and continue bringing in talent. I don't want JAGs and Lamar, but having Lamar is also how you get veteran FAs to want to come here as a last effort to go to a superbowl- which is a highly valuable thing the Jets have not been able to get.

and you're not forgoing the chance to have either, what you're giving up is 2 chances of doing so out of 6 picks the Jets have this year and some amount of FA that would've otherwise been spent on a random guy. In the first round that's the 13th pick, which is well otuside the elite prospect range (so like a 35% chance of them being a hit maybe?) And in FA that's probably not an elite guy either, but an above average to below average starter- because very few good players are even in FA to start with. And if a truly good FA is there, and they're looking at the Jets without a worthwhile QB, why would they come here instead of the chiefs/cowboys/whoever has cap space that is also coming out of the playoffs? Like this is the problem the jets had the last few years, there's no reason for good players to come here, so they were overpaying.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10dolj5,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-16T16:56:56Z,nyjets,0.0224044451722324
14008,99588,99588,NannigarCire,"But you're screwed in a different way, because they're less talented. They're worse players. You need a higher threshold of talent supporting them to be a year-in, year-out playoff/SB competitor than you do with Lamar, as is shown by the Ravens roster.

>O Line is no longer a disaster. We improve the safety spot, and augment the coverage ability of our LBs. We take more shots in the draft, theoretically augmenting our cost controlled core. You have signifigantly more cap space in the Summer '24, when once again there will be a qb musical chairs situations again, and you have less glaring holes on your roster.

how? Like, how would the team suddenly fix all of these holes in one offseason without accruing any new ones? is there some history or proof that teams just get better every year and never get worse or stay the same? In this scenario you're hoping that something like 7 new player acquisitions all turn out for the best with 1 of them being a first round, probably 1 big FAs and thats the only ones that Lamar Jackson's contract stops. And that's without even accouting for the talent the Jets will lose over the next 2 years due to aging out/contract disputes (Elijah moore will near certainly be leaving and need replacement) And in that scenario, you're hoping for a 80% hit rate on those players just to what? grab the next veteran who is worse than lamar?

I think that's far less likely than paying off Lamar to get a 100% certain hit at the most individually impactful position, while using all the other resources to still attack the same positions. Like what exactly is the %age loss for a competitive jets team to choose at pick 13-24 for the next 3 years vs not picking there and just having lamar jackson?

to me, i can't get behind any of this idea because it's a boat vs mystery box scenario. like this is an idea i understand for Carr/Garappolo, or even Rodgers due to age concerns. There's a big trade off there, but for Lamar? Unless you think Lamar is outside the top 12 QBs and is extermely unlikely to be a top 5 QB, it's hard to agree with any of it- and personally i think he currently is top 8 and very easily could be seen as top 3 in a situation that is very good around him.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10dolj5,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-16T16:29:04Z,nyjets,0.047626430526528

He's not unique in being catered to other than having a unique set of talents. And i don't know what they figured out, Lamar last year put up 7.5 YPA which is just around 75th percentile for league YPA with 64% completion which is just around 65th percnetile while having an awful supporting cast. And then this year, with an even worse supporting cast, his passing efficiency went down but his rushing efficiency returned to the same levle it was when he was MVP.

If 'catering an offense to him' is making guys like Demarcus Robinson and Patrick Ricard play >50% of the snaps then this is a very bad catering job imo. it's more likely they were hitching their wagon to Lamar saving an offense that was lacking the talent to do anything else",1.0,nyjets,t3_10dolj5,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-16T15:50:10Z,nyjets,0.0229565013885498

The idea that a guy who is used to playing hero ball for an entire season would suddenly turn it off when it's carried him all the way there because in a surprise turn of events, some of his players were actually performing for once, isn't very realistic when you can bet the entire week of practice leading up to it was likely based on Lamar being a hero.

I also think it's obvious that Lamar is not in the tier 1 of QBs (the one that used to contain all the elite QBs but now only contains Patrick Mahomes and no one else), so the thought of him having flaws is not an issue. All the tier 2 Qbs, Lamar, Allen, Burrow, and Herbert if you want to include him have significant flaws in their game that keep them out of elite, cause them to have drop-dead awful games sometimes, but also have strengths that allow them to be extremely competitive and SB hopefuls year in and year out. In the past guys like Rivers, Romo, Roethlisberger all fell into this group and all of them were prone to some of the most boneheaded 4 INT games ever seen.

If the goal is to wait for a tier 1 QB to be available, it is never happening. The tier 1 QBs who enter FA are either unknown as Tier 1 guys (Brees) or guys who are too old to sure what their quality is (Brady, Rodgers).

all of this is just...so not good at evaluating whats happening. How is Lamar playing hero ball if his starting receivers in the playoffs the last time he played were Mark Andrews (good), Marqise Brown (good enough), and then Willie Snead, Miles Boykin, Patrick Ricard, and the ghost of Dez Bryant. What is the methodical non-hero approach to running an offense like this? Lamar had to rush for 140 yards for the Ravens to take out the Titans that year. Without the hero game, they lose. Has Lamar been in a situation with the Ravens to be able to not play hero? He had as many carries in that playoff game as the Ravens RBs.

The jets are not deciding between Q and Lamar, at worst they're deciding between Corey Davis and Lamar and that's an easy trade. Beyond that, the jets are currently running bargain bin player sfor C, S, LB, and are getting a good run out of both ends of the ball without it. And further, the FA is not a place to find great players in those positions, it's a place where you overpay for teams castoffs and are taking high risks regardless. Almost every player we have paid for at these positions off FA has been underwhelming.

Yes, you'll have to lose first round picks to get Lamar and that will make some of the team-building more difficult but the Jets are currently stacked with young talent and alternatively, not getting a QB at all will just waste them altogether. So you can either try to win by grabbing a great QB, weather the storm of not having mostly mid-to-late first round picks to work with (its not like we're giving up top 5 picks) and just roll with 2nd rounders and later on an already talented team while running cap magic to shed bad contracts (Davis, Lawson, eventually Laken and Mosley when he ages out) to replace them with other FA castoffs to fill in holes and so on.

If you don’t believe Lamar’s playstyle puts him an an increased risk of injury compared to your average NFL qb, then idk what to tell you. He’s a great player, and he deserves to get paid. But he does not deserve top 5 qb money fully guaranteed. It’s not worth the clearly increased risk that comes with him as opposed to other QBs.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10fa7cu,False,0.0,:WSB:,2023-01-18T12:09:26Z,nyjets,-0.051419588816068
16087,106754,106754,OrangElm,"Lmao he’s far from the best at protecting himself in the league. That’s probably Brady, or most other pocket passers.

The nature of how he plays will get him hurt. Also I’d never want to give Feilds a guaranteed contract either. Josh Allen at least has the arm talent and accuracy to be elite even without rushing, Lamar does not. He’s a great player, but if we give him the contract he wants we are BEGGING for disaster.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10fa7cu,False,0.0,:WSB:,2023-01-18T11:49:10Z,nyjets,-0.0929507330246913
16088,106755,106755,OrangElm,"Injury prone is typically overused in the NFL where guys always get hurt anyway. Guys like CMC are not injury prone imo, he just plays at RB had 2 (unrelated) season ending injuries in a row.

That being said, there are certain times where it’s true. Lamar Jackson centering his game around running, and the way runs so often leaves him far more likely to get injured than other QBs. And as a passer alone without that running is he even special? No, he’s not. I’m not in favor a large guaranteed at all, and anyone saying he’s not likely to get injured if fooling themselves.",3.0,nyjets,t3_10fa7cu,False,0.0,:WSB:,2023-01-18T11:31:15Z,nyjets,-0.1094508377826051

He still might have been worth it, and we probably would have kept him even if we had to overpay, if we didn't have deal with the horrible look of cutting a young punter who got injured.
