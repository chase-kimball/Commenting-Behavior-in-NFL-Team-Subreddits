15832,135584,135584,NudeCeleryMan,"I promise it's not in bad faith. And I think I do understand the differences in risk. Or as well as any non-medical professional can. I've learned a LOT about concussions this season.

In both cases, we have players with some sort (now) existing or pre-existing condition.

>Even if resuscitated rapidly and making a full recovery, some after-effects can include reduced ventricular ejection fraction, which would make it almost impossible to return to being an elite athlete as the blood pumped with each heartbeat is reduced.

Damar would be playing with potential risk to his health and life going forward.

There is a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about Tua.

Tua has had two diagnosed concussions. Possibly three but ataxia is not proof of a concussion and that was his one and only temporary symptom. He went back into the game, ran a complex offense, relayed 15 phrase plays to his teammates, beat the Bills, and appeared publicly in a press conference after the game. He passed every concussion screening every day between Sunday and Thursday. Neither Tua or any teammate, friend, spouse, parent, coach, trainer, or doctor observed or reported any concussion symptoms during or after the game. Not on any day during the week following. Ryan Fitzpatrick interviewed him the day before the game and they aired the interview. Not a person on Earth mentioned anything strange about Tua and his quarterback room teammate of 2 years didn't notice any signs of concussion. He showed no signs of concussion while playing before the hit.

Is it possible he had a concussion? Yes. Is it also possible he did not? Yes. But no one knows. The best guess of the only people examining Tua at the time (doctors) was that he did not.

The Cincinnati concussion (Sep 29) was likely a grade 2 Moderate concussion as he lost consciousness but seemingly not long enough to qualify as a grade 3 severe concussion. It looked very bad but I believe that is because fencing is scary to look at. If he had been just knocked out and didn't fence, I believe it wouldn't have looked so scary to non-medical professionals. But fencing posture is not an indicator for concussion grade severity.

The 2nd diagnosed concussion (Dec 25) was not his first or second game back. It was his 9th game back plus a bye week. It took place 88 days after the first diagnosed concussion. This was a Grade 1 Mild concussion. He DEFINITELY showed signs of concussion with his play day-of and inability to remember plays the next day.

So Tua has been diagnosed with one moderate concussion and one mild concussion.

It's *possible* he's had one one moderate concussion and two mild concussions.

Definitely scary and I personally have no idea if he should come back but you can find medical professionals who say as long as you have time to recover, you can come back. For what it's worth, the Dolphins GM said Monday he's been told by medical professionals and the players union that Tua would not be considered any more prone to concussions than any other player if he comes back next year.

So they both carry risk to health in returning.

15955,135783,135783,NudeCeleryMan,"I actually did a little examination of this when someone in our sub asked if we had a chance of keeping it within 2 scores.

>More than half of Buffalo’s wins were by 2+ scores.

This statement lacks context.

I'll post what I wrote:

>The Bills have an interesting set of data to look at in one score games.

>In 2022, the Bills have played almost every ""good"" team very closely.

>One score games:

>* MIA (L)
>* BAL (W)
>* KC (W)
>* NYJ (L)
>* MIN (L)
>* CLE (W)
>* DET (W)
>* NYJ (W)
>* MIA (W)
>* CIN (NC)

>The 2+ score games were against the Rams (+21 Pt Diff.), Titans (+34), Steelers (+35), Packers (+10), Patriots (+14), Bears (+22), Patriots (+12).

>The average margin of victory in those games was 21.14

>The many close games is not to say the Bills aren't a good team. Winning 13 games is hard. Impressively, those three losses were all 3 points or less and one OT loss on a fluke fumble.

>But the question is whether Miami will keep it within 2 scores. With the number of injuries we have to key positions (QB, DB, LT, RT, RB), it's hard to imagine we can still be considered a ""good"" team at this point in time.

>I think Miami is likely in the ""Rams, injured Titans, early Steelers"" zone due to the Skylar + backups position we're in. So, based on some very loose 2022 data, I'd predict a 21-28 point differential playing on the road in a cold Buffalo.

>It's a division opponent and those tend to be closer so maybe we can shave off 4 points? That still leaves us at 17-24 points and above the 2 score range.

>My prediction: Not very good odds of keeping it within 2 scores.

>Some notes:

> * The Titans were without Derrick Henry and AJ Brown
> * The Steelers were pretty bad when they played the Bills. Pickett's 2nd start and no TJ Watt
> * The Packers were also pretty bad when they played (3-5) and before Watson emerged as a scoring threat
> * Josh Allen has been dealing with an elbow injury since the Jets game (I believe) and that may be a reason for margin of victory coming down but they aren't really scoring any less than before

* LG is hurt and hasn't practiced
* Mostert *might* play as of now but ~~had surgery this week on a badly broken thumb~~ it's not known if he's had surgery on his carrying hand but either way, not good!
* Our fullback is playing with a cast on his hand (was pretty hilarious when he was thrown the ball and he just looked back like, wtf are you doing).
* 4 of 6 best DBs out.
* Xavien Howard has been playing on two injured groins all year.
* Chubb, Hill, Waddle all hobbled.
* IF LT Armstead plays, he will also be hobbled and needs surgery the moment the season ends.

(The Fins won 11-6 with 2 of their points on a safety)

And, which impressed you more, today, a defense that frustrated the second best QB in the NFL (and scored a TD) or the 231 yards of confused looking total offense that only scored 2 TDs, and none last week?

It's fair to point out that Flores was fired after 10-6 and 9-7 seasons, with a much less talented roster than this year's, that including today, went 9-9. (Tyreek, Armstead, Chubb are all new)

No one is suggesting that McDaniel be fired. But, he sure didn't distinguish himself, either.

33176,245351,245351,fortas,"I think our team is low key in a terrible position. 

Firstly, we have very little draft capital so we aren’t going to improve at all in the offseason. 

Second, I’m not convinced that Mike McDaniel is a good football coach. I think he’s very smart, likable and funny. He does great things on offense and his press conferences are amazing but he also has HORRENDOUS clock management skills, penalties killed us all season and the defense has regressed a lot. He needs a good DC to help him out with that side of the ball. Some people are head coaches and some people are just coordinators and I’m starting to think that McDaniel is the latter.

Lastly, we have a terrible situation at QB. We will NEVER win a Super Bowl with Tua. He can’t play a full season and he arguably should retire after the concussions. He’s played 3 seasons and we all know who he is now which is a good QB that’s injured a lot. Teddy Bridgewater is a bum and Skylar Thompson, while he played admirably and has improved, isn’t a franchise QB. 

I feel like we are going to have 2-3 seasons where we are 7-10, 9-8, 8-9 and we won’t be able to get a good QB and by then all of our good players will be gone and we are going to have to start all over. We won’t win the division with Tua or Skylar because we have to contend with Buffalo and the New Jersey Jets are getting better. We are kinda fucked.

Little nuggets that stuck out to me
-McDaniel references how the Vegas spread changed by four points once tua was out. Coaches usually pretend to be unaware of spreads so that was interesting.
-When asked what he learned from his first season as HC, McDaniel says how rewarding the good things would be and how much missed opportunities keep him up at night. 
-He knows how starved the fanbase and organization is for a playoff win and regrets that he couldn’t get it done. This is a guy that wants to win badly.
-Wilkins has an incredible work ethic. He’s definitely the heart and soul of the defense.
-Grier said high rate of team injuries will not affect future personnel decisions. “You can’t play scared. It’s football, injuries happen”.
