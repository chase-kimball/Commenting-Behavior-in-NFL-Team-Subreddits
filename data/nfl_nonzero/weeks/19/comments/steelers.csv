9279,54598,54598,Dang026,">Pickens is a legit top 5 talent

This is the delusion I'm talking about. Every fan thinks the player on their team is better than they are. Pickens was a rookie entering the season. Off the top of my head there are at least 20 receivers who should be ranked above him. Sure he has the POTENTIAL to be a top 5, as does Najee who also isn't there yet although he is probably top 10. Freiermuth im actually pretty high on and I'd say hes about 6 or 7th best TE.

...but we had zero depth at WR outside of DJ and GP and the offense was masking the fact the left side of the OL was so bad to start the season Trubisky was getting rid of the ball in 2.3s on average which was among the fastest in the league just the same as Ben the past few seasons. Not much changed there due to awful OL play. 

If i were to put a grade in that group they are outside the 20s for their overall performance this season mainly due to Dotsons complete inability to pick up a blitz, Dan Moore Jrs proneness to give up the edge to a speed rush and the lack of push in the run game by the entire group up until the final few games of the season

Recievers/TEs id have to rank around 10 or 11. RB at 8.
Say QB/OL each at 20/24 and that puts the offensive ranking in terms if talent somewhere around 17-19 imo

Overall id say the offense did underperform a bit but the QB carousel and Najee being MIA for 2/3 of the season as well as having no WR3 (since week 6) in an offense that relies on movement from such players based on college film, I'd say it could have went so much worse than what the fans are currently losing their minds over.",4.0,steelers,t3_10ffdcc,False,0.0,:primantis:Primanti Bro's,2023-01-18T22:38:25Z,steelers,-0.0853754544665568

I keep hearing this repeated but where do you think they rank in terms of immediate available talent, not projection based on youth or how they will grow together as a unit?

Were they honestly a top 15 group in terms of talent, entering the season, with that OL being thrown together and Mitch Trubisky as QB1? I could agree maybe top 20 but considering the team ended up around 25th or 26th in offensive production thats not terrible especially considering thier featured back in Najee Harris wasnt healthy for 2/3 of the season and Kenny had multiple concussions.

I think Steeler fans overestimate the actual talent level as compared to the rest of the league.

9281,54600,54600,Dang026,"Lets have a conversation about the offensive production since 2018, following LBell refusing to play, the entire OL aging out, AB going nuts, Bens arm falling off and the offense being the lowest paid of any team in 2022 with a rookie QB who got multiple concussions and Mitch Trubisky who clearly isnt a starting QB splitting reps. Also a rookie WR was the teams #1 with no clear #3 in an offense that has always played the 11 set. Claypool was traded by week 7 and Gunner Olszewski/Steven Sims was our #3 which was somehow worse than Ray-ray McDonald lol.

Not saying Matt Canada deserves an endless pass but lets say Kenny is 'The Guy' and give him another weapon or LG early in the draft if they're going to have the lowest paid offense. CA3 isnt a guarantee rather a gadget player and likely a return specialist.

I would genuinely like to see them take Jordan Addison in the 1st and give Kenny a Chris Godwin type of player to consistently target in the slot while Diontae plays the outside as a pure separator and Pickens is the 50/50 guy.

If the play calling remains problematic or the scheme doesnt allow stars to shine then clearly the fault will be on MC but lets not act like Najee wasnt hurt all season and a shaky QB room who was relying on him to be the soul of that entire offense wasnt crippled by his absence. Also the O-Line took until the final 4-5 games to look like a cohesive group.

This feels like the Terrell Edmunds hate all over again. Hes not a top 20 player at his position but he knows his responsibilities and is almost never injured yet the fans hate him and blame him for a majority of defensive woes because he never lived up to his billing.

Its typical angry yinzer shit that hasnt been true in a long time but they heard it once and now they wont let it go.

Rookie WR2 and limited depth after trading Chase and the CA3 injury didnt help. The jet sweeps were converting at a high rate and getting great YPC. Kenny was operating well in the system and looked comfortable calling adjustments within the offense.

Name me all of the times that a young QB benefitted from multiple coaching changes. Look at Baker, Carr, Darnold even Watson is struggling after being on pace to be a top 3 QB of the past decade statistically.

Fact of the matter is that half of the teams who make the playoffs the previous year, wont make them the following season. 5-7 head coaching changes will be made every offseason. There will be 2-3 team in a ""full rebuild"" every season. You can say the Steelers were in a rebuild year but they still almost made the playoffs and they were able to continue developing young talent and keep the winning mentality.

I want to play devils advocate here.

Firstly, my stance on Tomlin is I’m back on the train. I have defended him my entire fandom but admittedly, I started to waiver a little bit at 2-6 this year. I’m firmly back in.

I think some of those playoff losses should’ve been wins regardless of the injuries. BUT, some of them you can’t really put on the coach, it’s on the players. like the Broncos game in Denver (2015?) when we were driving and a CB strips whoever our RB was (toussaint?) and Denver ends up winning. Or the Packers Super Bowl with Mendenhall. 

But games like the Jaguars, Browns, Ravens when we started Tate at RB, and the Tebow game, we were the better team even with injury. 3/4 of those were at home too. 

Others - like the AFCCG against New England where we got thumped or KC last year, it is what it is. They were better than us.

Tomlin is a great coach - top 5 AT WORST, (id say 3rd) but our last 3 playoff games we’ve given up 42, 48 and 45 points. For a defensive minded coach, our defense doesn’t show up much in January. 

Those numbers are absurd, regardless of how you look at it, and regardless of injuries. Losing 1 or 2 guys shouldn’t make you go from giving up no more than 24ish points, to nearly 50. But then you can also point at depth and roster construction, which is more KC.",5.0,steelers,t3_10br5wz,False,1.0,:SOTN1::SOTN2::SOTN3::SOTN4: Shut Out The Noise,2023-01-14T10:58:18Z,steelers,-0.000940640223272
16202,100502,100502,ItsYourBoyD,">play the Bills, Chiefs and Vikings

This will be unpopular but Minnesota isn’t a great team. Every game is 1 score and the difference between this year and last year is that they’re actually winning them. They won’t be as good next season.

The Bengals own the Chiefs. They have their number, it seems every time they play the Bengals win.

Buffalo fully healthy is probably the best team in the NFL, but they lose a ton of talent going into next season, and to start that MNF game a couple weeks ago it looked like Cinci was all over them too.

Cinci is really fucking good. Don’t look at what we do against them, or Baltimore, or Cleveland. You build to win within your own division, so we all give each other the toughest games. Look at what they do to teams outside of the north. 3 out of their 4 losses came from within the division. Also, 7 of their 12 wins were by 2 scores or more. They score points and put teams away. 

They went to a Super Bowl last year, and their biggest weakness was their offensive line, it was pretty much their only weakness. So they went out and got offensive lineman and they’re right back to being one of the best teams in the league, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re back in the big game again this year.",1.0,steelers,t3_10ay0as,False,0.0,:SOTN1::SOTN2::SOTN3::SOTN4: Shut Out The Noise,2023-01-13T16:59:37Z,steelers,0.0312218818396115

16206,100508,100508,ItsYourBoyD,"> win the division

I definitely think we’re a playoff team but I don’t see us winning the division. The Bengals are very good, have a decent amount of cap space going into next year, and have drafted the replacement for their biggest FA loss (assuming Bates leaves). I think our window opens 2024 and onward once they have to pay Burrow and (hopefully) lose some talent. 

They’re one of the elite teams in the AFC. I think there’s going to be a good chunk of years where - barring injury - you see the Bills dominate the east, the Chiefs (already have been) dominate the west, the Bengals take the north and the Jags win the south.

We’re in a position where we’re still competitive and can win games for sure which is why I think we’re a playoff team, but you look at games like the Chiefsx2 last year, the Bills and the Eagles games this year where we’re not there yet. We can’t compete with these high octane offenses the league has gravitated towards, we typically get blown out. They’re complete teams and we can’t sustain TOP to keep our defense fresh, nor score the points they do. The offense needs to be ALOT better in 2023/2024 to actually make meaningful strides. Not just small jumps and “marks of progression” but actually develop an identity, and finish drives.

The team also needs to start on time. Not start 1-3 like last year, or 1-4 like this year. Games in September matter just as much as games in December, and the piss poor start this year, especially against AFC teams who we were fighting for to get a playoff spot, ALL beat us for the H2H tiebreaker… Pats, Jets and Dolphins. 2 of which we played at home.",8.0,steelers,t3_10ay0as,False,0.0,:SOTN1::SOTN2::SOTN3::SOTN4: Shut Out The Noise,2023-01-13T11:15:01Z,steelers,0.0202304651629982

I think the primary reason they kept him is because:

A) The easiest way to ruin a rookie QB is to have him play for new coordinators every year. Learning new and conflicting things makes it hard for rookies to have a foundation to build off of. Unless you know for a fact you're getting the next Brian Daboll it's a risk to change OCs for young QBs. What if the guy we hire next doesn't work either? Then we end up in hell like the Browns or Jets.

B) The biggest reason this season was a failure was cause we lost too many games early in the season. Bringing in a new OC brings the entire offense back to square one and it'll take time for them to get better, causing them to struggle early just like this year.

1. I don’t think next year will be our Super Bowl run. I think a more realistic goal is to get a playoff win. I hope KP makes great strides next year, but I just don’t see a team with this many holes rebuilding in as little as one year. Around Kenny’s year 3 and 4 is when you make your push. 

2. Ramsey will not be a Steeler. He is in the point of his career where he is concerned about two things: getting Super Bowl rings and cashing fat checks. The Steelers cannot really offer either of those things right now. I see him being more of an expensive rental corner than a guy we can build around. We don’t pay full retail for players ever, except for maybe TJ and Minkah. 

3. I’m not going to say he’s overrated, but he’s increased his market value by making himself into a brand. He’s a fan favorite because of his trash talk and physical play.
