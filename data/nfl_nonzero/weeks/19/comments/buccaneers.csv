We usually say we want things to be as fair as possible, but what we really mean is we want things consistent, but also not rigid, which can contradict each other.

No, that would really slow down the game, but I do want that cherrypicked play to be called. 

The problem with being flexible but consistent, it causes escalation (I got away with that... I should try that again or that+1), and when the officials try to reign it in it looks really unfair.

5126,31174,31174,CoopNine,"What part of the ball though?  Does the chip account for where it is in the ball and it's orientation?  Is it accurate enough to be useful in those super hard calls to make?  How often does it need to be calibrated, and is at the beginning of the game enough?  What can cause it to become out of calibration?

Did the runner have possession, were they down, were they in bounds all has to be be taken into account.   For a chipped ball to really work, it needs to take the full ball into account, be aware of orientation, and you'd have to have information between video  and ball location sync'd nearly exactly.  

It's a tough problem to solve, with a lot of little details that have to be worked out, and it has to be perfect otherwise it won't be trusted.   It's a really big ask.

I think for now, the chips can provide some interesting stats and data, because that's their purpose at this point.   I think you'd want to see this work well in something like hockey or soccer first where there's less complications on determining a score. 

The biggest mistake could be implementing something like this, and having it fail horribly with visual evidence.   You can overrule something with visual evidence, but then you're trusting a system that has been proven to be wrong (and now we have PROOF) for those calls where there isn't visual evidence.   The second biggest mistake would be implementing it before people are ready to accept it.   See the mess Pitch f/x created over 10 years ago... And don't discount the fact that people do like some ambiguity in their sports, I know it's counter intuitive, but a game with ironclad rules enforcement may not seem as competitive, and people will still blame the system even if they really should understand rules are interpreted as close to perfect as possible ( see video games for examples of this behavior )",2.0,nfl,t3_10d4g6d,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers,2023-01-16T11:47:56Z,buccaneers,0.0281663100233163

The question becomes what do the mid tier QBs ask for and should they get it? If Watson is/was the 8th or so best QB, what does the 10th best QB get? Lamar is an MVP who elevates an offense even with no talent. He’s above Watson as a QB, so there’s no good argument to not give him what Watson got. 

I’d agree though. I’m curious where the contracts go from here. There’s a dam that’s going to break sometime. I’d expect guarantees become more popular, but the total price tag drops.

>Do you think they're going to try to clean house this year then? 

No, I think theyre going to let Bowles hire a ""competent"" offensive staff that he likes and theyre going to empower him with his vision.

I think when Bowles got promoted he had to coach with a staff that didn't necessarily fit what he wanted to do and be offensively. 

>'retool not rebuild'.

This depends on how the cards fall, if Bradys not back and we dont get an alternative QB whose a star, we will rebuild. If he decides magically to give it another shot with us, we will retool somehow. I dont know how, but Licht is brilliant at making things work contractually. 

>Maybe they go one more year with Bowles (maybe with more influence from BA)?

BA will be an advisor, he wont give opinions unless asked, because its not his team anymore and hes good at letting things go like that. They'll give Bowles another shot, Not leftwich though, he will be gone, we will either fire him now, or fire him by mid season for not being able to do the job effectively. I have no faith in him based on his interview answers about play action etc. He fundamentally doesnt understand playcalling when he thinks play action doesnt work without the run.

>I'm sure he came in on Fridays and fucked with the gamelan when he was coach. I'm also sure that at least had a part to play in why he is no longer head coach after 2 very successful seasons in a row.

Health and the idea of him leaving a legacy of good coaches in his tree/installing them. BA has always been a major mover for the black community having coaching positions. 

I think what did BA in was more so him realizing he would be leaving Bowles and Leftwich with a shit situation if he didnt retire sooner. I believe that was genuine. What made Brady and BA such a phenomenal pair was their differences in philosophy. Brady was more aggressive than he ever had been with downfield passing with us, once it clicked, it was beautiful after the bye week ( we did adjust to bring in some more of what Brady liked that super bowl year after the bye week if you remember.)

There was none of that this year, because Leftwich was in over his head. He reminds me of McDaniels, someone who seems to on paper have all the tools, but as a person just isnt someone who can get the job done. Hell man, Mcdaniels won a bunch of super bowls with Brady. But everyone still thinks hes an ass head coach, and rightly so. I feel like Leftwich is that same way, but people were afraid to bash him in the media all season because 1. He got propped up by media because of a push to get more black representation at head coach and 2. Saying anything about his performance negatively will bring out the ""racism"" argument without looking at the facts. 

I hate that, because objective truth in performance, lack of adjustments, inability to have a competent game plan around weaknesses, its a failure on a coach. Protecting him wont make the product better, it will actually make him worse off because he will be unaware of how he can get better. Other teams had more injuries and were WAY worse off than us, and yet they performed better in the wild card round, think Miami, think the Ravens, they were COMPETENTLY coached, they were over matched and should have been door mats like us, but instead they  put up a fight. We got our asses put over a knee and spanked like children because of poor coaching, poor gameplanning, and frankly besides their defensive end we out talent them and out match them at almost every position besides running back.

Probably not, but you can clearly see a massive difference between what Leftwich tried to do versus what Arians did. 

Takeaway:

Brady thought we should run the ball more, he got an OC who did that, with an Oline that isnt built for it. Arians tried to tell Brady that it wouldnt work with who we have. What you see is the evidence that Arians knew his players and their strengths better than Leftwich did from a coaching perspective, and Brady was hoping we could functionally run the ball without leaning on the pass. 

Every game we had to come back because we would start out more run heavy, and never establish the pass in a way that made us a threat, all short passes to players who are not good in tight space. We didnt have the personnel.

A few that stick out in my mind.

* Devin White takes a couple bad angles and is out of position on a few big runs.  Were in the right spot (a matter of just a foot or so) he has some TFL's or short gains.
* SMB playing 10 yards off but still looking like he is playing man.  This is more scheme than play, but still WTF.
* Mike Edwards looking lost in coverage.
*  Fournette cutting back right into a tackle when he had two blockers and lots of green if he keeps running to the outside.  Easily at least a 3-5 yard (at minimum) difference.
* Julio Jones putting in zero effort to make a block on a screen to Godwin.
*  Julio Jones throwing his hands up pre-snap indicating he doesn't know what the play is.
*  Julio Jones going in motion and Brady immediately telling him to go the other way.
*  Brady throwing into quad coverage across the field to Brate.
*  If Mike Evans was Gronk on that same throw to Brate, it would have been a TD.  I feel Gronk would have saw what was going down and cut to the right to be WIIIIDE open for a walk in score.  Mike just stops his route and watches the rest of the play.
*  WTF were Evans and Gage doing on the Brady INT?  If you rewatch that play, they both loaf to the same spot in the field, which is also the same general area was who was hustling.  The only other receivers on the field were Otton who was engaged in blocks and White who looked like he was just a dump off option to the right.

People that would free up the cap space and put us in a good position.  There are some players that are often injured or players that may not be worth the sallary. 


Also, in peak ""hey, I did this on Madden and it worked"" fashion.. I think the #19 draft pick would be perfect to trade.  Replacing injured, average, or overpaid players with cheaper free agents and draft picks would be a gamble that I think is worthy of trying. 

With, or without Brady, there are a couple of players that should get traded in the name of cap space and the future. I think the Pats approach of ""stock up on bunch of average players and use them to the max"" would've helped us this season. (Hypothetically...4 Tyler Johnsons probably would've done the same as Gage and Julio..for example). 

I hope we make the smart choices. I don't think a team with Vea, Jensen, Godwin and Evans paired with guys on rookie contracts like Shoyinka, White, Otton etc. should tank. We definitely have a very solid team that can be competitive in a shit NFC South division. With, or without Brady.

Coaching and good GMing can bring this team to the playoffs again.

25153,153682,153682,dragonsky,"I am in minority here and I am fine with it.

I hate the new rules of the playoffs overtime.

It rewards bad defense and it punishes good offense.

If you have a good offense and  you manage to score on a first down in the OT....you won't win. In fact, you will probably lose. You will play for ""3 and out"" probably.

The opponent, who condeded a TD, will have 4 attempts for a first down cause..well, they must go for it.

And once they did multiple passes and rushes....the opponent D will be tired...and if they score a TD...they can go for 2, and they'll win.

Despite the fact that one team went ""first pass - TD"" and the other one went ""rush-pass-pass-rush-pass-rush-pass-pass-pass-rush-pass-pass-rush-rush-pass"" with 40% success..... the second team would win.

Losing on a ""coin toss"" is not a legitimate thing or argument.

You didn't lose on a coin toss. You lost on a bad defense. It's your fault for being an offense-heavy team.

I like the rule of ""FG doesn't win a game and the other team get's a chance"" cause it  awards the good D that stopped the run and it punishes the bad O that didn't score a TD.

But  this rule is genuinely stupid and kneejerky cause ""ooh i wanted to see 56-56 game :( Shame for that good offensive team :(""

I hope this kneejerk decision gets punished this year. It probably won't, but it's a matter of time before more teams that win the cointoss will start choosing to receive.

Receiving the ball in a playoff TD is the better choice than receiving it.

Will the NFL change the rules once they realize that ""Hey, the team receiving the ball has an advantage now!"" ??? Will they make it ""If you win the coin toss in playoff OT you MUST receive first""??

Mark my words:

In X amount of time, they will change these rules. Mark my words. Idk if it will be in 10 years or 5 or 15 or whatever..but they will accept that these rules did not make the game better.

27135,166379,166379,idaho22,"My main takeaways are everyone we are losing and how many of these people drastically underperformed their pay grade this season. It leads to this longer post I keep making but most of the players going out the door simply didn't perform well in this game or in the second half of the season:

Hicks, Julio, LVD (sadly), Brady, etc.

William Gholston and our cornerbacks look like priorities to bring back but we didn't even play Jamel Dean in that game and he was torched left and right at the end of our season.

I can't see how we can afford any of these players and most of who I think played ""well"" in that game and through the end of the season are already locked up to long term contracts. 

Who played ""okay:"" really just Vita Vea, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Ryan Jensen, Wirfs, and Winfield.

We have quite a bit of dead money in Brady so it's impossible to think we don't tear it all down and rebuild. We are $35m in cap hell AFTER losing all of these players with the majority of that being Brady. This was our year.. we pushed most of his contract into next year and it all counts as dead money. 

I can't think how in hell we can ask Mike Evans to restructure again, however, Evans Godwin and Shaq Barrett are all players who restructuring helps. 

Restructuring:

Shaq Barrett seems primed for a restructure if we know his achilles rehabs properly.. a 31 year old coming off a drastic injury is going to have some devaluation in his market value. However, if we signal we are willing to lock him up to finish his career here.. I think it could be a win win for us.

Underperformers (for salary): 

Akeem Hicks couldn't stay healthy. He looked nothing like the $8m we paid for Suh.

Julio Jones couldn't stay healthy and similarly was not AB this season for us.

Sean Murphy Bunting/Jamel Dean - I simply don't see how we can afford to pay these guys unless we move Devin White and cut our abysmal left tackle.

Performed for Salary (we take them back if we find a way): 

Tom Brady should be someone we sign no matter what if he wants to play for us.

Lavonte David dipped off consistently in this season and it was hard not to notice. I love him anyway I hope we bring him back.

William Gholston has always been underpaid for what we got out of him. He's every bit as good as elite players. 

Trade Targets: 

NOT Devin White even though he honestly looked terrible during the season. He's young, and seems like a player we'd get the most trade value for after seeing Roquan Smith get moved. You can't build an entire defense around a middle linebacker unless they are ELITE. Devin White has ELITE speed but he hasn't looked the part. A team who sees him as the final piece could move for him. The issue is we don't really save much by trading him. 

Mike Evans ironically because of how he restructured his contracts so many times he ends up being the best money on a trade target. If we do this I'll probably flip the fuck out and say I'm not a Bucs fan anymore but I'll eventually come back around.

Cut Targets:

Donovan Smith is a player who just straight up sucks at this point. He's the most expensive player next year and we save quite a bit cutting him with only a $3m penalty. I think he will be gone.

Tldr: I can't look at this cap table situation and know how we can keep remotely any of our star players who are set to leave. And we are set to lose A LOT:

We also made RapSheet’s list, which wasn’t the case a few weeks ago.
