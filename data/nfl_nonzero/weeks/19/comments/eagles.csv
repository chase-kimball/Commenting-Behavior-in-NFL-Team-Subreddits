Laurie had gotten a bit too hands-on by the end where He would critique the game in a weekly meeting with Howie and Doug.

 The main tipping point at the end was the clusterfuck that was the coaching staff since most of Doug's circle was Andy Reid's tree (most of the SB year coaches were from Chip Kelly's time or who were brought on by Howie/Jeff).

Given our lack of late round picks (No 4th, 5th or 6th) I wouldn’t be surprised if Howie traded one of those 1st round picks(hopefully the Eagles pick at 31st 🤞🤞) for more draft capital.

And objectively false. 


Go to the 49ers sub and ask them if they think their defense has no weakness and see what they say.



I didn’t say it was getting torched. But averaging  223 is 20th overall in the league. For context the only NFC playoff team with a worse passing defense are the Minnesota Vikings.

He’s talked at length before about finding weaknesses for a qb in the pocket and forcing the rush to attack it. For instance, if you have a qb that really struggles when he has to move to his left at all, he will detail a rush plan that forces a qb to that side. His goal is to not only get after the QB, but to move them off their spot to a weaker position.   
  
 
  
The big thing we need to see is how he plays coverage. He’s always been extra man in the box, single high. Works well with a good secondary, doesn’t as much if you don’t.

*""understanding of a situation or event only after it has happened or developed.""*

The Eagles in 2018 were on a hot streak but the Bears were 12-4 and had dominated the Rams on SNF a few weeks before. The Eagles running back corps consisted of Josh Adams and Wendell Smallwood. The Eagles were literally 9-7 the following season of the Super Bowl. The Eagles in 2018 against the Bears for that playoff game were a 6.5 UNDERDOG according to literally everyone in the media at the time of the game. Also, the Bears were a literal double doink away from winning the game.

>There’s no hindsight. The Eagles were so much better. The Vikings fluked a win and then had to play a team that was better than them at every level.

There is hindsight unless you can show me 5 years ago you said ""Keenum is not good and the Eagles should not be underdogs""

Other than that, everything you're saying goes against what the narratives were in January of 2018. The Eagles were literally anointed as the biggest 1st seed underdogs.
