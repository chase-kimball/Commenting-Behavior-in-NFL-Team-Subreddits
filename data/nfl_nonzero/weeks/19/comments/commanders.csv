12586,102129,102129,Low_Brass_Rumble,"couple things immediately jump out:

* OL help. This is priorty numero uno in the draft and FA. Cosmi is decent at RT but may be better served sliding in to Guard, Leno is passable as a swing tackle, but basically the entire rest of our line is a black hole. We were supposed to have center solved, but we're constantly playing our 3rd-string guy (Schweitzer - good guy, pretty solid OG, but not meant to be a C) because the first two guys on the depth chart are always hurt. The ideal scenario has us picking Skoronski, Johnson, or Jones in R1 and signing at least 1 proven, high-quality vet to anchor the line (Orlando Brown and Mike McGlinchey are potential targets; I'm also intrigued by Ben Powers out of Baltimore).
* Howell shows out. The Tendie Terminator has shown some flashes of real talent, as well as some areas to work on. The current goal is to put him in the best situation to succeed and see what he has. It'll take a fucking legendary meltdown to be worse that what we had under center this season, but he's the one guy who can raise our level the most if he surpasses expectations.
* Better offensive playcalling. Scott Turner was a great play designer, but an atrocious playcaller. The guy *refused* to take what defenses gave him. He'd get cute and try to fix what wasn't broken, killing drives in the process. He was lost in the red zone. His play sequencing was totally scuffed. He didn't have a lot to work with at QB, but by all accounts his offense was this weird combination of overly complicated and predictable that made it unfriendly to QBs. We're crossing our fingers that Ron makes a good decision for his replacement.
* Chase comes back healthy and confident and lays down the law for a full season. Sweat is a beast and the depth guys held down the left side admirably, but the equation totally changes when that Young/Sweat 1-2 punch is on the field.
* Our young guys in the defensive backfield continue to develop. Benjamin St-Juste is starting to really utilize his length and looks like a legit outside CB, Darrick Forrest showed some really encouraging flashes at FS, and Jamin Davis took huge strides his second year after a disappointing rookie campaign, even wearing the green dot for the second half of the season.

16556,132573,132573,Professor_Nincompoop,"So first off I would argue that the GM position is more than just the managing the draft or free agent signings, it is first and foremost a management position.  McCloughan totally reorganized the scouting department and not just from a personnel perspective but also in regards to how the team evaluated prospects which persisted throughout the Kyle Smith years that followed.  He also, for a short time, restored some semblance of organizational integrity which was no small order considering Snyder and Allen still roamed the halls.  

As for his free agent signings most were geared towards bringing in veteran leadership on short term team friendly deals, something we have struggled to do outside of his time here. He also uncovered some guys like Ty Nsheke who was out of the league and turned out to be an extremely reliable and valuable swing tackle for a time.  

As for the Dotson pick, I think people really undersell how much his Achilles injury and the nerve damage his rookie year affected his career.  That injury dogged him his entire time here and for a player reliant on his vertical skills for jump balls it was unfortunately a career ender.

Another thing to consider is that it's not just an OC job. It's an OC job with play calling responsibilities. That's a highly sought after position, and you can do much worse than scheming and calling plays for an offense with decent OTs, good RBs and a very talented WR room.

Look at the one ""defensive HC"" on that list.  Bills might be on their 3rd OC next year in 3 years if Dorsey gets a job - and he's interviewing with Panthers.  Yeah the Bills are still doing good so far, but that might be keeping them from being as good as they could be with not being able to build from year to year offensively.  Their ceiling could be even higher than what it seems right now.  

I think pairing a franchise QB with a good offensive HC is the easiest way to sustain success.

He got a lucky shot and is outplaying the other guys before him. Check his stats comparatively. And he’s been playing without Deebo most of the time. 

I’m referring to the past preseason where we were excited as a fan base? Not sure your confusion there. Here’s an article that took me 2 seconds of googling “Sam howell preseason” to remember the stats and hype: https://sportsnaut.com/sam-howell-gives-washington-commanders-hope/amp/

Howell has looked solid, yes limited appearances, but solid and poised and comfortable and that’s what you want to see. Sure there’s a pick here and there but every other qb does that too….he’s gotta learn from those. Rivera even said the one he threw agaisnt Dallas he never does in practice and always makes the throw any other day. It’s a rookie mistake he’ll grow from. That what he needs to grow and become an NFL caliber qb. All I’m saying what’s the harm in letting a guy with potential that’s got the mental and physical traits to get the start and see what he can actually do.

You don’t want that at the water cooler. Fresh start is best.

Rebrand the team. Leave Football Team and Commanders, including Major fucking Tuddy in the past as Dan’s legacy.

Donate or convert FedEx field to something for the community. Strip all history of the team/era from the facility to neutralize it. Perhaps establish it as a nonprofit organization to run it, and call it “Overdue, over Dan”, and the mission is to give back to the community that Dan Snyder robbed and literally shit on for over two decades.

Rebuild RFK as the state of the art facility (not just in the NFL, but in all of sports) and build larger than life monuments of the greats, celebrating the rich history and culture of the Washington Redskins. Leverage that to establish a new culture rich in traditions under the new brand.

Hire a good person (culture) and strategic savant (dynasty builder) executive to run shit (difficult to just hire someone to do as good a job as Howie Roseman, for example, because he climbed the Eagles corporate ladder for 23 years since 2000). Do not rush this hire. Check tons of references and discuss/research around the league before making your decision.

Get the fuck out of the way. The next part is the responsibility of the hire above, while you go work politics on the new stadium, ceremonies, culture, deals, exclusive rights, etc. 

Empower that hire to do their thing with building out their staff starting with GM > HC > OC > DC > STC > etc.

Empower the staff to collectively evaluate the current roster of players and support their decisions for who they keep, restructure, trade, cut, draft etc. Again, stay the fuck out of the way.

Gently suggest that you’re open to investing more into the staff to ensure the success of the players that made the final selection (specialty coaches/consultants/etc.), and bringing in culture guys/mentors such as the Jay-Zs of the world and top tier athletes, and then stay the fuck out of the way.

Continue to celebrate and reward the fan base for their incredible loyalty, recognizing the trauma deep within all of them. Show, don’t tell, them you love them. Include them in the process with transparency that doesn’t compromise the vision/strategy of the organization. Get out into the community and work your ass off with a focus on community appreciation. This will help you sell out your seats in the new stadium.

Host free/complimentary watch parties for all games at FedEx (be a masterful fundraiser for the non-profit to be a valued keystone of the community).

Any sniff of a scandal, mistreatment of any employee, player, or fan, gets immediately acted on and proactively surfaced as a demonstration of accountability and transparency. This applies to everyone top to bottom. Hire a third party audit firm to investigate the team annually to demonstrate your commitment to this. 

Host events that focus on a particular historic player, game, season, staff member, story, etc. to keep the historical culture and traditions of the Redskins rich within the fanbase and the new brand and new facility. Do exclusive giveaways at these events. 

For home games, give away a few tickets to a family in the community. Share their story at an opportune moment before, during, or after the game. 

Do not, and I repeat, do not get in the fucking way. This is not about you. This is about football and the people who make that awesome from the staff to the players to the fans.

Process:
I like some of the players we’ve drafted. And I absolutely loved the move to trade down while getting Jahan & haul. 

On the flip side, here’s an example of a costly decision on offense, defense, and in the draft:

1. Didn’t draft a QB in 2020. Didn’t in 2021, either, after starting 4 QBs that season.

2. Decimating the o line and then reaching to get o line dependent Wentz

3. Signing an exclusive man CB in WJIII for a primarily zone scheme

Ron’s lackluster situational awareness and poor game management have been evident in each season, however not knowing the playoff stakes is the hair that broke the camel’s toe (/s) for me.

Many other teammates (BRob, Terry, Slye, Davis, Toohill, BSJ, Fuller, Forrest) made impactful plays, too, so I feel this was a team effort.

Although Henicke played with his characteristic moxy/grit and made some really nice plays, Heinicke also lost a fumble, threw a typical floater pick in the 4th, got sacked on 3rd and goal in the 3rd, and didn’t throw a TD pass all game. 5 PDs, 3 sacks, and 4 QB hits on Heinicke. So he was getting stormed that game and still made some great plays.

Here are 15 interesting stats from that game:

1. WSH running the football 49 times
2. WSH dominating time of possession 40:24 to 19:36 
3. AJ Brown injured (1 reception for 7 yards on 4 targets)
4. PHI 4 turnovers to WSH 2 
5. WSH holding PHI to less than 100 yards rushing
6. WSH holding PHI to 47 plays for 264 total yards offense
7. Heinicke-McLaurin connect 8 times for 128 yards 
8. PHI 7 penalties for 75 yards
9. WSH Davis no call face mask on PHI Goedert and recovered fumble to end a potential scoring drive while injuring Goedert
10. WSH St Juste forced fumble on PHI Watkins, recovered by WSH Forrest to end a potential scoring drive
11. WSH Slye responsible for 14 pts, including 4/4 FG
12. WSH Sweat sacks PHI Hurts on 3rd & 8 with 2:49 left in game because of WSH Toohill’s pressure forcing Hurts into Sweat
13. WSH Heinicke coincidentally clutch taking a knee moments before a late hit penalty which extends the drive to end the game 
14. WSH Toohill recovers fumble and takes it to the house to end the game with a chef’s kiss 🤌🏼
15. WSH rushed the ball for 152 yards

Watson was loaded with risk and accomplished jack shit prior, but it doesn't matter because any remotely talented QB gets paid. That's how this league works. You'd think after watching every new QB contract ballooning you'd understand this, but it's clear you don't. QB is the most important position, it's hard to find one that's good enough to win it all period. It doesn't matter if they're the best QB or the 5th best QB. If they're available, they will be overpaid.

QBs tend to take lower guaranteed money for teams they want to be with, but not always. Lamar might take less just to leave Baltimore if he really wants out. What they do with the tag and shit will obviously affect Lamar's options, but if Lamar was an unrestricted free agent right now, he's getting a bigger contract than Watson, and I have no clue how you'd think otherwise. That doesn't even mean you need to believe Lamar is better, merely that he is signing his contract after the Watson one.",1.0,nfl,t3_10ckxkw,False,0.0,:Commanders: Commanders ,2023-01-16T03:21:38Z,commanders,0.0319195957437875
