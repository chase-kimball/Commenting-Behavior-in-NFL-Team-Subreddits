26212,151081,151081,ParticularCanary3130,"I think they are thinking about the next year's draft. Bc I found this:

Lions 2024 picks
First round: Lions own pick
Second round: Lions own pick
Third round: Lions own pick
Third round: Vikings pick
Fifth round: Lions own pick* (conditions attached, see below)
Sixth round: Lions own pick
Seventh round: Lions own pick
Lions send Vikings a conditional fourth-round pick in Hockenson trade — HOWEVER, that could, instead, be the Lions’ fifth-round pick, if the Vikings win a playoff game.

So for This year, the sooner they are out the earlier we get to pick. Next year it would change what round pick we give them. Based on what I read I think I'd rather have an earlier 2nd round pick from them this year than   a 4th vs 5th round pick for 2024 since both of those aren't as hit for drafts.

He said, “Oh, it’s ok man, let’s take a photo.”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept insisting and saying “come on” and grabbed my phone to take the picture. Afterward, I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off “I love these people in this city” I heard him say. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands after paying and giving the cashier a tip. 

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, thank you so much for the generous tip.” He said no problem, and walked gingerly out the store. I’m happy to report I followed him where he started handing out the Milky Ways and $100 bills to the homeless in the area. 

One homeless woman asked him, “Mr. Johnson, will you please stay in Detroit and help us win a Super Bowl?”. 

“Yes. Yes I will”, he responded.

After that, I got on the phone and called my good friend Pelissero to give him the good news.

The end of the Bills game could've gone differently if our offense converted quicker. If we call a different play on 3rd down, perhaps we're converting or even finding the end zone. Moreover, if we get a stop the series before, we're not even worrying about it.

The idea is not letting the games get that close. There's going to be games like that, and some of them are going to be lost. The Lions had a lot of things break against them this year, and I'd say most of the close games we lost weren't due to a bad coaching decision but rather just dumb luck or a very bad performance on defense that set the other guys up (i.e. a huge conversion on 4th down). The Vikings game comes to mind. Think about that: if our defense could've stopped Kirk Cousins in the 4th quarter we would've swept the division and we'd be in the playoffs right now, all the other games you mentioned aside. So, as far as coaching goes, I'm not worried. The Lions outcoached NUMEROUS teams this year and took it to them. Coaching was a strength, even more than the offense was. What we need to do is improve the defense at all costs and keep the band together on offense. If we can get our defense to play half as well as our offense was playing and put up similar points next year, then the Lions are a Super Bowl team.",2.0,detroitlions,t3_10axcp8,False,0.0,90s logo,2023-01-13T10:17:45Z,detroitlions,0.0530794551337257
