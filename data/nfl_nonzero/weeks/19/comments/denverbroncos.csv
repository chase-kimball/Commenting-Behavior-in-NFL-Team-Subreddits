8059,48554,48554,GearsofTed14,"I think the problem with Staley is that he’s way too seat of the pants, and when you’re a head coach and you don’t appear to have some sort of plan or process in place for decision making, that unnerves the shit out of everyone, because it gives the impression that you don’t really know what you’re doing, and you’re just making it up as you go. Like last year, when he would go for a 4th and 7, and then punt on a 4th and 4, with seemingly no legitimate justification for either, it opened him up to criticism—especially when it stopped working (last year week 18 for example, or that TNF game against KC last year). Take this game against us for example. There seemed to not be too much concrete reason why he kept everyone in—when an example of something should’ve been: if BAL wins, then we’re playing everyone to get the win. If they lose (like they did), then our starters are just going to play 2 drives and then they’re done. If he’d said something like that, that would at least lower the temperature a bit where someone could at least say “okay, there’s something resembling a plan here.” But instead, he allowed himself to get caught in no-man’s land with this weird “idk what tf we’re doing” game plan, which ended up burning him. And if you do too much of that, then even when one of your gambles “works,” you’re still going to get shelled because people will think that the process wasn’t right—if that makes sense. Broken clock scenario. It’s a similar thing we experienced with Hackett (setting all the other just general bad coaching aside). It just felt like he was permanently reacting, rather than saying, “okay, this is what the plan is for X. This is our process.” And it was most evident on that Seattle field goal where he freaked out and rather than saying, no, we’re not settling for this, we have to get closer, he did what he did.

Point is, people are a lot more comfortable with decisiveness, or at least the appearance of it. It just feels “safer.” At least from your leaders. With indecision, you put yourself in a permanent no-win situation. And I think with Staley, despite the numerical success, it’s sort of a “once you see it, you can’t unsee it” thing, fair or not, and it’s the type of posture that’s woven into who you are as a person, meaning, it’s extremely hard to change, which tells those fans that he’s pretty much always gonna be the guy going for weird 4th downs and making bizarre decisions that only sometimes pan out, which in turn, is going to waste the prime years of their young star quarterback. So while yes, you could definitely do worse than Staley, you could absolutely do better as well, especially with someone like Payton openly willing to come coach your team",2.0,denverbroncos,t3_10d1kkv,False,0.0,Super Bowl 33,2023-01-16T07:57:48Z,denverbroncos,0.0515073744499686

I agree with you. I'm not sure how they'd do it, especially for things like holding, but it seems like they just need to change the rules so that fouls could be called correctly and consistently without hurting the current flow of the game. Whenever I hear things like ""there's holding on every play but most of it isn't called"" then it sounds like some minor form of holding should be allowed but more egregious instances should still be a penalty.

I agree, even though Paton will never admit it.

If we do hire an OC so good that they get poached as a HC next year, I'd say it's maybe a good problem to have. And hopefully in that situation, you have someone working under that OC that may be able to step in and replace them and at least keep a consistent scheme going that works.

>After their 2-hour or so interview Tuesday, it became clear from both the Broncos and Sean Payton that there is sincere mutual interest in each other, sources tell 9NEWS.

>Not that an announcement is coming in the next few days. According to a source, there most likely will be a second step in the Broncos’ head coach search process, with one to three finalists expected to be brought into the team’s UCHealth Training Center headquarters next week for one more healthy discussion before a final determination is made.

>With Jim Harbaugh dropping out Monday to remain head coach at the University of Michigan, most of the speculation has Sean Payton and Dallas defensive coordinator Dan Quinn as the co-favorites to become the Broncos’ new head coach. However, 9NEWS has learned that former Stanford head coach David Shaw has impressed the Broncos’ ownership group and general manager George Paton to the point there may well be a Big Three again in Denver’s coaching search.

…

>Payton, the former Super Bowl-winning coach with the New Orleans Saints, is considered the Belle of the Football among candidates in this year’s head coaching cycle. According to sources, Payton was as impressive as one would expect for a guy with such a head coaching pedigree. He was interviewed Tuesday morning in a Los Angeles-area hotel conference room by Penner, another Broncos owner Condoleezza Rice and general manager George Paton.

>That same trio also interviewed Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris for a little more than 2 hours Tuesday afternoon in the same L.A. hotel. Morris, who has previous head coaching experience with Tampa Bay and Atlanta, also impressed the Broncos’ trio with his preparation and plan to win, according to sources.

…

>From there, Penner and his associates will pause to consider who to bring in for a second interview next week. The second round of interviews will involve Penner, his wife and co-owner Carrie Penner Walton, and Broncos controlling owner Rob Walton. George Paton will be around for follow-up discussions and to help the coaching finalists tour the Broncos’ facilities.

>Contrary to some media speculation, George Paton is returning as the Broncos’ general manager, regardless of who Penner ultimately decides to hire as head coach. Remember, even if Sean Payton asks for final-say authority on roster decisions – as would be his right given his gravitas and resume – he had a productive and professional partnership with Saints’ GM Mickey Loomis that worked well for 15 years.

…

>Although there has been speculation that Payton would command a $15-$20 million a year salary if he returns to coach, he and the Broncos did not talk compensation during their interview Tuesday, according to a source. The Broncos also have not engaged in trade talks with New Orleans on compensation for Sean Payton, although they are aware of the Saints’ asking price which reportedly is a first-round draft pick. The Saints hold Sean Payton’s contractual rights for two more years which is why they are entitled to compensation from the team that hires him away. The Broncos do have a first-round selection in the 2023 draft, although its overall placement depends on where the 49ers finish in the postseason. For now, the Broncos’ first-round selection is no better than No. 24 overall.",19.0,denverbroncos,t3_10fomg2,False,0.0,Rod Smith,2023-01-18T19:30:15Z,denverbroncos,-0.0007723668261618

I think you're projecting. They're interviewing three first-timers (Evero, Demeco Ryans, David Shaw) vs four previous HCs (Harbaugh, Payton, Quinn, Morris).

If I could have my pick of this bunch, I'd take Payton no doubt. He is a proven winner and has given his opinions on ""fixing"" Russell Wilson.

If not Payton though, give me the gamble over the known mediocrity of Quinn or Morris, especially since we'll have our own first rounder in 2024 to make up for if Evero sucks
