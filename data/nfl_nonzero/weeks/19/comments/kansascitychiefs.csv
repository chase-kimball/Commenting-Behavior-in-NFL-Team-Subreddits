There is a cool hallway in the main concourse with the Chiefs Hall of Honor (behind section 119), and the main pro shop (behind section 101) is cool to look around.... and spend WAY too much money on a t-shirt or other merch. 

Depending on how much time you want to spend inside before the game, I would say give yourself 1 hour to get from your car into the stadium. The closer to game time it is, the more hectic traffic is and the further away from the stadium you will park. But 30 minutes from the gate to a parking spot is probably close to accurate.

Do what you wanna do in the stadium, grab food and drinks, but make sure you're in your seat for the national anthem. The crowd experience, in my opinion, is the best thing about a Chiefs game. And the playoffs take it to a whole other level.

You don't think DBs are sticking  with WRs who are bigger, faster and know their route because they are just that good lol... no.

This was one of my favorite tricks on deeper routes... Off the press or the engagement at about 5 yards you're basically deciding what route they're running. So at 5-7 yards if they're chugging deep, most likely it's a deep route (there's a few others but statistically speaking). What I would do is right at the hip flip where I'm running with them, as they brought their arm/hand up in stride, I slam my hand down on their hand. That way when we're running ideally my hand is smacking down on theirs as they're trying to pump their arm up (We're in opposite strides basically). Makes it *massively* easier to run with someone, throws off their entire route and resulted in numerous interceptions. Also, very very hard for the refs to see because my outside arm is completely free, I'm not grabbing and the hand collision is happening between us. It doesn't work every play but when it works, it make the whole rep easy as pie.

Brady decides to pull it and throw the quick slant, the defender doesn't bite that hard, then gets his hands up and jumps and is blocking that passing lane, so Brady now has to hold it a second longer, so now the o-line is downfield illegally.
