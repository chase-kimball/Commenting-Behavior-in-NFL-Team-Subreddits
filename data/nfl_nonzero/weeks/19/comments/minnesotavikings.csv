Without skilled veterans, we start losing, which hurts short term, but pulls us higher up the draft ladder. The more cheap, young, unproven talent we have on this roster, the better long term because if they do have a breakout season, they're another asset in the making. We build their stock and flip it for more. Justine Jefferson is already giving vague, ""Let's see how much they *really* want me"" answers, because he figured out the business and knows he's got the leverage. He'll take the money, and we want him to earlier than later because the salary cap should go up over time. If we play our cards right, after a few years, early in his big contract, all that young talent we'd been hording/flipping will turn into a couple of irreplaceable position players and a couple of *extra* draft picks that we turn into supporting players around a new core. JJ will be in his prime, and our roster will start to look like it's coming together for long term success. When that happens, despite JJ's contract, we'll still be on so many young contracts that we'll have enough money to make a few big signings and fill the missing pieces. 

Keeping good players in lost years is a recipe for disaster. Look at how the Patriots operated for 20 years. Forget the fact they had Brady and Bill for a second. They sold high and bought low -- always leveraging their value in order to sustain the ability to acquire new talent and make big acquisitions. They didn't have these short terms bursts that resulted in long term droughts. They didn't always win the Super Bowl, but they were always in the conversation.

Anything Daniel Jones did has to be placed in the context of our terrible defense. None of his passes went deeper than 20 yards. Not saying he didn't play well, but our defense made it very easy for him.

  
As for Kirk, the only reasons we won 13 games this year were 1) Jefferson is amazing. 2) Kirk balled out with 8 huge comebacks.

35979,233954,233954,mrmpls,"Are your numbers correct?

Also, using the individual's cap hit in the year they win the Super Bowl but ignoring prorated bonuses, dead cap, etc is an incomplete evaluation of the total cost of that QB's true cost.

Tom Brady had a 2020 cap hit of $25MM, not $28MM, and $25MM for 2021. But he restructured and spread out this amount after the Super Bowl win, so his cap hits were only around $10.5MM and $11.9MM in 2021 and 2022. This leaves dead cap of $35.1MM next year which he isn't even under contract.

Using your ""cap hit"" analysis, if Tom Brady had won a Super Bowl in 2021, you would say he was inexpensive/low contract, while completely ignoring the $35.1MM dead cap in 2023. I'm not suggesting you factor in QB cost that occurs *after* a win, I am just providing an example of how selecting a single year's hit is misleading.

Also, why look at the cost of the individual QB instead of the team's spending on QB? I'm having a tough time finding what it was at the time, but it looks like the Eagles spent $14MM on Wentz and Foles combined in the 2017 season when they won SB 52 in Feb 2018.

You say QB contract numbers are ""debilitating"" but don't seem to understand why that would be: a team who is paying a high amount for a quarterback has likely failed to obtain one in the draft (and has to pay in free agency), and such a team is likely already not very successful.

I've been a Kirk fan. I've been a hate Kirk fan. Kirk finally failed this season in the big moment, so all the Kirk haters are out in full force. They are just dumb individuals that look at 1 overall play. That 1 play call, that 1 throw, ""ruined"" our season because nothing came after it. KOC called a terrible fucking play. Our OL got blown up immediately. No other receiver had separation. He threw to the only guy with a chance to break a tackle, albeit, a very low fucking chance. Good coaches put their players in situations and scenarios where they can succeed. KOC is a rookie HC. He did a decent job this year doing that. But he has made some very... VERY... boneheaded decisions as a coach.",25.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10dgcpa,False,0.0,virginia,2023-01-16T08:51:24Z,minnesotavikings,9.807654824224693e-07

Over the course of the whole season, I think KOC made more good decisions than bad, just slightly. But when it came down to it. When we really needed something. He made the wrong decision when it counted. Multiple failed trick plays that werent needed. Over thinking play calls. Running 3 straight times behind your center after a blocked punt against the Packers on the 1 yard line. 2 of those behind your 3rd string center. 4th and 8 season on the line and you run a guy short of the sticks. No motion before the snap. Nothing. 6 minutes left. Giants just scored. We come out after the KO and do a WR screen and a TE screen. for -3 yards. Go 3 and out.
