1: Gets home field thru the playoffs and a bye

2: Gets home field for at least 1 game (probably 2) and the weakest seed round 1

3: Don't have to play the strongest wild card team, and home field round 1

4: Home field advantage

5: Gets to play the 4 seed instead of 2 or 3

6: Doesn't have to play the 2 seed

7: Makes it to the playoffs and a chance to upset

So option 1. He did an incredibly shitty job with Josh Rosen and helped him become one of the ""worst QB bust's in a while"" in your terms. That's pretty fucking bad, and not who you want around your developing franchise QB.

Option 2, Rosen was never going to succeed, and was always a shitty quarterback. This means that Leftwich has absolutely no talent evaluation skills and was unable to see tape on *a guy who played his position* and say ""hey, this guy does a lot of things bad"". There's zero chance the QB coach had no say and had no interaction with Rosen before they drafted him, and if Rosen never had a chance, Leftwich missed all the flags, whiffed, and allowed his organization to draft a guy with a top 10 pick who can't even make it as a backup in this league. That's a pretty fucking bad picture too, and not a guy you want in charge of your roster.

Teams generally don’t take deals that don’t give them flexibility to manipulate the cap because of how often it’s done.

As for your second point, realistically I shouldn’t even acknowledge it because we both know you’re being extra on purpose for the sake of arguing, but here we are. You’re correct. The cap does in fact prevent you just making super teams. You got us in the technical sense!

But that has nothing to do with what we’re discussing. We’re not discussing the cap in regards making a super team. We’re discussing the cap in regards to breaking teams up and honestly that’s just a myth at this point.

Of a glimmer of hope dressed as a mirage. The beast comes for us again, into our home. But that is not our fate my friends, no. As it is written, in the book of Coughlin 14:11, ""That which is confined in the darkest dungeon, may most easily find the light."" Now there is an undeniable spark of HOPE before us, if only we can find the COURAGE to kindle it one more time. And if we do my brothers and sisters it will LIFT us and CARRY us to places we have only been able to DREAM of. Now I ask you, as you stare into the deep dark depths, to open your heart one more time, to take that step and BELIEVE in HIM. And you will BE rewarded, because with the ENTIRE DUUUVAL NATION at your side we will SMITE that beast with the HOLY million dollar arm of VENGEANCE!!!

After the first pick:   
Dungy: ""That is illegal contact for sure.""   


He didn't give them a pass for it at all, but he also didn't continue bringing it back up because he really can't.   


1st quarter, 2:51 remaining, they picked up flag. Dungy says: ""Samuel tried to get his head around, but I don't think he's playing the ball."" Then the ""rules analyst"" explains that it isn't a foul this year, and you can hear Tony huff a bit, but he doesn't speak for the next 30 seconds or so. Doesn't reply to Terry. Honestly think if you saw video of him, he would have been shaking his head in disbelief.   


2nd quarter, 6:56 on game clock, no flag. Tony doesn't comment on it. Al Michaels does a bit, but Tony I think is honestly just done with it at this point, and doesn't mention anything about the no call at all. Just comments that the Jags need to go away from passing underneath. 

3rd, 7:58 on clock:  Maybe should have been one, Dungy says not a whole lot of contact there.   


He did call out the PI during the 2-pt try in the 3rd.

The Giants went to beat the Patriots in the Superbowl. Coughlin was quoted say the final game of the season led the team to believe they could play with anyone in the league.

30093,208269,208269,ddscience,"Most common definition of ""pressure"" in this context of OL performance is when a pass blocker is directly responsible for allowing either a:

- QB hurry (opposing pass rusher forces QB into early movements/passes), 
- QB hit (opposing pass rusher hits the QB but after a pass was made), or 
- QB sack

The ""directly responsible"" part is the most important piece. It basically means that we're excluding any hurries/hits/sacks that resulted from defensive schemes (pass-rushers that get to QB unblocked/untouched) or from QBs themselves (hanging on for too long, scrambling from a clean pocket, etc.). And **only** looking at the results of straight up pass-pro matchups between a pass-blocker versus a pass-rusher.

&nbsp;

Two things I can see leading to a lowish grade:

1. if Little had help on a majority of those sets against Mack/Bosa
 - I don't have actual numbers on it, but I would bet that Mack or Bosa were being doubled by Little + someone else on most of their pass rushes. In that case, since it's a 2v1, you'd expect even a below-average pass-blocker to win those reps, so there's not a lot of opportunities to ""shine"" and get positive graded plays
2. if they are considering his reps' wins and losses in addition to pressures
 - if you allow a pressure, then you got beat. But if you get beat, that doesn't always mean you also allowed a pressure. So Trevor could have been pressured 0 times all game with Little (or anyone) getting ran over every snap, as long as it takes the pass-rusher more time to run you over than it does for the play to unfold as planned.",3.0,jaguars,t3_10difei,False,0.0,:JAX0:,2023-01-16T21:25:47Z,jaguars,0.012312631034445

And putting all bias aside, the Jags have objectively been trending upwards while the Chiefs downwards over a similar timespan. 

I probably don’t need to mention the Jags’ recent string of games given where this post is, but since December (aka the past 6 KC games): 
-	2 were actually convincing/Chiefs-esque wins (SEA and LV)
-	3 were **very** nearly lost against notably weaker offenses (DEN x2 and HOU)
-	remaining game is a loss against CIN

1c. Let me start over

1c-a. The kicker is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, extra point, that prohibits the extra point from doing, you know, just trying to score the point. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the kicker is in the motion, he can't be over here and say to the demons in his head, like, ""I'm gonna miss this! I'm gonna hit the upright! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to kick and then don't make it, you have to still make it. You cannot not make it. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, kicking motion of the ball, and then, until you just miss it.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there's the yips you gotta think about.

1c-b(2)-b. Aang say yip yip to make appa fly 

1c-b(2)-b(i). Oh wait, he talked in that dream episode too! That would be even worse.

1c-b(2)-b(ii). And fuck the great divide episode amirite?!? Haha classic…

I think we need to involve Etienne in the passing game more on the short routes to open it up for deep stuff, kinda like how we did with the chargers. If the chiefs respect all three levels of our offense, then we can move the chains.  
  
On defense, we need Josh Allen to show up, and if he gets double teamed, we need our other d-linemen to take advantage. Along with that, we need to contain mahomes' scrambling/rushing.
