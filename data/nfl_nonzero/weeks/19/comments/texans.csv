The entire nation freaks out when Tua gets knocked out and seizes up but professional mma fighters get bonuses for that and justify it as a part of the game. I forgive him. It’s not a heartless thing, it was a failed recognition that things went too far. He needed to be reminded of the callousness.

After CTE was discovered, the game is trying to separate itself from violence but for years before that, it’s violence was celebrated. For every guy that stays on the field injured after a play, there are countless injuries that the players are feeling but ignoring. This game is organized pain and violence but is now hidden for PR reasons.

&#x200B;

To defend this a little bit, I know that a lot of fans are looking at the idea of sending draft capital out for a coach as too valuable of an asset to lose on a position (head coach) that we can fill without spending draft capital at all. We need to think about it from all angles though. For starters, why be Peter Griffin? Just take the boat. That 12th overall pick and newly promoted coordinator are mystery boxes. We could end up with THE best coach in the league or we could end up with a guy who should never have been promoted from the job they were actually good at (Pep Hamilton). We could end up with Christian Ponder, we could end up with Deshaun Watson (oops). The 12th overall pick this year will also come with a roughly $3.5million cap hit. We could spend that money in free agency and while we won't get back a guy of 12th pick's ceiling for 3.5 million, we can use that to sweeten the pot a little bit for some of the talent I've had my eyes on. Talent that should be a little cheaper to bring on board with Payton at the helm. We're coming off two 4 win seasons that led to a 3 win season. There is a definite Texans tax to the contracts that free agents want from us right now. Bringing in a head coach who has a record of winning 73% of his games over a FIFTEEN year period is going to help with that. Add to the fact that he is liked and respected by the guys who've played for him in the past? That's a whole lot of winning before we even play a down of football this year. Additionally, I'm not really offering 12th straight up. If I get the impression that 33 overall will do it then that's the offer, but I'm expecting to start with 12th and 73rd for Payton, 40 and 71. That has a pick value between 26th and 27th pick which in in the expected range of outcomes. If they aren't feeling the 3rd round pick swap, leaving it out brings the value to exactly 26th pick.

With Johnson heading back to Detroit, there's noone else who is even close. Steichen is a talented young offensively minded coach who has also coached the other side of the ball. There is only one major potential red flag and it kept me from hiring his co-coach Gannon last year- he needs to replace our offensive coordinator. Steichen and Pep worked together on the Chargers during Herbert's rookie season. If Pep will take the demotion back to QB coach in order to stay with Steichen at the helm great, otherwise, moving on.

Next man up is Ryans. Ryans would be an immediate PR success, with both the National media and the fans. Bonus, I like the way he coaches. The downside is, I don't want to be in the position 2-3 years from now where our OC gets poached just as we start rolling. I'd rather bring an offensive guy in to implement his own system to initiate an era of continuity for the offense. I'm just not sure that Thomas Brown is that guy, but if Demeco's interview doesn't go well, he might get bumped into this slot.

I’ve been against taking a QB for a decent amount of time now and I don’t think I’ve ever been more sure it’s the wrong move to take one. There’s so many more confounding factors in play now that if we do take one, he’s bound to fail. 

1) it’s clear that Bryce/Stroud and I guess Levis are somewhere between the 2022 and like 2021 QB class talent wise. Whereas Carter/Anderson are on par with most recent players at their position; though neither have the Myles Garrett type of hype around them and that’s ok. If you’re taking a QB in the top 5 he has to be generational, and neither Stroud nor young are. Whereas it’s way more reasonable to argue that Carter or Anderson have that ability. 

2) Caserio is clearly on the hot seat and taking a QB would buy him time. This is probably the biggest pitfall we could fall victim to. I can’t emphasize enough how bad taking a QB just to take one to extend your tenure is; especially if he’s not head and shoulders better than the surrounding best players available, which they aren’t. 

3) Our defense SUCKS. We have no first or second round picks in the front 7 with a generationally bad rush defense. Now a good bit of that was Lovie’s archaic philosophies at work; another (and I think much larger) part of that is talent disparity. This is a really good defensive draft especially as it relates to the front 7. This is the time to build the trenches and solidify what was an abysmal rush defense in 2022 and 2021.

28426,219770,219770,lovetape,"> I have yet to see anyone mention this, but bountygate

It's mentioned in pretty much every thread about him? 

The weird thing about Bountygate is, I don't think anyone was punished for intentionally seeking to cause harm to opposing players, they were punished for incentivizing players outside of their contracted terms to do something. I think it was $1000 if a player was carted off, $1500 for QB, and during a playoff run, Jonathon Vilma put up $10000 as a bounty against (I think?) Kurt Warner and Brett Farve, the Saints playoff opponents during their Super Bowl run. 


I know it's sick? but it was a long time ago, and it doesn't seem to be something that's persisted. No one seems to have a problem hiring Gregg Williams (outside of being a shitty coach). 


Payton did an interview Monday, [where he talks about the potential trade stuff to acquire him](https://twitter.com/TheHerd/status/1615066212869996544). Sounds like a mid-to-late 1st is the asking price.
