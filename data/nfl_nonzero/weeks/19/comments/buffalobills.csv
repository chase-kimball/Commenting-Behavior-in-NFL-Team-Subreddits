Lets be honest here, the only good proven WR on this team is Stefon Diggs. He isn't wrong of guys off the street playing snaps, Beasley should've stayed retired, and Brown has a play once in a while but other than that doesn't contribute much.

Gabe Davis is an average at very best vertical threat WR who has a heavy drop rate, McKenzie is only good enough for a gadget role and occasionally a short screen pass or something. Shakir unproven since they barely play him but looks great when he does in limited action. and Kumerow when not injured is really only a ST guy.

WR is a sneaky big need for this team in the off-season, we need to drastically improve behind Stefon Diggs. WR and OL needs to be Beanes biggest focus's this off-season.

Apart from that large loophole, one of the most insidious aspects of online sports gambling specifically is how easy it is to hide, and therefore do a massive amount of damage before it's discovered (or the person asks for help on their own). No one would bat an eye if a young guy watched a lot of sports (on TV or phone), or spent a lot of time discussing sports with friends or online, etc. You can make the bets from your sofa/bed/toilet, without even going to a bookie or lottery kiosk. A friend or loved one would likely notice soon enough if you were hung over every morning, passed out on hard drugs half the time, making multiple large purchases each day, going to card games 3x a week, or desperately chasing anonymous sex at every opportunity; however, if you have separate finances, even your significant other might not notice a problem with online betting until you've dug a massive financial hole for yourself.

Although I'm usually fine with letting people have their vices, and wary of sounding like I'm clutching pearls, I think it's shitty that this is being normalized as part of watching sports for young people, particularly since most of the people who develop gambling addictions are young men.

17661,114898,114898,MosEisleyBills,"For me Dorsey has put everything in place that we’ve been looking for. Ultimately the QB decides where and when to release the ball. It doesn’t matter how well planed the play is and how well the guys run the routes if Josh goes off plan. The 3 touchdowns and the drop by Knox in the end zone show we have the playbook and the wrinkles in the playbook. 

Josh is a gunslinger and plays what he sees. We need to accept that there will be times when he squeezes a window rather than take the dink/dunk. 

When you watch plays back, there is almost always an open man but Josh takes another target. 

Josh wants a Super Bowl. I believe when he wins us our Super Bowl we’ll have a different Josh. He won’t force it and be more surgical when we have our Super Bowl. 

I’m also going to say that the dolphins are a damn good team. The dolphins D had the skill to play cover zero effectively on pretty much ever down. The dolphins game plan was very effective and not a plan many teams can play (bengals and chiefs won’t be playing cover zero).

Our team trusts the guys that were here over rookies or new acquisitions, but they do give everyone a chance to earn their spot. That being said they've got to be spectacular to unseat a current player.  A good example is this year with Elam. We're still running Dane Jackson out there opposite of Tre when we've got Elam healthy. Another example has been the return of John Brown and Cole Beasley. Both are vets with significant time in the system, but it's changed some and it took weeks for them to bring them back up to speed. We also don't rush players back from injury as we're seeing with Micah or Tre earlier in the season. Trust has to be warned with this staff, and sometimes it makes our staffing choices appear slow to react.

Another aspect of our FO mentality is if younger players get hurt in camp and can be stashed on IR that's where they go. Hodgins had an ankle injury his first year and spent the season on IR so he wouldn't take a roster slot or a practice squad space. Similar thing happened year two.

27956,195943,195943,Why_So-Serious,"1.) Why would you think the Bills would win by 30 points when every game was close with Dolphins including a loss? Tua wasn’t doing anything special. He threw it in an area where Hill or Waddle were and they put in the work. The delusion of “We shoulda crushed them” is a problem with certain parts of the Mafia. I don’t know where your expectations come from but you should look inward and adjust them. There are  no easy wins in the NFL. 

2.) Daboll/Dorsey isn’t responsible for preventing the Dolphins from scoring. The Bills O scored 34. 

3.) This is the same exact shit people that believe they are being thoughtful would post about Daboll. “In my expert opinion the offensive play calling is laking and preventing Josh Allen from growing.” Has been posted for the last 5 years. 

STFU you’re not an OC and don’t know what you’re talking about. It sounds like it’s a thoughtful topic but really it’s just pouting because the Bills didn’t win by 30 like they wanted. 

Josh Allen is choosing to throw bombs on these plays. If anything Dorsey needs to talk to Josh about taking what the defense gives you more often. Which is what Daboll had to do the last 4 years as well. 

Josh is a gunslinger and is going to go long. The Dolphins had 8 men in the box on blitz the whole game with no deep safety help. So Josh said fine, I’ll throw to my 1:1s deep. 

This worked like a charm in the second half of the Patriots game. We had a lot of drops and mis connections in this game. 

So the Dolphins said “F it, we’re in this game let’s keep going with the same strategy.” They basically just went on a crazy full house Blitz every play and Josh countered with a bomb every play. 

Dorsey/Daboll/You wouldn’t be able to change much of what was going on in the field. 

Multiple times you can see Dorsey called a play where Diggs runs short and stays near the LoS. Diggs was wide wide wide open with no one near him. Josh wasn’t even trying to look short or look at the hot routes. He is like “fuck it I’m throwing it over those mountains”.

There is a shot that shows the 1st down marker on the field and for some reason the yellow marker is waaaay off on that play. It’s usually closer in my experience. 

If you watch the broadcast copy you can see an angle where you see where the yellow line starts on the field.

 Why did we think this game would be different than the other 2 ?

     2 ) The band was back and healthy. Morse, Poyer, Josh's elbow, Hyde ( altho DNP). Tre not on a pitch count. Beeze and Smoke adding firepower and wrinkles on the old (tired?)  Conversely Miami injuries X3.

    3) Home field, momentum ( I know he pitches tho) , Miami shakiness and team tumult.

    4). We see what the Bills can do when humming on all cylinders...how they can explode...on 3rd down, 4th quarter etc.

So thank God the professional athletes the Bills are,   weren't listening to us, or the oddsmakers...and respected Miami as a team individually as players ....and...had faith in themselves that bloodied tho they were,  and self inflicted wounds would not keep them from winning a 15 round bout.
