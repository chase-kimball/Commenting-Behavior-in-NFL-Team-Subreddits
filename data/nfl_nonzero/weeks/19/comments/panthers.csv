The definition of what makes a ""good"" QB prospect has expanded massively in the last 15 years...and Will Levis still doesn't fit that much broader definition.

The only real thing Levis has going for him is a loose comp to having similar physical tools to Josh Allen...who is arguably the most unexpected QB success story in modern football history. He made unprecedented improvements in his mechanics and processing ability in order to become who he is today. That's not the comp you want your potential #1 guy to have.

>32. Carolina Panthers  
  
It's not good for a rebuilding team to come in last when we list the value of the rookie classes in 2022, but here we are. It didn't help that the Panthers had no second-round pick, sending that to the Jets in the Sam Darnold trade. Almost all of Carolina's rookie value came from one man, first-round pick and starting left tackle Ikem Ekwonu. He was unspectacular (46th out of 63 qualifying tackles in PBWR, for example) but started every game and still has plenty of promise for growth. The only other rookie worth more than two Total Points in SIS metrics was undrafted running back Raheem Blackshear, who was useful as a receiver with 10 catches for 93 yards. Third-round quarterback Matt Corral was injured all season, and fourth-round linebacker Brandon Smith played only 5% of defensive snaps.",11.0,panthers,t3_10fbegy,False,0.0,Ice Up Son,2023-01-18T10:20:59Z,panthers,0.0068729865957211
