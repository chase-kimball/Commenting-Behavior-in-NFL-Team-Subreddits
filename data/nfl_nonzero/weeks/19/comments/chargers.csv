Hard to keep up the shameless positivity after that. But, I hope it was made clear Lombardi cannot stay. Staley sure, I‚Äôm cool with another year but I‚Äôm not confident in the man. 

Anywho, Without those 5 turnovers, Lombardi‚Äôs offense only scored 10 real offensive points. He had all season long to figure out a running plan that worked for this team, he failed. We lose Mike, and all of a sudden (*to nobody‚Äôs surprise*) the passing game gets condensed to a 10 yard box. And no, it wasn‚Äôt because we don‚Äôt have Slater, The OL gave Herbert space and time more than not. Discount injuries, Daboll ran his team into Minnesota and won. McDaniels almost beat the Bills in their stadium with a 3rd stringer. Harbaugh almost beat Cincy in their stadium with his backup. Good coaches get through injuries. Good coaches know how to make the best of the situation. Input Herbert into any of those teams and they‚Äôre Super Bowl favorites. 

I‚Äôve had some time to dwell on this, so it‚Äôs not a ‚Äú*wahh we need to fire somebody*‚Äù type of reaction. Staley did his job, he had his defense humming for 30 minutes. Does that excuse the inexcusable? No, what happened is a fireble offense. But, if he can get the right OC in here let‚Äôs roll with it. I‚Äôll give him the benefit of the doubt, because when he interviewed for this job, he had a plan for Herbert‚Äôs offense. He was cockblocked from hiring Kevin O‚ÄôConnel and Mike McDaniels. As a result, he had to go with the emergency plan: Lombardi. Two seasons guys :/ He‚Äôs had to two full seasons + a playoff game to give this team some sort of identity that isn‚Äôt just ‚Äú*Well if Herbert isn‚Äôt God on the field this offense looks shit*‚Äù.

That‚Äôs not sustained success. When the Patriots dynasty was picking from 28+ every season and still having to draft well to maintain that, that‚Äôs where it gets difficult. We can‚Äôt even get the sustained success to expose his deficits. Most guys who are routinely drafting top 20 don‚Äôt get such a massive sample size to keep drafting top 20 from. They get fired for failing. 

I agree that they are good picks. What I am not going to do is say that drafting Keenan Allen in 2013 is the reason Telesco should still have a job. That‚Äôs lunacy.

Wtf does this even mean. The Dolphins assembled that entire rest of the team by themselves. They messed up taking Tua over Herbert but that‚Äôs it. 

>Telesco has assembled some good rosters in his time, look at our roster this year. On paper that's a deep playoff roster, it's not all telescos fault we fuck things up like we did the other night. 

All of r/chargers was saying WR was an issue all last season. We need to add more WR talent. We need speed at WR. We need a deep threat to open up the passing game. Even Joe Lombardi came out and criticized our roster construction for limiting us in that way. Joe freaking Lombardi. At the trade deadline, everyone on r/chargers was clamoring for a WR.

5493,25556,25556,BoltGang17,"This part sums up the fuck ups from top to bottom so well:

>Herbert said after the game that offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi called an interior run with a ‚Äúkill‚Äù built in for this third down. The kill, or audible, was a jet sweep end around. All week, the Chargers had been practicing that jet sweep play with receiver DeAndre Carter as the handoff man, according to Herbert. Carter was already filling in for Mike Williams, who suffered a back fracture in the Chargers‚Äô meaningless Week 18 loss at the Broncos. At this stage of the second quarter, though, Carter was out of the game with an ankle injury, so Michael Bandy, a former undrafted free agent who started the season on the practice squad, was in at Carter‚Äôs spot.

>Herbert got to the line and saw a Jaguars front aligned to stop an interior run. Based on this look, Herbert killed the initial play, checking to the jet sweep. Herbert took the snap and turned to hand off to Bandy, who was running in motion from right to left. Bandy was not even looking for a handoff. He was not aware of the kill, Herbert said. They fumbled the exchange. Bandy recovered, but the Chargers were forced to punt. And Trevor Lawrence engineered a 53-yard touchdown drive on the ensuing possession to put the Jaguars on the scoreboard heading into the break.

>The jet sweep handoff call from Lombardi was an asinine decision in the first place, even if Carter had been in the game. The Chargers have run four jet sweeps to Carter this season. He has gained a combined -21 yards ‚Äî note the negative sign in front of that number ‚Äî on those four touches.

>Beyond that, Bandy playing meaningful snaps in a playoff game is an indictment of this entire organization. Bandy earned his practice squad spot with a fine training camp. And my intention is not to pile on a hard-working player who has made some meaningful contributions this season. But a team trying to win a Super Bowl has to do better.

I've only been following the team since 2011-2012 so I missed 2006, 2009 and the 2010 Specialest Team heartbreakers. I would put this on the top for losses or at least close to it. McCoy playoffs I knew going against Denver was an uphill battle. Lynn playoffs I knew going against Brady and the Patriots as depleted as they were was not gonna end well, so expectations were set. This time I had lot of hope that because all the pieces were there, all the games outcomes fell our way and they also won all the games they needed to win [the only big disadvantage I saw coming into the game was coaching](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/107my45/thoughts_on_wild_card_matchup/j3not9x/?context=3) so maybe they could be the last year Bengals: A team getting hot at the right time with an elite QB at the helm. I suppose this ended up being the Jags (for now).

 But the whole team fell apart. So I guess this takes the top for me. I rather they had lost normally on a hard fought game, or even a blowout like week 3. But no, they had to lose with a game for the history books. If you caught me in the game threads I was not even a bit confortable with the 27-0 lead, and was even less confortable once they scored to end the half. Our 2nd half perfomance had shown that everytime they let a team score before half that they almost end coming back most of the time. And then drives happened, and then Jax kept scoring, we did not, Dicker missed, Bosa had a meltdown.

Lombardi is gone. Staley, we will see. His job was secured before week 18, then he burned some after the Mike Will thing and then the only way he was out was if the playoffs were a disaster and that is exactly how it went. Telesco, I don't know enough about GMs but it is true that his numbers don't lie. I won't even touch the ownership stuff, that feels as set in stone as it is.

I'm not sold on Payton yet. We will see if that even ends up being a possibility and if it is what the price tag will be. Giving away a 1st and 2nd doesn't bode well for the chances to upgrade the offense/defense so even if Payton came in he would have to work with the same personnel.

I was not even sure or on board with firing Staley (Lombardi yes, Staley not so much) unless we loss in an embarrassing way but they managed to do it. And it wasn't a blowout loss, no. It was a 27-0 blown lead. It's even worse. So much worse.

Herbert had a pedestrian game. I still don't know what is it with the batted passes. If its because of the injuries and what not. But he didn't have a good game today.

The running game disappeared and was not only ineffective, but they kept running on the same side over and over and over...

The defense was aggresive and all over the place playing excellent during the first half. This disappeared during the 2nd completely. They looked lost, out of energy, they were jogging on some plays. Barely making contact. Where they scared about penalties?

Special teams was good but then during the 2nd half they also started to slip. Ball was getting returned for a lot more yards, the gunners didn't seem to be in place or even close to the returner most of the time. That Dicker miss...

Worst loss I've ever seen.

14549,85019,85019,LakeShowBoltUp,"How the Chargers can beat the Jaguars

**Take more deep ball shots off play-action.**

[Justin Herbert](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert) led all quarterbacks with 215 passing attempts off play-action in the regular season. His yards per attempt on those throws? Just 7.6, which ranked 23rd. Could we see an increase in schemed shot plays against this Jaguars secondary? This is an opportunity for offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and the Chargers to use max protection off play-action -- or boot Herbert to the edges -- with vertical reads in the pattern.

Plus, if wide receiver [Mike Williams](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045138/mike-williams) \-- who is [questionable with a back injury](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35413642/chargers-wr-mike-williams-back-expected-ready-jaguars) \-- is up for this game, Herbert could cut it loose down the field against a defense that gave up 25 receptions on throws of 20 or more air yards during the regular season, the 10th most in the league.

**Match** [**Derwin James**](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3691739/derwin-james-jr) **in coverage against** [**Evan Engram**](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051876/evan-engram)**.**

The Chargers played single-high man coverage on 40.1% of defensive snaps during the regular season, second most in the NFL. And given the route traits of the Jacksonville tight end -- and how he is used on quicks, unders and second-level throws to get him the ball with open grass to attack -- I want to see this matchup with James.

The Chargers safety has the lower-body agility and coverage skills to stick with Engram, who has been targeted at least eight times in three of his past five games. Limiting Engram is the best way for the Chargers to disrupt [Trevor Lawrence](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence) and the Jaguars' passing attack.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How the Jaguars can beat the Chargers

**Target the Chargers' sub-package fronts in the run game.**

Jaguars running back [Travis Etienne](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239996/travis-etienne-jr) has 99 carries for 615 yards out of 11 personnel (1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WR) this season. That's good for 6.2 yards per carry. And Etienne has 13 rushes of at least 10 yards in those three-wide receiver sets. Stretch it to the edges here on zone, get downhill or run one-back power to dig out some daylight for Etienne.

The matchup fits against a Chargers defense that surrendered 5.4 yards per carry against 11 personnel this season. Etienne had only seven carries in the [Week 18 win](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401437954) over the Titans. Expect that number to jump Saturday night.

**Find** [**Keenan Allen**](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15818/keenan-allen) **on third down.**

Jacksonville has to account for the Chargers receiver on third down when game-planning for this matchup. He's going to line up all over the field, in reduced formations and in the stack or bunch sets. And he'll be put in motion. Allen can win one-on-one due to his savvy route running traits, and Los Angeles will scheme for him to attack zone coverage with middle-of-the-field sit routes off the mesh concept, flood and levels.

Over his past four games, Allen has caught 10 of 13 targets on third downs, converting seven of those receptions for first downs. We know the Jags can go man heavy on third downs, playing Cover 1 on over 58% of coverage snaps in their past four games. Let's see if Jacksonville matches or travels with cornerbacks [Darious Williams](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239833/darious-williams) or [Tre Herndon](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122160/tre-herndon), and I would think about using bracket techniques here, too. The Jaguars can't allow Allen to get loose and make himself available to Herbert.

The Chargers played single-high man coverage on 40.1% of defensive snaps during the regular season, second most in the NFL. And given the route traits of the Jacksonville tight end -- and how he is used on quicks, unders and second-level throws to get him the ball with open grass to attack -- I want to see this matchup with James.

The Chargers safety has the lower-body agility and coverage skills to stick with Engram, who has been targeted at least eight times in three of his past five games. Limiting Engram is the best way for the Chargers to disrupt [Trevor Lawrence](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360310/trevor-lawrence) and the Jaguars' passing attack.",1.0,chargers,t3_10azl01,False,0.0,Felipe Rios,2023-01-13T11:05:27Z,chargers,0.0086544043747284

27880,155190,155190,TrueJP,"I need to take a break from last night...

So, let's talk about what you want to see in coordinator changes for next season.

I'll start...

I can't see Spanos firing Staley or Telesco... this offseason. I also can't see him paying for a proven coach like Payton. But, I can see us replacing Lombardi and MAYBE Hill.  Besides, I think Staley still owns the trust and faith of our locker room. His pregame gameplans and analysis are also consistently improving.

That said, I do think he needs an experienced hand to help manage in-game decisions. So, I'd like to see a former head coach added as a coordinator/Asst head coach. 

Best case, he learns and improves. Worst case, we have his successor in case he doesn't work out.

With that said, here is my list of names, ranked in order of preference:

OC

1. Frank Reich, former HC for Colts, QB Coach/OC for the Chargers, probably needs another OC job before he'll get interest as a HC again (perfect for what I described above), experience developing talented young QBs.

2. Pep Hamilton, Houston Texans offensive coordinator, XFL GM/head coach, QB coach for Herbert's offensive rookie of the year campaign.

3. Matt Weiss, Michigan Wolverines co-offensive coordinator, while he's not had HC experience, he's a SB champion with the Ravens in '12, instrumental in developing their record breaking run game in '18/'19, a wonky young dude who might work well with Stanley.

DC

1. Ronaldo Hill, feel like we need continuity here with how long it's taken the defense to begin gelling, also feels like he and Staley would both loose their jobs if either does

2. Vic Fangio, former NFL defensive coordinator and head coach, if we don't get Reich and decide to replace Hill, this is the obvious choice, needs a DC job before he'll get any interest as a HC, Staley runs HIS defense, who better to handle mid-game adjustments than the guy who invented your scheme

3. Brian Flores, Steelers Senior defensive assistant & linebackers coach, former MIA HC, always felt the MIA defense played hard for him, MIA did him dirty and he deserves another shot.

4. Sean Desai, Chicago Associate head coach & defensive assistant, history with Stanley in Chicago, no HC experience, up and coming defensive mind, gamble, unproven

27882,155192,155192,TrueJP,"None of what you said is wrong. But, if you've watched as much Chargers football as I think you have, you know that Herbert is a robot who precisely executes whatever gamelan he's given. To date, this is the most damning indictment he's earned. 

It was clear Staley was trying to run out the clock beginning with that last drive of the second half with the cushion our DBs started using. Felt like Lombardi was calling the same game, albeit poorly. 

Herbert DID miss a couple throws. But, that endzone miss to Keenan looked to me like one of his throwaways (right at the outside edge of catchable for the wr but impossible for the DB). Low throws have a low probability of being intercepted. In all, it seemed like someone told him to protect the ball, especially after halftime, e.g. go out and try not to lose. The whole team looked like that in the 2nd half 

To me, that's why this is coaching and not on the players or Herbert. The players proved they could dominate in the first half. Staley proved this too with his first half gamelan. But he blinked too early and underestimated a hungry Jags team and SB winning coach.

All of the QBs you listed have at least one of either superior weapons or scheme/coaching. If we ever had these, we didn't use them in the 2nd half.

But, you're right that Herbert's got to start going a little rogue sometimes like these other QBs. Sometimes the scheme sucks or the play breaks down.
