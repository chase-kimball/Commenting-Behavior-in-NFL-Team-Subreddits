I didn’t dislike Danny, he seems impossible to hate for no reason. He’s a like-able guy even from afar. 

But I think we all came into this season with our doubts he was the man (is he damaged beyond repair from shitty coaches and too many coaching changes? Can he learn to go through progressions? Can he take care of the ball? Etc.), and our hopes he’d be great (we’ve seen some flashes of excellence so maybe these coaches can develop DJ into his best self like DaBoll did with Allen and Kafka did with Mahomes?). 

And don’t lie — No one in here was saying “hands down he’s gonna be great.” 

And as the season advanced we all watched him steadily improve. And now we are all like “yeah that’s our fucking QB.”

There would be a triangular field. The end zones would now be the size of an NHL goal net to compensate for the smaller angle. There would also be a 12th player on each team called the serpent. If he tackles you, you're considered ""poisoned"", and thus ejected after two more plays. The only way to avoid this fate after your envenomation is to find the ""antidote"", which would be scoring a touchdown in the tiny ass end zone.


In conclusion, three-team football would be a mix of hockey, football, and three-player chess from the big bang theory.

I don't think he was ever top 3 (outside of the 2011 season) but he also never had teams nearly as good as Bradshaw did and still won two Superbowls. 

Thinking back on it, the only other HoF player Eli ever crossed paths with was Strahan at the tail end of his career while Bradshaw played with Mel Blount, Mean Joe Greene, Jack Ham, Franco Harris, Lynn Swann, John Stallworth, etc. all in the prime of their respective careers. I'm probably even forgetting some names tbh, but suffice to say that Bradshaw commandeered a stacked team while Eli found lightening in a bottle twice and won with a great coached team that wasn't necessarily super talented.

Herbert is an elite QB because of his ability to play the position and his statistical excellence. He also does have 13 GWD since the start of his career, which is tied for 3rd-most in the league.

Also let’s also remember last year’s “gotta-have-it” game saw one of the most insane fourth quarter appearances of all time with Herbert vs the Raiders. If his coach wasn’t a moron, they would’ve been in the playoffs. 

But it’s probably for the better actually because now they will fire Staley and Lombardi and (hopefully) give Herbert some competent coaching. 

The one “flaw” in Herbert’s game is that he plays within the system he is given. He is not a big-time
freelancer like an Allen or Mahomes or a Roethlisberger. He reads the field like Tom Brady (the way he pings through his progressions) except with a better arm. So when you have a mediocre OC like Lombardi calling your plays you are screwed. 

This is the same problem Stafford had in Detroit. He had Lombardi as his OC and it was not good. I still remember at the beginning of the season all the Detroit fans saying to watch out for this guy.  Herbert is more talented to the point where he has broken into that elite tier, but with him he needs/wants structure and therefore needs to be provided with a really good OC/offensive-minded HC to maximize his talents to an even greater level.",1.0,nfl,t3_10cmrt5,False,1.0,:Giants: Giants,2023-01-15T10:28:28Z,nygiants,0.0702155888170496

- DJ was near flawless all game. His passes were ridiculously accurate and he was decisive and smart with the football. DJ was easily the top QB of all QBs that have played this weekend

- Saquon was efficient and ran hard. I like that we were able to pull off the W with Saquon only getting 9 carries

- DJ and Saquon is the best rushing tandem in the league right now. It’s electric

- SHOUTOUT TO HODGINS THE DUDE IS BALLING. I can see him as our WR2 next season.

- Thibs got held so many times last night and refs didn’t call shit for him.

- We game planned for JJ really well. Dude was bracketed all night to take away his big play ability. However, we seemed to just not plan for Hockenson at all.

Reese was pretty good at keeping us away from cap hell up until he ended up in desperation mode in 2016 and bought an entire defense. He managed the player contracts side of things decently, but was straight ass at drafting because he concerned himself with workout measurables. Literally every first rounder he called in from 2009 onward was a raw athletic freak in college. (Nicks, JPP, Prince, Wilson, Pugh, OBJ, Flowers, Apple, Engram). In the lower rounds, you also saw a lot of even more raw athletes like Marvin Austin and Adrien Robinson. Whether the pick was a hit or a bust was entirely dependent on whether or not the player could learn to play football at a pro level. It also explains why so few of them got signed to second contracts.

Gettleman was the exact opposite. His draft picks are panning out for the most part (the one major exception being DeAndre Baker).
