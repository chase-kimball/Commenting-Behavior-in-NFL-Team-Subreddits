So you have to look at the player. Derek carr, who I am still a fan of, Regressed under McDaniels.  And it has nothing to do with coaching, scheme, playcalling, talent at receiver or the line.

Say what now? You want to not go after Brady and chase a playoff appearance, but if they have the greatest off season in the lifetime of most Raiders fans and don't jinx it by *trying*, they're going to use reverse psychology on the league to make the playoffs? This is the nonsense we're spitting out as a fan base now? 

Things can turn around quick in the NFL and we've all seen many examples. However, those things don't tend to happen with dysfunctional organizations and coaches who aren't innovative. McDaniels has never tailored his offense to his personnel as a HC. We've seen the Patriots do it while he was there, but he didn't do it in Denver and he hasn't done it in Vegas. 

As of today, Chase Garbers is the QB. If you don't want them to sign Brady and load up for a run with the SB at home next season, I am not here to tell you you're wrong. I am here to tell you that if they don't, they will likely be worse in the 2023 and McDaniels probably loses his job. I don't think he wants that and regardless of what Davis has said publicly, if they don't look like a team that's going to win 10+ games out of the gate next year, his seat is going to be nuclear. 

The program has been installed and next season is go time. Yes, they're going to continue building, but McDaniels doesn't have the cachet that Gruden had to survive a true rebuild.

The only other option to get a QB actually better than Carr is if Rodgers wants out of GB, we could theoretically trade Carr and a couple picks to GB for Rodgers.

I don't necessarily agree with some of the conclusions though.  A few examples in no particular order:



Passing time under 2.5 sec is attributed to RZ.  RZ is certainly more likely to be under 2.5 than a midfield play, but you know what else does?  Missed blocks.  Pressures.  Quick slants (by my eye test we probably run those the fewest this year than any other year since the Joe Bugel year, and certainly far less than a WCO).  


Don't get me wrong, I have no doubt that the RZ stats will be terrible.  I don't have any qualms about shitting on it, just don't agree that passing time under 2.5 should be equated with RZ.



Stat difference between halves.  There are many ways to spin this.  Let's say a guy is better in the 1st.  You can say he's great at playing with a lead, keeps scoring, etc.  Or you can also say that they choke when they're behind, not clutch etc.  Very different narrative for the same thing.  If a guy is better in the second half you can spin it as a slow starter, garbage time  stat padding, let's the game get away early and has to play catchup at the end.  Or you can say that they're clutch and they turn it on with the game on the line. Again, very different narrative for the same thing.




Second half collapses.  Average ToP is attributed 100% to the O.  There's two sides to ToP.  O needs long drives and D needs short drives. One or both of those got worse in the 2nd half but we don't have data on that.  I don't agree with arbitrarily choosing one side to blame without data to back it up.  Ideally we would see per drive averages on splits for O and D.  I have no doubt that both got worse, but not sure how much worse each got. FWIW, on a per drive basis the O was 2nd in ToP while the D was 25th.  But PFR doesn't have that broken down by half.



I'll add one last thought to ToP per drive.  I don't think the O can average 2nd in the league if they have huge collapses in the second half of the games.  I don't think the D would be ranked 28th if they were killing it in the 2nd half. I don't have definitive data, but it's hard to imagine a scenario where the per drive averages don't show the D performing significantly worse than the O in 2nd half ToP.",2.0,raiders,t3_10btsv4,False,0.0,:projector:,2023-01-14T13:08:32Z,raiders,-0.017827617463826

26639,203903,203903,_taugrim_,">As someone who lived through all of this, i can unequivocally say that this is an EXCELLENT breakdown of how our history has played out.

I have much better visibility starting around the Gruden hire.

I was a kid when the Raiders beat the Skins in the SB. Was glad to see it, even though I lived in VA, because the Skins were loaded with arrogant pricks.

After college, I moved to SF, and in 1999 became a diehard Raiders fan after attending the 45-0 blowout of TB. I loved the energy of the fanbase and it was fun rooting for the Silver & Black.

I had real hope after back-to-back 8-8 seasons that Gruden had the team going in the right direction. He was, but after the Tuck Rule game, it was clear that Al's ego was going to lead to a bad outcome. It can be argued that for 1 season Callahan opened up the offense, but long term we would have been better off had Al not traded Gruden.

**What was most frustrating for me was watching Al stubbornly stick to outdated habits in drafting and personnel decisions**. He over-drafted for measurables, instead of balancing that with football ability, and we had bad miss after bad miss as a result. Too many scholarship players. The teams that have consistently excelled (BAL, PIT, NE) draft well consistently.

What's ridiculous is that the picks I advocated for pre-draft (and I've posted them over the years on various forums, Twitter, and more recently here) have vastly out-performed what Al and then what McKenzie did. And I'm just a fan using common sense.

Mark's one big victory was Allegiant Stadium, but aside from that, he's failed in terms of hiring the right football leadership on a consistent basis. While I greatly hope McD+Zieg pan out, McD does so many things that are the hallmarks of a bad leader.",3.0,raiders,t3_10b12hd,False,0.0,:28:,2023-01-14T14:34:42Z,raiders,-0.0068878918430529

If we’re talking QB as in taking snaps at QB, Lamar is obviously very good. A lot of times when the passing option isn’t there, him moving around either opens it up or means he can run himself. 

Lamar is an elite athlete. He can do things that probably nobody else can do. He can make any throw and he’s absolutely electric when he’s running himself. HOWEVER Lamar isn’t the best at making reads or adjustments. And that’s fine. He’s clearly been very successful without it. But just athletic ability isn’t going to lead to sustained success. That’s exactly why a guy like Russell Wilson fell off like he did (granted I think he’s going to do better next year). If you rely too much on your athleticism you’re going to struggle when you don’t have it anymore. 

There’s a reason why QBs like Brees, Rodgers, Manning and Brady were so successful for so long, even when they were really up there in age. Because they understand football, they understand what they need to do to put the defense in a spot where they can exploit them. 

I think it’s an overstatement to say that Lamar wouldn’t be successful elsewhere, but the organization definitely needs to embrace who and what Lamar is and what he brings to the table if they want to be successful.

First you have to actually find a QB talented enough to play that long; certainly not easy.

Then you have to be able to develop them, because few people come out of college playing like Herbert or Burrow. 

Then you have to be able to acquire talent to put around them to put them in a position to succeed; Carr has a lot of flaws, but he can make work with subpar receivers. He doesn’t have the highest upside, but he has a pretty decent floor 90% of the time.

You gotta throw it earlier to make sure the ball arrives in that tiny little window.  That means your redzone passing offense is limited to jump balls or check downs, which aren’t that successful in most cases.  His hesitancy to use his legs also doesn’t help either.
