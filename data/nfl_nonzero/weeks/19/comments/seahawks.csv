If they end up using the non-exclusive Franchise Tag on Geno (\~$32M), that's essentially just a wash for team spending at the QB position.  If they do sign him to a contract, then the Franchise Tag sets the ceiling for the contract negotiations, so expect $30M or less average per year.

The non-exclusive franchise tag for the QB position going into 2023 will be around **$32M**.  Franchise Tag is always used as the max amount (per year) in contract negotiations. [https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cba/franchise-tag/](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cba/franchise-tag/)

6465,50641,50641,CustardAffectionate6,"*FINALLY* a thread! Thank you, mods.

**Without Trades**:

1. **Pick 1.5:** Will Anderson Jr (Edge, Alabama): Arizona surprises everyone and takes Myles Murphy at #3, allowing Anderson to fall to #5. 
2. **Pick 1.20**: O'Cyrus Torrence (OG, Florida): Hawks get a day 1 starter to replace Gabe Jackson, who's been/will be released. A mean interior run blocker with a fairly high floor and even higher ceiling. 
3. **Pick 2.37:** Siaki Ika (NT, Baylor): A 360lb natural nose tackle. A rotational player to help relieve Al Woods, becoming an everyday starter in year two.
4. **Pick 2.51:** Jack Campbell (LB, Iowa): A violent wrap-up tackler with a knack for sniffing out runs and misdirections, with sideline-to-sideline speed. Adds immediate depth with the ability to displace Barton/Muse as the starter, with the eventual return of Brooks midseason.
5. **Pick 3.83**: Tyrique Stevenson (CB, Miami): A strong and long corner with great ball skills -- Pete can't pass him up in the 3rd round.
6. **Pick 4.122**: Zach Evans (RB, Ole Miss): More criticism incoming to the Hawks FO for drafting a RB only one year after taking Walker II in the 2nd round. Evans is a powerful runner between the tackles with great burst -- a deadly 1-2 punch to relieve Walker.
7. **Pick 5.152:** Rashad Torrence II (S, Florida): The second ""Torrence"" from Florida taken in this draft. Torrence is an athletic, physical safety with great instincts. 
8. **Pick 5.155**: Henry To'oTo'o (LB, Alabama): An athletic inside linebacker who excels in zone coverage. 
9. **Pick 6.195**: Ricky Stromberg (C, Arkansas): A high IQ center and nasty run blocker. Stromberg will surprise many due to his productivity as a 6th round pick, while also frustrating the fan base with his below-average pass protection.

**With Trades**: 

1. **Pick 1.5**: With CJ Stroud still being available at Pick #5, the Seahawks trade Pick #5 to Carolina for picks #9, #39, and #114. John Schneider surprises nobody, picking up a 2nd and a 4th rd pick to move back 4 spots.
2. **Pick 1.9**: Tyree Wilson (DL, Texas Tech): At 6'6/275lbs, Wilson becomes a day 1 starter at the DE position in year 2 of the Hawks 3-4 defense, immediately improving *both* the pass rush as well as the run defense. 
3. **Pick 1.20**: O'Cyrus Torrence (OG, Florida): Hawks get a day 1 starter to replace Gabe Jackson, who's been/will be released. A mean interior run blocker with a fairly high floor and even higher ceiling. 
4. **Pick 1.37**: BJ Ojulari (Edge, LSU): A well-rounded Edge who can get after the passer and set the edge on the run.
5. **Pick 1.39**: Drew Sanders (LB, Arkansas): An instinctual pass rusher who also excels in zone coverage, with the versatility to play both inside and outside.
6. **Pick 1.51**: JL Skinner (S, Boise State): Reminiscent of Bam Bam with his 6'4/220lb frame, and room to put on weight without losing athleticism. Pete Carrol gets an enforcer as a depth piece, with Adams' ability to stay healthy in question.
7. **Pick 3.83**: Jaquelin Roy (DT, LSU): A powerful NT with the strength and quickness to demand a double team.
8. **Pick 4.114**: Kendre Miller (RB, TCU): A powerful runner between the tackles and strong pass protector with great hands and receiving ability -- the Hawks new 3rd down back to spell Walker.
9. **Pick 4.122**: Zacch Pickens (DT, South Carolina): Another athletic interior D lineman who can anchor against the run. With Al Woods entering the last year of his contract at 36 years old, and with Poona on his way out, Seattle solves for their future while addressing two of their biggest weakness entering this draft -- pass rush and run defense.
10. **Pick 5.152**: Dontayvion Wicks (WR, Virginia): With good size, strong hands, and elite acceleration, Wicks adds some much-needed depth to the receiver room.
11. **Pick 5.155**: Julius Brents (CB, Kansas State): A 6'4 corner in the 5th round. Pete does what Pete does.
12. **Pick 6.195**: Javion Cohen (OG, Alabama): An athletically-gifted guard with room to clean up his technique.",2.0,seahawks,t3_10d9bh7,False,0.0,:sea1:​,2023-01-17T15:01:12Z,seahawks,0.0073072727538285

As a player, he’s a safety that’s mediocre in coverage and doesn’t seem to elevate the secondary as a group the way Earl or Kam did. And I essentially consider the sack stuff useless for a safety. Not because it is all the time, but because come playoffs you’ll be seeing top QBs, and your top QBs usually feast on blitzes. (Also, if you need to use it to the extent we did 2? years ago, it means you’re using a safety to compensate for a shit pass rush).

All that said, he would have been extremely helpful this year, since our corners could more or less stand on their own and he’s pretty good at coming into the box and stopping the run.

I just get tired of the Geno hype and the idea he is worth a large contract when people can't seem to put 2 and 2 together. A HOF QB leaves and immediately falls off a cliff and a career backup starts and has a pro bowl season.

What is more likely Russ completely lost it and Geno is all of the sudden a really good QB, or we have great coaching and great system when executed properly? Like look at SF they were able to win despite multiple injuries and with a 3rd string rookie QB.

Minshew has had constantly good numbers mostly on shitty teams and I think he could get to the next level here. But people will say he is garbage and Geno is way better. But they seem to be the same people who said Geno is garbage before this season and we would be lost without Russ.

We aren't good to be lost without Geno either. I mean franchise him for next season for stability if you have to but he shouldn't be the long term solution. Especially with the draft capital we have.

So why wouldn't they give him a smaller incentive rich muti year deal to start if he was part of the plan? You know you aren't drafting a QB (last draft) and Lock is going to be a FA too.
