6522,77208,77208,Kimber80,"Sure.

Well for clutch, performing on the biggest stage, IMO Montana was the best at that. He was perfect in SBs, 4-0, and he was spectacular in all of them. His PR in all four is just amazing. Even though Brady has played very well overall in his ten Super Bowls, he has lost three of them, and IMO came extremely close to losing two more, games that were basically out of his hands and control. Montana never committed a turnover, INT or fumble, in the SB. IMO, some of Brady's ""clutchest"" moments in the SB involved him recovering from  his own earlier major mistakes, like the pick-six vs the Falcons. Brady also threw INTs vs the Panthers and the Seahawks that are among the ugliest  picks I've seen thrown in the past 20 SBs. To someone who grew up watching (and ""hating"" Montana and his 49ers) I just saw him be too perfect in SBs too many times to imagine him losing any out of 10, much less 3. So to me, Montana is easily the best/greatest Super Bowl QB. which to me is the peak of clutch.

IIRC, Brady's  best PR in 10 SB games is not as good as Montana's \*average\* PR across his four games. Brady's peak is less than Montana's average, and Brady has played some great Super Bowls. That is just mind-bogglingly clutch to me, moreso than Brady, who has IMO been great in some SBs but far from it in others.

As far as ""best"",  I distinguish ""best"" from ""greatest"", I agree that Brady is the GOAT, which to me is about overall achievements, and IMO, his enormous pile of achievements , both in terms of stats and winning, and both regular season and post season, are just unassailable.

But I think Montana was better. To me, Brady's unassailable pile advantage is significantly a product of longevity. When both had played 13-14 years in the league, Montana IMO had better achievements both regular season and post-season. Montana was injured at that point and never the same, while Brady - to his great credit - just kept going, since his 15th season, he's won four more Super Bowls and added another huge pile of stats to his resume.

Heck, back in either 2014 or 2015, IIRC Brady predicted in one of those ""deflategate"" emails that the last chapter of his rivalry with  Peyton Manning would be him playing long after Manning was gone, and he has indeed done just that. Manning beat Brady 3-1 in AFC title games and 3-2 in playoff games overall while they were competing, but then Manning couldn't go any more and Brady just kept on going, racking up more wins. We've just never seen anything like his longevity, and he might well win SB #8 this year.

But it's like, IDK, imagine Brady retires next year at 47 with 7 SB wins.  Then 20 years from now, some other QB has 5 SB wins at age 47, but then thanks to more improvements in health and nutrition, and guts and physical durability, plays 10 more years, to age 57, and wins 4 more SBs to end up with 9. I'd call him the GOAT over Brady, but I would tell others that Brady was better.

The O never got into a rhythm all season. But I think roster construction, bad drafting played a huge part. Some players..especially in the secondary just showed that they ain’t NFL players. Brain drain was huge. Two big examples being Kevin O’Connell going to Vikings and our secondary coach Ejiro Evero (went to Denver as their defensive coordinator and is now getting head coach looks) it’s clear that McVay was unhappy with the shuffling/new additions on his staff. Difficult schedule too! Also had some inconsistent play from usually consistent players..Havenstein and Ramsey coming to mind. Just a total breakdown of a franchise.

15418,151396,151396,VastAmphibian,"gut feeling says halftime adjustments are a thing. broadcasters throw that word around all the time. the team is all together and there is this big chunk of time when the game is on pause. of course you would use it for addressing major changes that need to happen for the second half.


but if you think about it, it doesn't quite make sense. halftime starts as soon as the clock hits zero. however the teams are still on the field when this happens. they have to walk back to their locker rooms. that's a couple minutes, meaning returning to the field is also a couple minutes. they need to loosen up to play when they return for 3Q. if you account for all that, the length of time that the players are back inside the locker room is only a little over 5 minutes. to validate this point, and as you have said, former nfl players like peyton and eli say that during halftime, they use the bathroom, hydrate, maybe eat something, and next thing you know it's already time to go back out there. they simply do not have the time to have this grand half time adjustment meeting that everyone is imagining to happen.

The 2nd game being in the AFC Championship when the Chiefs were up 21-3? (or at least I think that was the score?) going into halftime and all the sudden Patrick Mahomes magically forgets how to play the quarterback position for the first time in hIs NFL career. 

And then finally the 3rd game this season when the Chiefs were driving down to score and win the game and Travis Kelce fumbles. 

Now don’t get me wrong, the Bengals obviously won all 3 of those games, and they deserve credit for that. I’m just saying, the Chiefs were clearly the better team in all 3 of those matchups, and I believe they’re currently a much better team than the Bengals are, with or without their 3 recently injured offensive linemen.

We're like ""dude, we know this story well. Please google 'NFC Championship Game, Saints/Rams', as an example""

As a fan who still to this day harbors ill-will about the non-facemask on Goff on the drive right ***before*** the non-DPI Saints drive, I've learned over the years that, I can personally hold my own opinions of that game and how it went down....while still acknowledging we received the benefit of one of the league's biggest officiating gaffes of all time. 

By shutting up about the ""well, y'all got the benefit of bad calls your way too!"" with Saints fans in the years since, some Saints fans have even been kind enough to say ""...yeah the zebras fucked us, but damn if Payton's playcalling couldn't have still won us that game if he hadn't gone so pass-happy after that blown call!""

The same with us Rams fans in this one: both things can co-exist.

33710,277511,277511,txyesboy,"Here's the thing. Take this from a fan of a fan base that benefited from one of the biggest officiating gaffes in NFL history with playoff implications.

1. You're **not** entirely wrong; but the impact of the officiating gaffes in the game's waning moments will always be seen as the most egregious.


2. We had a truly legitimate call not go our way in the NFC Championship game literally on the drive before the ill-fated Saints final where the Rams should've been called for DPI that all but would've guaranteed the Saints as NFC Champs. The missed facemask on a Goff slide at the Saints 4 yard line would've netted us a 1st and goal, and we would've been ***up*** by 4 rather than having to settle for a tie. That missed DPI on the Saints final drive gets called, Saints score a TD, go up on us by 3....just like they did when ***they*** had to settle with a FG, and we still have time to kick the game winning FG to send it to OT anyway...exactly as it went down.....


3......but nobodies' gonna want to hear that, and nobody will remember that, either. We felt convinced (same as you do) that we're in the right to raise concern #2 above to justify why we shouldn't feel bad about the completely obvious missed DPI against us. 


4. But it changes nothing. 


So the point is; just be cool with the win; regardless of how it happened, because no one is going to ever be able to take that away from y'all. Moreover, people will be more chill with you if you don't go out of your way to take offense to it and try to justify why it ""wasn't so bad"".

We'd been a shitty team again since the downfall of the Greatest Show on Turf in the early 2000's until Snead built this team up/McVay's arrival. One of the few ""luxuries"" of being a shitty team for a long time is, the amount of ridiculous ""insider news"" about your team is almost nothing, because nobody cares. So the last few off seasons of ""the bill has come due on the mortgaging of this team's future"" (after 2018 season SB loss, after 2019 missing the playoffs, after 2020 McVay/Goff falling out rumors) have been odd for us to get used to. 

I mean, I get it; it's a rare feat that a team that just won 5 games after winning the SB should be considered ""fine"" for 2023; but every situation every season is different. 2022 was just a wash, and before Halloween we basically packed it all in to make another run for 2023. 2022 was just auditions for the few starting positions that our outgoing starters are vacating at this point.

But all these folks out here are victims of an oversaturated media blitz that threw the Rams in their face for 5 years with the false narrative that ""any minute now"" the house of cards this team built by mortgaging their future by trading all their draft picks away is imminent....and because we had a shitty record due to raising the white flag on this season about week 6 or 7 due to the injuries must surely mean the media narrative has finally come true. 

But no; because the media falsely built this narrative about us all the way back to 2018 of our imminent demise coupled with us having a bad year = surely *we're* the crazy ones for providing fair assessments of why 2022 sucked for us and why 2023 won't.

But then again, when we *are* competitive in 2023, I'm trying to determine what the media's narrative will be, then?

33722,277528,277528,txyesboy,"But see that's the problem the media has overblown all of this. Stafford has made it emphatically clear that he intends to play next year. And despite all of the stories out there saying McVay is somehow considering leaving - he never once said last off-season or this off-season that he definitively was thinking about leaving to take a job on TV or anything of that nature. Most of us Rams fans have already known that McVay is not leaving this off-season; it's just a product of manufactured drama from the media.

Sure enough, within the hour, it's already being reported that McVay intends on coaching the Rams in 2023.

Once the team fell to .500 in October, playing fourth and fifth string OL it was pretty much a forgotten inclusion but nothing that took place in 2022 for the Rams was going to matter as to how well we would look in 2023. 

It's not just blind optimism; minus 1-2 people (Whitworth, etc) this is the same team that won the SB in 2021. And with not returning OBJ or Von Miller, they've been replaced with ARob and Wagner in theory. It's negligible how much they vary production-wise (and aren't ""apples to apples"" comparisons to each other anyway) but taking everything that took place on the field in 2022 with the Rams as a sign of how good/bad we'll be - when 1/3 of these 4th/5th stringers will almost never see the field very often again for us, isn't a good barometer.

What I'm also saying is - i'm not speaking with rose colored glasses; this team *will* see a precipitous drop in 2024; just in the simple fact that this is when Donald will finally retire.

And yet 2021 happened.

We got spit roasted with injuries at a rate we couldn't sustain remaining competitive. Also, the bulk of our star players we will rely on on 2023 that got hurt with injuries that would normally not have been season-ending, became season-ending to ensure they can be fully restored health for 2023.

We don't have any critical free agent losses this off-season we can't live without, as many of them have suitable replacements that have already been subbing in at their positions already; freeing up much needed cap relief. Also, except for no #1 pick, we have our #2, #3, will get comp picks, and have a boatload of 5th, 6th, 7th rd picks.
