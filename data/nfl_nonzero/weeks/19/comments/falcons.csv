 Pickett was the most pro ready of the QBs he lived up to that. He was thrown into the thick of it and was asked to do the most he has shown he can be a serviceable starting QB in the NFL.

Ridder was next up in line with being pro ready he knows how to run an NFL offense and has the intangibles but he has to work on his throwing mechanics and accuracy. He was given the best chance to succeed and showed improvement with every game. He did not show enough to say he is anymore than a backup yet.

Willis had a great build, speed, and arm strength but is all raw talent that needs a lot of grooming and even that may not be enough. He was not asked to do much and only really showed off his legs as being effective.

Purdy is propped up by a good system, coaching, and a strong team around him. I would have to watch more film of him to make a fair assessment.

He’s the only owner in the history of the Super Bowl to have his team not trail for an entire 60 minutes, and when the clock hit triple zeroes, but lose the game. Imagine that. 

MBS has been abysmal at home attendance, not to mention the transplant nature of our area where we get outdone by Cowboys or Steelers or whoever else’s fans for home games. 

He needs to back up the PSL costs and winning does that, along with having dynamic players people want to see.

There’s a reason Josh Allen, and Brady, and Mahomes, and Lamar, and Herbert have top selling jerseys. The QB is the face of your franchise and when you have a winning one, business is booming. 

The Bucs last night had a ton of Bucs fans for a home game against the Cowboys. Next year, I doubt they out number a team like Dallas or Pittsburgh because Brady is done there. 

Star power at QB determines your franchise’s trajectory, your sales, your GM and HC’s employment. 

I don’t think AS survives for much longer with “oh we had old Ryan, and Mariota, and I’ll just see what Ridder can become” when the odds of a later round QB succeeding is insanely low. 

I like Ridder. I just don’t think we have the time to see if he pans out and the likelihood he does is not in our favor.

They didn’t really cement Ridder as the starter and I have a feeling that the first phase being completed meant escaping Ryan’s contract, surviving a year with Mariota or Ridder, who may end up as a bridge himself to someone else, adding big receivers like Pitts and London, and a HB1 like Allgeier. 

But my feeling is the second phase means having the resources and money to chase a QB, who I think they feel is more important than slowly building this team up.

I think the offense scored something like 10 points when the drive was preceded by a JAX kick off/punt.  And 20 points when the drive was preceded by a JAX turnover.  The Chargers offense was not great.  They were gifted points all first half by the defense and special teams.  And when JAX cleaned up their offense and stopped coughing up the ball, the Chargers offense went to sleep.  Only 3 points in the second half.  I don't think its too much to ask an offense to score 1 TD in a half of football.  If your offense can't do that then its not playing well.

My general philosophy when it comes to these big blown leads is that it's a team effort because they only happen if the defense and offense both stall out at the same time. I think this one is a bit different though because the defense did so well in the first half and was the main reason the lead was so big to begin with.
