But, of the 5 coaches that are last in their division, havent made the playoffs in 2 years, and also called plays at some point in the season, 3 of them were fired. (60%)

But i dont see why that's relevant. You can cherry pick any stat to make anything look good/bad, but when you start making your comparisons so convoluted, your point becomes extremely spurious.

Like i could say: *Every Michigan backup quarterback drafted in the 7 round draft era has made at least 15 pro bowls. Therefore, you should only draft backup Michigan quarterbacks.*

The point is that calling plays isnt uncommon. It used to be uncommon, but now it isnt. It is part of a philosophical shift in the thinking of NFL organizations. Whether a coach calls plays or not doesnt affect team success in any way. And if the coach calling the plays is good at calling plays, you keep him at that position. 

Some of the best teams in the league have coaches that call plays. Some of the worst teams in the league have coaches that call plays. Sometimes coaches give up play calling, it seemed to work for the Eagles this year. It didnt work for the Broncos. There isnt a conclusion to be made anywhere.

It is true, that the league doesnt care if a player has off field issues.
Even the saga about Watson was primarily virtue signalling, which seems to have been effective.

Just think for a second why we dont hear about Mixon or Carman? What about the Kamara situation? AP and Tyreek Hill beat their own kids. AB was accused of sexual assault and even threatened the victim on social media, yet nobody cared when he signed with TB shortly after.
I mean Michael Irvin literally tried to kill a teammate and is in the HoF and nobody cares.

The league took a public stand for very easy PR against Watson, while letting all these other assholes off scot free. 

So yes, the league doesnt care.

Steve Keim, ex GM of the cards said it best when he said that if Hannibal Lecter ran a 4.3 they would say he had an eating disorder.

>Tua is going to do everything in his power to make sure he gets at least one payday.

That being said those are off the field issues.

Tua's situation is connected to the thing that could seriously threaten the future of the league, which is concerns about the safety of the sport.
