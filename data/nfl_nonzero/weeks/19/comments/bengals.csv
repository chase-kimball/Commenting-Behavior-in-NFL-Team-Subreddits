What bit the Chargers in the ass is the fact that they left too much time for the Jaguars to play football. The reason the Chargers couldn’t burn more clock is because they don’t have a running back that can run it up the middle for 3 to 4 yards consistently. They don’t really have access to the most efficient way to burn clock. Obviously Austin Ekeler is a good player, but what the Chargers really need is like a true power running back.

This is honestly something that the Bengals have managed to do well. There have been several occasions this year where the Bengals have had like nine-minute drives because they managed to run the football well and weren’t constantly stopping the clock.

Drafted Burrow with the number 1 pick and then the following year drafted his receiver and then we get new uniforms and then we win the AFC North and then we won the AFC and then we make it to the Super Bowl and then we rename the stadium for enough money to re-sign Burrow and Chase, get an indoor practice facility, and then we win the AFC North again and then we do better than we did last season not having a Super Bowl hangover grabbing the 3 seed. 

And let's not even start getting into the details of how the Blackburn's have completely changed social media perspective with Cincinnati. And let's get into all the free agents we signed that have completely helped this team to a literal 180° turn.

Our DEs and CBs have some of the best run defense metrics in the league. Our LBs are among the best in pass coverage. Everyone tackles well. That makes our defense incredibly versatile, and it enables us to change our defensive scheme on the fly. And what is the Bengals D known for? In-game adjustments. Strong second halves.

Again, I don't want to take too much credit from Lou, because I think he's been great. And maybe this is all pre-emptive copium for if/when he's given a HC gig.

“The woman tried to roll up her window but Tirico reached in the car and attempted to wedge his hand in between her thighs. The two apparently saw each other at work the following day and the woman expected him to apologize, which he didn’t, instead telling her that “all I did all day was think about you.”


In a separate incident involving another female producer, one who’d been out to dinner with Mike Tirico and his fiancee (and future wife), Tirico sent her an e-mail telling her that he wanted to sleep with her. The two were later part of a group of staff members that went to a bar following ESPN’s coverage of the NCAA Tournament, at which point Tirico approached the woman and said, “I wish I was single. If I were, I’d throw you on the table right here and f— your brains out.”


The woman tried to dismiss him as just being drunk but things got even worse. As she was driving home, a car came speeding up next to hers on the interstate and it was Mike Tirico, who was waving his hand out the window as if to tell her to pull over. She sped up to escape but Tirico sped up as well. She eventually slammed on the brakes and veered toward an exit.”",14.0,bengals,t3_10dzjp4,False,0.0, ,2023-01-16T20:18:14Z,bengals,0.00501559163121
