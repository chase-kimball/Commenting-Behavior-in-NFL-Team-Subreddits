It's such a weird contract as the cost to move on keeps going up each year due to those option bonuses. So if the Packers want to move on from Rodgers this seems like it would be the year due to the unique guarantees he has in the contract. If they don't want to move on they are pretty much locked to him through 2026.

The Packers NEED an upgrade at TE. Tonyan might not be back and Lewis might retire leaving Davis as the only true in-line TE with any experience. TEs take a few years to round into form, but Mayer can come in and contribute right away with his blocking (which is absolutely necessary in this offense), which from what I've read of him is solid. Once/if Mayer reaches his potential, he will be a great for a young QB, whether it's Love or another QB, as good TEs often server as large-target security blankets in this league.
