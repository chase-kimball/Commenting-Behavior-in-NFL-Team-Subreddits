And if the Colts went 8-0 down the stretch instead of 1-7, Jim Irsay would have been a football f’n savant for hiring Jeff Saturday.

I don’t think speculation based on a hypothetical situation is a very productive or useful exercise.

We didn’t make the playoffs. Todd Downing didn’t keep his job. Why get upset or stressed out over an outcome that didn’t happen?

The rumors that Downing was getting fired started leaking from Ken Moore *before* the game against Jacksonville in Week 18, so do we even know the speculation based on a hypothetical to be substantive? Two different OCs on playoff teams were fired today, could Downing not have been a third had we got bounced in the Wild Card round?

And the fact that four different assistant coaches got fired, this was a staff house cleaning project that doesn’t seem like it could have been entirely contingent on one Week 18 win and playoff berth. It’s not like Downing was singled out, Carter was canned too. Vrabel and the FO were clearly unhappy with the offensive staff, I don’t think 8-9 or 9-8 instead of 7-10 was going to change that.

I feel too often here it’s being conflated that Vrabel not firing Downing mid-season is an indication he didn’t want to fire him at all. Do we know that to be the case? The one firm thing we know is that, yes, he die in fact fire Downing literally the day after the season ended. Just because you as a fan want a coordinator fired during the season does not mean it’s a reasonable or rational thing for an actual franchise to do. *Two* coordinators were fired during the season this year, and they both occurred a week before or immediately concurrent with the HC also being fired. It’s not normal procedure to make staff changes mid-season, even for the worst teams every season.

Ossenfort and Robinson have extremely similar backgrounds as Patriots scouts through-and-through.

If ownership did not like Robinson's vision for the future of the team, they likely would not like Ossenfort's vision either because it's probably pretty darn similar. It would be pretty underwhelming to move on from a GM and replace him with the same exact kind of guy in Ossenfort that was only here for the worst years of Robinson's tenure as far as the direction of the roster and drafting goes.

Cowden may be an in-house guy that's been in the building longer than Ossenfort, but has a completely different background as Cowden got most of his early experience under Marty Hurney in Carolina. They likely have different philosophies because of this, even if Cowden worked under Robinson longer.

So you want somebody other than Todd Downing....to do exactly what Todd Downing was doing? And you would want them fired for doing that too, right? You want the waterboy calling plays by the end of the season? There would literally be no difference in the season if Todd Downing got fired on December 17th or waiting until January 9th like they did. You can't just fire people willy-nilly like that, there's a reason it's pretty rare for coaches to get fired during the season lol. A grand total of 2 coordinators were fired this year during the season, and both were fired at the same time the head coach was or within a week of the head coach being fired.

And yes, firing an OC is more impactful than firing a GM when it occurs during the season. The OC that is responsible for calling plays during games, installing the gameplan each week, being at practice every day, scouting future opponents, being in meeting rooms with players all day, etc. The GMs job is pretty limited during the season when it comes to day-to-day operations. Of course the GM is more impactful on the direction of the team at a macro level, but you'll notice an impact on the team more directly during the season by firing a coordinator than firing the GM.

You want him to go up to the podium after a game and say, ""Yeah, playcalling was ass brother, we gotta get this bum out of here soon."" 

I'm sure there was internal criticism of Downing that wasn't aired publicly, including the fact he was *fired* immediately following the season. There wasn't any real benefit to firing Downing in December compared to January, nobody was making an offense with as many injuries and as little talent that much better by calling plays in Todd's stead.

In December Vrabel said: 

""We’re not going to make any coaching changes during the season. Those are things that I evaluate at the end of the season. I see what’s being taught. I have the luxury of going into each and every room. I hear what’s being coached. I hear the details. I hear the design of each and every play. So, that’s not something that I’m going to be doing right now. But again, we’ll evaluate everything at the end of the season and go from there.” 

And he did evaluate. And Downing got fired. That's not criticism? And I'm pretty sure he criticized the offense during the season at press conferences. He at least wasn't saying they were doing great or anything lol.

How many teams, good or bad, are firing coordinators during the season? Are they model franchises you want to be emulating? I think it's fine to not make any mid-season changes given the circumstances this year. What's the benefit? Would Tim Kelly have done any better than Todd Downing at calling plays for Joshua Dobbs to run with two of the worst tackles in the league and two back-ups on the o-line in front of him?

And what criticism did Vrabel air publicly about Robinson? Other than the quote after the KC game about not having anyone to throw to, when has he been outwardly critical of the roster construction?

Oh, you don't know? Just like the rest of us? Damn that's crazy how you can immediately declare that Bowen is going to suck and all hope is lost then.

There's definitely a difference in the 2020 Bowen that was calling plays for the first time and wasn't even DC in title compared to the Bowen that's been calling plays for three years now and is actually on the sideline each week.

Nevermind that 9 of the 11 defensive starters from Week 1 in 2020 are no longer on the roster and probably 80% of the personnel has changed, and maybe that was the biggest problem facing that awful defense in 2020.

It's definitely a loss for Schwartz to depart, but c'mon with acting like you know exactly how much this is going to impact the team 8 months before they play another game lol. Don't even watch the games then jesus fucking christ.

Schwartz wasn't on the field calling plays in 2021 or 2022. The Titans could have hired him to be DC in either one of those years and have him just call the plays if that's what they wanted to do, but they didn't. I'm sure Schwartz would have been happy to have the job and stay in Nashville if he's willing to take a DC job in Cleveland, but he wasn't offered it.

Do we even know if Schwartz was in the building every week drawing up the gameplan with the rest of the staff? Or was he on a consultant schedule and providing insight when needed. How much more wisdom can he impart on our current staff after two years if he's not the one actually running the defense? How much more is there for them to learn about his scheme if it's not the scheme they're actually running and instead they're just taking elements of it.

If Schwartz were as hands on and actually the guy pulling the ""play good defense"" lever every week like you suggest, why didn't the Titans make any effort to just make him the DC instead?

Here’s my comment on it from then:

“One thing that I couldn’t help but notice watching that Packers team, just how awful the body language on their players is and how piss poor their effort could be sometimes. Receivers jogging on routes, nobody hurrying to the line, it almost looks like some of those guys don’t want to be on the field. Obviously it’s a top-down thing there, when the guy getting paid the most money in league history is doing that shit I can’t blame the rest of the team for thinking this shit doesn’t matter too. They were coming off a huge win, at home on a short week against one of the most injured teams in the league, their season was pretty much on the line and some guys looked like they couldn’t be bothered. Even the fans look like they hate their team too, they seem just as tired with it. Down 2 scores with under 5 minutes remaining and no timeouts left, and there was absolutely no sense of urgency in their offense. That team in Green Bay is a team in dire need of a spark or a shake up, just something to give them some life because the win against Dallas just four days ago seems like it was just a mirage.”

I respect Rodgers and just how talented he is and everything that comes with that, but goddamn could there be a worse player to bring into a locker room now? One thing goes wrong and that guy bails on his team and looks like he couldn’t give less of a fuck.

Say what you want about Tannehill, but when his teammates have let him down in the past you could hardly tell. He doesn’t pout. He doesn’t go on McAfee’s show every week to bitch and moan. He earns respect and gives respect. Rodgers just brings a circus of nonchalance.

I want no part of the 2022 Rodgers. Maybe he can pick it up in a better situation, but are we a better situation offensively than what he had this year? No way lol.

And that doesn’t even begin to explain just how much Vrabel and this version of Rodgers seem to be opposites. You know how quick Vrabel would get sick of Rodgers’ shit? I have zero faith the two of them could co-exist for any stretch of time.",34.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10bdna6,False,0.0,11,2023-01-13T21:16:04Z,tennesseetitans,0.0191102943977389

You got your wish, Downing will never call a play for the Titans again. What difference does it make that it happened on January 9th instead of December 19th? Who gives a shit lmao?

Do you think Tim Kelly calling plays for Malik Willis and Josh Dobbs would have given us a better chance to win than Downing? Would it have gone better than when Kelly called plays for the Texans in 2021 and got 4 wins with Davis Mills and Tyrod Taylor?

The roster and injuries would have limited any playcaller, I think it's probably unfair to not just let Downing ride out his shitty hand here and force some other poor sap like Kelly to scheme up a gameplan that gets ruined by Dennis Daley letting an outside linebacker get a free shot on the QB before he can even finish his drop 4 times a game.

When could they have even fired him? When they were 7-3 after the Green Bay game to prevent the 0-7 skid? Who fires coaches when they're 7-3? Firing Robinson at 7-5 is different since he's not on the staff gameplanning week-to-week and his job comes more into play during the off-season, so it's not one-to-one. Is it going to set a good example to the league and potential new OCs for 2023 that they can get fired when the team is 7-3 or 7-5? Even if the offense was shit through most of those games, I'm sure it would leave a sour taste in anyone's mouth that we might want to bring in for next year.

I'll just say it once again, you got what you wanted so who gives a shit that it happened a couple weeks later? I don't want to cape for Todd Downing because I also think he's a shitty OC, but goddamn some of you act like there's a long-list of other coordinators that could have done better with a rookie QB that's only capable of running a rinky-dink RPO offense and got benched for a practice squad QB, two of the five worst starting tackles in the NFL, the worst receiver group in the league, the smallest guard in the league, and by the end of the season an o-line that had lost it's two best players. Who's scheming up the plays that can win with that group??

I don't think Downing should have been kept for 2023, far from it, but what would the point of firing him in December have been? How much better could the offense have possibly gotten with the players we had by the end of the season if there was a different guy calling plays?

HOWEVER even on draft day there was some concern that against stronger NFL caliber opponents he wouldn't do as well and may need to be kicked toward the guard position... something which ultimately ended up happening as he just doesn't have the arm strength required for the LT position.

On Paper, Dillon Radunz was 6'6"" - 34inch arms, coming in just shy of 300lbs.

For comparison Peter Skoronski is 6'4"" - 32"" 2/8 inch arms, coming in at 315lbs.

Broderick Jones is 6'4"" - 32"" arms (approx), coming in at 310 lbs.

This is why both Peter Skoronski and Broderick Jones are projected as either RT's or guards at the NFL level (sure you try both at LT but neither are likely to stick) as they don't even match up well length wise vs someone like Radunz who himself is at most a guy you can throw in as a relief LT but not someone you want playing the game there.

For a true LT's build you need to look at Paris Johnson Jr 6'6"" - 35"" 6/8 inch arms, coming in at 310... those are ideal measurements for the position which combined for his talent in the role and his speed (2nd fastest of the 4 names listed so far) makes it more or less guaranteed he's a LT at the NFL level.

Now if you'd like additional options for a true LT in the draft (that might be there in the 2nd round)  Anton Harrison is 6'5"", 34"" arms (approx), coming in at 315lbs, he has a decent shot of becoming a LT at the NFL level, however he is also only really good at pass pro and not much of a run blocker... however he ends a lot of plays on his backside and doesn't have the strongest arms and needs works on his technique. (he would probably be a superior option for a pass heavy team that needs a backup LT that can develop into a starter)

A better late option for us IMO would be taking Dawand Jones who is 6'8"", with massive 36""1/8 inch arms, and weights 360lbs. He played mostly RT but on the occasions he played LT he was excellent at it and honestly I believe has a better build for LT than RT... However when you have a player like Paris Johnson on your team a strong LT base gets pushed to RT for the guy that has Immediate impact and skill at the role. He'll take some time, but i'd be willing to bet he's easily an improvement over Daley and overall wouldn't be a bad ""cheaper"" option draft cap wise.",10.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10c2xwb,False,0.0,"""BIG Jeff"" Simmons",2023-01-14T17:54:15Z,tennesseetitans,0.0713355336658277

I'm not worried about next years cap as with all those moves we'd still end up with around 140 million in the black (which granted we would have to reup players with besides simmons... but Simmons' deal should be unaffected from that point on as he essentially gets first dibs.",6.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10aosnx,False,0.0,"""BIG Jeff"" Simmons",2023-01-13T02:44:37Z,tennesseetitans,0.1184

Cutting Dupree, Woods, Lewan, and Zach + adding DHop leaves us with 2.3 million in the black (which isn't enough to sign rookie contracts as you want around 5 ish million). The easiest compromise then is to postmark the trade to after the June 1st deadline and right before cutting Dupree also on a post June 1st cut. That leaves us with around 8.7 million in cap... or about 3 million to go into the season with once the rookies are paid.

All of this assumes we aren't going to trade for DHop and then cut Tanne which would be... an odd move to say the least.

(Also, this is not a move I personally would do as I don't believe we are in our superbowl window even with a magical draft where every player we are likely to pick is a generational talent... we might be next year if that happened... but not likely their rookie year and not without an upgrade at QB).",17.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10aosnx,False,0.0,"""BIG Jeff"" Simmons",2023-01-13T02:32:32Z,tennesseetitans,0.0215980127327899

31140,168591,168591,WhiteXHysteria,"I think vrabel, and the OCs we have had, recognize the talent issue on offense. 

We have a QB who can sling it but doesn't elevate anyone and has trouble diagnosing blitzes and reading defenses in real time. Great anticipation thrower, but if he doesn't have ultimate trust in a WR he stares them down and doesn't move through his progressions very well. 

We have an elite RB.

WR1 has shown promise and everyone else is JAG. 

Chig has shown massive promise as a receiver but the rest of his game needs a lot of work so he has to get limited snaps. Hoop showed some flashes once he settled into a new team, but that took a couple of months. 

The OL is a disaster all the way across making any sort of  real offensive gameplan difficult to pull off without a Qb who can read defenses and handle protections at an elite level and get through their progressions at an elite level once the ball is snapped. Hesitating for a quarter of a second on the first read to see if they will be open means a sack.

Some context. We allowed 49 sacks this year while having injuries at all 5 positions on the line. 

In 2019 the Bucs allowed 47 sacks. They got an elite QB with 0 mobility and dropped to 22 sacks(21 on Brady) and won the super bowl. 

In 2007 the patriots allowed  21 sacks. 

In 2008 the Pats lost brady in game 1. They ended up allowing 48 sacks.

In 2009 Brady was back and he was sacked 16 time(Hoyer added 2 more sacks). 

Keep in mind, all the pre-2021 stats had a full game less. 

A good QB can be game-changing for the OL. For all that  Tannehill is good at, he is not great at dissecting a defense at the line. He is not good at calling out protection and all. That is why Ben Jones has handled that job. Tannehill also is sub par at feeling and evading pressure. Obviously, Malik doesn't do the line any favors either. 

Brady could step in here with 5 Dennis Daley's and not hit 40 sacks, maybe not even 30. He is about as good as QBs get at knowing what the defense is doing at the line. Allegedly, Bryce Young is elite at this as well but I've not watched him and the NFL is a different beast than college.

When you get a QB like Brady you get a guy who will see exactly how the defense is planning to attack and can make adjustments at the line to counteract that, whether that is keeping a man in to help protect or whether it is changing a route for a player to be hot. Something we almost never see anyone do here.

Go look at the offensive line sack ranks for Brady's teams. The 07 and 09 pats were top 5 fewest. The 08 pats without him were bottom 5. The bucs before him were roughly bottom 10 and immediately jumped to top 5 when he came in. 

His football IQ makes a massive difference. 

Tanny can run but he's pretty mediocre in terms of reading a defense. He stares down receivers and doesn't feel the pressure well. 

Brady is possibly the best ever, right with Peyton, at being able to know exactly what the defense is going to do at the line. 

He sees it and makes changes at the line to either move protection or change routes to take advantage. He doesn't need to run. 

He's played with some shit teams throughout his time and made it work on his ability to break down a defense while making any generic slot receiver a god from his quick passes.

31182,168638,168638,WhiteXHysteria,"Nah. Brady is way smarter than that.

I don't think we should even bring him in but he can read a defense and protect himself as well as anyone. 

Someone able to break down the defense at the line can make a big difference to the blocking.

Purdy is the real unicorn this year, except he is in a known QB friendly system. So it is hard to judge him because we all know Jimmy G is pretty mid and he does fimne in that system too.

Ridder is the only guy at this point I would say is actually backup level from what I have seen. 

Skylar is real bad even with Tyreek and Waddle, which we have neither. Plus their line is better than ours. 

You can go way back through a mountain of my comments and I said before the season that Malik shouldn't even be our backup option. As in maybe he comes in in relief or during an injury but should not start. 

Matt Corral couldn't get a start in a dreadful QB room. Chris Olakodun didn't even make a roster, so he is by default the worst QB of the draft for now.

Overall, there are many years of history to show that QBs drafted in the 3rd are generally very bad. Yes there is small list of exceptions but it doesn't make Malik worse just because Russ slipped further than he should have or because Tom Brady exists. We don't fault Skylar Thompson for not being Brady, we understand Brady is an outlier and an exception. Same with Russ. You generally don't even include outliers when creating reasonable expectations because they will skew the data to make your expectations unrealistic.",3.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10ar9ob,False,0.0,300 to link?,2023-01-13T08:18:12Z,tennesseetitans,0.0156286033782939
31222,168683,168683,WhiteXHysteria,"Okay? Purdy is in the known most QB friendly system in the NFL and maybe Zappe is a unicorn. 

It doesn't change the expectation that historically 3rd round QBs are like 1 actual hit. Maybe 2 other guys you'd be okay with filling in, and a whole bunch of dudes similar to malik.

Small project QBs with boom/bust potential go high. Guys like Allen and Mahomes. Guys who are deemed day 1 starters typically go #1 overall. 

The 3rd round is where you start to see massive projects picked. Guys like Davis Webb, Davis Mills, Kellen Mond, Will Grier, Mason Rudolph, Cody Kessler, Garrett Grayson, Sean Mannion, and yes, Russell Wilson(the real unicorn of the group). Plus others I have likely forgotten from making this same type of comment since last April. They basically all fall into the first group.

> Last year I heard from a lot of people that he interviewed with, how well he did. He is very qualified, and I think he'll be a great partner to Vrabes. I know Vrabes well, and that's such an important relationship – the head coach/GM one. Having each other's back and having the respect of each other is so critical because you are leading that organization together. … I think it's a great fit with (Ran and Mike), because the first part of any relationship is there is a mutual respect, and I know they'll have that. And I think the loyalty – they are both very loyal people and I think they'll have each other's back. And that's the thing – you're going to have your hits and you're going to have your misses but if you stay with it through all of those you have a chance and I believe strongly knowing the two of them that they will be a really good fit.

I don’t want to be too cynical but Bieniemy’s been a hot HC name for years now. unless he just doesn’t want to be a HC I only see a couple options here -

1. he’s been told he needs to call plays first to have a shot at HC somewhere, so we’re looking at another Lafleur situation

Purdy’s looked fine. good, even, at some points. so did Mullens and Beathard. Lance will be good in this offense too. he’s barely played
