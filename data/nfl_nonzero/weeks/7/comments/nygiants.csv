1. Coaching. In the 4th quarter they never make mistakes and they always take advantage of other teams‚Äô mistakes. The offensive scheme is fantastic, it‚Äôs unreal how often you see complete bum WRs like Slayton, James and Sills somehow running open on crossers. They have allowed Jones to be a 1 read and run QB, which is huge because he has always struggled going through progressions. Defensively, Wink has done a great job dialing up pressure to get stops late in games.

2. Luck. Basically every win has been by a razor‚Äôs edge. Beat Titans by 1 because they missed a relatively easy FG to win it. Beat the Panthers by 3 because they lost 2 fumbles and dropped what would‚Äôve been the easiest pick-6 of the season. Beat the Ravens because Lamar dropped the snap on 3rd and 6. Beat the Jaguars by literally half a yard, after a blocked FG somehow still went in. The amount of breaks they‚Äôre getting is crazy, it‚Äôs amazing to watch.
