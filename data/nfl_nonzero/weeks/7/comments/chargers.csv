I mean his efficiency stats are other worldly as well so idk what to tell you my guy. And also you're only furthering the point that Herbert has to do EVERYTHING for the team to win games because his defense and coaching stinks out loud. It's impossible to ask your QB to consistently win games when your defense gives up 27 points per game.

> In 2019 they went 5-11 after going 2-9 in one-score games. The season before that they were a playoff team, going 12-4. My point is they had several of the same key pieces that led to more success before they drafted Herbert and did make the playoffs.

The 2018 Chargers were 4 years ago. That's forever ago in NFL terms. New coach, scheme, players. It's literally impossible to compare them. Also that team was 6-1 in one score games so maybe they weren't as good as their record? 

> My point here is that you can't blame injuries for the chargers. There were other more injured teams that still had success, which is why that's a faulty argument to begin with.

They were 5-11 the year before they drafted Herbert. Hence why they were picking 6th overall.

The bad news is that we lost a lot of people today that will probably miss quite a bit some time.

Herbert is still dealing with the ribs but now he has a limited snap count Allen and a WR group that consists on his WR3 becoming WR1 and two practice squad guys. 

JC Jackson's loss was brutal, contract aside, you don't want guy trying to get their shit together simply drop out of the field because of something out of their control. Non-contact injuries are scary. And even worse was seeing Williams ankle get twisted like that. 

Defense plays well. They ball most of the time. But the amount of Almost-Ints is getting absurd. It means they are in position and they are well coached to get to the position to make the plays but are absolutely not executing anything. The Run D has barely improved.

I expect some wins here and there but expectations are low. I won't even touch on the coaching staff. It's already tough enough seeing the players play like this and go down like flies.",18.0,nfl,t3_ybwlh3,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-10-23T19:02:31Z,chargers,0.0506690729645877

>I will say I didn't expect him to start of this bad but it will eventually get better. Like Gilmore at the beginning of 2017 after we gave him a shit ton of money wasn't good, the defense was giving up 400+ yards a game and i remember specifically in week 4 Hightower had a sack that would have forced the Panthers to punt but Gilmore gave up a face mask and the Panthers proceeded to drive down the field and kick the game winner and we lost 33-30. Gilmore lost us the game and at the time I was very low on him

&#x200B;

>Look at when Gilmore first got here. Dude was complete dogshit the first several weeks and everyone wanted him fired into the sun. They changed up their scheme to better suit his skillset and he ended up becoming the best CB in the league.

&#x200B;

>Gilmore looked like an overpay his first 8 or so games in NE, then was lockdown for the rest of that season and 1st team all pro the next season

&#x200B;

>All I can say is when we signed Steph Gilmore, he wasn’t great the first 3-4 weeks while we were playing zone

 

>When Gilmore was signed a lot of patriots fans were concerned after the first couple games, sometimes it takes a bit to adjust to a new team

34962,199450,199450,costopule,"Death by 1000 cuts. 

It started with the Chiefs game. 

They didn’t take Gerald Everett out when he was gassed and calling for it, leading to a 99 yard pick six when we were tied 17-17. Now down 7, we start by throwing away a drive with playcalling, and then the Herbert injury drive that went nowhere. 

We at first thought it might’ve been like the other couple of times he looked hurt in his career, only to miss a play or two before coming back in, so maybe he’s fine. 

Chiefs promptly pull off a 52 yard rush on their first play, then we’re called for a facemask, and our defense holds them out of the end zone, but we ushered them to our 18 yard line for free in 2 plays and they get the easy FG to make it a 10 point game with 3 minutes to play. Game is already lost here. With Justin Herbert’s status questionable, and the fact that we need like a 30 second touchdown, a prompt 3 and out, and another 30 second touchdown, it’s best to take Herbert out at this point. 

Sure, Herbert want to go back. Okay we’ll grant him that because he has earned the right to make that choice if it seems like he’s fine. 3 passes to RBs later, it’s 2:12 left in the game and Herbert is so clearly hurt that he doesn’t even try to run the ball for the easy first down and throws it away. This is where you take out the QB regardless of how he feels. 

Prompt hero ball from Herbert to keep the drive alive, but it’s too late as that took us to the 2 minute warning down 10. We get the TD on 4th down, followed by a failed onside kick and the Chiefs kneel out the game. 

We leave the game wondering if we’ll see Herbert again, also knowing that we blew it on defense and our offensive playcalling did fuck all to help us. 

Look at all our games after that and you’ll see we make dozens of bad decisions, our offense is plagued by terrible playcalls, and our defense is invisible in key portions of games. You can only defend this for so long. Yes, injuries have fucked us, yes we’ve had bad luck on some of our turnovers, yes there’s been some questionable officiating in many of our games, no, that shouldn’t mean we look this terrible.

I have given Staley the benefit of the doubt time after time, but when this stuff happens time after time, he loses the benefit of the doubt. Ekeler and Herbert have willed this team to 4 wins, and that won’t keep happening. Our defense is also only 4 guys, Derwin, who’s been great but also has had some key errors, Callahan, who has been an unsung hero for us, Mack, who is holding down the defensive front with Bosa out and others on the DL rarely making impact plays, and Tranquill, who disappears at times. 

I don’t think the season is lost but it takes time to turn it around, and we’re all out of time after the bye and ATL game. We’ll see if this staff and this squad has what it takes, but we recognize that if this season finishes looking how it looked through the first half of the season, we do not want to do the same thing again next year and will welcome a coaching change.",30.0,chargers,t3_ye1htr,False,0.0,Austin Ekeler Fan Club President,2022-10-26T12:18:34Z,chargers,0.0243613683486449

There’s nuances in these situations, and the doomers are dooming while the rest of us are still staying positive and want to still give our guys a shot to turn it around. 

The way I see it, Staley has this season to prove he should stay. Part of that is the decision to remove people who are issues from the organization.

Just imagine how filthy Herbert to Jefferson would be. And don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love Keenan and he is one of my all time favorite players, but getting a player of Jefferson’s caliber would take Hebert’s game to a new level. I feel like It would be the equivalent to what Diggs did for Allen and it would transform him into a completely different player. Our offense would be unstoppable.
