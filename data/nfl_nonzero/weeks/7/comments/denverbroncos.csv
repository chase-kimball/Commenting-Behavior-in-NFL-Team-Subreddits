If our offense was struggling, I’d be one of the people defending him and saying “it’s only his first year!” and convincing other fans to be patient. But our offense isn’t struggling, it’s completely lifeless. It has no identity, it has no strengths, and it’s completely lacking in any direction whatsoever. And Hackett is an offensive-minded coach, so if any area of our game should be thriving, that’s it.  

Paton seems like a smart man so far and doesn’t appear to fall victim to sunk cost.
