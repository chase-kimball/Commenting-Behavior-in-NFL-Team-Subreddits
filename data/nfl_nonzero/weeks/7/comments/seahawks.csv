8640,64833,64833,Esuu,"To add to your point, QBs who have left the league or regressed since 2018(passer rating/ANY/A rank):

* Brees(1st/3rd)
* Wilson(3rd/7th)
* Ryan(4th/5th)
* Rivers(5th/4th)
* Watson(6th/13th)
* Wentz(7th/12th)
* Fitzpatrick(9th/3rd)
* Luck(11th/11th)
* Dak(14th/19th)
* Big Ben(15th/9th)
* Trubs(16th/16th)
* Cam(17th/21st)
* Baker(19th/14th)

And this is ignoring Rodgers/Brady because while they're both not playing to the level of the previous few years 2018 was actually a bit of a ""down"" year for both. If you add them that's 15 of the top 20 QBs.

I also have Watson and Dak on there since neither have really played this season.

That's a lot of talent to replace in 5 years. While guys like Mahomes, Allen, Jackson, Herbert, Hurts, and Burrow have all shown they're likely to be among the next generation of great QBs that still likely isn't enough to replace all of the lost talent over the past fews years and next few years.

It makes a lot of sense when you look at the drafts between Rodgers(2005) and Dak(2016) or Mahomes(2017). Out of those, the only franchise level QBs to come out were Cutler, Ryan, Flacco, Stafford, Cam, Dalton, Wilson, Luck, Cousins, Tannehill, and Carr. Three of those players are already out of the league two are now backups and Ryan, Stafford, and Wilson all looking a bit washed. Cousins, Tannehill, and Carr, while fine QBs, aren't exactly HoFers/borderline HoFers like we're losing.

The same thing happened about 20 years ago. There was a talent gap between the Montana/Marino/Elway/Young/etc. era, and the Manning/Brady/Brees/Rodgers/etc. era. If you go look at the late 90s/early 00s passing leaders you have a few great players then just a bunch of alright/good players or one off seasons. It's actually pretty wild to go look at some of the pro-bowl QBs from around '99 to '03. Instead of a cadre of future HoFers it's a bunch of ""Oh yeah, he was good for a few years there"" type of guys.

We're now experiencing that same talent gap between the Manning etc. era and the Mahomes/Allen/Jackson/etc. era. It won't play out exactly the same but it isn't surprising that there's a lack of QB talent now that the last great QB generation is almost fully out of the league and the next hasn't completely formed yet. It's been a little weird due to the longevity of some of the great QBs so there may be a smoother transition, but I expect this year and at least next year to be seasons where we're constantly wondering why QBs seem to kind of suck, something we haven't really had to deal with for almost 20 years.",3.0,nfl,t3_y948jt,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-10-21T14:09:02Z,seahawks,-0.0197946737985718

He was able to move on from his personal feelings and make the move that was best for the team.   Russ wanted more agency then we were willing to give and trading him would give the best outcome for both parties

Not only that, but they were able to fucking NAIL that 2022 Draft Class (at least so far).   Both of them deserve credit for that, it wasn't a sole Pete thing or a sole John thing

35585,315988,315988,spacedude2000,"The worst part of this is I really don't think Russ is as horrible as this year is making him out to be. Sure he has missed some guys and regressed physically but still, he can't get anything going in terms of rhythm - love him or hate him, that is unsual. We've seen Russ stall at many points during his games with the hawks, but typically he has been able to adapt and that hasn't happened yet. 



I think Pete had Russ on the best ""leash"" you could design. His ability to playmake on the looks that Pete could create was incredible. Hackett either is unable to design it that way, doesn't have the personnel, or he simply lacks any control of the game (strategically speaking). It may be all of the above. 



Truly, I don't know what the Broncos ownership was doing with Hackett. He hasn't tried to emulate any of Pete Carroll's offensive ideology, what gave Russ success: Improvisation. Railroading him into an offense that has no cohesion with his play style is a recipe for failure.",3.0,nfl,t3_ybued4,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-10-24T03:42:46Z,seahawks,-0.06027001051695

You might not agree with all his positions but that is totally fine, he does not shy away from debate and actively encourages it in his chat. He will back his positions up with a deep knowledge of the game, fairly extensive knowledge of this franchise and can talk Mariners too. 

His chat is *so good* other teams fans hang out and talk shop.  His channel has more than doubled its subs since the Russ trade so I know some of you out there have joined the community since then.
