As much as the Bucs needing to play a game the previous week helped my Rams, I still, in theory, believe that it was better with 2 byes. Not so much because the 2 deserves it so much more than the 3, but because *just* the 1-seed having such a huge advantage over everyone, when their margin of separation is often not much, seems unfair to me.
