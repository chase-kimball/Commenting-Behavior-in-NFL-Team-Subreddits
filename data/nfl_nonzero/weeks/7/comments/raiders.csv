Pickett doesnt have elite rushing ability like danny dimes, lamar, allen, lance, etc. Doesnt have the elite arm talent like allen, mahomes, herbert, lawrence, etc. Not the prototypical qb size. His accuracy is okay at best and he has awful awareness.

Hes going to join the long list of 1st round bust and will eventually end up on the panthers",-1.0,nfl,t3_yc0uvf,False,1.0,:Raiders: Raiders,2022-10-23T22:45:47Z,raiders,0.0446251017093658
