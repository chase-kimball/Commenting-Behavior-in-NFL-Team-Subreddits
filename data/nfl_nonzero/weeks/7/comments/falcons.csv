You have to remember that we changed both our GM and coach in the 21 offseason.  They basically inherited an aging, declining QB with the worst contract in the league  and no succession plan in place.  My theory is that the new regime was not happy with Ryan at QB but that it was the least bad option.  I don't remember all the specifics (and I'm not a cap expert to begin with) but I believe Ryan's cap hit was way worse last offseason than this offseason.  It was harder to justify moving on from him back then.  

But we do know this for a fact:

1. They kicked the tires on both Lance and Fields prior to the 21 draft.  Rumor was that they really liked Lance but the 49ers jumped the line.  Apparently, they didn't like Fields so it is what it is.
2. Arthur Smith's offense is radically different this year than it was last year.  It is way more run heavy.  Given that his claim to fame is unlocking Derrick Henry then I think its safe to say that this year's offense is closer to his preferred offense than last year's.  I believe he adapted his offense to play to Matt Ryan's strengths last year and that wasn't an idea situation for him.

Because of this I think its plausible that internally the Falcons had already decided to move on from Ryan but hadn't made their intentions obvious.  Then Watson basically fell in their laps. IIRC Watson's people reached out to the Falcons and expressed interest and we were frontrunners to sign him until Cleveland offered the crazy contract.  Once that happened, it became de facto public that the FO was looking to move on from Ryan.  Of course, Ryan wanted out after that so they put the plan in motion.",14.0,nfl,t3_ycko6d,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-10-24T17:58:20Z,falcons,3.1257777244812235e-05
