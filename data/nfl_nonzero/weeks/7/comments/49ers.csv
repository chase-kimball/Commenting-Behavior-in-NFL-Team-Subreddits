26604,178307,178307,ToePunchKick,"> Which technically they did according to draft value.

We don't actually know that, and that may not be true at all in fact. Because if the Niners finish as a playoff team, then the valuation very well may fall short of 1st round value.

If the Niners finish with the 25th pick slot:

2nd round pick (58): 330 pts  
3rd round pick (84): 145 pts  
4th round pick (128*): 44 pts

(*: estimated pick position based on a projection of seven 3rd round compensatory picks being awarded. Could move a slot or two in either direction.)

That's 519 pts, which is equal to about 38th overall. 

Obviously, there's a 5th round pick a year later still in play. But with an average value around 33 pts, that still wouldn't be enough to get to pick #32 value (590 pts). And that's not factoring in that, from value comparisons, a future year pick is considered worth one round less than a current year pick, so we really should be talking a 6th round pick's average value of around 20 pts.

And if the Niners finish *better* than the 25th slot, then things drop sharply. With last year's finish in the 29th slot, then we're looking at (292 + 128 + 40) = 460 pts before the 5th rounder, and now we're firmly in mid 2nd round territory.

So, if the Niners make it to the divisional round or better, then no, Carolina doesn't get 1st round value. And if the Niners are only slightly worse than that, they *maybe* they get ass-end-of-the-1st value.

To really get solid 1st round value, they need the Niners to miss the playoffs, and preferably not be that close.

(I'm futzing around at work so I'm only about 88% confident in the math and exactness of the pick projections. Apologies if I fudged in one direction or another.)",8.0,49ers,t3_ya0d0v,False,0.0,:helmet2: 49ers,2022-10-21T18:35:36Z,49ers,0.0020253921226766

35515,235446,235446,ezioauditore00789,"Jimmy has strengths, and his quick release makes him suitable against the blitz and pressure; his strength works perfect for Shanahan's offense. Even-though PFF metrics state Jimmy is not good against Pressure, I had not seen many QBs playing better when their starting tackles were out outside of Jimmy. Kyle likes his QB to throw middle, but things get dicey when Jimmy turns over the ball a lot; when a play is not there, he forces into a  tight window or misses to read the underneath LB or robber safety. Kyle wants Jimmy G to get rid of the ball sometimes; he has mentioned in many interviews best play is to throw the ball away. 

Not sure if this is Jimmy's or Kyle's fault, Jimmy is not used to push the ball downfield, even when the defense is crowded 15-20 yards from LOS. When a defense takes out middle, I just wish Jimmy takes a deep shot and not worry about the completion; that would make defense to respect his deep ball and open middle. Before this season Jimmy rarely protects his player, he throws the ball to a spot where LB and Safety take the soul out of his receiver. QBs have to lead the receiver to a spot to avoid hits, YAC will take a hit, but it’s a crime to put receivers to take such bad hits. 

Why Trey ? League has been copying his play style; therefore, he needs a QB to innovate more plays and also stay rooted in his philosophy that is backed by solid run game. Jimmy's inability to stay fit is the biggest reason for them to move away. FO also not happy with Jimmy off-season workouts. He never works with his receivers on building chemistry during the off-season. 

Kyle might also expects more from his QB, similar to Allen when you see Allen tells his coach to go aggressive on some situation. May be Kyle wants QB who would have his back. Jimmy also talked in KNBR few week back how they are both communicating more than ever, you could see more deep passes called this season

Jimmy and Aiyuk still do not have a great chemistry. Juszczyk and Jimmy miss wide-open plays; these plays are result of lack of reps between them.
