1527,17157,17157,Avery-Bradley,"As others said, the Niners have great depth at every position. Their weak link is their secondary, so we'd be throwing a ton. This would be a great litmus test for Jalen Hurts in the postseason (although I firmly believe he's our guy, if for some crazy reason he puts up a horrible game like 1 rushing TD 3 INTs, reactionary Eagles fans will go crazy).

Although our talent surpasses theirs, the Giants are well-coached. Brian Daboll is the man. If we make one mistake, they will capitalize. Their defense has showed up, and all their wins have been one possession wins. If they make a trade at the deadline for another receiver (Chase Claypool? Kendrick Bourne?), they will be even tougher to stop.

If Dak gets hot again, the Cowboys will be difficult. Their secondary is boom-or-bust, they do a decent job at forcing turnovers thanks to Dan Quinn. I still like our chances, but winning in Dallas is always tough.

The Vikings in theory should worry me, but it's so hard to get worried about Kirk Cousins. I loved their addition of Kevin O'Connell, they're passing more, but it's still Kirk Cousins. We also beat them handily.

A lot of the Bucs and Rams woes are from their offensive lines. If they can make an in-season move for a guy, they'll be back in it. But I don't know if such a move is even possible at this point without trading big assets.

The Packers also have a great secondary, but their receivers are horrible. I don't even think a Chase Claypool can save them, assuming they pull the trigger for him. Who's their WR1? Allen Lazard?

My god that division would be even more insane. For them to consider it, they would have to be not confident in Pickett. I think they'll keep Pickett and rock with him next season. 

The Niners will probably want to roll with Trey Lance unless they're concerned he'll only lower his value if he plays next season. If they did a Rodgers trade, they would definitely salary dump Jimmy G to the Packers. Garoppolo and a second for Rodgers? 

The Panthers won't do this trade after trading CMC and Robby Anderson.

The Saints would be interesting, but I don't know how they'd figure in his contract with their cap situation. They also don't have their 2023 first rounder or 2024 second rounder.
