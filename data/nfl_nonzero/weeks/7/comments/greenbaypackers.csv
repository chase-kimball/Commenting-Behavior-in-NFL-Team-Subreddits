* 5.174: WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling: Decent NFL WR, jettisoned because we didn't want to pay him. Honestly decent value for round 5
* 6.207: WR Equanimeous St. Brown: buried on Bears depth chart. Just not a good NFL player.

2019

* No WR selected

2020

* No WR selected

2021

* 3.85: WR Amari Rodgers: currently has more career fumbles than receptions. Terrible pick.

2022

* 2.34: Christian Watson: selected as a project player. nagging injuries have kept him off the field. Jury still is out, but not looking good for now
* 4.132: Romeo Doubs: has lots of upside, but play is up and down. Jury still out
* 7.258: Samori Toure: hasn't sniffed the field yet, but is a 7th rounder so take what you can get

* 2020: you already know it: Don't trade up to take Jordan Love and instead take any one of Higgins, Pittman, Claypool; swap the kamal Martin pick with Donovan Peoples-Jones in the 5th round
* 2021: idk what to say here, but Amon Ra St Brown would have been nice in round 3 or 4 instead of Amari rodgers.

Quay and Campbell looked to get on the same page and did well. I think Quay got beat on some runs but overall an encouraging development for them. Jaire played pretty good D I think but Heincke threw some incredible throws that scary terry also did an awesome job catching. Run defense is atrocious but its fine when they are inside moves just we keep getting beat to the edge which sucks. That Jones 2nd TD was an amazing catch and I think they should have him line up as a WR with dillon in the backfield. Only WR that is making plays.
