15557,143880,143880,Thriven,"> At any rate, the dude doesn't have issues throwing from the pocket as long as he has a pocket. He's one of the best pocket passing talents of the last few drafts, believe it or not.

I don't doubt it. His accuracy is really good. You have to work with what you got, and while I think we could pay more of an investment to our offensive line; when we pay more they aren't healthy. When we have gaps in the oline it has to collapse, the QB has to roll out or step forward.

I don't know where we will find an oline at any point in the season where he can get more than 3 seconds to dropback and pass.

This isn't just about Kyler Murray, this is a problem on almost every football team. When they say a teams oline is good, it doesn't mean the QB gets 4 seconds to hit a target in the pocket. Murray just happens to be so much faster than most pocket passing QB's. He seems to either run or throw. I'd like to see him rollout into some open space and throw. I'd like to see him step up into the pocket and throw. He rarely does and he usually commits to run.

I want to see him throw for many reasons. I don't want to see him get hurt by making the plays on his legs but I would like to see him extend the play more.",1.0,azcardinals,t3_yb7a9h,False,0.0,:Black1: Kyler Murray,2022-10-24T16:47:44Z,azcardinals,0.048076217366557

15559,143890,143890,Thriven,">\- Kyler doesnt help himself by being so skittish and rarely staying in the pocket.. is constantly on the move

Most your points are valid but I think this one is misconstrued. Kyler sits in the pocket too long and he's just not a pocket passer. He's not tall and he needs to either step up to throw or roll out to throw over the defensive line. Russell Wilson did this for years. To throw over a defensive line these days you have to be a taller QB, a Peyton Manning build QB. 

I think the problem with Kyler Murray is he is skittish about leaving the pocket. He wants to dance in the pocket but we just don't have the line to give him that time and when he rolls out late or steps forward late, they have a man on contain. Rolling out earlier usually forces the LB on contain to commit early opening up the field. Ertz/Conner/Benjamin should be the outlet if the contain commits.",2.0,azcardinals,t3_yb7a9h,False,0.0,:Black1: Kyler Murray,2022-10-23T02:40:18Z,azcardinals,0.0064601736538513
