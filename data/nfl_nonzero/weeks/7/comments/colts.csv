He is a good offensive mind and coach. The offensive line regression is troubling but to me that’s a 3 fold issue. 
1. Ballard stopped investing in the offensive line after the 2018 draft. 
2. I’ve not liked how the line has performed under Strausser since he was hired. 
3. Some of the blame has to be on the QB. I assume QB’s set their own protections in this offense (Going back from what I can remember Luck talk about in 2018) and I just expect veteran QB’s who won a MVP and had an all pro selection to be able to diagnose have answers quicker than what it looked like Ryan was processing the field. Ryan honestly looks like 2018-2019 Eli out there. 

Where I will give push back is 2019 Jacoby and the injury excuse. I feel the subsequent years of him start with the Dolphins and Browns have put to rest the talk of how good he could have been if he had not been injured. The offense was just as inept as this offense led by Ryan, the only difference is Jacoby is turnover adverse.",2.0,colts,t3_ydc2ix,False,0.0,Pimp Luck,2022-10-26T05:56:19Z,colts,-0.043657659474982

He was supposed to do the east stuff that Wentz  struggled to do. But I think the thing that people over looked in the transition from Wentz to Ryan is people expected the east throws to still be there. Imho, Ryan’s inability to stretch the field allowed defenses to sit down and dare him to beat them over the top. This took away the east stuff and exposed Ryan as washed up QB.

Matt is similar to rivers, except he panned out even worse. 

The moves just haven’t panned out the way the organization thought they would for a litany of reasons. We’re at the point where the theoreticals are biting us in the ass. 

Hindsight is 20/20. It’s easy to say now that we should’ve went all out to score our future long term QB, but at the same the FO thought Rivers was gonna stay longer, they thought Wentz could be a long term guy, and they thought Matt had way more gas in the tank than he actually does.

The Colts have not been a bad team over the last few years. Disappointing? Very. But we haven’t had a losing season since the year Luck retired, and even then we went 7-9 which isn’t ~that~ bad compared to many other teams losing seasons thru the last few years.

I still like Reich, I think he’s a great OC. Just probably not meant to be a head coach, which honestly kinda makes sense given we pulled him from the Eagles last minute when McDaniels fucked us. I still like Ballard, because he’s drafted a lot of the best players we’ve had in years on both sides of the ball. They both came into an already hectic situation and I genuinely believe they’ve made the best of it that they could.

That being said, it hasn’t been good enough. They’ve made big gambles that didn’t pay off. Ballard didn’t make big enough gambles, or made the wrong ones in terms of who he gambled on. Frank out thinks himself frequently. 

I genuinely believe that had Luck not retired, we could’ve won a SB by now with the team we’ve built. The risks taken at the QB position just have panned out poorly.
