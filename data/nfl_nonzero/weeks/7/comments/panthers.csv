I loved CMC but his age and contract aren't good for the team next year and beyond.

The number 1 pick gives the the best QB we have in years (not hyping prospects just the bar is that low).

Article 13 Salary Cap Accounting Rules

Section 6

>**(iii) Amounts Treated as Signing Bonuses. For purposes of determining Team Salary under the foregoing, the term “signing bonus” shall include:**

(1) Any amount specifically described in a Player Contract as a signing bonus;

(2) Any guaranteed reporting bonus;

(3) Any consideration, when paid, or guaranteed, for option years, contract extensions, contract modifications, or individually negotiated rights of first refusal;

**(4) Any option exercise fee or bonus, subject to the rule set forth in Section 7(c) below, and any option buyout amount, when paid or guaranteed;**

(5) The difference between the Salary in the second contract year and the first contract year when Salary in the second contract year is less than half the Salary called for in the first year of such Contract;

(6) Any reporting bonus in the season of signing when a contract is signed after the start of training camp;

(7) Any roster bonus in the season of signing when a contract is signed after the last preseason game;

**(8) Any salary advance paid on a guaranteed basis**;

(9) Any guaranteed bonus tied to workouts;

(10) Any salary advance which a player is not obligated to repay;

(11) Any amount of a Salary advance, offseason workout bonus, offseason roster bonus, or offseason reporting bonus that is guaranteed for skill, injury and Salary Cap terminations, on a non-contingent basis for all of the guarantees. (Notwithstanding Subsections (8)–(9) above, a Salary advance, offseason workout bonus, offseason roster bonus, or offseason reporting bonus that is guaranteed for skill, injury and Salary Cap terminations, but on a contingent basis for any of the potential guarantees, shall be included in Team Salary only in the League Year in which the bonus is earned by the player; e.g., in the case of an offseason roster bonus, in the League Year in which the player is required to be on the roster to earn the bonus. The rules set forth in this Subsection (11) shall not affect Salary Cap accounting for any other purpose.);

This section seems to be treating the guaranteed 5th year option salary (numbers 4 and 8) as a ""Signing Bonus""

&#x200B;

>(ii) Acceleration.

**(1) For any player removed from the Team’s roster, or whose Contract is assigned to another Club via waivers or trade**, on or before June 1 in any League Year prior to the Final League Year, or at any time during the Final League Year, **any unamortized signing bonus amounts will be included in Team Salary for such League Year**, except that for each League Year preceding the Final League Year, each Club may designate up to two Player Contracts that, if terminated (i) on or after the first day of that League Year; and (ii) on or prior to June 1 and if not renegotiated after the last regular season game of the prior League Year, shall be treated (except to the extent prescribed by Section 6(d)(iv) below) as if terminated on June 2, i.e., the Salary Cap charge for each such contract will remain in the Club’s Team Salary until June 2, at which time its Paragraph 5 Salary and any unearned LTBE incentives will no longer be counted and any unamortized signing bonus will be treated as set forth in Subsection (2) below. If acceleration puts a Team over the Salary Cap, the Team will have seven days to conform with the Salary Cap, but may not sign any players until there is Room to do so under the Salary Cap.

This states that any player's ""Signing Bonus"" is counted towards the team's salary cap.

>(f) Traded Contracts.

(i) In the event that a Player Contract is assigned to another NFL Team, either by trade **or pursuant to the NFL’s waiver procedure, the assignee Team will count as part of its Team Salary only that portion of the player’s Salary which remains unpaid and for which the Team may be obligated.** The assignor Team will continue to count as part of its Team Salary only that portion of the player’s Salary which has already been paid by the Team and/or any Salary for which the Team remains obligated.

This outlines that in a trade or waiver, the team claiming/trading for the player only has to count unpaid salary towards their salary cap. Since the above sections seem to state that option fees/guaranteed salaries are ""signing bonuses"" and not regular salary, the onus would still be on the Panthers to pay out/claim that money on their salary cap (thus the obligation in the section above)",2.0,panthers,t3_yciezi,False,0.0,Ice Up Son,2022-10-24T18:07:06Z,panthers,0.037992421091632

Even then, TMJ's trade value would have been less than ideal due to his lack of production. It would probably be a late day 3 pick at best, which is a terrible return for a former 2nd round pick.

We're finally seeing what TMJ is capable of now that Robbie is gone and Marshall can play more outside. IMO Marshall wasn't put in a position to succeed as a big slot with a QB (Baker) who didn't target the middle of the field. Now he'll have an opportunity to show what he can do as a full time starter.

If any other receiver were to be traded before the deadline it would probably be Rashard Higgins, because he's not under contract in 2023 and likely isn't part of the team's long term future.

Ironically I think now we’re in more of a position to “retool” even though trading CMC seems drastic to some. If the Panthers can trade away players on expiring contracts like Ioannidis and Bozeman and trade Shaq to get his salary off the books, the young defensive core will be mostly intact with some solid pieces there on offense.

If the Panthers can get a QB and a WR in the 2023 draft the team could be immediately competitive. Positions like LB, RB, and OL depth can be addressed in the middle rounds. I wouldn’t want to go on a spending spree per se, but I’d love to sign Gesicki to give the rookie QB another legitimate weapon.
