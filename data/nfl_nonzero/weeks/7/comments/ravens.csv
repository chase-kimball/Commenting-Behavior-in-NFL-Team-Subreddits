31550,178060,178060,ZombieFeedback,"I agree for the most part. Andrews is a better receiver than most receivers and is one of if not the best tight-end in the entire game. Bateman has the potential to be an absolute stud and his combo of size and speed already forces defenses to alter coverages when he's in. Duv is lightning in a bottle, and while he doesn't have the hands, route-running, or physicality Rashod does, every play he touches the ball on has the potential to go to the house.

That said, this group has two problems:

1. There's nothing behind them. Look at just how crippled our passing game was with Rashod out of the lineup and Duv forced to take over as WR1. I love the guy, but he is not an X. (At least not yet) Proche and Wallace are just warm bodies, Robinson is a career WR3, and DeSean Jackson is 36, which might as well be 95 as far as an NFL WR's career arc is concerned. The instant one of those three went out of the lineup, the guys who had to step up were all completely overmatched. The NFL is a war of attrition, you don't want to pay elite money to benchwarmers, but you need to have *something* for the inevitable scenario that someone gets hurt and it's time for the next man up.

2. Other than Andrews, they're all potential. I love Rashod's skillset and think he'll be elite barring injuries, but I could say that exact same sentence about guys who never reached that ceiling. He's got one 500-yard rookie season under his belt and two good games as a sophomore, and a huge chunk of the passing game is resting on his shoulders. Duv is the best returner in the NFL, but it was a legitimate question mark until this season whether he was capable of being an offensive contributor, and while it looks like he is capable of that, his time as WR1 with Bateman out did not inspire confidence in me that he'll rise much higher than that. If either one of those players are at their ceiling, we are in serious, serious trouble, because Andrews is the only really trustworthy, proven commodity we have in the passing game.

To be clear, I am absolutely glass-half-full on Bateman/Duvernay as a WR combo. You could do better, but add Andrews to that and I think you can mess teams up. But there is absolutely no depth whatsoever behind those three, and while I think they'll deliver on their potential, that's still an unknown, and we have no real alternative if either of those coin flips comes up tails.",7.0,ravens,t3_ydejou,False,0.0, :19:,2022-10-25T18:18:32Z,ravens,-0.0368369319992959
31551,178061,178061,ZombieFeedback,"If we were getting blown out by them I would completely agree. We're not getting blown out though, we're literally a play or two away from flipping the script. You can't scheme your way out of a major talent deficit, you can't fine-tune yourself past being plain overmatched. You *can* fix your mistakes though, and you *can* tweak your gameplan enough to make up a difference of four points per loss to the best teams in the league.

If we're still struggling to close games out after the bye then I'll change my tune, but with how close we are right now against legitimately elite competition, and how historically consistent team improvement after a midseason bye week is, I'm reserving judgement until then.",1.0,ravens,t3_yczrno,False,0.0, :19:,2022-10-25T13:18:26Z,ravens,0.100363232

Not only that, but we were in position to win all three of those games, which on the one hand is intensely frustrating because goddammit we could easily be 7-0 right now, but on the other hand we're going toe-to-toe with the best of the best thus far in the season, in spite of how many major players are either still missing (Ojabo, Bowser, Dobbins, Bateman) or are limited (Ronnie, Gus, Houston, Moses) because of injuries. If this team can get its offensive miscues sorted out, keep getting players back healthy, and avoid any major injury losses, I don't see any reason *not* to buy the over. This is a very good football team that just has to figure out how to get out of their own way and they will dominate.",4.0,ravens,t3_yczrno,False,0.0, :19:,2022-10-25T13:00:33Z,ravens,0.054087328
31553,178063,178063,ZombieFeedback,"On the one hand I can't blame the team for being anxious about the OL. Ronnie was supposed to be on a strict snap count and a sudden RT injury has blown up those plans, and at RT you're either playing an injured Morgan Moses or a backup. Leaving either of those situations alone on an island is going to make you antsy.

But at the end of the day, that's the situation we're in. Ronnie's looked great so far and is playing almost 90% of the offensive snaps, I think you can start to give him more solo situations going forward. I get being cautious, but he's passed every test so far. As for RT, either we trust Moses enough to hold down the fort at RT in spite of his injury, or we need to sit him to get healthy enough for us to trust him. And if we need to sit him, we need to give Mekari more credit and leave him by himself sometimes; he's a mid-tier starter at-best, there's a reason he's a reserve lineman, but he's one of the best reserves in the league, and held up respectably last year. Not amazingly - there's a reason we got Moses - but well enough that I'm okay leaving him alone if he's not lined up against Garrett or Watt or something.

31559,178072,178072,ZombieFeedback,"I'm of two minds on the issue.

On the one hand, it is clear that the passing game was not meant to be the focus. Of 60 offensive plays, we ran the ball on 44 of them. (73.3%) This makes total sense if you look at the Browns pass defense vs. their rush defense; 14th in passing yards allowed per game, 13th in passer rating allowed per game, 13th in passing TDs allowed, the Browns aren't top-five elite against the pass, but the worst you can say is above-average. Meanwhile they're straight-up horrible against the run, sitting at 24th in yards per game, 26th in yards per rush, and 32nd in rushing touchdowns, in spite of only being 16th in attempts against. They're awful at defending the run, so the smart thing to do is to pound it down their throats all day. Situational football isn't just making the smart decision on third down or goal-to-go situations, it's also adhering to a gameplan that avoids your opponent's strengths and picks on their weaknesses, and that's exactly what the Ravens did. This is the stuff that Bill Belichick and Tom Brady got praised for doing for years; the Patriots would win by 20 in spite of Tom throwing multiple interceptions because the gameplan was to pound the ball with something called a Jonas Gray for 200 yards because that was the weak point on the opposing defense. They'd do it in the playoffs too, Tom beat the 2019 Chiefs in spite of throwing two picks because the gameplan was to ram it down their throats 47 times and rely on the ground game against the NFL's 28th rush defense. Smart teams adjust their gameplan to focus on their opponent's weakness.

On the other hand, while the passing game was not the focus, you still want to see more efficient work from a guy who's asking for a fully guaranteed contract. 56.25% for 120 with only two plays beyond 20 yards is *not* the kind of passing you want to see even if the sample size is limited.

I was legitimately mad about last week. That pick never should've happened, and he should've checked the ball down way more than he did. This week wasn't great, but I'm willing to give him some benefit because it is clear we put the overwhelming majority of our practice reps and gameplanning focus into the ground game this week.",20.0,ravens,t3_ybrk8c,False,0.0, :19:,2022-10-23T17:22:21Z,ravens,0.0491500232640483

That said, he has been one of the most underrated tough runners in football his entire career, and while ACLs might impact speed and agility, nowadays they don't usually reduce power that much.

Starting in 1990, SNF in the first half of the season was shown on ESPN, and then shown on TNT(and eventually moved exclusively to ESPN in 1998) in the second half. However, as to not conflict with any World Series games in October, some games had to be scheduled on a Thursday, or [even postponed a day](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/27/sports/nfl-week-9-bears-dolphins-postponed.html).

TLDR: Before the 1999 NFL schedule came out, the 1999 World Series Game 2 was already scheduled for Oct 24th of that year, which was a Sunday.  So the schedule makers had the Ravens-Chiefs play on that Thursday instead.",6.0,ravens,t3_ydhs3s,False,0.0,Find me at the end of the bar....,2022-10-25T19:31:41Z,ravens,0.0568701131687242
