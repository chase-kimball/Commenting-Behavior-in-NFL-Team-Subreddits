It sucks, but thats the NFL. And RBs shouldnt really sign a 1 year ""prove it"" deal like other positions because that team will absolutely run the brakes off of you in the season.

Ideally he needs a contract that will bring him comfortably to his 30s with decent money, but i dont think any team out there is willing to do that. So it might just be that his best option is to stay with Cleveland another year or 2 and play under Watson who will be throwing a lot more, stretching the defense, allowing him to get more pass catches out of the backfield and allowing him to run in more open lanes. But i also dont know if the Browns have sort of mentally moved on from him already after the vocal offseason and taking Ford.

Priefer should have been fired a long time ago imo. Woods is difficult because he did have a great end to season last year and it’s not really helpful to fire him mid season. 

I expect big changes to defense and special teams this off-season if things continue. 

Culture, accountability, motivation etc are all important but as an outside fan it’s hard to know what goes on inside the locker room. The fact is - when teams lose fans scream and shout about culture problems, leadership problems, etc. when teams win - everything is fine. If we had just an average defense we’d be 4-2 and things would be peachy. At the end of the day, it’s on the head coach, so if things don’t get turned around next year then sure fire Kevin.

 Right now we can point to an obvious factor that’s limiting success - defense. That’s on Woods. Yes, it’s on stefanski +/- Berry for having woods employed, but  Stefanski has earned the chance to work with a good Qb and try and find a new coach to run the defense.",3.0,browns,t3_y9t475,False,0.0,:chubbatman:,2022-10-21T10:05:29Z,browns,0.076668796484525

8456,60741,60741,Godszn,"Have to vent about Sean Payton. Seeing a lot of fans wanting to get rid of Stefanski and specifically mentioning going for Payton and I find it to be such a hilariously bad take.

Don't get me wrong - Payton is a very good coach and his success speaks for itself. I'm a big fan of Stefanski but if you could magically swap them one for one this offseason and Payton would transition seamlessly into the org and fit well with the front office, that would be something to seriously consider. 

But it's almost like people forget that the Saints went through a 3-4 year stretch with PRIME DREW BREES and a high powered offense with prime Jimmy Graham and very very good Marques Colston where they finished like 7-9 and had god awful defenses. What's happening with the Browns right now happened with Sean Payton with a HOF QB for multiple years. Browns fans would be sending death threats to his house.

Finally the saints got a stud defense (do you think Payton had much control over that? Highly doubt it) and had a good stretch at the twilight of Brees' career (which they still managed to choke away in the playoffs multiple times).

This also doesn't factor in that we would need to trade significant draft capital for Payton - so it's just simply not happening. And who knows if he would gel with Berry and co.

Doesn’t being a fan necessarily require your emotional energy?  For 20 or so weeks, I’m 100% invested in how the Browns are doing.  I get a rollercoaster of emotions when the season is in swing.

You sound like someone that isn’t a fair weather type, but you’re nearing apathy and that’s ok.  I’ve followed the team since the early 80s.  The only time I felt apathetic was during the 0-16 season.  It was a combination of our front office and coaching staff seemingly totally out of their depth when it came to fielding a good team, and the players who tried as hard as they could to overcome that.  

It was hard to watch and then I kinda tuned out and turned down my Browns volume switch.  That isn’t the case now.  We have great players and a fine head coach, but a defenses that needs a new DC and secondary coach.
