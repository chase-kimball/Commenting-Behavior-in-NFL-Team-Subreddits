4475,25572,25572,BuctheFalcons,"I agree with some parts of what this article says. No need to force Mike bad targets when we can get Godwin good targets.

The issue I have is the idea that A.) BL is scheming up lay-ups with any regularity and B.) that a lay-up to one of the innumerable JAGs on this roster is worth more than a ""bad"" target to Evans. I'll take a shitty target to Mike over a ""good"" target to Brate, Miller, Beasley (no longer on the roster, but still), or Perriman 7 days a week and twice on Sunday. The production we have when targeting these guys is laughable. They collectively have 31 receptions for 293 on a whopping 60 targets. I'll take a 50/50 ball to a certifiable stud over a routine pass to one of our role players when every ball to these guys is 50/50 by default. 

Other teams don't have the same issue with their WRs that we do. The Bills are capable of getting Diggs a million targets while also scheming Davis open. The Chiefs can get Kelce open despite everyone and their fucking dog knowing he's getting 10 targets. Adams was the only WR on the Packers and was always open. Same with Jefferson on the Vikings. Does Evans have the same skillset as some of those guys? No. Is he better with vertical routes? Yes. Does that mean we should use him in exactly one way? Fuck no. While he's better over the top 1v1, he's still a great WR and should be used on shorter and quicker routes. It'll keep the defense honest so CBs can't cheat back and maybe give our offense an extra layer and less predictability. 

As far as the bit about taking what the defense gives us in terms of running the ball, at some point we have to admit that the running game is dogshit and that it will continue to be poor until proven otherwise. Teams will continue to dare us to run because they know that we can't and know that we'll take what the defense gives us play after play despite the defense only giving us 1-2 fucking yards. We should be doing to other teams what the Cowboys did to us in the opener two years ago. Screens, short passes, routes with rubs to spring guys open for YAC.

Good stat! I appreciate you pointing this out. 

>Every other D got at least one turnover against that O.

This is what I meant by they aren't losing us the game, but they're not helping them win either. Ultimately, they kept the game close for our offense to show up, they never did, and the Bucs ran out of gas energy wise on defense. Its why our 4th quarters look so rough, they run out of energy every game because the offense wont stay on the field. 

>The Steelers game. The Dolphins beat the Steeelers yesterday 16-10 because they stopped Pickett twice at the end with INTs

False equivalency, every team is different, every player is different, in Picketts case it was different. The Dolphins are much more competent as a team coaching wise than us at this point, and that game was closer at the end than ours was. Some teams match up better than others, i.e., its how the Bengals somehow got to the superbowl when they were arguably not the best AFC team. 

Im looking at their performance as a whole, they didnt play amazing, they played well enough to keep us in the game though, our offense let them down and I cant blame our defense **for our offense keeping them on the field for 45 minutes in a game.** Thats ridiculous. That effects everything, especially turnovers because you're just gassed and don't have your full wits about you.",1.0,buccaneers,t3_yc9d8r,False,0.0,:RedJersey69: Nice,2022-10-24T10:15:51Z,buccaneers,-0.0017442448969889
11474,75491,75491,Kreynard54,">How can the D get a B-. This the Panthers points totals over the last few weeks and that was with McCaffery.

It comes down to overall. Theyre not winning us games but theyre not losing games for us. I gave them a B because they've kept us in every game and even yesterday they kept us in this game when our offense was not putting our defense in easy field position. The point of the defense is to slow down the other team, in the modern NFL 21 points isn't a crazy amount to give up. 3 points IS crazy amount of offensive inefficiency for ANY defense to overcome. Speaking of he bears, think that bears defense when they had Trubisky. That Bears defense was awesome, they still gave up yards and points, but they weren't blown out hardly ever. When they lost, it was because the offense couldn't move the ball. 

Offense being all the field and being efficient gives the defense rest, allows them to make adjustments and be coached up on what the opposing teams doing. The fact we have only given up:

10 to the Saints

14 to the Packers

15 to the Falcons

20 to the Steelers

21 to the Panthers

(KC is the one game you can blame our defense fully). 

Is a relative miracle. Had we turned the ball over im sure it would be much worse. 

My argument is simple: DEFENSE SHOULDNT HAVE TO CONSISTENTLY BE THE SOLE REASON WE WIN A GAME. Blaming them when the offense can only muster 3 points, cant get them off the field to rest and catch their breath, and not being able to close a game against a team who CAN and WILL run on you because they have a lead isnt their fault. We cant play the pass exclusively on 3rd and short with 3 minutes left when they arent in a hurry to move the ball down the field, they literally have their entire playbook to pick from. 

We are awful at closing out games on defense while being down, but part of that is because we are making it so much easier for other teams to use their entire playbook to close us out.",3.0,buccaneers,t3_yc9d8r,False,0.0,:RedJersey69: Nice,2022-10-24T09:11:29Z,buccaneers,0.0281094462869111

**Offense:** F 

Evans clearly had an off day, no one else stepped up as a playmaker. Even if Evans droped that ball, its time to call out Brady for not pushing the ball down the field, I realize the olines rough, but jesus. Havent been attacking deep and over half out plays were checkdowns or runs. We are trying to use Fournette as if he is Christian Mcaffrey, he is not. Playcalling was uninspired, running on 3rd and 4th and short when we clearly dont have a pulse in the center of the line. Its just bad coaching at this point, bad playcalling, bad design, and uninspiring football. Brady missing reads needs to be called out, hes missing open guys in favor of checkdowns, maybe he doesnt have the time, but i see in some instances he does and hes hearing footsteps. Leftwich is trash at game planning. 

**Defense:** B-

Kept them in it, didnt make enough plays to change the game, but didnt lose us the game at all, kept it 7-0 going into the 4th for gods sake. Gave up too many rushing yards though which ate up time. 

**Special Teams**: C

Because I feel like it.

We are the worst team in football right now from an execution standpoint. NOT FROM A TALENT STANDPOINT. Its hard to find anything we are doing good, no one respects us and I don't blame them.

Of the issues this team is suffering from, O-line play/health seems to be the biggest, then coaching/play calling, then QB play. Brady looked like he'd given up in the Pittsburgh game and the results in the Carolina game appear to support that conclusion. If Jensen were healthy, that would help O-line play and probably Brady's attitude/patience, and we'd probably be 5-2 right now.

Bowles and Leftwich are probably both on the hot seat the rest of the season, but I don't think firing either one fixes anything during the year.

16796,114576,114576,SilentSentinel,"You're really living up to your username I see! I'll overlook you calling me an idiot after I tried to show this person a primer on EPA that's a good start and just say you are better for not watching the Bucs offense. 

For the record I included a second stat above, the simple to understand yards per carry metric. I don't love yards per rush compared to success rate but the outlier nature of this stat makes it somewhat interesting to look at at least. If the current numbers hold, the Bucs will finish with the worst yards per rush attempt since the 2000 San Diego Chargers, who finished with a 1-15 record. So I think we can probably assume the Bucs can't run the ball very well. More importantly, the Bucs have consistently failed in critical rushing attempts. On 12 rushing attempts of 3rd down or 4th down and 1, Fournette has converted for a 1st down on just 2 of them this season. The Bucs rushing offense is consistently being trusted to convert and keep drives alive and fails to do so nearly every time.

The Bucs love running the ball though. Their neutral situation pass rate on first down in 20th in the league despite being the worst team in the league at running the football. This puts the team behind the chains immediately, forcing Brady into obvious passing situations where the defense knows they must throw and can tee off on the offensive line. 

And uh... [I know that not everyone loves PFF's OL grades but here's a chart for rookie OL and Luke Goedeke is on his own island in hell.](https://twitter.com/NoFlagsFilm/status/1582803974226202624?t=8pRH-_j9WlRTlsAbtYwv1A&s=19) He'd probably be playing a little better if he was next to Ryan Jensen, but instead he's playing next to Robert Hainsey, a second year player with no previous experience who converted from college RT to Center and has struggled heavily as well. Per TruMedia, the Bucs have the 5th worst pass block win rate in the league. Now sacks aren't an offensive line stat in a vacuum, often times QBs can hold on to the ball too long and invite uneeded pressure. But if you look at Time to Pressure, the Bucs are 6th lowest, which means that the opposing pass rushers are winning quickly. This usually happens when the pressure is coming from the interior which passes the sniff test given Goedeke and Hainsey's inexperience and performance thus far.

So they can't run the ball, and their pass protection stinks. But surely these high flying receivers can pick up the slack, right? Well they probably would be(and bear with me because we're going back to EPA a little here), but prior to this game the Bucs led the entire league in EPA lost to dropped passes. It probably goes without saying, but after that terrible Evans dropped touchdown I doubt they will be losing their lead in that category this week.

I hope this was enough to help provide additional context for you and whoever else may see this. I use dropback EPA/play because I think it's the best metric for evaluating QB play at the moment, but there's plenty of stuff that points to the issues on this offense everywhere you look. This teams playcalling and more importantly play sequencing is a complete shit show and is incongruous with what they are actually decent at. Even when they do correctly rely on Brady's arm in advantageous situations, the receivers cost them more than any other team's do. It's entirely possible that Brady has lost a step. He was like the second or third best QB in the entire league last year and is 45, a slight step back would make some sense! But he's still a top 10 QB in the league at the very worst.",3.0,nfl,t3_ybrja1,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers,2022-10-23T20:05:02Z,buccaneers,-0.0235075335743305

19180,127498,127498,TheFencingCoach,"I wanna do a breakdown on why Kanye's antisemitic remarks have been so disgusting and dangerous.

First the tweet: 

> I'm a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up
I'm going death con 3 On JEWISH
PEOPLE The funny thing is I actually can't be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda

He then continued his hatred on a show called
""Drink Champs"" and brought up age old antisemitic tropes about the Jews controlling the media and having control of the entertainment industry. 

Much of what Kanye believes here originated from a hate group called the ""Black Hebrew Israelites."" This is an extremist hate group who you'll often see spewing antisemitic rhetoric in major metropolitan areas such as DC.

This hate group, of course, is not to be mistaken with Jews of Color.

Remember the New Jersey Kosher
Market attack that killed six people and injured 3? Perpetuated by Black Hebrew Israelites.

The BHI don't only target Jews with antisemitic propaganda, but according to the SPLC, they target Muslims and Asians too. They are a bona fide hate group.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the BHI have…

> cited antisemitic conspiracy theories for the
""effeminizing of Black men"" and often claim that Jews were behind slavery, having either designed, built or owned the slave ships. They also have xenophobic tendencies toward Muslims or anyone of Middle
Eastern appearance. In the past two years they have taken to verbally harassing anyone appearing Asian, often using COVID as a reason and demanding their members avoid patronage of any Asian establishments

Darrell Brooks, the Waukesha parade murderer now on trial shared the content and rhetoric of the BHI frequently before killing 6 people and injuring 62

Hate mongers like Brooks and Kanye love sharing fake Hitler quotes, when oddly, there's a *pretty large* swath of actual antisemitic Hitler quotes they could pull from.

Now, back to Kanye now that you have some context about who the Black Hebrew Israelites are…

I saw a tweet the other day with a poignant fact:
Kanye West has 31.4 million Twitter followers.
As misguided and manic as he is, he is iconic and a voice that many listen to, are inspired by.

By contrast, there are only 14.8 million Jews left in the world, 7.6 million of which reside in the United States. 

According to the ADL, antisemitic incidents reached an all-time high last year. 2,717 incidents occurred… a 34% YoY increase

When you have a prominent figure like Kanye tweeting the beliefs of extremist fringe groups, it normalizes antisemitism. It inspires others to get behind the message and perpetuate antisemitism around the world.

According to the LA Times:

> On Saturday, demonstrators gave Nazi salutes as they stood behind a large overpass banner that read, ""Kanye is right about the Jews,"" according to images collected by antidiscrimination organizations and Jewish residents appalled by the group's message.

When antisemitism becomes normalized by pop icons with huge followings like Kanye or Desean Jackson, violence becomes normalized with that dehumanization.

It’s no surprise that now the Holocaust Museum in LA has been bombarded with messages of hate too.

Brady cemented his status as the GOAT a long time ago. He could have retired the moment he won us our second franchise ring and it would have been a nearly untouchable legacy. 

He gave up a marriage of 13 years for what? Getting pounded by DL because our interior OL can't block? Because our defense can't stop an offense schemed by Steve Wilks and Ben McAdoo? Because Leftwich is playing checkers in a game of 3D chess?

Let’s assume Brady is completing 55% of his passes, instead of his usual 70%, because of the drop off in interior line performance.

2021: 42, 67.5%, 28.5 comp per game

2022: he has a 67% completion percentage for the season, if we want him to have 29 completions per game, then he needs to throw the ball about 43 times per game.

If yall played football at my high school, my mf coach along with half the team would be in prison lmao

And that's just high school, shit gets immeasurably more intense in college and I'd assume it only increases in the NFL with Antonio Brown types in the locker room

Edit: guys I'm not acting tough I'm a DnD DM by night and I work in an art museum by day, all my other time is spent cuddling with my wife. I was never even a starting player lol. All I'm saying is that there is a toxic culture in football that is far more prevalent than appears when just watching from afar, especially via social media

Edit2: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. You didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.",81.0,nfl,t3_yc8uk1,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers :Lions: Lions,2022-10-24T09:40:12Z,buccaneers,-0.0404044585696855
