2073,18770,18770,Bieber_hole_69,"But Patricia didn't get that entire 3rd year, I don't know if the Lions would be willing to give another coach they were unsure about a make or break 3rd season again after having to fire the guy they did it for last time. I also don't think firing Campbell restarts the rebuild, I think it just starts a new phase of the rebuild, especially if they have a new QB as well.

The Lions are in a different spot roster-wise than they were with Patricia of course, but Campbell still has 5 less wins than Patricia did through 23 games, and some of the losses this year for Detroit point towards poor coaching.

Campbell reminds me a lot of Mularkey in Tennessee. He came in to a really, really bad situation with a poor roster and awful locker room. The players loved him and played hard for him while the roster was still not great. He really improved the mentality and drive of the locker room completely turned around the culture of the franchise. Then when it became clear he had reached his limit as a coach and he had reached his ceiling, they made the tough but correct decision to move on even if he overachieved. He was the perfect coach for the situation, but not an actually great coach.

I don't think it means starting over to fire a transitional coach like Campbell, it's just the necessary step towards actually being a good team. Going from dumpster fire -> plucky upstart that plays hard -> contender sometimes requires a change at HC.

I would also hesitate to trust a top 5 pick at QB with Campbell. If you aren't 100% sure about a HC developing your potential franchise QB, you shouldn't let him stick around or you end up with a situation like the Bears are currently in or the Cards were in with Rosen, and suddenly that top QB pick could just be a waste.",15.0,nfl,t3_ydxiue,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-10-26T09:35:12Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0064810611119372
2074,18771,18771,Bieber_hole_69,"I can depend on Tannehill being out there every Sunday at 100% or close to it, and have been able to for 3 years now. The same could pretty much never be said about Mariota. You could pretty much count on him missing a few games with an injury every year, and those were pretty much automatic losses. That's maybe the pivotal difference between the two.

Along with that, by the time he was nearing the end in Tennessee around 2018 and 2019, Mariota was risk-averse to such a degree that it was bringing the team down. The offense the Titans want to run and have had incredible success running under Tannehill has been centered around play-action shots to the intermediate of the field with max protection. On concepts like that, there's only two routes being run, and maybe a checkdown. Sometimes that intermediate route is just not going to be open, but you've still gotta throw it there and let your receiver make a play, and when that receiver is AJ Brown he can probably make that play most of the time. 

Tannehill was always willing to take that shot, and stay in the pocket while he knows he's going to get drilled. Sometimes it's going to result in a bad sack or an interception, but the way the Titans have wanted to play offense requires those shots to be taken regardless of outcome. It opens up the running game and forces teams to play their linebackers back to respect play-action. If the QB isn't willing to take shots, the running game isn't going to work and the entire offense isn't going to work.

Mariota in early 2019 had a good completion percentage and didn't turn the ball over, but the offense as a whole suffered because of his unwillingness to let it rip and see what happens. He would check down or run instead of throwing the 50/50 ball that the offense required to be successful.

I think Art Smith and the Falcons are running into the same issues now. Mariota is just not willing to take shots to deep or intermediate parts of the field if a guy isn't wide open, and sometimes that's just not gonna happen but he still needs to make the throw. He doesn't throw with anticipation either, so when you have receivers that don't get a ton of separation he isn't going to throw them open. When you only throw the ball 18 to 22 times a game, you need to make those plays count and Tannehill in 2019 was as efficient in that volume as any QB in league history.

Personal wise, the Falcons have followed the model the Titans did for pass catchers while Smith was OC. Huge athletic freaks that don't get great separation, but can just make a play on the ball. Tannehill has always had the confidence and trust in his playmakers to give them a chance at making a play, while Mariota just never has and seems to still not even though he has guys like Pitts and London that seemingly excel at just making a play.",7.0,nfl,t3_ydon6t,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-10-26T08:49:28Z,tennesseetitans,0.0461077558909133

Would I love to win a Super Bowl one of these years? Yeah, of course. But if that's the bar to success then you are never going to enjoy being a fan of any team that's not a dynasty. 

We're coming off the first back-to-back division titles the franchise has had since before the AFL-NFL merger and are on track to have the first AFC South three-peat since the Colts won five straight from 2003-2007. We went over a decade without winning the division. This is legitimately a run of success this franchise has not seen in 20 years, only five teams in the league have won more games than us since Vrabel took over.

The Colts had almost two decades of HoF level QBs and won a single Super Bowl.

Sorry about the rant, but sometimes I just feel a real disconnect with this subreddit now because this team was really bad for a really long time, and even worse than that they were really, really goddamn uninspired and uninteresting too. 

It's fine to be critical of the team because they definitely could be better when it matters the most, but to call them mediocre now completely misrepresents the word lol.

This is the best time to be a Titans fan in a *really long* time, and it can always get so much worse. Sometimes it's good to take a step back and enjoy the good times while they are still here, this may just be as good as it gets.

2077,18775,18775,Bieber_hole_69,"OBJ would love to go anywhere that will pay him.

Seems pretty clear from how he's been on social media lol, he's open to literally any contending team that has a few million in cap space.

Guy won't be cleared until December and won't be 100% until like Divisional round weekend, if at all this year. 

Could he help us? Yeah. And he wouldn't cost any draft capital. But the max impact he'll have is like 150 yds in the regular season and maybe 10 catches in the playoffs, while also likely demanding to be compensated like he's producing way more than that.

All that being said though, I wouldn't hate it. I am against using any draft capital more valuable that late-round swaps or conditional picks to get a WR just because of how our offense operates. I would definitely be in favor of using some capital for O-Line help though, and if our O-Line was at least a little better than WR help could also be beneficial. 

As it stands though, I don't think any WR is going to make a massive difference in our chances of contending. We desperately need speed, but speed in itself isn't expensive. We just need even the threat of speed on the outside, and there are some 4.3 guys sitting on practice squads that could give us that for bargain bin prices. Doesn't matter if they can actually play, we just need *somebody* that can force defenses to respect the downfield passing game even a little bit to open things up.

I think the jet sweep to Chig in week one fit the bill for fans only hating it because it didn't work though.

Maybe 3rd and 1 when you have Henry in the backfield isn't the best time to call it, but the play makes total sense and isn't a bad one.

Jet sweep to the QB though? Has Willis ever gotten a jet sweep handoff in a live game before? How often are they practicing that play to feel confident in things going off without a hitch?

Getting the ball in Willis' hands in that situation is a good idea. The way Downing did it was idiotic.

Once the Simmons extension is done, depending on how they want to structure his deal it could be an absurd amount of money to spend on the defensive front for 2023 because Landry's contract really starts in earnest next season.

Currently as it stands with Simmons playing on his 5th-year option, the cap number for all four of those guys in 2023 is $59,003,000, or 25.8% of the salary cap. They could get that number down for next year with a Simmons extension, but even then it's probably going to force one or both of them off the team as well, and it can't be Simmons or Landry.

Autry has no guaranteed money left on his deal, so cutting him only puts $2,000,000 in dead money on the cap, but it only saves $7.250,000. Dupree on the other hand would put $10,850,000 in dead cap hit, but frees up $9,350,000. Cutting Dupree would also put some dead cap on the books for 2024 and 2025, but not enough to really impact the decision as the savings would outweigh the dead money pretty heavily. Would you want Autry + $9.35M or Dupree + $7.25M? Or just cut them both and spend the $16.6M on their replacement(s)?

2104,18806,18806,Bieber_hole_69,"I do think the moves for Julio and Woods are at least less risky and more measured than giving Davis the contract the Jets gave him.

Julio had the same amount of time left on his contract as CD's deal with NYJ, but less guaranteed money left. On paper it was basically swapping out Julio for Davis and a 2nd round pick, which seemed like an upgrade at the time and probably was if Julio's hamstrings weren't cooked. I don't know many people at the time the trade was made that would have said Julio wasn't an upgrade over CD, or would expect Julio wouldn't be on the team for 2022 and even 2023. 

I still don't think it was the wrong move knowing only what we knew in June 2021, you can't really make a move like that expecting the worst outcome. Had we known Julio was totally washed back then, yeah the right move would have been keeping CD, but I think everyone would have rather had Julio if given the option. Julio even ended up playing more games than CD last year and had like 50 less yards, they were pretty close to the same production last year.

And the Woods trade can't really be viewed with the CD contract in consideration. The Woods trade doesn't get made if the Julio trade doesn't end up going as badly as it did. We traded for Julio with the intention of him being here at a minimum through 2022. Julio was the upgrade from CD and Woods was the emergency replacement for Julio. 

Would I rather have CD for $3,000,000 more than Woods for this year? Yeah, probably, but CD wasn't an option at the time we traded for Woods.

2105,18807,18807,Bieber_hole_69,"The Saints already were on borrowed time with the cap stuff and only extended their window to kick the can down the road because they had an all-time great draft in 2017.

It's kind of easy to forget in hindsight with how long ago it was, but the Saints were trending in the wrong direction pretty much every year after 2012, aside from an outlier year in 2013 when they started 9-2 and finished on a 3-4 skid that ended with a divisional round loss. They had a great offense that buoyed a horrific defense to mediocrity most years, and were still employing cap gymnastics to push the can down the road just to stay mediocre.

Swapping out Rob Ryan for a returning Dennis Allen in 2016 and then that draft where you have an infusion of talent that includes two All-Pro players on offense and three top-tier defensive starters, (Although Hendrickson was a late bloomer,) gave the Saints an entirely new window to be contenders.

They went all-in on the Brees era and it didn't really work until they just happened to have one of the best draft classes of all-time. It's never enough to create funny money with the cap and be able to keep all your stars and bring in new free agents while kicking the can down the road, you need to also hit home runs in the draft, or in the case of the Rams trade those draft picks for home run players, along with hitting on your late round picks. A lot of other stuff needs to go right too.

Even with the teams going all in and acting like the salary cap is fake, the ones that can turn that into success are the ones that still make the most of their draft capital. It's even more important than the salary cap stuff. The Giants went in like the cap was fake for the 2016 off-season and spent a lot of money during Gettleman's tenure, and it only got them one Wild Card playoff berth because the draft picks building the foundation around the spending stunk. 

As a GM you have to be as confident in the money you are spending as you are in your ability to draft when going all-in on the salary cap, or you can set a franchise back *years.* I'd rather trade draft picks than hemorrhage cap space if I had to risk one or the other.

I too have been contemplating this teams QB history as well as why we seem to struggle to get more high end talent at the position. I think a lot of it revolves around our focus around the running game which doesn't necessarily provide the best supporting cast for the passing game to thrive/exist. It also limits the type of QB that can really thrive in our system... someone like Mahomes likely doesn't become a ""Mahomes like player"" in our system simply because we don't invest in that high end pass pro and WR room as heavily as passing focused teams. 

The upside is that in general so long as we have a great RB which we seem prone to find, a baseline average NFL QB can be ""good enough"" in our system to lead us to a positive win season. (and from that you can extrapolate more chances at post season success) 

The run game is our identity, and I wouldn't change that as we are one of the best at it. But, in some ways it is a limiting factor, even though it also seems to make us more consistent than a lot of teams that have severe highs and lows season to season depending who they have at QB and who they can afford in their receiver room.",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_ye6xdm,False,0.0,"""BIG Jeff"" Simmons",2022-10-26T20:06:51Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0763023238616562

When I look at Stroud or Hooker I see someone who makes a talented roster even better. When I see Young play I see the bottleneck of the most talented roster in college football. They win in spite of Young.

Anthony Richardson has a very similar but slightly different issue to Farley and is physically gifted similar to Malik. He's raw because he was injured most of last year and his team is poopoo bad in places. But he will probably be at about the same experience level and with a similar ceiling and skill set to Malik come next year's draft. (Essentially if we want another QB scratch off similar to Malik, Richardson is that guy)

He isn't good now, but can potentially become a good-great starter under the right set of circumstances.

Hall is actually superior to Young imo. I'd seriously consider drafting Hall over him though I'm not sure Hall will be a true starter, He's got a decent shot at it and has a decent floor even if his potential isn't in the stratosphere.

More importantly, she puts the right people in the right places, empowers them appropriately, and does the type of work an owner should do. You can see her direct effects on the team in the way that she builds team culture. She grew up completely steeped in football and knows it well, but she doesn't meddle in any football decisions like so many owners do. She lets the people paid to do that job do that job until they demonstrate they can't. Instead, she focuses on building the team up and building its culture.

Bringing those past players back into the fold, hosting them in the owner's box, giving them recognition on-field, all that shit is actually important to the on-field football.

If you saw the Cowboys Hard Knocks, you saw how much players (young and old) talked about how meaningful it was to them to be a Dallas Cowboy. That the star on the helmet meant something. Building up the sense of history and demonstrating to players that they'll be remembered and appreciated for playing hard for this team, that stuff means something.

Some notes on the defense: Kristian Fulton. Did he play yesterday? Honestly I couldn’t fucking tell you for sure because sitting in the stadium I literally don’t remember seeing him or hearing his name. I didn’t think about him once yesterday. Fulton was MIA in the best way possible. I noticed McCreary a few times, and usually for good reason. Amani Hooker proved he’s an absolute game changer as well and why he’s so important and why the extension he signed is an absolute steal by the Titans. Byard is a stud. Dupree is a stud. Big Jeff is a stud. Autry is a stud. Long is a stud. Andrew Adams with the Titans longest pick 6 since 2012???? Terrance Mitchell sealing the game away Peanut Tillman style???? Dudes coming off the street and making plays for this defense. Just fucking studs up and down this defense man, and we’re still missing Molden and Cunningham. I say it all the time but it’s such a shame we’ll never see this defense with Landry healthy, because it would be one of the best units in the league without a doubt. Hope Big Jeff is okay.

Obviously the offense was not firing on all cylinders. I will point out that after the bye week I was really expecting them to go back to featuring Kyle Phillips a lot more but their game plan might have gotten tanked a little bit with his injury in Fridays practice. But Derrick Henry is still the king and Ryan Tannehill is 6-0 this season in not losing games for the Titans. Radunz can’t pass protect to save his damn life (had some gnarly run blocks though tbh), we need Nate Davis back in the worst way. It FEELS like we’re using Geoff Swaim less, which is always good, hopefully Hooper can build on this game and be our #1 TE consistently. I’m fine if the Titans want to line Willis up at QB and run some things but lining him up as a TE/WR just ain’t it, he ain’t that guy. Ben Jones is an absolute hero. 

Randy Bullock and Ryan Stonehouse are studs as well.

The Colts STILL can’t beat the Titans even though they were still significantly more healthy than the Titans. Colts were missing an EDGE and a LB (first game they weren’t missing anybody going in). Their offense was literally 100% healthy. Titans are missing their starting OLB, ILB, SCB, RG, WR, SWR, and LT. The Colts are a poverty franchise and should be treated as such. Colts paying $20/year to a guard that gets consistently owned by Big Jeff, Teair Tart, and Denico Autry is the best contract ever for the Titans. And the funniest thing is Colts fans just CAN’T admit, or at least hate admitting, that Nelson is playing like garbage and is a huge reason the Colts lost to the Titans twice this season. Matt Ryan is one of the worst QB’s in the league and they owe him $35 million next season ($18 million guaranteed). Anyway, hope the Colts finish 8-8-1 and keep Reich, Ryan, and Ballard, I think they’re doing a great job.
