829,2542,2542,AU_wde_2,"Just saw a report that the panthers turned down a 2 1st round pick trade for Burns from someone 

So if you had any hope there it should be dashed and you should be okay with that because more than 2 1sts is steep for anyone.

That being said he would’ve been an interesting fit - people were scared of a Frank Clark situation but I’ll be honest it would’ve been more like having (a non-injury prone) Dee Ford back there again. Explosive around the edge and really not good against the run. I don’t think I would’ve been too distraught about that because back when we had Ford our LB’s were shit so we had no run stuffing ability but it *would’ve* been interesting to see how it played out 

Haven’t heard an iota of rumblings around Tunsil but he’s my dream trade, give up OBJ + maybe a 3rd and a 5th maybe get back a 6th (totally spitballing there but I’d give up a 2nd plus OBJ for him). Instant upgrade at a huge position of need. He needs a new contract next year, there was a plan to do that with OBJ so I can’t imagine you can’t dust off that and try and reapply, again just word vomiting that trade",3.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_ybesbl,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2022-10-23T06:51:40Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0117438593106995

The Bills have a great HC, the one thing they were missing was consistent pressure off the edge, they tried to solve it with a rookie last year in Rousseau and now in year 2 he’s starting to be more consistent, combine that with a guy like Von and match that against our Tackles taking a violent step back and it was a match made in hell for us. 

This isn’t to say all hope is lost for us, we still have a plenty good shot but it’s going to take health and a lot of broken tendencies. Run from under center, let Pacheco and McKinnon run angry and run play action from those sets.

He’s definitely in his last season with KC with his contract structure alone, so it’s time to get that settled.

My personal hope for the WR room is extending JuJu and letting Hardman walk. Odell is whatever for me and I don’t have a strong opinion either way (except if it prevents us from getting and edge via trade). I also heard recently that MVS’s contract is structured in a way where the Chiefs could cut him after this season and only have a small cap hit, so that’s something to watch. Both the 2023 free agents and draft class will be rich with skill position players, so we will have plenty of choices to replace WRs and RBs if needed.

We still have one of the best O-lines in the league and 90% of teams would take ours over theirs. We aren’t getting anyone new for the line this season unless Niang comes back and plays well. Unless there’s going to be an upgrade in the free agent market next year or a deep draft class for lineman, we will still be searching for the long term solution for at least another season. Kinnard is also developing as well so he could be the next man up soon.

Here are some of the good bits: 

> Not surprisingly, Mahomes led the Chiefs to the greatest single-game performance in history: a Week 9 victory over the Cleveland Browns in 2018, Mahomes' first year as a starter. The 37-21 final score of that game may not stand out, but the devil is in the DVOA details: three 75-yard touchdown drives and a 95-yarder, lots of third-and-long conversions after holding penalties, a pre-halftime Hail Mary interception which doesn't count in our formula, and so forth. 

> Drew Brees and LaDainian Tomlinson led the San Diego Chargers to the second-best offensive performance in history: a 45-23 win over the New York Giants in 2005. Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills came in third by dropping 47 points on the New England Patriots in the 2021 playoffs. Hall of Famers Willie Roaf, Will Shields and Tony Gonzalez helped Dick Vermeil, Trent Green and the 2003 Chiefs notch fourth-place with a 45-17 win over the Lions. Some fellas named Steve Young and Jerry Rice led the way as the 1991 49ers piled 52 points atop the Chicago Bears for fifth place.

> The Chiefs now rank first in offensive DVOA in 2022, as well as first in points per game with 31.9 and first downs per game with 24.4. They rank second in yards per game (403.3), passing yards per game (296.0), yards per play (6.34) and passing yards per play (7.72). They also rank second in overall third-down conversion rate (51.9%) and red zone touchdown conversion rate (76.7%).
