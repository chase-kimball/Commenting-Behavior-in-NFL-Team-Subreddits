Mitchell Rales, the Walt Whitman High School alum who co-founded Potomac‚Äôs Glenstone museum, comes in on the Forbes list at No. 291 in the world with $7.5 billion. Rales is co-founder of Danaher, an industrial conglomerate that makes wrenches, water quality tests and voting machines. He's a major shareholder in Danaher as well as Enovis, a medical technology company, and Esab, which makes manufacturing equipment. His billionaire brother, Steven, also owns shares in these companies.

Chevy Chase native and real estate heir Bernard Saul II has $3.8 billion and a Forbes ranking of 710 in the world. He‚Äôs 90 years old so maybe some of his 5 children would be interested.

What everyone (WAS included for the first two rounds) failed to account for was his work ethic.

One other consequence I foresee with this - Sam Howell will not see a snap this year barring injury to both TH and CW.  His best chance is Heinecke getting injured during this time Wentz is out.  Otherwise, Ron isn't just going to throw him in there.  It's not like Madden where he wants to start progressing his young QB's ratings, and he's not in desperation mode.
