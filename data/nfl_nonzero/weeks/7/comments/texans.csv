25382,193030,193030,degening,"I think in order of need it should go something like:

1. QB: But only if you really like the guy. If you aren't 100% sold on any of the QB's you kick the can to next year.

2. Edge: Take BPA at the position with whatever pick this ends up being. That could mean we take Anderson or whoever the 2nd best guy is. This could come from either the first or second pick.

3. DT: This has been such a huge hole since DJ Reader left but by position value alone we have more pressing concerns. Still would like a first-round pick on this position but we may wait till next year if we really like one of the QBs this year. Possible to take in the 2nd round too if a guy falls.

4. WR: Although a top 3 wr from the class would be nice in reality this is quickly becoming the deepest position group in football. I think this year atleast we wait till 2nd round or later unless we trade our second pick down for a late first + w/e(2024 first most likely). The only time I would use a first this year is if the class ends up looking like 2013, but that requires some hindesight.

5. C/LB: We need both of these positions as well but once again based on position value alone I doubt we take either in the first in this draft or the next.
