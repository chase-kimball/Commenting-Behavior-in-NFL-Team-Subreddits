11159,69800,69800,Jarl_Balgruf,"I think that's a very important distinction that people tend to forget. I mean, Zim had it figured out on the defensive side for a *damn while* taking us from his first year from dead last in defense the year before with Leslie Frazier up into the middle of the pack. By year two he was in the top 10. And we all know how that culminated into one of legitimately the greatest 3rd down-stopping defense in NFL history. 

It was only once the paradigm shift occurred in his last years that players demanded coaches and owners put players' health, safety, and mental well-being higher than they ever thought to that Zim started to become the old, grumpy, out of touch coach that didn't motivate his players in the way that became almost the league expectation. And in those last few years, he lost the locker room and the team was ready to move on. 

Now obviously there are about 100+ factors that contribute to this entire downward progression after the 2017 season I'm absolutely sure. However, to end with an example of what I'm referring to with his old-school mentality that worked for a while, Zim was well-known for using the phrase ""You can't make the club in the tub"" when his players lost their starting or rotational spots after taking time for their physical health, and this really rubbed players the wrong way over time. Just look up what happened with Sharrif Floyd - horrible luck on Floyd's part in the years after being drafted with a botched surgery/recovery, but even though the guy did everything to get back on the field and was dealt a shit hand, Zim had no remorse and  publicly used that exact phrase from above. 

So overall, Zim was never a ""shitty coach who nobody ever liked or followed,"" a Bill Parcells student who exemplified that persona, and it worked for a lot of his career. But times change and so did his hold on the franchise.
