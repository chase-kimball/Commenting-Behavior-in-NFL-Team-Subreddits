(2 interceptions in his last 9 games (240 att. total))

&#x200B;

Accuracy is still an issue however, and the biggest split is him in a clean pocket vs. him under pressure. I'd have to go back to get the exact stats, but in a clean pocket he is pretty good, his QB rating is \~108. Under pressure he has a total of 54 passing yards with cumulatively 54 sack yards, so net 0 total yards. Unbelievably stark difference.

14300,99906,99906,NannigarCire,"That depends on a certain philosophy for the subreddit from the mods. I personally don't believe the mods should be heavily involved in doing much other than not allowing the space to become a link dump for sport pundit hopefuls to post their drivel and to keep the users from returning to their primitive states when they can't convince each other of something. I don't know how the other mods feel, but i don't like the idea of summing all threads into one. There have been scenarios where the mod team has done this in the past, and it's usually relating to some specific news. Making a singular ""discussion"" thread about a player's performance, even if it refreshes every day is a very specific choice.

This is my personal calculus for it, if the users didn't want to see it, they'd downvote it. The users on this forum can do that. They can even turn on the setting where after downvoting something, they no longer see it. I have it on. I downvoted this thread even, not because i'm tired of the Zach Wilson content- but because i think it's a dumb argument. If more users want to do that, the threads will probably stop, because there will be little to gain. Otherwise, there are 129 comments in this thread. Only about 15 of them are from this top comment complaining about the content. There are 114 comments that may be wanting to discuss the topic, even if half of them are probably from two brick walls talking to each other.

The thing also, is the users can just choose to not look at these posts. Nothing forces it. I don't see what's gained in summing these threads up. If the users don't have the self control to just not look into the thread, that's a personal issue. I like to treat the users as adults. They don't need me to guide their hand on what posts to look at, what posts not to, where to place their specific opinions in what threads. This is a user driven place. The only exception on that is to not allow this space to become a place where users are being used as a consumer funnel. That's my opinion. Other mods might disagree, and in case my personal mod philosophy doesn't make it clear- they're the more active ones anyway.

But self posts are very rarely able to meet the criteria of spam or self promotion, and even Wilson threads- like them or not, are clearly upvoted heavily and filled with comments so they are something that the subreddit wants to discuss whether you or I like it.

14308,99916,99916,NannigarCire,"I think this has to do with having a lot of young starters the last few years. I know people tend to think the older you are the worse your body is, but iirc some people who studied it said it’s the opposite- older bodies have a harder time recovering but the players themselves aren’t injured as often because they’ve also had the professional training and dieting and etc ingrained heavily into them year after year. Young players rarely come into the league with that level of detail to their seasonal preparation, and are usually more focused on the big picture stuff (base mechanics, playbooks etc). So I’d say this is more of a feature of just having really young teams year after year, although yes luck and randomness is involved the majority of the guys are just young and not quite taking care of themselves in the way the NFL is demanding of them (yet).

14309,99917,99917,NannigarCire,"The elite comment isn’t true and but more importantly, it wouldn’t matter. Since 2012 (when the league adopted the read option and QB evaluations mightily changed as a result)- 23 QBs have played their age 23 season as a second year starter and thrown at least 100 passes. Wilson is 16th out of 23 in YPA at 6.9, with only Josh Allen below him and ultimately becoming good. Of the guys ahead of him are Mahomes (8.8, insane), Deshaun Watson (8.2), Cam Newton (8.0), Jared Goff (8.0), Marcus Mariota (7.6), Justin Fields (7.6), Justin Herbert (7.5), and this is where the list stops showing any more good players. Kyler Murray had 7.1, and Jalen Hurts at 7.3 are the only others who have shown long term starting potential. And I want to compare him to Fields number for a second, because field’s is throwing to worse players and on a worse offensive scheme. There’s no reason for Fields per pass efficiency to be substantially better than Wilson’s. So everything about that should be questioned. Wilson has better talent around him and is getting less out of it as a passer.

If the idea is “well as long as the jets have a good defense, all Wilson has to do is game manage” alright sure I don’t disagree. But this isn’t a post about the Jets winning or losing games. It’s about Wilson playing bad ball, which he is. The only thing he currently has going for him on the season is his low int %. This is peak Alex Smith we’re watching, and that will have very low long term returns if it doesn’t improve",1.0,nyjets,t3_yc78w0,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-10-24T16:11:09Z,nyjets,0.0077400441293962
14310,99918,99918,NannigarCire,"Discourse on Zach is reaching a very weird level of bad analysis imo. Zach is being protective and not costing us games, yes- this however is because unlike him all the other QBs since Sanchez that the Jets have played we’re also being forced to carry the team. Zachs sitting back and being allowed to play this way by circumstance. Once the game falls behind, that’s when he might start making all the boneheaded moves. The one time that happened, he didn’t- great sign and all but 1 game is not much of a sample. His YPA on the season and career (and this is the only basic stat that actually matters long term) is abysmal. Anything short of 6.7 is not even backup QB material, short of 7.1 is barely startable. He’s currently at 6.9 for the year and that’s awful. 

However I also believe that the offense is still not doing Zach favors for accruing stats. They’ve  correctly identified Wilson as their best WR, incorrectly utilized Moore, and as a result have given far too much of the easy layups to Corey Davis who is not dynamic or skilled enough to make an offense worthwhile. I really, really hope that if Davis missed this game and the coaching staff brings Moore back in, they get their heads out of their asses and don’t force Moore to run clear outs for Mims/Jeff Smith of all players.

14313,99921,99921,NannigarCire,"He's not those guys, but it's not really relevant. Moore isn't those guys because he wasn't in the opportunity to be them, and he believes he can be them if he gets the opportunity. So why are the Jets putting him in a spot where he isn't being able to show his worth, after he proved he belongs on a field to do so? For all we know, without injury last year Moore puts up 1k yards.

Sure, it's impatient. But he doesn't have a duty to be loyal to the team. That's something fans imagine. These guys are just employees. If you join a company that sucks for you, you're not forced to see it through.

Winning doesn't do much for his career though, Byron Pringle and Demarcus Robinson were on the winning team for their entire career, and got basically a similar amount of opportunities as Elijah now. They got very bad deals on the market, they're also much less talented. The Jets W-L record matters to Jets fans and organization loyalists. Moore's seeing the writing on the wall as him being an expendable part of the offense that isn't going to bring him in more. And whether its because of his ego/pride or him looking ahead to career earnings, he's seeing a team that wants to stay this way- run heavy, and keeping him expendable. That's his perspective and the organization isn't doing a convincing job showing him otherwise. 

Like think about it- Moore didn't do this week 4. he didn't do it week 5. What was different about week 6? My guess, is week 6 Garrett Wilson was covered by Jaire Alexander for the majority of the game. And even so, in that situation where the defense has put their best corner on your top WR- the Jets still chose to keep Moore in a suppressed, low volume, high decoy position. No manufactured touches or screens (which really is a travesty given our personnel lets be honest), no moving Garrett outside for Jaire to follow him there and have Garrett run a few decoy routes to remove Jaire from plays and open the field for Moore/Davis. He was just gone. And the Jets won. They have no intention to change their strategy. I bet he talked to the OC prior to that game, maybe he was even told this would be his week. But it's not coming.

People are reacting to the only part of the story they have, Elijah is asking for a trade. I don't know what's going on in the management/coaching meetings/private meetings he has with whoever, but i do know what the Jets are doing with Moore on the field is kind of dumb.

14314,99922,99922,NannigarCire,"Tyler Boyd already got paid though. He got 43 million before either of Higgins or Chase joined the team. Hardman doesn't complain for his own reasons, but Hardman has also been given a lot of opportunities to perform and has failed to do it. His situation is different in that sense. Moore's not being given the opportunity this year, and last year when he was he performed, he's just being purposely utilized in a low volume offense to open the field for other guys. He's the sacrifice, and i'm guessing he wasn't told he'd be the sacrifice going into the season. I'd guess this is the biggest problem, that there was no reason for him to enter the season thinking he'd get sacrificed. I also would imagine that for Hardman, playing with Mahomes on a pass-first team is a great place for his career to get a random boost anyway, than on a new team. It's not the same calculation for Moore. Even if the situations were the exact same though, Moore has no duty to be loyal to the Jets. They are just a business. This isn't a hobby club. It's a for-profit business. And the business would, and has, made decisions that would punish a player for wanting money when they deserved it anyway. It's not necessary for Moore to be loyal to the team, the team has to earn players loyalty too. They aren't beholden to the team. I personally side on the players just for that reason alone, and whatever internal conversations have now led to two second round WRs wanting to leave the team in their sophomore years is saying they're not good at making these guys want to be loyal.",2.0,nyjets,t3_y9pm1y,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-10-21T10:11:05Z,nyjets,-0.0029741262348138

Look at Byron Pringle and Demarcus Robinson, both played on a winning top offense as ancillary decoy options. Neither got a very good deal when they hit FA.

14319,99927,99927,NannigarCire,"personally, i support Moore. Whether it's ego/pride, or just wanting to make sure he has the money for the future- team loyalty for a player is stupid. The jets have him running clear out routes for the new guy and one of the most mediocre veteran WRs in the league on a run first team that's winning games- aka not likely to change their formula. I can see the writing on the wall, i'm sure in conversations with the OC, he can be absolutely certain what the writing is too. And it's not like it's working very well either, Jets are 23rd in yards per drive and 24th in points per drive. The defense is what's doing the work of helping the offense be effective. And then the offense is primarily focused on running the ball. It's not conducive for the guy who came into the season as the clear top guy, was the star MVP of off-season practices (""unguardable"" as some beat writers would say about him) and then suddenly made into a ghost on the field schematically- because there's nothing forcing the Jets to put Moore into this position instead of Garrett/Davis.

As a ""jets fan"" aka a guy who turns on the tv when they play, it sucks. But the Jets team would easily make a business decision with any player if they had to. Moore's making a business decision for himself, cool. Championships aren't real, money is though. It's kind of like being at a startup for a year or two and getting passed over for a promotion in favor of some new guy after you've put in tons of work at the foundation, but having management tell you ""our stock is killing it rn!!"" to make up for it. 

I don't think it'll affect the Jets much, Moore isn't really suited for a decoy role anyway. Just go pick up John Ross in FA and you'll get about the same value, and maybe even more because Ross can actually take the top off a defense. But it is extremely stupid, imo, for the Jets to have put themselves in a situation where Garrett gets the top coverage (unchangeable), Moore gets the second hardest coverage as the clear out option (schematically); and then the worst of the three starters, Corey Davis, is given the easiest coverage (also schematically).

16219,106957,106957,OrangElm,"Not much asked of him so far *this season* bro, he had way more asked of him last year and he’s about to have much more asked of him.

Did you see me calling for him to be benched. The ZW defenders here need to stop strawmanning every single person who says something bad about him. Zach NEEDS to start every game for the feast of the season to see if he can develop. No shit, he’s all we have at the moment and our future depends on his development. 

But the more I see from him, the worse I feel. Where is the big step we needed? Zach had like a nearly all time rookie performance last year. This year he is finally completing screens I guess? He’s still missing open guys on easy throws, EVEN WHEN we aren’t asking much if him. 

If you think this take is about Denver then you need a wake-up call. Zach has had like a SINGLE complete game from a film perspective. Even in the Titans game he looked bad missing easy short throws and then hit that long bomb downfield. 

And I wouldn’t say it’s a guarantee he does any better, because now we need him more. Let’s see how he does without a strong run game. 

Again I’m rooting for Zach. I want to be wrong. But I am extremely concerned, and any Jets fan who isn’t is either not watching or in denial. He has not looked good. Let’s hope that changes. But again if he doesn’t look good by end end of the year it’s time to bring some new blood in.",1.0,nyjets,t3_ycce12,False,0.0,:WSB:,2022-10-24T14:35:13Z,nyjets,0.0291878152006702
16220,106958,106958,OrangElm,"He wasn’t really. There were interceptable passes thrown and all this man was asked to do was complete short passes. You know he doesn’t have a 300 yard game yet? Bailey Zappe already does.

Wilson is not having much asked of him, and he looks at BEST serviceable when he’s only asked to check down. Him only needing to throw 18 times and him not throwing a pick in that game is NOT some great thing. It’s like borderline a good thing. At least he can not turn it over in 18 plays, and we all celebrate that because he was somehow even worse last year.

The one game of his entire career where he looked like a legit QB was the buccs last year and that’s IT. He has flashes in other games, but he never looks like the guy consistently throughout a game. He’s played 17 in his career now. Good players make things happen, and bad players get excuses. I’m sick of excuses.

I desperately want Zach to be that guy. I love his personality and the team rallies around him. But if he doesn’t start showing more progress this season I’ll be on board with bringing in some new talent next year. We all saw what happened in 2009/10. Let’s not delude ourselves here.

You didn’t see Devonta smith requesting a trade week 1 after no targets. This doesn’t happen. We are winning games and he’s so me focused that rather than work it out with coaches, he wants to leave.
