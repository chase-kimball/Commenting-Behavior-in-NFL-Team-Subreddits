It's obvious that Pederson is a good coach but his wanton aggression is beginning to elicit some concern from me. Over the past few weeks he and his staff have made some truly baffling game management decisions that have all but certainly taken points off the board. While I am pleased he has the confidence and faith to trust this team to convert, at some point you need to comprehend the limits of your personnel and take what the other team gives you.

Speaking of taking points off the board, over the four game losing streak this team has had a red zone turnover in 3 out of the 4 games. Yet more points coming off the board from a combination of inexperience and sloppy execution; this team is at least 4-3 if those never happen, especially considering that all 3 of them occurred when the offense was almost assuredly going to punch it in for 6 on the corresponding drive.

It should also be noted that this team has been totally putrid in the 4th quarter this season barring the Chargers game. If the defense isn't surrendering the lead, the offense is stagnating at the most pivotal point. For instance, the offense had the ball 3 times in the 4th quarter yesterday and accrued 0 points from them while the defense committed a bevy of penalties to essentially gift the Giants the winning TD. Again, everything is a factor but it's understandably difficult to win games when you only contribute during the first 45 minutes.

Finally, Trevor played horribly against Philly and Houston but does deserve some credit for bouncing back over the past two weeks; at least you cannot pin the losses entirely on him. That said, while I understand he is in the middle of an ersatz rookie season, I do not think it's out of line to ask him to step up and win a game for this team. He was drafted #1 overall and yet whenever he needs to deliver a drive he has fallen woefully shy of expectations. I know he is still young but it would go a long way towards believing he is the future cornerstone of the franchise if he could just score some points when it mattered.

TL;DR: Team is better than 2-5, critical mistakes from the coaching staff, the offense in the red zone and the entire team in the final 15 minutes are culpable for the poor record.",3.0,jaguars,t3_yc6bbx,False,0.0,:WH1::WH2::WH3:,2022-10-24T05:02:16Z,jaguars,-0.0480986027604058

Week 6 - Defense gives up the go ahead score after the offense retakes the lead.

Week 7 - Defense gives up the lead by committing dumb penalties. Offense has the ball 3 times and doesn't score.

Neither side of the ball can do a damn thing in crunch time either, the defense folds like a wet paper towel while the offense never gets going without Trevor sailing 10 passes over his receivers heads.

What he didn't realize is it was maxing out his weekly acquisitions(6), and now he can't pick up a kicker/defense for Sunday. He found someone in the league to trade with, a trade that included a kicker/defense.  

The issue is, trades take 2 full days to process so it wouldn't go through until Monday. Now the commissioner is talking about pushing the trade through so these guys have their players for Sunday. We have had the commissioner ""push through"" 2 trades in maybe 4 or 5 years and both times it was standalone trades that weren't a result of someone messing up their adds AND they were unanimously agreed upon by the league. I'm the opponent for the guy who messed up his adds, so commish will kinda screw me if he pushes this through. Am I crazy for pushing back on this?

Whether they have progressed since early this season is a different question, and the reality is the Jaguars pretty much have been the same team in a lot of games since Week 1. They have been a very productive offensive team that hasn't always scored as well as they have moved. They consistently have run well in many situations but haven't been a great running team in must-run situations. They were a very good takeaway team defensively early in the season and haven't forced a turnover in the last three games. They haven't really been a great pass-rushing team all season and haven't improved much in that area. They haven't been great in clutch moments offensively or defensively late in games, and mistakes have hurt throughout the season. None of this means the Jaguars can't do these things.
