- Justin Fields needs to throw the ball away a little more.

- RB duo is very successful

- OL was actually quite a bit better, but they have much work to do.

- JF1 has butter fingers and must hold onto the ball

- Pettis is quite a good utility guy.

- we truly had good execution and that showed.

- the game was called to JF1’s skill set.
