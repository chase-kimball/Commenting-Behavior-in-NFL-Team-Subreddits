SS if Edmunds isn’t back, although I suspect that’s a priority signing.

Oline, particularly C/LG. C is more of a reach because Cole is still under contract, but ideally a guard with versatility.

I also think context and quality of opponent matters, as well as reps taken. Kenny has played better teams, with less time preparing with the starters.

When the Bills are up 4 scores, he’s not going to have a high Y/A. They’re going to play off ball zone coverage and keep everything in front of them. They’ll give up short completions. That’s also the best team in the AFC at 5-1, on the road. The Bucs have a very good defense, but Mitch outplayed Kenny when he came in off the bench and the Bucs aren’t great, sitting at 3-4 (still leading their division though). Miami is a good team sitting at 4-3 (probably 6-1 if Tua doesn’t get hurt), with an aggressive defense on the road, but I didn’t think Kenny played great in this one either. Then up next you have the best team in the NFL.

Mitch started against a good jets team and got benched, 2 teams with losing records (2-5 browns, 3-4 pats) and the 4-3 bengals.

Realistically, did you expect to win any of:

Bills, Bucs, Dolphins or Eagles?

Prior to the 4 game gauntlet it was pretty much accepted we would be like 1-7 or 2-6 at best.

Now we are 2-6 or 3-5 at best, with a MUCH easier schedule down the stretch, and help coming (Kazee, Watt back, Leal back, CBs healthy, CAIII?)

We’ll start winning some games and Kenny will look better. I think no matter what, this is a mulligan year. He could toss 25 picks and still get an opportunity next year. He needs a preseason with the 1s, knowing he has job security as the starter and a competent OC, so next year is going to be very telling.

16494,100856,100856,ItsYourBoyD,">a lot of those picks are coming during clutch time

I don’t know if I FULLY agree with this, but I do to an extent.

2, arguably 3, of his 7 picks are during crucial moments of games

The 2nd one against the Jets, which he shouldn’t have thrown, but hits Pat in the hands and bounces straight up to get picked. The 2nd and 3rd ones against Miami are bad. One should have been DPI (first against Miami). Two were essentially Hail Marys or arm punts (first career pass Vs jets, Hail Mary Vs Jets). Bills one was bad but it’s just trying to make something happen before half while getting blown out. 

Mitch who is a 5th year vet had 3 total TDs in 4 starts (1 week 1, 1 week 2, 0 week 3, but had 1 rushing TD, and 0 week 4) as well as 1 TD in relief during the Bucs game, so 4 scores total.

##Stats

Mitch: 3 passing TDs, 1 Rushing TD, 2 INTs in 18 quarters + an OT.

Kenny has 2 Passing TDs, 2 Rushing TDs, 7 INTs in 12 quarters. 

Kenny is turning the ball over more (as expected by a rookie) but he’s also taking chances. The problem with Mitch was how safe he was playing. When Kenny came in, we were leading the league in passes BEHIND the LOS. Mitch was playing like he didn’t want to lose, rather than like he was trying to win. It wasn’t even game manager level. Mitch looked the best coming off the bench against the Bucs.

Also, the offense is just bad. The play calling is bad. The scheme isn’t great, but isn’t horrible. But we’re struggling to score points regardless of who’s at the helm. The offense has moved the ball better though since Kenny has started. If Kenny limits the turnovers over the next couple games, he’ll have a much better looking statline than Mitch did, and that’s playing IN Buffalo, IN Philly, IN Miami, against a good Bucs D, and coming in relief against the Jets.",12.0,steelers,t3_yd53rf,False,0.0,:SOTN1::SOTN2::SOTN3::SOTN4: Shut Out The Noise,2022-10-25T10:43:12Z,steelers,0.0416773558292934

3. Hail Mary last play of the jets game 🤷‍♂️ 

4. Bad pick against Buffalo, just trying to make something happen before half. Throws into double coverage, under throwing a deep pass to Diontae. ❌

5. Should’ve been DPI. You don’t really know if that’s a good or bad ball, because the defender interfered with the play. 🤷‍♂️

6. Tried to fit it in a window that wasn’t there, and a great safety makes a play. Bad pick. ❌

7. Just a bad rookie mistake. Run out of bounds, pick up the yards and stop the clock, OR, as OP noted, give the WR a chance in the back corner. Probably worst one of them all, and just a miscommunication between him and Diontae, which is corrected with time developing some chemistry. ❌ 

Most are on him, but 3 starts im willing to chalk those up to rookie mistakes and learning experiences.

Mental mistakes, 3rd and 1 driving with momentum -turned 3rd and 16. Drive killing penalties to start drives, where it becomes a punt fest.

During said punt fests, Harvin has been bad. He needs to completely flip the field, enough of these 30-40 yard punts, we need bombs. He has no consistency, and he could be gone next year. 

The 2 minute drill was sloppy, a lot of time wasted. You need basically the entire length of the field with no timeouts, you can’t waste any time.

Everyone jumping on Pickett, but listen. Guy wasn’t taking reps with the 1s. This is his third start, going on the road in primetime against a good dolphins team. The offense ABSOLUTELY needs to do more, more chunk plays, more points, fewer turnovers, but it isn’t all bad. He drove us down twice, and killed us with turnovers twice.

>Miami traded their assets so they could draft a QB

They gave up an all pro free safety and used the pick they got to draft.. NOT TUA…. But Austin Jackson, OT, USC. They’d take that trade back in a heartbeat. Hes a starting calibre OT. You don’t trade an all pro to get someone who’d be easily replaceable like him. Their Oline is also worse than ours. 

>Steelers are in need of a LT

yeah… idk how to tell you this, but Dan Moore is going to be around for a LONG time. The only guy that won’t stick around very long is probably Dotson, or if someone walks in FA. We don’t invest heavily in the Oline, PARTICULARLY at OT. Never have and probably never will. 

>might as well do that when not making the playoffs

Who said that? They’re a game back of the North and starting to get healthy. If Baltimore keeps choking away games, we’ll be right in the thick of things for the division late in the year.

We lost the North last year with a worse roster by 1 game to the AFC representative in the SuperBowl. This team isn’t some far off 1st overall pick contender. They’re a healthy defence away from playoff contention, and an OC/experience/depth away from contending.

Fully healthy we marched into Cinci with a brand new QB who isn’t very good, and won.

And regarding playoff success, we’ve had deep runs and talented teams and like everyone else just get unlucky sometimes. Sometimes we’re outplayed, sometimes our best players don’t play in games at the same time (only 3 playoff games with big 3 killer Bs all playing), sometimes you just run into a buzzsaw.
