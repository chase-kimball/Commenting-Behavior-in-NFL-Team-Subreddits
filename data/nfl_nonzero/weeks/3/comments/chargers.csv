>Yes, it has happened multiple times. First you have to understand that when a team wins the coin toss, they win the option to make the choice in the first half or the second half. If they take the first half choice then they have the option to kick or receive and regardless of what they choose, the other team will have the option to kick or receive in the second half. There was a NFC Championship game in 1986 between the Redskins and the Giants. The Giants won the coin toss and took the option to kick the ball off so that they would be playing with the strong wind at their back in the first quarter. In the second half the Redskins elected to receive even though they would be playing with up to a 30mph head wind. The Giants kicked off both halves and their strategy worked as they beat the Redskins 17–0.
