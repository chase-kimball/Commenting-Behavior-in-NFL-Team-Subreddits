Dorsey could not control what our D did, but with his knowledge and trust of our O I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility to say that he had *some* influence as to how long the O could stay in the field, i.e. how he could keep the D *off* the field. 🤷‍♂️",1.0,buffalobills,t3_xoihl7,False,0.0,:still-bill:,2022-09-26T12:31:57Z,buffalobills,0.0029632415980795

It was the offense’s mistakes (no blame - they happen) that cost us, not Dorsey’s calls. The stat line shows that, I believe. Insane offensive numbers. You only lose that with mistakes. His frustration was that even after all those things out of his control he could still eek in a W but the mistakes kept happening. Don’t blame his reaction.

To echo the sentiment—credit where credit’s due—props to the Fish, especially their *Defense*. Others will point out our depleted D vs. Tua, but really the credit belongs to their Defense. Far from perfect, but considering the ass-stomping we gave the Rams and Tits, it was enough to get the job done. The silver lining for Buffalo here, in my opinion, is that much of our offensive issues that came can be addressed in time for late season.
