11376,84407,84407,Kwall267,"I still think we have a good team. Our WR group is as good as we have had since 2015, RBs as good as we have had since the Rex days. DL is a good mix of young and veteran talent. LB are fast and experienced and our CBs are over preforming as well. The three big glaring issues are QB play (currently), OL, and Safety. 

Flacco is not a starter in this league. At best he’s a veteran presence in the locker room. Jury is still out if Zach is the guy. I really hope he is because he’s perfect for NY and so much fun to watch when he’s playing his game well. 

Our guards should be the one best duo on the league. AVT is getting better and better every game but so far Tomlinson has underperformed. Having a rotating door of tackles will ruin an offensive line. If Becton isn’t the guy that needs to be priority number 1 this off-season. Mitchell is showing promise but isn’t a starter right now either. 

Safeties, while often viewed as a luxury, have been a liability. Particularly Joyner. He and Sauce haven’t been in the same page at all this season. Also, twice now this season whitehead has gone for the big hit without wrapping up the ball carrier and bounced right off of them and given up touchdowns.

Saleh’s philosophy has always been to treat players as adults, not scream at them, condescend or degrade. This is why players loved him in SF. But that can’t come at the expense of accountability.
