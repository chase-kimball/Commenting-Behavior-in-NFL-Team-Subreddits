23211,126982,126982,baha24,"> our opponents have been ass

So I promise I'm not trying to just be Pollyannaish here, but this is what I would say about our performance against seemingly weaker opponents so far:

- I was genuinely worried about that Seattle game. There were too many emotions going into it, and as Dave Logan has said, because it was Week 1, the Seahawks didn't know yet that they're supposed to suck this season. So they had tons of unearned confidence going into the game. Moreover, the game was *at* Seattle *in primetime.* Despite all that, our offense actually looked surprisingly good. We lost because of one too many miscues, which it's reasonable to chalk up to rookie coach, no pre-season for most players, things still needing to gel for the offense, etc. If we play that game any other week/not in primetime, I think we win with ease.

- As for Houston and SF, there was only one thing I knew about each of those teams heading into the matchups: despite their ""bad"" and ""meh"" perceptions, respectively, both boasted good defenses. SF has allowed the third-fewest PPG this season (behind, funnily enough, us!). Houston is ranked 12th. Our defense did the job it was supposed to do, and our young offense did just enough against stout units to get the wins.

I actually agree with much of what you said, and I'm not trying to be unreasonably green-eyed about all this. I'm just saying I think there are sincere reasons why those games were all closer than many of us think they should have been. That said, LV is giving up the 9th-most PPG and 12th-most YPG, so I really hope we see the offense finally start to click this week.",3.0,denverbroncos,t3_xpio1d,False,0.0,Kenny,2022-09-27T14:30:55Z,denverbroncos,0.0445967521991514
