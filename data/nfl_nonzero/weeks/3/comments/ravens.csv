He has more TDs than all other NFL teams. He’s leading the league in passer rating. The Ravens are tied for the second best record in the NFL. 

Judge is having a remarkable year, tops in HRs, near the top in BA, RBIs, hits. I have no idea on his fielding stats. His season is very good, but not record setting.

31630,178183,178183,ZombieFeedback,"The ugly truth about playing defensive back is that everyone gets embarrassed sometimes. League average passing yards per-game last year was 228.3, and half of the league is above that. You can't hit that with just checkdowns. It's like playing baseball, even the absolute best of the best know they're walking back to the dugout without a base around 70% of the time. Failure rate isn't quite that high for good DBs, but everyone is going to lose sometimes, even the best guys, especially with how the rules stack the deck so heavily in favor of WRs and the passing game nowadays. Players like Darrelle Revis who basically never got burnt or Ed Reed who know the offense better than the quarterback does are the exception to the exception to the exception. 

Adapting to a league with bigger, faster, stronger, smarter players is already a tall task. That's true at any position, but doing it at a position where failure is just a part of life, *and* your mistakes are magnified in a major way - a lot of fans won't even notice or be able to tell a defensive lineman messing up his assignment, but everyone is going to see a blown coverage, especially if it's a touchdown and gets stuck on a highlight reel - is asking for egg on your face.

I'm confident they'll get it worked out in time. I'm not expecting Pepe or Armour-Davis to develop into the next pair of all-pro corners, but I think once they get their NFL legs under them, they'll be solid players behind Marlo and Peters, the new versions of guys like Anthony Averett, Tavon Young, Brandon Carr, etc.. Hamilton we already saw big improvement from against New England, and I think we're going to continue seeing gradual improvement over the course of the year. I don't know if he's a pro bowler or all-rookie or anything, but I think the guy we see against Cincy in week 17 is a much better safety than the guy we've seen in September.
