Turnovers have been the difference, which, amazingly, kind of feels good based on preseason expectations.

We were in all 3 games, more or less. Losing to a team that dropped 42 on the ravens and beat the bills isn’t such a bad look.

Losing to the ravens primarily because we turned the ball over, also wasn’t an indictment of the team.  Mac fucked up, but he looked great launching bombs until he got hurt.
