This is a bit of an exaggeration. There were reports that Nick Sirianni won the HC job specifically because he laid out a hiring plan that impressed ownership, and many of the assistant coaches came from Sirianni's background.

Also, it was famously reported that Lurie called Pederson into his office and made him explain why the Eagles were running the ball so much. It's well-known that Lurie wants a team built around the passing game. And yet, as a first-time HC, Sirianni was apparently given leave to transform the Eagles into a power running team.

Everyone wants to take a side in a divorce. Pederson defenders suggest that the Eagles front office has become power-hungry and controlling. Lurie defenders suggest that Pederson is a dope who was propped up to a Super Bowl on the backs of his assistant coaches. The truth, as always, is likely far more mundane and exists somewhere in the middle; the Eagles were regressing year by year (for reasons we can all debate), the coach and owner disagreed on how to stop the skid, and they agreed to part ways.",52.0,nfl,t3_xqua12,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2022-09-28T22:36:12Z,eagles,0.00362069181912

He didn't play with the ball as high, so he had to come up to throw more and that caused his lateness and under throws deep. This year, he's playing higher up and more on time, causing his deep ball to be much better. It also helps having three different dudes who can all go get it deep.
