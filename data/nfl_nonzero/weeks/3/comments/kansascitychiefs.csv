5631,40620,40620,ChevalMalFet,"Well, let's look at the negatives first:

* Most devastatingly, we blew one of our few 'easy' games on the schedule. The Chiefs missed a massive opportunity to gain ground on AFC rivals like Buffalo or LAC. The Bills only have a few losses on their schedule, and blowing a game like the Colts stings, because we need every game if we're going to host the AFCCG again. Doing that should be our goal this season, since that gives us the best chance of making another SB. Today was a big blow to those hopes. 
* Remember, football is a high-variance game. Weird fluky things are *going* to happen every single game. You are *going* to have injuries, you are going to have missed calls, you are going to have unlucky bounces on should-have-been catches or shouldn't-have-been-turnovers. It's your job as a team to play well enough that the luck *doesn't matter.* If this is a 3-score game as it probably should have been, none of these unlucky bounces matter. So don't blame the refs, or bad luck. Yes, they played a part, but the Chiefs could have just *played better* and not been a position where one egregious unsportsmanlike conduct flag costs them the game. 
* Special teams cost them the game - probably a 14-point swing all by themselves. Skyy muffing one punt, downing another at the 1, cost the offense two drives and gave the Colts 7 points. Butker's injury (thanks, Arizona) led to a missed PAT, a missed FG (shit, we just get those and we win and are talking about the offense getting bailed out) and another fake FG since we don't have a kicker. Special teams took what should have been a blowout even with our faulty offense and made it a game. 
* Offense cost them the game. I'm more worried about this than special teams - rookies will make mistakes and Butker WILL come back (he, uh, he *will* come back, right?) and Toub consistently fields one of the better units in the league. But we should never have been in a position where even spotting the Colts a free TD and blowing 7 points of our own decided things. Three major concerns:
 - Trading Tyreek was supposed to see his production replaced with a bunch of targets for Mahomes to spread the ball around to. Today, no one besides Kelce got open. That's two weeks in a row where if we don't have Kelce *we have no offense.* That's the most worrisome thing about the game so far. The WR *has* to figure out how to beat man coverage or this team is cooked. 
 - OL, especially Brown, got beaten repeatedly, after getting beat by the Chargers, and after the Cardinals were able to get some pressures, too. That's a problem, since the OL was supposed to be a strength. Mahomes has been hurried two weeks in a row and has to resort to streetball - except Juju, MVS, and Hardman can't play streetball, so, again, we come back to *literally only Kelce can do anything on offense*. 
 - As has been the case since 2020, the run game was weak. Mahomes was literally pointing out the holes to CEH for him to run through (instead CEH bounced outside and was TFL). 

* The offense failed in every phase today, but STILL would have scored 3 TDs had Kelce not dropped the dagger (just like he missed a wide open endzone last week and was stuffed by Derwin James - two uncharacteristic mental errors in two weeks by him, but he'll figure it out). So we CAN and should dominate on offense, but we're not going to hit our potential until we figure our identity out. 

* Defense was rock-solid and also cost them the game. Without Moore's fumble and the soft call on CJ, they held the Colts to two field goals. Missing 3 starters and they performed about as well as the Jags did last week, and the Jags' defense is for real (holding the Chargers to 10). Just got unlucky at the worst possible time - that call *was* horseshit but you *shouldn't be in that position to begin with*.

* The defense made hardly any mistakes, but if they had made one fewer, we win.
* The offense made a ton of mistakes, but if they make one fewer, we win.
* Special teams was complete, unmitigated disaster, a horror show, a catastrophe. If they had made one fewer mistake, we win. 

All in all, the team isn't *doomed* but this was a colossal missed opportunity, and while I'm confident in the defense, feel like ST will figure it out, I'm worried about the *offense* of all things.",58.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_xog1c7,False,0.0,"Pat ""Kermit"" Mahomes",2022-09-26T06:41:15Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0195920284309833

8144,56572,56572,Darkagent1,"Yeah man sorry if I came off aggressive. This isn't super obvious. 

Basically a chain crew consists of 4 people. 2 holding the LOS and the first down (the orange ones with dots, also called the ""sticks"" and I will be referring them as such), 1 holding the box (the down indicator) and the 4th handling the clip. The two sticks are held together by a literal chain that is measured and known to be 10 yards. When a first down is signaled the sticks guys will run to where the spot is put one side down and pull on the other side so there is no slack on the chain connecting them. That is 10 yards and becomes the line to gain (the first down). At this time the 4th guy with the clip will pick one of the big lines (every 5 yards is a big line) and will literally clip the clip to the chain link between the sticks on one of the sides of the big line (this is pregamed with them to maintain consistencies). So there is now a marker that basically says ""this chain link should be exactly on this yard line"" and now that is the anchor for where both of the sticks should be.

When a measurement comes, one official holds down the ball at the spot, one official takes the clip and places it on the yardline exactly where it was clipped, and one official pulls on the first down stick until it has no slack. Then the stick is placed on the ground and the white hat looks to see if the ball is past it. 

This is also used when flipping the field in between quarters to set up the sticks at the correct position on the field just flipped. The clip is used as the anchor and the sticks are just where the clip is with no slack.

31883,213098,213098,SylvesterTaurus,"Here are my biggest observations on all 3 phases so far this season. I‚Äôm no high-level expert, so these are just my fan opinion. Love to hear what y‚Äôall think:

Offense. Our lack of a consistent run game is what‚Äôs holding us back to the most. The playcalling looks bad because we don‚Äôt have a complete offensive gameplan established and defenses aren‚Äôt adjusting to account for the run. This seems to be a combo of the O-Line and backs not hitting the right holes depending on the play. Obviously we still can win despite this because Patrick, but not having a reliable run game puts way too much on him and the pass-catchers to produce. Not having a true running threat in the backfield is severely limiting what our offense is capable of. 

Special teams: Yes it was an especially terrible game for special teams yesterday (except Townsend punts). However, the return unit has never seemed fully right to me. We have 2 rookies returning kicks. No hate to Skyy or Pacheco, but Hardman is a proven returner and can even be a game-changing one too. I understand he has more of an offensive role now, but he‚Äôs needed in the return game again. I was actually surprised initially that we didn‚Äôt keep another WR or DB that returns kicks. As for kicking, not having Butker (probably the #2 kicker in the league) has proven to be a core thing that moves the needle for this team. Ammendola was perfect against the Chargers (lest we forget), and he had a bad kicking game yesterday (it happens). However, I blame the coaches for not letting him kick the FG we ran a fake in to get his confidence right. I don‚Äôt give Ammendola fault for yesterday nearly as much as the coaches who put him in those situations.

Defense: This defense has the chance to be something special, and we don‚Äôt even have all our starters playing yet. We have some dogs and they have been playing very well to start the year, which is incredible given Spags‚Äô scheme. I‚Äôm hoping that means we‚Äôll be even better as the season goes on as the full defensive playbook gets unlocked and we have all our core guys on the field. I also want to give a huge credit to Joe Cullen for helping push our defensive line to a new level already. Dunlap already looks like a A+ signing, Chris Jones is eating, Karlaftis is racking up pressures, and even Clark is making positive and visible contributions. One negative thing that stands out to me so far is our CBs aren‚Äôt playing the ball as much as they should. I can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs a young secondary thing, lack of emphasis from coaches, or player tendency. With the variety of size and speed with the CBs, I figured we‚Äôd be able to get more PBUs and contest for INTs. Taller receivers (e.g. Mike Williams) will eat us alive if that tendency doesn‚Äôt change. However, I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll think differently when McDuffie comes back because that‚Äôs a big strength of his. It‚Äôs also still Watszn, and he‚Äôs been a helluva find by Veach so far.

As much as I hate the loss, I‚Äôd rather get the bad plays and decisions out early than have a game like this late in the season or playoffs. I‚Äôm optimistic that this game highlights the key adjustments needed to get this team‚Äôs full potential in action. I‚Äôm also anxiously waiting for the trade deadline to see what move(s) Veach makes.
