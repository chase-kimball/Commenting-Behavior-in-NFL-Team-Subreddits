First touching is a violation, and the receivers shall have the option of taking possession of the ball at the spot of first touching, provided no penalty is accepted on the play, or at the spot where the ball is dead.

But I don't feel As let down with some of our losses in the past. Philly and Minnesota seem to be solid teams this year. We held Jefferson to 14 yards!! That in itself is a miracle, especially when Tracey Walker went out with an ankle issue. Swift seems banged up. St brown seems a bit banged up too. We still have some backups on out o line and we still seemed to get 5ish yards a run. It hurts but we will have that revenge game when it matters in December. Hurts, but isn't the end of the season.

27120,152657,152657,Pinkaroundme,"Every little thing we say expects perfect outcomes. If we make the FG, they end up at probably the 25 and have to drive 75 yards to win. As opposed to the miss giving them better position.

If we punt, it either sails into the endzone and they get a touchback, which would be the same scenario as a FG and touchback but with 3 less points, or you actually manage to pin them, which again, is not guaranteed in the slightest.

Or you go for it - either you miss it and they have the same field position, or you make it and the game is over. In terms of difficulty of executing the play, I’d argue pinning the team back with a punt and kicking the FG were about equal. Just because 56 would’ve been his longest FG doesn’t make it impossible. He’s a young kicker. He doesn’t have that many attempts. And Fox is much more often a guy who can boom a punt to the other side of the field and flip field position, not always exactly a pin them deep guy. 

Now. The coaching staff had to make a decision on this. In 30 seconds. And I took 5 minutes to type this shit out. It’s much harder in real life and in real time. 

All this to say - we can talk about punt vs kick vs 4th down try all we want, but the bias in us makes whatever decision we think is right into the best possible scenario, when we all know it often doesn’t end up like that despite your best plans.",6.0,detroitlions,t3_xondb5,False,0.0,Growley Cats,2022-09-26T14:54:11Z,detroitlions,0.0384930664062301

This offense runs through Goff and Swift and Saint. And if they aren’t on, it’s hard to win. That’s a fact. The truth is, this sub LOVEEESSSSS to overreact. It’s what this sub does best. 

A Lions win in week 2? Super bowl bound babyyy!!! 16-1 babyyyy!!!

A Lions loss in week 3? Doom and gloom. Where was hutch!? I can’t believe our rookie DE with 2 game experience did so shit! Honestly, bust. AG? Shit. Can’t do anything!

The truth is somewhere in the middle. But we love our extremes, because any sign of hope is so rare for us then when it happens, we clutch onto it and hold on for dear life. And we’re so used to losing then when we do, well it’s second nature. 

The middle ground is this - the Vikings are not a bad team. At all. Doubling a top 2 WR in the league took him out of the game, but left other receivers open. Our D is hella banged up and that contributed. Walker going out, and AO holding DBs because of trouble keeping up due to his injury. And our d-line missing players today.

Our O is hella banged up. Missing our two starting guards. Our star RB is on a major snap count and playing through pain. Amon Ra was in pain. So was Josh Reynolds. Our coaches made some questionable decisions. Stupid decisions. Baffling sometimes. It is what it is but this sub is so reactionary it’s honestly hilarious sometimes.

Secondly, going back to last year, since Anthony Lynn was taken out of the equation, this team has done more with less offensively than at any point in its history. That's not hyperbole - that's fact. We've got guys on the offense who have no business doing what they're doing from a historical perspective. I'm looking at the two games this year as only evidence of a continuation from what I saw at the end of last year. This is the first time I can recall actual *creative* coaching in Detroit, going along with some of the basic fundamental stuff working for once. I can't recall a time where I've seen the offensive line here effectively move people on a week-by-week basis. Sure, some of that is on effective personnel, but some of that is also on blocking scheme and knowing how to get the most out of your dudes.

I'm not pumping anything. If you don't like it, *pump off*.

He also had Barry Sanders in the backfield. While one year he went 10-6, the other two he was 9-7 and 5-11. 

I refuse to give *any* credit to any of the Lions coaching staff back then (with the exception of Fontes, because he was fucking awesome), because if they had a coaching staff worth their weight in shit, there'd have been no way they'd have lead teams with Barry Fucking Sanders to losing records. Dude had one season - ONE - when he put up less than 1,500 all purpose yards, and it's because he only played 11 games. If there was any level of creativity there, or competent QB play - which falls on coaches as much as it falls on a player - there's no way those teams wouldn't have been going on deep playoff runs and potentially winning Super Bowls. Parcells *wanted* to be here, but William Clay Ford was too cheap.

Tom Moore's successes all came with teams which had guys like Barry on them. I grant that it takes a good OC to maximize assets and succeed even when you have star power, but Ben Johnson is doing this shit with mostly a bunch of second year guys and Jared Goff. 

Swift is special. St. Brown is special. And Goff has proven that he can be a successful quarterback in the NFL. But the play design and creativity has been worlds apart from anything I've ever seen here in the past. Hell, it's even pretty damn creative as opposed to what I'm seeing by contemporary NFL teams. I'm not saying Ben Johnson is a prodigy or anything, and it's possibly he may wind up being nothing special, but since he and Dan stepped up to the plate and took over the offense from Anthony Lynn, the transformation has been quite apparent.

Pace finished 4th in the 1996 Heisman race as an offensive tackle. That is still incredible to me. Joe played in a regular pro offense. Pace was the reason the Greatest Show on Turf existed. The offensive coordinator turned head coach, Mike Martz designed an offense predicated on the 7 step drop back pass. Holy hell is that a long time for a left tackle to hold a block on a consistent basis game after gamer, year after year. It worked because Orlando Pace is a once in a generation talent. Once Martz tried to bring that same offense to Detroit without the dominant left tackle, his offense got exposed and almost got Detroit's QB's killed. In my opinion if you put Orlando Pace in a regular pro offense I think he would have become even more dominant and that is saying a lot.
