A lot of this goes for Jon Allen too but I don't have to stick up for him as much given his reputation.  

Additionally, the defense played more than well enough to win on Sunday and were completely let down by the offense this time.  I got no complaints with the defense b/c every NFL defense will wear down if their offense scores 0 points, has a 323 to -1 passing yard differential, and turns the ball over giving short fields.  The rules of the game are totally in the offenses favor so they can't hold the line by themselves an entire game especially when they're given short fields too.  How they only scored 24 is a miracle.

Once again, I repeat, at one point there was a 323 to -1 passing yard deficit - and we even abandoned a totally functioning running game lol.

34367,273830,273830,ninjagruntz,"A common knock (I don’t particularly agree with it) on Chase Young is that he doesn’t develop elite pass rushing technique to overcome NFL linemen. He allegedly leveraged his size and speed to bull rush undersized defenders in college and racked up stats doing so. 

That said, Jamin Davis has never developed the technique to overcome linemen, let alone NFL caliber linemen, but people seem to think he can just leverage his speed to overwhelm? Have you ever seen that work? Look at the top players that get to the quarterback and you’ll see they have elite technique that they’ve developed and continue to masterfully improve.

Davis is over here learning how to tie his shoes. He’s been playing well where we’ve been utilizing him, but I wouldn’t think for a second he’s beating NFL linemen 1 on 1. He’s been lucky to be in the right place at the right time to make a play; he doesn’t create the opportunity like elite pass rushers do. 

For this reason, I see him further developing his strengths to become a sideline to sideline elite tackler, mobile QB spy, cover TE in passing situations so there’s not a mismatch against an undersized DB, but dropping him into protection against a WR, or trying to beat o line with technique seems like a big stretch that I’d love to be proven wrong on.",6.0,commanders,t3_xp205d,False,0.0,Fuck Dan Snyder,2022-09-26T20:54:24Z,commanders,0.0964790205130323
