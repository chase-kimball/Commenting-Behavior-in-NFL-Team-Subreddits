Weighted DVOA is the default measurement, which more heavily weighs later games as the season goes on. Some teams, like the Jaguars, have played way better than expected so far, so the DAVE stat combines DVOA with their preseason forecast to try for a more accurate projection for the rest of the season.

You can hardly say we didn't swing for the fences to replace Jimmy. We traded up to no. 3 overall and drafted a young, talented and athletic QB only a year removed from a Super Bowl appearance with Jimmy.

I think there's a fair amount to criticize Shanahan about, but trying to find a good QB is hardly one that can be attacked at this point. They made moves for Jimmy in 2017 and made moves for Trey. Now we can argue whether those decisions paid off ultimately, but I'd argue with a SB appearance and two NFC championship game appearances in since 2019 at least somewhat proves the admin has the right idea even if it's demonstrably hard to land a top 10 QB.

But we are in second place and will be in first if we win next week. The Cards look awful and so does Seattle. And the Rams look good but beatable, there’s a reason we are favored even without Trent. 

There’s a lot to be disappointed about, sure, we’ve laid two eggs and lost our QB1 for the year, plus we lost our LT and RB1 for long stretches. But the defense looks amazing. Kinlaw and Hufanga especially have really stepped it up this year. With our defense we should still be competitive in a lot of games, and yes, we will win some of them. 

Will it be enough to get us into January? Maybe, maybe not. But people are out here acting like we are the 2016 team. Yeah, let’s fire Kyle… I’d love to have another HC hired by Jed York. Jimmy is the absolute worst QB in team history… let’s start Brock Purdy. I’m not a Jimmy stan by any stretch of the imagination but that’s ridiculous. Jimmy is limited and has a lot of bad games like Sunday night but he’s a veteran who knows how to win in the system. Watch everyone be on his nuts again if we smoke the Rams next week.
