>“This team, if you look really closely, is not set up right to succeed,” a league source said. “It’s going to take time and patience and getting more of the players that Josh and Dave want in there before they can really be competitive.

The difference is that their defenses were good enough and/or the Raiders offense was bad enough that we came up short against them.

Against the Chargers and now the Titans, they gave up lots of points early on and that is always going to hurt the offense. The running game goes away and the entire game plan hinges on how the offensive line holds up and obviously that's not a strength for this team to say the least. 

Both those teams took their foot off the pedal and gave us a shot to win but their defenses did enough to close out the game. The only difference is that last week when we had the hot start and then relied on the defense it completely fell apart.

The I formation has the QB, FB, and HB lined up in a line like an ""I"". Theres some variants on it, like the Maryland Power I where you have 3 backs lined up behind the QB in a line.

There can also be slight offsets with the FB moved a couple yards to the Strong side (side with the TE) or Weak side (side away from the TE)

A lot of formations are called different things by different coaches though. For example, Bill Walsh used a formation where you had 2 WRs, a TE to one side, and 2 HBs lined up parallel to the line about 5 yards back. The FB would lineup directly behind the QB, and if the HB was on right side it would be the ""brown"" formation. If the HB was on the left side, it would be called the ""blue"" formation.

Basically the nomenclature started with the Wing T, way back before the forward pass was legal. The amount ""back"" they were was based on how far they were from the line of scrimmage. Quarter Back was closest to the line, Half Back next furthest back, and Full Back was the ""most"" back of the 3

Since then there's been a lot of changes in systems and responsibilities, so the ""fullback"" is now a blocker who lines up closer to the line than the Halfback, and the Halfback is what we think of as a 'modern' Running Back

EDIT: I got mixed up. There was a Quarterback, a Fullback, then a Tailback. Fullback and Tailback were around the same depth, and the Tailback would get the ball and follow the Fullback. There was also a ""Wingback"" which you only really see in triple option offenses nowadays, which lines up more like a modern tight end (but can get the ball on reverses, sweeps, etc)",14.0,nfl,t3_xo9agc,False,0.0,:Raiders: Raiders :Jaguars: Jaguars,2022-09-25T23:44:22Z,raiders,0.0063112890089163

I think our receivers are struggling to pick up the system and JMD is being way too aggressive with play calling. This is a weird team since we’re making a lot of big plays but failing to execute in key situations and thus losing close games.

At that point, there are basically two outcomes - we continue to suck ass and end up with good draft picks, or JMD and the team actually figure shit out and end the season strong.

37115,269243,269243,nimoto,">This is exactly what toxic positivity is.

No, I'm literally describing the behavior of an adult. Bad things happen, and sometimes we don't get our way, and you move on to the next one. I'm not happy about losing, and I don't need you to be happy about it. I'm just not foolish enough to think I have an explanation or way forward that would work better than what's already being planned by the people being paid to do that job. 

I think what you may not realize is that the lowest level person working for the Raiders has a better understanding of the team, players, coaches, and reasoning for specific decisions than we as fans ever will. You are less qualified than the equipment manager let alone the GM, and have access to less information than most of the Raiderettes. 

Have you ever heard Plato's ""allegory of the cave""? It's like that.

>So the losses are nobody's fault? Just remain ignorant and act like everything is gonna work out? After 20 years of mediocrity at best and abhorrent football at worst?

No, the losses are the fault of a myriad of factors, many of which have nothing to do with our team, and they are certainly *not* the fault of a single person. That really should be obvious. Football games are extremely complex with a huge number of factors that influence the outcomes. It's laughable to try to chalk any loss up to any specific player, coach or decision.",1.0,raiders,t3_xopeym,False,0.0,:Logo_95-Present:,2022-09-26T22:59:58Z,raiders,-0.0155870802595626
