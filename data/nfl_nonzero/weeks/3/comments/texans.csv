Most pressures: Great DE free agent pick ups

Niko Collins target depth: Mills is locked on Cooks unless it’s 3rd and long and he’s double/triple covered. Bad QB and OC combo.

Missed tackles: Bad linebacker and Dline play. The secondary missed tackles are because RBs get to the second level every play. The secondary is gonna have a ton of missed tackles if they lead the league in face time with RBs. 

Best allowed passer rating: 27.7 am I missing something here? If this is saying our defense did good, it’s because the Bears didn’t need to pass with their bad QB when their run game was boat racing our defense.

No WR touchdowns: Mills sucked

Rex Burkhead 3rd down targets: Too many things about this pisses me off. Mills has terrible check down habits, receivers aren’t open, Burkhead plays too many snaps. Mills sucks under pressure.

Broken tackles by an RB: David Montgomery against our soft linebackers and DTs.

Broken tackles by Pierce: That kid has talent. 

Rush yards given up: Again…our LBs and DTs suck.

Red Zone Defense: Our secondary can cover when the space is small. This is a product of defensive scheme. Open field means lots of inside pass space. Backed up against the end zone. We can play the receivers tighter in our scheme…

Most drops: Bad WR depth behind cook. Bad ball placement by Mills.

*Edit: Just saw your other comment wanting to consolidate these arguments into one chain - whoops!*

The season Watt put together in 2014 was absolutely superb. Do we think a defensive player with a less impressive season (and let's face it, we're not likely to see another season like 2014 Watt in a long, long time) but on a team that made playoffs will beat out a QB in voting? I don't think so. And I think the fact that the Texans missed the playoffs by one game is absolutely asinine when considering Watt's merit for winning MVP. Again, not blaming you - I'm blaming the voters for their hardline stance on making playoffs. 

If Watt had played for the Panthers in 2014 (who made the playoffs with a 7-8-1 record) instead of the Texans (who missed the playoffs with a 9-7 record) would he have won MVP? Would he have deserved to win because he had 2 fewer wins but made the playoffs? No sane person would say yes, but apparently the voters would.

That, to me, is the perfect illustration of why the ""Gotta make the playoffs"" argument is flawed.

Rodgers got the award because there were no transcendent RBs to bump him off the spot, and based on voting trends the last 15+ years the only real option for MVP is A) best QB with one of the best records, or B) RB that had an earth-shattering, record-breaking season and was also on a team that made the playoffs. And hell, even ""B"" doesn't really seem to be an option anymore because Derrick Henry arguably put together a better season than Adrian Peterson's MVP year in 2012, *and* finished with a better record, and didn't even pick up votes. He lost to - you guessed it - Aaron Rodgers. The other two players receiving MVP votes were Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes.

The next year - his sophomore year - he won DPOY with 20.5 sacks, 81 tackles, 29 TFLs, and an insane 16 passes defensed. He absolutely crushed Von Miller in voting, missing a unanimous selection because one jackass voted for Von Miller. Watt was the already being called elite in his 2nd year.

2013 was a down year for the Texans and for Watt, but he still put up 10.5 sacks and made the Pro Bowl. He picked up 2 votes for DPOY, just because there was no runaway candidate that year (Kuechly ended up winning w/ 38% of the votes).

2014 an 2015 were two more back-to-back DPOY years. Watt finally got his unanimous DPOY in 2014, and arguably should've been MVP. This was the year he did everything: they'd put him on offense in goal line packages as a lead blocker, he had 3 receiving TDs (on 3 targets, no less), he had an 80 yard pick 6 and 60 yard sack-fumble-6. He made first *and* second team All-Pro, as a DE and DT, respectively. Alas, MVP is an offense-only award, so it went to Rodgers. Still super salty about that, because if Watt didn't win MVP that year, no defensive player is **ever** going to win it. I mean, that was just an unbelievable season.

2015 saw him shed votes to Donald (7), Kuechly (4), and Josh Norman (2), but it was still a strong year w/ 17.5 sacks. This is where the injuries started to set in, as he fought through wrist and groin injuries all season.

2016 was a herniated disc, which he underwent surgery for in the offseason. He ended up playing Week 1, but getting shut down a few weeks into the season for back surgery again.

2017 saw his season shut down early again, this time for a broken leg in Week 5.

2018 was his return to form, where he stayed healthy all season and recorded 16 sacks (second most, behind Aaron Donald's 20.5) and a league-leading 7 forced fumbles.

2019 was another injury-shortened season after tearing his pec in Week 8. He returned in time for playoffs, though, helping us turn the tide against the Bills and win that game.

2020 was a healthy but down year. The Texans were ass and he saw the writing on the wall, requesting release from the team. Still makes me sad, man. Andre Johnson will probably always be my favorite Texans player, but J.J. Watt was the best we've ever had - and probably will retain that title for a looooooooong time.

2021 with the Cardinals got cut short with a shoulder injury in Week 7.

2022 started with an injury (calf strain) that caused him to miss Week 1, but we'll see how he fares the rest of the year.

- Pre-snap assessment is atrocious
- He has the pocket awareness of a womens clothing designer 
- No route progression. He locks on a target, and either makes the throw or panic throws to someone else
- Stares down the receiver too much
- Disappears in the moment (a good QB will step up when the game is on the line; Mills hasn't shown that quality yet)

Quick assessment: he plays like a good backup, and that's not a bad thing...if he's your backup. 
I've yet to see him do anything that made me sit up and say ""yes! that's the guy!"". 


As an example, Trevor Lawrance was pretty shit last year; but, he had flashes of Wow from time to time. You knew, this guy has the potential to be good. This year, he's showing improvement, showing that he is a starting QB, he's showing growth.
