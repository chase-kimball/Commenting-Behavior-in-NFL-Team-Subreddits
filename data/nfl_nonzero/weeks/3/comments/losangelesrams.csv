16311,156343,156343,Wapow217,"I have said this many times on multiple threads about Goff. 

HE IS A SUPER BOWL WINNING CALIBER QB.

You will not win because of Goff you will win with him. Which is a big difference. And one the few weaknesses of McVay. You can fish for a man and he eats for a day or you can teach him how to fish and will eat for a life time. McVay will fish for you. He creates offense off the players he has. He is currently doing it with the o-line and the bad Rb they have. 

Goff very well could be turned into a win because of if given the right coach, much like Brees. Goff has all the intangibles to do it but as we saw this last weekend will make bone headed mistakes from time to time which is where McVay was able to actually help. He created a Madden offense for Goff that was dumbed down. Most routes had two options the short pass if the DB goes long with the other WR or a long pass to the other WR as the db goes for the short WR. McVay would read the defense for Goff and tell him where to look and go. It wasn't till later in the season that teams began to pick up on this and would wait for the headset to turn off and then switch to the actual defense. Best example was the Bears.

This is why McVay wanted Stafford. With Stafford you can win because of him right now not just with. Stafford can over come those issues that Bears caused. Goff could have won the Super Bowl last year with the Rams as well but it would have depended more on the rest of the team which I don't think there was enough fire power on offense for Goff.

McVay can coach around any QB and make them look great by creating a system QB. But he is only getting them the fish. He is not teaching them how to fish though.  So the system QB will stay at just that or have little improvement compared to if you taught them how to fish. An example of this is Sean telling and talking to Goff and reading the defense for him up to the radio cut-off. That doesn't help Goff when the radio is off, the defense would then switch its coverage.  In the 2018 season, teams like the Bears started to hone in on this and just waited for the 24-sec mark when the radio shut off, and then they adjusted and it would through Goff off.

I made no exceptions about everything I claimed was an upgrade.

20933,172834,172834,barrenarrows,"To everyone calling tutu a bust, let‚Äôs consider this following statement. 

He was drafted with last years roster. We need to remember a few things about last years roster. The BIGGEST part was that our line was light years above this years like. We could actually have time of a deep threat. Tutu wasn‚Äôt used a lot because he was raw, but could develop and that‚Äôs a big reason for having Jackson as part of the WR group last season before he requested to leave. Tutu unfortunately (and I get it it‚Äôs assumed this would happen) got hurt on special teams last season so he never got to develop time with the 1‚Äôs to get into a rhythm.

I think a second issue is we didn‚Äôt expect or realize the issue with staffords arm was going to be as big of an issue as it‚Äôs become, he‚Äôs clearly not comfortable and is having issues pushing the ball deep downfield (yes I know teams are also playing two high shells which doesn‚Äôt help the situation)

Lastly, he was drafted to be a motion guy/deep threat. This sub acts like he was taken to be our WR 1 and that‚Äôs just not realistic. He‚Äôs a -late- second round pick and was seen to be a WR 3 at best.

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs great, I don‚Äôt think he was worth the pick given the other options available; but he wasn‚Äôt drafted to be the future rams HOF WR option on this team. The amount of hate he gets is so weird and dumb. Don‚Äôt be mad at him. He‚Äôs a dude playing wide receiver and wants to be great, if you follow him on IG he‚Äôs constantly working hard at doing what he can to contribute to the team. I‚Äôm waiting for the end of the season to come before I make an accurate thought on him.

The old ex-QB Stafford is sitting at 74/102 7.5 YPA /4 TD/5 INT rn. With a super bowl winning team no less. And now has a higher cap hit. 

Moreover, only Geno Smith has a lower cap hit than Goff and it's not as though Goff has Wentz dead cap space. Goff is squarely in the middle but has better squads than the Raiders, Commies, and Seahawks. 

If there's the cap space after the dead cap hit, then possibly the Lions can sign Jackson. There's still finding a trade partner for Goff; while $30 mil is a lot, it might make sense for Carolina, Seattle, or Houston (if Mills doesn't work out, long shot)

And no, I don't think Brad Holmes is building around Goff, but is building a well rounded team that can be taken to the next level when they move on. Goff, with a couple first round picks, isn't too bad to accelerate that vision. A possible 2 more years with Goff is enough time to find the next, best QB 1.

Goff had zero help in development when we drafted him under Fisher, and one of the first things McVay did was hire Greg Olsen to be his QB coach IIRC.

I think Goff really progressed as a player but definitely hit a ceiling with McVay in 2018, and both needed a fresh start from each other. 

Now in Detroit he‚Äôs in a make or break situation where he needs to take all the things he learned in LA and apply it, and he‚Äôs doing really well. I‚Äôm pretty proud of him after all of the jokes with how ‚Äúdumb‚Äù he‚Äôs supposed to be.
