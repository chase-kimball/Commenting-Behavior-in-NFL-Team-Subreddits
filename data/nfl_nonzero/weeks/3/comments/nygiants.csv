How tf are the Giants supposed to rebuild if we trade away known talent for unproven potential talent? You then have NO TALENT.

It doesn’t make sense. You don’t build a team that way. You build your team by adding new talent *around* your existing talent. Saquon is existing talent. And no one is trading away a 1st for an RB in their contract year.

Shoen even said in pre-season that Saquon is on a short list of players that you can build a winning Giants franchise around. So why the fuck do people think their “trade Saquon away for draft capital” arm-chair-GM lingo is a good idea? If that’s true then we should trade away our two first round picks from this year while we’re at it to get more potential future talent.

I *really* want KT to succeed. I think you are just being a little too emotional about this (no offense intended). I was excited about KT last year as well.

But his off season, all the bad media reports, all the injury excuses, etc. are starting to look real now that real games are occurring and KT isn’t contributing.

Defenses are not changing their entire game plan for a guy who has had one good game in his entire NFL career. That’s just your excitement about KT’s *potential* talking.

KT is NOT a player that opponent defenses have to build entire game plans around to defend, so there is no advantage lost when saying “KT Is not healthy” then to play him on game day because you were trying to psyche out the opponent last minute and make them change their game plan again before the game. So the coaches and these reports don’t need to be bullshit.

4752,48763,48763,DoABarrowRoll,"it's funny because a) I agree and I'm surprised it took the league this long and b) this is the first time since 2004 we've only had one MNF/SNF game

From like 05-15 we were regularly playing like 3-4 MNF/SNF games every year, and then the last few years it's been 2 or 3, and now we're down to 1. Which is a good choice, we suck, the ""NY media market"" excuse is lame.

we ""only"" have 2 prime time games this year, this MNF game, and then the late afternoon Thanksgiving game if that also counts, (also against Dallas funny enough), which pretty much just counts for the TNF game every team has to play during the year. I guess if you count the international game as ""prime time"" too then it's 3 but I personally don't.

Teams that didn't get a MNF game (which they really should give every team a MNF or SNF game no matter how bad they are imo): 

ATL (1 TNF), 

CAR (1 TNF), 

DET (Thanksgiving early afternoon), 

HOU (1 TNF), 

JAX (1 TNF, 1 INTL), 

MIA (1 TNF, 1 SNF)

NYJ (1 TNF)

Take out the TNF games since every team plays at least one, and go back through the last few years for the Giants:

In 2021 we played 2 MNF games (losses to KC and TB, who thought that was a good idea idk)

In 2020 we played 2 MNF games (week 1 loss to PIT, week 8 loss to TB) and SNF once (loss to CLE)

In 2019 we had 2 MNF games (losses to the Cowboys and Eagles, the latter being the infamous Daniel Jones falling down meme game)

In 2018 we had 2 MNF games (losses to Atlanta and SF, wow I blocked this year out of my brain apparently) and 1 SNF game (week 2 loss to Dallas)

In 2017 we had 1 MNF game (week 2 loss to DET) and 2 SNF games (a loss to Dallas and the weird win we had in Denver).

25101,208799,208799,dergl,"Yes, but not everything is in a vacuum. There are always factors that affect performance, particularly with QB's. Having elite receivers will allow for more opportunities for a QB to make throws that will increase their grade - moreso than poor WR's that force a QB into tight-window or contested throws. QB's also affect o-line play - Brady's linemen typically grade well because they don't have to block for as long. David Carr, Russ, Daniel Jones, etc. make it harder on their linemen by holding onto the ball longer. Some of these factors are also scheme dependent - if the OC sucks, they're not going to scheme as many open plays for the QB/WR which also affects the line.",3.0,nygiants,t3_xpjukp,False,0.0,:Helmet_Catch: Helmet Catch :Helmet_Catch:,2022-09-27T17:04:30Z,nygiants,-0.0179624754262983

- DJ played his ass off last night. Stat line will show an ugly performance but he was the sole reason we had any chance to win. He faced ~25 pressures and was sacked 6 times last night. Not sure how much more he could have done. I think maybe 29/31 other starting QBs in the NFL would have done as well or worse than what DJ strung together given the pressure he faced.

- Our O-Line played like shit. Now, they faced a Micah Parsons and Demarcus Lawrence duo that we just could not contain. DJ seemingly played outside of the pocket more than in it, because he had about 1 second before it vanished

- Saquon looked great. He had maybe 3 plays that he was juuuuust about to break for big yardage but got caught at the last defender. Dude is back to that top-3 RB status as far as I’m concerned

- we have no WRs, and I still want Kenny G off this roster. Dude is a waste of space and an embarrassment to all WRs in the league. I’d rather cut his ass and take the cap hit than let him fill up a roster spot.

- defense definitely played their worst game so far in my opinion, but still decent. We gave up way too many big yard plays but more importantly we need to generate turnovers.

- Shep… poor dude. I dunno what the diagnosis is yet but fear his career is at its end. The dude is the heart of our team and I’m gonna miss seeing him on the field.",53.0,nygiants,t3_xpek5b,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-09-27T06:49:36Z,nygiants,0.030454091658789
