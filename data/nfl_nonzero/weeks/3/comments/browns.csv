23979,176566,176566,deviden,"tl;dr - defenses in the NFL are too smart, too varied and too well coached for the style you propose to work every week, it has to be a change-up move and not the base offense.

well this is a separate but slightly related question to my larger point about run game and underneath/YAC pass game, which keep the clock running and take longer to get down the field than a gunslinger pass game (incomplete = clock stops, long passes move ball down field quicker in fewer snaps). Prevent Defense works this way too - stop the long pass, keep the ball inbounds and the clock rolling. In college the clock stops every time you get a first down and on every incomplete pass, and that's how the scores get so insanely high. In college you're also playing against kids with limited film room and on-field experience so going tempo is a reliable way to bamboozle defenders.

Teams do play with tempo offense and no-huddle/quick-huddle in the way that you describe but you dont want to do it constantly if the defense's alignment and personnel matchups dont favor you. It is difficult for an offense to effectively communicate complex playcalls in hurry up offense, and so you're limiting your menu of plays when you go into that style - you're also putting up tape for defenses of how your hurry-up/2 minute offense works so they know what to expect when you're trying to get that vital extra/final score at the end of a half or end of the 4th.

Also - when you hurry up the defense and lock them into a personnel package you're also hurrying the QB's ability to read the field and locking your offense into a personnel package.

I dont think they're the best team in the league or anything, and they still need to face the ""defenses got more tape on you"" test, but the Dolphins are good value for their 3-0 standing and will boat race many of the opponents they face in this year's schedule.

edit:

For Baker the big scare has got to be that he's highly unlikely to be anyone's QB1 after this season (unless the Panthers extend him...) and who's gonna want Baker with his attitude as QB2. Backup QBs are supposed to stay quiet, play nice with others and help prep the QB1.

The loss of Hill is one thing, pretty significant in itself, but the change had already begun last season and it's driven by new age defense. 

Defenses are committing to stopping explosive passes at the expense of giving up underneath passes and easier yards in the run game, because they believe that even the league's best offenses won't always score a TD if they consistently have to do it in 10+ play drives. 

Mahomes and Reid already have the answers to the test. It's run game, it's finding ways to manufacture YAC from underneath, and it's scheming open the deep coverage beaters when they do those things and draw more defenders into the box. They just have to do it. 

Thing is - even if you are successfully beating modern defense by including more run game and quick game passing into your offense, you're already reducing your own opportunities to rack up stupidly high scores because the rush and the easy completion YAC passes keep the clock running, and scoring via 10+ play drives will eat up 4-6 mins of clock instead of regularly scoring in 90 seconds like you used to with prime Kelce/Hill against older styles of defense.",9.0,nfl,t3_xq3o14,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2022-09-28T06:46:08Z,browns,0.1097820202466659
23983,176570,176570,deviden,"Plus, defenses are wise to the modern passing game's shit. The name of the game is ""limit explosive plays"" because long drives of high efficiency translates to points far less frequently than drives that contain a 20+ yard explosive play or two, and ""disguise pre-snap coverage looks"" because there's too many good QBs and they need to be mentally slowed down somehow. 

Hasn't been this much cover 2 and quarters coverage across the league since the brief period where Tampa 2 was the default - and even back then it was run out of a 4-3 or 3-4. Nickel has become the base defense for a lot of teams, and a lot of teams are commiting to a light box with extra bodies to cover the deeper passes.

Defensive coordinators have accepted that giving up lots of guaranteed short yard gains to the rush or underneath passes is better than constantly getting roasted by Mahomes/Allen/Herbert on deep shots. Make the offense be slow and patient and sooner or later one of your guys makes a play or one of theirs makes a mistake.

Also... the best solution to forcing teams out of light box, nickel/dime and quarters/cover2 defense is to run the ball down their throat and present a consistent threat of generating explosive plays from the rush but there's only about 4 or 5 teams in the league who have the line, the scheme and the backs to do that (consistently create 20+ yard explosive run plays) and they're not any of those teams you listed. The Lions aren't competitive in shootouts every week just because their DBs are wildly inconsistent, it's because they can pop explosive plays from the run on every drive and this forces opposing defenses to play different. 

But what does the run do that the pass doesn't? It eats the clock and it gets fewer yards, on average, even on explosive plays. So as defenses are forcing offenses to be more balanced with run/pass there's naturally going to be less time for scoring points and fewer drives per game.

So it's a double whammy. There's way fewer explosive passes, which means way fewer points, and there's more run game coming back into the league so there's fewer drives and less time on the clock to score points in.

So yes, it's absolutely valid that a certain amount of points per game downswing is due to injuries or WR trades away from those teams but this is a league-wide trend that's affecting nearly every game. Defenses have caught up, defenders are faster than ever, and until offenses figure out a solution, the same way Seattle Cover 3 got SOLVED by modern OCs, this is the new normal.",35.0,nfl,t3_xq3o14,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2022-09-28T04:38:44Z,browns,0.0391278463814919

Ultimately it comes down to the fact that in today's NFL you draft for traits and interview performance more than you draft for college level production. You're not looking for a ""good enough"" QB, you're looking for a freakshow. 

Lance has freakshow physical talents, and he's a smart kid who interviewed with Kyle better than the alternatives like Fields. KS bet on developing Lance because freakshow talent opens up new areas of the playbook that are closed to him with Jimmy G as QB.

This is an important point. Stefanski and the brain trust on offense are extremely good at scheming up clearly defined reads for the QB, and the difference we're seeing with Jacoby vs Baker is that Jacoby will execute the offense as scripted with a calmness, maturity and consistency. 

What Jacoby is not, and never will be, is a QB who can elevate the offense beyond its structure and the capabilities of the guys around him. He's not going to make Stefanski and co. right when they get it wrong.

I am extremely bullish on our schematic and playcalling side of things but sooner or later you run face first into a defensive coach that's just as smart as your offensive coaches and/or has enough players at their disposal that there's no weaknesses to expose, and they can out-execute your playmakers, and stop you doing the things you're good at doing.

Baker never learned how to make vision lanes for himself in the pocket, he throws batted balls, and he panics in the pocket - leading to him running into sacks on the edge or dropping too deep, or at the very least losing his downfield vision. 

Baker's got a cannon and the big balls to throw difficult passes but more often than not if you do the above you'll negate his strengths - and sooner or later he'll lose his composure.

2019 vs steelers - Decent game by baker, just south of 200 yards and 2 TDs. defense had 4 INTs too.

2018 vs. Jets, a game that gave us all hope. he moved the ball well but nothing earth shattering. just above 200 yard in a little over a half. definitely his best game of the TNF games even without scoring.
