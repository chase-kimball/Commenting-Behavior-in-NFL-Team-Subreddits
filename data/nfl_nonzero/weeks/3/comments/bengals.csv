1910,18905,18905,BeerNinja17,"Yeah, but aside from teams like the Bills there are few known commodities early in the season (see: the Colts). Lots of teams are “supposed to” win and do not early on. It sucks because it seemed like we were finally a known commodity. No more hoping; no more waiting. Just like in 2006 and in 2016. But alas, we are Bengals fans and nothing is given to us. So we hope; so we wait.

The true test of this team’s ability will be if they actually surpass the previous squads I mentioned. I still think Burrow and this team is special. There are no catastrophic injuries like in ‘06 and no aging stars like there were in ‘16. Honestly, I think Anarumo is the key difference. As much attention as the offense gets, the D is the backbone of this team. Maybe that’s what flips the script for us longtime Bengals fans.

48646,363742,363742,type6_birdbrain,"Hi folks, I think with the way the NFL handled the initial CTE studies, it is clear they really do not care about the players.  Not sure they ever have.  Repeated hits after a concussion even if not producing a new concussion are bad.  I'm a Bengals fan and while I was happy to see Tee Higgins back in the game after he got blasted today, I worry like crazy for these guys long-term.  CTE takes a long time to develop, and there's no way holding Tua out a few plays will mean he is ""fine"".
