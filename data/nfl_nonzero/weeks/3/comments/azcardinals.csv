27262,235663,235663,yesdamnit,it looks Like he’s a rookie out there because that’s how they’re treating him.

I understand his o line was terrible and that might’ve forced it more than the script wanted but I’ve never seen him play like the floor is lava outside the pocket until Denver. Hackett doesnt know how utilize him and it shows. Wilson isn’t made of glass. How many bootleg options were run tonight, ZERO. Every single play that was called had him in the pocket. He was almost completely shutdown ALL 3 games now. And now that theres more tape it’s going to get worse if Hackett doesn’t pull his head out of his ass and let Russ move around a little, I mean that’s just his play style and what’s made him a future HOFer. If you bought a fancy new car and youre just going to leave it in the garage because youre too scared it might get a scratch why buy it in the first place?
