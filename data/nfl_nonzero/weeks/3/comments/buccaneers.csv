Scooter can play gunner on special teams. Darden returns kicks. Darden also looked really fucking good in camp. Both of them have utility outside of pure WR play and at a bare minimum give this offense a layer of speed that it otherwise doesn’t have. When any 2 of Julio/Evans/Godwin/Gage are 100% there is nothing TyJo brings to the table, and burning a roster spot and harming our ST just on the off chance that Godwin/Evans/Julio all missed the same few weeks was a totally worthwhile gamble by the FO.

15272,106126,106126,Ranma_chan,"Well. Let's see.

Expansion franchise in the mid-1970s. Expansion rules in the NFL at the time meant that we got a bunch of cast-offs save for the #1 overall pick ([Lee Roy Selmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Roy_Selmon)). Our team was dog-shit other than the Selmon brothers (Lee Roy and Dewey) at first. We went 0-26 in '76 and '77, until we beat the Saints and Cardinals in the last two games of the '77 season.

In 1979, our team was really good and we made the NFC Championship Game, but some injuries and bad luck meant we got blanked 9-0 by the Rams.

The team then sucked for another decade-and-a-half. In the mid 90s, our original owner (racist shitbag) Hugh Culverhouse died and the team was bought by Malcolm Glazer. We were doing a bit better at the time, got some generational talent in the likes of Derrick Brooks, Mike Alstott and Warren Sapp.

Our uniforms went from [creamsicle/white](https://pokemonflashfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mike-Alstott-1996-Donruss-Rookie-Card-208.jpg) to [red/pewter in 1997](https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTc2NDg4OTA0ODQzNjAxNjI3/alstottbucs.jpg) and we became known as the [Pewter Pirates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LuQtTtQ2Xg), though our defense at the time was referred to as the ""Tampa 2"". 

This was the start of our best era before now, we made the playoffs multiple times - we lost the divisional round in 1997 to the Packers, made the NFC Championship game in 1999 ([and lost to the Rams after the controversial Bert Emmanuel no-catch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_NFL_playoffs#NFC:_St._Louis_Rams_11,_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_6)), and then lost in the wildcard to the Eagles in 2000 and 2001.

In 2002, we fired our coach Tony Dungy and brought in Jon Gruden from the Oakland Raiders. In that first season, we beat the Eagles in the NFC Championship game and advanced to [Super Bowl XXXVII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVII) against the #1 offense Oakland Raiders - Gruden's former team. We absolutely creamed their *ass*, 48-21.

The years after were not kind to us. We missed the playoffs in 2003 and 2004, we won the division but lost the wildcard game in 2005 against the Redskins, missed the playoffs in 2006. In 2007, we made the playoffs as a wild card team once again after winning the NFC South, but lost in the wild card game to the (eventual) SB champion New York Giants (who upset the 18-0 Patriots to deny them a perfect season). That was the last time we made the playoffs until 2020.

In 2008, after another bad season, and due to the fact the team was basically a shambling mess, we fired Jon Gruden and began our long reconstruction period.

2009, we started the season with a long losing streak (0-7), only to break it in a [throwback matchup against the Green Bay Packers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2U7dYANbXs) to celebrate Lee Roy Selmon being added to the Raymond James Stadium _Ring of Honor_.

Around this same time, we had numerous blackout games here in Tampa because the NFL at the time required a home sell-out to broadcast the game in the local market, so many Bucs games were not viewable in the Tampa Bay area. Like I said - a very dark time for the franchise.

In 2010, the Bucs actually had a winning record (10-6) but missed the playoffs on a tie-breaker against the Green Bay Packers after losing to the Detroit Lions. Fun fact - if we had won that game, Aaron Rodgers would have zero rings, as we would have frozen out the Packers and gone to the playoffs instead of them.

2011-2014 was a bunch of mediocrity. Our ""youngry"" defense and offense stumbled a lot, missed opportunities, and we also had to contend with the whole [MRSA problem](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/buccaneers/2013/10/11/mrsa-buccaneers-locker-room-carl-nicks-lawrence-tynes-league-union-meeting/2966515/) too. In 2014, we went 2-14, the worst record the Bucs have had since their inaugural seasons (0-14 and 2-12). This era did give us the Ginger Giraffe himself, [Mike Glennon](https://cbssports.com/images/blogs/mike-glennon-lovie-future-franchise.jpg), so I can't be that mad.

In 2015, we drafted Jameis Winston first overall, thus beginning the ""famous Jameis"" era of Tampa Bay football. We went 6-10 in his first season here, had a winning season in 2016 (missed the playoffs), and then had three straight losing seasons in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

During this period in 2017 and 2018, we were forced to rely on other quarterbacks to play because Jameis was either injured or suspended. This gave us the glorious memery of Ryan Fitzpatrick with the [Fitzmagic drip](https://www.nbcsports.com/sites/nbcsports.com/files/styles/article_hero_image/public/2018/09/16/nbc_nfl_fitzpatrickpresserv3_180916.jpg?itok=Qz8l_s-w)... only for him to go back to Fitztragic and derail what was going to be a glorious season.

In 2019, Jameis Winston made NFL history to be the first QB to record 30 TDs and 30 INTs in a single season. At the end of the season, following a 7-9 record and multiple losses due to his interception rate, he basically wanted a BIG second contract that was way more than he was worth. So, the Bucs told him to kick rocks and decided to try their luck in free agency. Jameis became backup to Drew Brees in New Orleans - and well, now he's their starter.

So then we arrive in 2020 - Bucs fans? We were all kind of depressed. We knew the future was going to be rough if we didn't find a good FA QB. But then we heard whispers.

_Tom Brady doesn't want to be a Patriot anymore?_

_Tom Brady might come to Tampa?_

No. Not possible. No way Tom Brady, the GOAT, comes to this franchise. He's just trying to game the Pats into giving him a bigger contract.

But then, in March 2020, in the middle of this chaotic new pandemic that looked to threaten the very fabric of sports in America...

[News broke.](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/sports/nfl/2020/03/20/tom-brady-signs-with-tampa-bay-buccaneers/112251556/)

Tom Brady was a Buccaneer now.

Oh my god.

Are you serious?

We were all in disbelief, incredulity, and HYPE. IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, WE ALL KNEW IT.

The 2020 season began, as it usually does, with a Week 1 game in New Orleans.

And we sucked. Absolutely dog shit. Tom looked old, the Bucs special teams looked out of their depth, and despite putting up a fight, we got buried by the Saints. Nobody was happy after that game, but we had to keep going.

Then we beat the Panthers. Handily.

Then we beat the Broncos - also handily.

Then we mounted a tremendous comeback against the hot-shot young Chargers, something that the Bucs of the 2010s would have never been able to do without choking. And suddenly, we were 3-1.

We had hope.

Week 4, however, put a brake on many of those hopes. We were bullied by Chicago. [Tom forgot what down it was.](https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/439/410/10410439.png) Many fans were afraid this was a regression to mean, and we were going to fuck up Tom Brady's last hurrah.

Then, we absolutely creamed the Packers at home. We made Rodgers look like a little bitch.

Then, we demolished the Raiders.

Then - we beat the Giants on primetime at home, despite making mistakes. RoJo fumbled the fucking ball, but we still won! It was beautiful!

We came home 6-2, feeling like nothing could go wrong.

But it did.

New Orleans came into Ray Jay and blew the DOORS off of us. 38-3. The memes were real. Jameis dancing in the locker room with crutches, eating Ws. Saints players crowing ""Better luck next year"", like we were going to miss the playoffs. It was a bad day. A very bad day.

We beat the Panthers the following week, but then we lost two straight - to the Rams and Chiefs. Both times having to fight our way back from deficits we had no business being in, looking like a broken team that was about to miss the playoffs.

As we went into the Bye, we knew something had to change.

And then?

And then we went on a tear.

The Vikings stood no chance - neither did the Falcons or Lions.

The day after Christmas, in a 47-7 blowout of Detroit, the Buccaneers clinched their spot in the wild card race, going to the postseason for the first time since they won Super Bowl XXXVII nearly twenty years prior.

Then, we kept winning.

We staved off the Washington Football Team, 31-23.

We marched into New Orleans and retired Drew Brees, 30-20.

We marched into Lambeau Field and sank the Green Bay Packers' hopes in yet another NFC Championship Game, 31-26.

Then.

The Super Bowl.

We had won seven games straight to get there.

Our own home stadium. The first team to EVER DO IT in the history of football. We would be fighting for Tom's seventh ring under the shadow of our own pirate ship.

And so we did. Our defense played their hearts out, and so did our offense. We ran up the score against Patrick Mahomes and the fearsome Kansas City squad that had bested us earlier in the year.

31-9. Kansas City did not score a SINGLE touchdown. One of only three teams to have the ignominy to reach the greatest stage in football and do that - the 2018 Rams, and the 1971 Dolphins.

For those of us who had seen the team suffer for so long, we had done it, and it was such a beautiful fucking feeling that I get the wiggles just thinking about it now.

To be a Bucs fan is to know suffering, but also to know joy in that when your team reaches the top, it will be the sweetest victory you could possibly taste. The Bucs are, no matter what the historical record says, one of the best teams in sports. They are a team that fights and scraps and never gives up, no matter how bad things seem.

I created a graph of the outcome of every single 1st and 20 play (by yards gained) since 1999 which was not a FG or QB Kneel. 

You'll see 2 things:

1) OCs choose to pass way more than run in this situation

2) Passes have a much greater variance and tend to get more yards than runs in this situation

x axis = yards gained, y axis = number of times it happened. read it like: since 1999, on 1st and 20, a pass resulted in a gain of 20+ yards almost 300 times, while a run resulted in a gain of 20+ yards about 20 times

I flew to clean up after the storm of Katrina a year later to help fix (read demolish with a sledgehammer cuz the home owners couldn’t afford to) houses in my summer off from college. I always thought the day August 28th will forever be burned into my memory because they left the day before with the morning newspaper still on the table next to half drank coffee. We helped tear their houses down and a year later in some of those wards and a car was still in a tree in one place. A year later they had markings on the doors for empty, animal, or human. It was eerie.

I just dealt with a cat one in my mountain home in Puerto Rico and was going to fly home but when it hit cat 4 I decided to say fuck it I’m not getting hit twice in one week.

Tampa has never seen a storm like this. As a Puerto Rican and Floridian I hope you all stay safe. This isn’t Francis. It’s another Katrina.

There was one question in the press conference where they asked ""do you see this getting turned around, is it there?"" and he said ""yeah--uh--we'll see--we'll keep working at it"". He's annoyed at the mistakes and maybe perceives a lack of effort in practice and studying and he's probably going to ride the offense on this in coming weeks.

That said, I absolutely did NOT at all get the sense that he was feeling hopeless or anything like that. He seemed like he was in a pretty good mood to me--he understands it's an early game, lots of people missing, and they should have won this game if they had cleaner play.
