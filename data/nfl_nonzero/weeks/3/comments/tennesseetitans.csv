2167,18877,18877,Bieber_hole_69,"Point differential is not going to be a useful stat for the Titans this year after how bad the score was in week 2. Getting blown out that badly one time pretty much ruins the usefulness of point differential going forward.

The Titans could win out at 15-2 and still have a negative point differential for the season now because of that -34 that's going to be nearly impossible to overcome.

The blowout loss to the Packers in 2020 also did something similar for point differential that season. We were 11-5 but only had +52 point differential, which equates to a 9-7 Pythagorean expected record. 

Generally under Vrabel we've overperformed our Pythagorean expected wins, averaging a +48.75 point differential over his four seasons as HC. You would expect about a 36.51-28.49 record over Vrabel's 65 regular season games coached going into this year, when instead the Titans have gone 41-24, over a full win better than expected each year. This would often signal that the Titans are bound to regress at some point, but four years of this is a pretty decent sample size that may show Vrabel coached teams do just preform better than point differential would indicate.

A bunch of different things can account for this, but I would attribute a lot of it to Vrabel's great record in one-score games and that the Titans just don't blow out teams all that often. Of Vrabel's 41 wins, only 15 (34.14%) have come by more than two scores. In comparison, of the Titans 24 losses under Vrabel, 7 (29.17%) have come by more than two scores, (with an additional 2 coming by exactly 16 points, which would raise this percentage to 37.5%.) In those blowout losses though, they have been outscored by 157 points (22.43 PPG,) and with the two losses by 16 included 189 (21 PPG.) In comparison, in wins by more than two scores the Titans have outscored opponents by 336 points (22.4 PPG.)

I don't exactly know what this data means because I don't have the time to check it against league averages, but essentially the Titans blowout opponents (3+ scores) about 4 times per season and get blown-out 2 times a season in the Vrabel era. Since these games are very similar in margin, two of the blowout wins are nullified by blowout losses for point differential matters. So the other 10/11 games per season are decided by two scores or less, and would even out pretty closely as far as point differential. In these 10 or so two score or less games, Vrabel has a great record, going 26-17 (.605,) when you would probably expect him to be closer to 22-21 (.512.) In effect, the Titans are winning an additional game per year on average under Vrabel than you would expect based on point differential, likely because the best teams each year using point differential aren't always the best teams, but rather teams that are blowing out opponents more than just grinding out tough wins.

A lot of advanced stats also do not account for weighing blowouts as outliers either, we're going to be pretty low-tier in DVOA and EPA no matter how the rest of the season goes because of week 2.",2.0,tennesseetitans,t3_xox2nu,False,0.0,11,2022-09-27T09:55:09Z,tennesseetitans,0.0353288023965094

7705,49598,49598,DrJupeman,"Practically speaking, ""Air McNair"" was not a *great* passer.  Consider 2003 when he shared league MVP with Peyton Manning:  Manning threw for \~900 more yards, had \~9 higher QB rating, more TD passes and 5% higher completion percentage (2003 was by far McNair's best passing season yet ended with 3,215 yards, fairly pedestrian even then).  Prior to 2003, McNair did real damage running, consistently exceeding 400 yards in a season.  Once 2003 hit, he became more of a passer and stopped being a dual threat.  He was no Lamar or Vick as a runner, either, though.

What McNair had that perhaps none of the three QBs I've mentioned had, was the ""it"" factor that raised everyone around him.  He was a leader of men. A warrior.  He routinely was hurt and played anyway.  He wouldn't practice all weak, he'd take a nap before the game, and then he'd play.

I think you do not need to watch anything more than the final drive vs. the Rams in the Super Bowl to understand Steve McNair.  Even though the drive is famous for coming up short, everything about that drive is Steve McNair at his finest.

That and the 2002 game against the Giants epitomized what this man was about. He was a bad MF! 

If anything, coaching held him back. I look at Donovan McNabb and early Dante Culpepper. Statistically, that is what McNair should have been if he had an offensive coach.",2.0,tennesseetitans,t3_xmwjbt,False,0.0,Samari Rolle,2022-09-24T15:35:51Z,tennesseetitans,-0.051068149566039

53326,305576,305576,uppity_chucklehead,"This upcoming Colts game feels HUGE to me. If we win that game, we might be right back towards the top of the division, and would have a great chance to go into the bye at 3-2 (and on a roll). Could really build some amazing momentum. 

On the flipside if we lose, we'll be in pretty rough shape.",19.0,tennesseetitans,t3_xoqtch,False,0.0,AJBrown,2022-09-26T14:26:52Z,tennesseetitans,0.08655
