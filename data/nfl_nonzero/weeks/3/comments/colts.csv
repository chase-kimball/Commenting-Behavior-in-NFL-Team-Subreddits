- Pray that Matt Ryan retires because his ~$35 million cap hit next year would ruin us. 
- Re-structure Ryan Kelly's contract, he's currently the 5th highest paid center in the league, and he sure ain't playing like it. 
- The most important player for us to extend this upcoming off-season is Bobby Okereke, ideally we want him on a 4 year deal. 
- I'm fielding any and all offers for Kenny Moore. Dude wants more money, and I am not paying him for that. Ideally I'd like to get a 2nd or 3rd round pick for him, or include him in a package to move up in the '23 draft. 
- Let Paris Campbell and Yannick Ngakoue walk in FA, unless Yannick puts up 10+ sacks. 
- Honestly, I'm probably looking to trade Moe Alie-Cox as well. We have 3 young tight ends that all have looked better than him this year (this is ofc hoping that Ogletree recovers from his ACL)

32166,233852,233852,voyagerx420,"You're not explaining shit to me, you just keep making generalized statements and claiming it make sense and are facts, but they're not.

Has Moore played poorly? Yes, there's no denying that, but my point about the entire team playing like garbage is also true. Kenny is one of the best slot dbs in the league and I have no doubt he'll turn it around, he's just too good of a player not to.

What drives me nuts about the simpletons around here, yourself included, is your fandom and opinions on players and coaches and their performance is unrealistic and ignorant. You guys operate on a zero tolerance policy and think that's ok. Well, I hate to break it to you, but it's not.

Players have bad games and rough patches, that's just the reality of football. It's absolutely insane to completely turn on a core player because he hasn't played up to his potential over a small span, in context with the rest of his career, and then throw out bullshit trade proposals as if that's going to be a win for the team as a whole moving forward. It's short-sighted and a testament to the fact that the average fan just needs to shut it and let the professionals do their job.

Edit - Also, the overpaid statement is laughable as well and further proves my point.
