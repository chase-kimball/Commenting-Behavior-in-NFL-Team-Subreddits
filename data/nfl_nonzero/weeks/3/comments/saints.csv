Olave, defense outside of one or two plays, Werner was a small concern due to limited reps but he looks amazing, we have a real shot to win if Lutz FG tries go through, Kamara fumble was another main reason for the loss, 2 minute/hurry up offense (I know, prevent defense).

Play calling (so many 2nd and long runs), Jameis (I know he’s hurt but bro was missing some layups and should have thrown 2 more picks, plus not seeing open guys consistently), o-line. Roby?

We would be 3-0 if we had just started Dalton over Winston. The problem is, Winston has completely fallen apart, even more than his Tampa Bay days

Week 1: Winston stares down receivers and isn’t on rhythm despite playing all training camp with his wide receivers

Winston also can’t diagnose a blitz for shit, meaning any blitz destroys him

Winston only starts to move the ball after falcons stop blitzing 

Game 2: defense holds TB to 3 points through 3 quarters. Winston throws an INT on his 5th pass to Olave deep into double coverage 

Winston implodes after that TB touchdown

Game 3: Winston can’t diagnose blitzes for SHIT. Panthers send 1 CB, LB, etc on a blitz and Winston can’t throw to a hot read or audible 

If Dalton just throws the schemed passes, the Saints are 3-0 or at worst 2-1 with a victory over TB. 

Eagles only are winning the trade because Dennis Allen is being a fuckhead and starting Winston with 4 back fractures against division opponents",1.0,nfl,t3_xo43hd,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2022-09-26T17:01:00Z,saints,-0.067135424
