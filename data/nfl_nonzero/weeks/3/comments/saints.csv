Game 2: defense holds TB to 3 points through 3 quarters. Winston throws an INT on his 5th pass to Olave deep into double coverage 

Winston implodes after that TB touchdown

Game 3: Winston can‚Äôt diagnose blitzes for SHIT. Panthers send 1 CB, LB, etc on a blitz and Winston can‚Äôt throw to a hot read or audible 

If Dalton just throws the schemed passes, the Saints are 3-0 or at worst 2-1 with a victory over TB. 

Eagles only are winning the trade because Dennis Allen is being a fuckhead and starting Winston with 4 back fractures against division opponents",1.0,nfl,t3_xo43hd,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2022-09-26T17:01:00Z,saints,-0.067135424
