Even moreso when he hasn't gotten enough reps (he has only 75% the passes of the other two, so in game equivalents he's only played 9.75 games)

**Edit:** I'm tired of having this argument over and over. You all need to learn about sample sizes. The point is, don't try to establish trends for players until you have high confidence in the data. Don't have high confidence until you have a lot of data. Right now we do not have a lot of data and whatever we do have has the caveat of regime change. World class QB evaluators have said it takes about 30-36 starts for QBs to start showing who they're going to be as a player long term. At the end of this year we'll be at 27, so the start of next year is when things will start to be very clear about what we have in him.

If you don't start the game with lots of easy passing, the QB never finds a groove or gets to see/feel how the defense is playing him. Additionally, the rarity of attempts makes each one have more pressure to perform. These factors lead the QB to be out of rhythm. Then it turns into a feedback loop, because poor quarterbacking leads you to further up the run %. Trent Dilfer spent 20 minutes talking about all of this in a very specific way last week.

Unfortunately, no.

Most, if not all auto policies define a collision loss as contact with an object or a turnover. 

The only exception is contact with an animal, which falls under an ""act of God"".

The root commentor is correct. It's better, and statistically safer to simply hit the animal.

Comprehensive coverage covers things like hail, a spontaneous fire, an animal hit, theft, random vandalism, etc.

Collision is very specific. Collision with an object, or a turnover.

However, if I had a claim that involved in, say, a deer hit, and that deer hit resulted in a turnover, it would still be considered a comprehensive loss versus a collision loss because that would give the greater benefit to the customer.  But if there is no contact with the animal, it goes back to collision.

46603,290945,290945,midkni,">Possibly, but you best believe the insurance company will fight it tooth and nail.

Respectfully, you are incorrect. I've been in insurance claims for 11 years.

I understand that there are times when people are not satisfied with insurance companies, but this is typically due to either customers not understanding what they have purchased, or working through a 3rd party liability carrier.

I've worked for 6 different companies. And save for one, all of them always hammered in the message, ""we find coverage, not look to deny it.""

Here's the reason why: If an insurance company falsely denies a claim, they are exposed to a bad faith claim, which if gone to trial, would result in the policy paying out for the claimed damages, but would also result in punitive damages as well. Not to mention a tarnished reputation. It would be on the news.

I can guarantee you that claims adjusters fight to find coverage for you and anyone else.  I've done it hundreds if not thousands of times. But the reality is that there are circumstances where coverage simply doesn't exist.

Khalil Herbert, just like last year, showed signs of being a great RB. Running is definitely our strength. I‚Äôm sad to see Monty go down, but it feels great knowing that we have another back. 

EJax is looking good again! And what a relief it is to see. I‚Äôm psyched to see him play as a ball hawk and all over the field. 

I thought Quan had a solid game. Maybe not market resetting contract levels, but very good nonetheless. 

Cairo is reliable. 

Nick Morrow is solid, and had some good tfl and was all over the field. Especially in the second half. 

Gordon seemed to settle down a bit as the game went on and made a few mistakes early. 

Brisker is legit. He didn‚Äôt have a huge game, but his positioning was solid and wasn‚Äôt super noticeable, which honestly is sometimes a great thing as safety. 

Now for the negatives:

Obviously, Fields. Spotlight is on the guy and he needed to have a great bounce back game against a bad team to make up for the stinker in GB. It didn‚Äôt happen. There‚Äôs a lot to unpack there (Oline wasn‚Äôt great, dropped passes, receivers not great etc.) but ultimately this was an uninspiring performance that really makes the doubt real. 

Getsy‚Äôs playcalling was pretty lackluster. The decisions made today showed severe lack of trust in Fields and honestly did not feel any different from Nagy at times. We‚Äôve heard players call him a ‚Äògenius‚Äô but it certainly didn‚Äôt show today.
