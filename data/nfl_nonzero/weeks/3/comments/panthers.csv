We did have Jordan Gross as well, but he was a rookie and hardly a difference maker.  
  
Comparing 2001 and 2002, again the big differences were at QB and RB.  There were also a few JAGs replacing JAGs at various positions, and a couple of key veterans retired.  So it's not like the roster had a ton of young talent in either year.  I can't tell you about salary cap because I don't remember and I'm too lazy to look it up, but we didn't hand out any big contracts for either of his first two years.  He just walked in, told the players they were soft, toughened them up, and schemed them to their strengths.  He didn't have a Quarterback either, but instead of trying to strike gold in trading for other teams' hand-me-downs he signed a steady vet to be a game manager and then found potential in a backup QB in Free Agency.
  
Right now we have two great playmakers on offense in Moore and CMC, a promising line, and some decent young depth.  On defense we have very good players at each level, with potential stars in our secondary and on the edge.  We could use another DE, and I'm still not sold on our linebackers.  But on each side of the ball, a new coach would have more to work with than Fox did.  

If the next guy comes in and decides to do a teardown given the youth and talent on our team, then right away I'm expecting us to continue to lose.  We're a QB and a coach away from being a consistent winner, and we still have a high enough pick next year to have a shot at getting the QB.

6591,40552,40552,DarthLordDonkey,"It's less so about tipping your hand and more about keeping the defence honest. The Panthers have designed the O around RPOs, which we can argue if that's wise or not. But it shouldn't be a surprise that they will often run an RPO out of a traditional RPO alignment. It's the same as when you have 2 TE lined up on one side, it usually dictates a run to that side.

That being said, if you have enough plays that counter what the defence thinks is coming, it's going to keep them more honest. The big DJ Moore pass  that counters Orlovsky's point came early in the second half, and I don't think it's a coincidence.

There's a reason why you hear the phrase ""putting it on tape."" When you show Defenisve Coordinators different looks, they'll have to adjust. If they don't, the result is a huge play.

If you want an example of it elsewhere, last night the Browns biggest completion late in the game came off a set up they'd been establishing all night.

I thought sharing this video was important, as what Orlovsky said on TV wasn't telling the complete story. This play was a tendency breaker, and its success relied on the Giants anticipating a run or RPO. Orlovsky was correct that the Panthers did often run RPO out of that same set, but when he says the clips aren't cherry picked, that's not true. By leaving out this clip, he's pushing a false narrative and not capturing the whole story. 

I'm not saying McAdoo and the O don't deserve criticism, but it's disappointing that a guy with the NFL knowledge of Dan Orlovsky found this to be the biggest problem of the offensive scheme, when there are far greater issues that still exist.

Look around the sub. Brian Burns is #2 in pressures. Jaycee Horn is the #2 graded CB. The OL is the OL of the week. What area of the field are we lacking in? Who is throwing the ball at a less than 50% completion rate right now when the average in the league is 60%? 

It's Baker Mayfield. He's a large portion of what's wrong with this team right now. He's not accurate and he can't convert when it counts. I don't say this in a 'get him outta here' kinda way.
