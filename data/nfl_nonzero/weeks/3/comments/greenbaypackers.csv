On score graphics, the team on the left or on top is usually the away team, and vice versa for the home team. As for *how* the teams are determined, you first have the **Scheduling Formula**: 

* 2 games each against your *divisional* opponents (6 total games)

* 1 game against each team in a specific division in your *own* conference (4 total games). Each year you play a different division

* 1 game each against a team from the other two divisions in your *own* conference, determined by what place you each finished in the previous year‚Äî1st place teams play the other 1st place teams and so on (2 total games)

* 1 game against each team in a specific division in the *other* conference (4 total games). Each year you play a different division

* **17th game, began in 2021**: 1 game against a team from the *other* conference's division you played two years prior, determined by what place you both finished in the previous year‚Äîonce again, 1st place against 1st place, and so on

and then how the home/away games are split:

* Divisional games: split evenly home and away every year

* Same conference: Split evenly home and away, rotates every 3 years. Gets tricky with the same-place games since you might play a team for several years in a row (Packers played the 49ers at home in 2018, then went on the road from 2019-21, and will play them at home again in '24)

* Other conference division: split evenly home and away, rotates every 4 years when you play each other again
