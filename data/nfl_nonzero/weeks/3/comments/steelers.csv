Problem is you can’t really find anything concrete to support it, as it’s most definitely a case by case deal. For every Russ, you get an RG3, a Terrell Pryor, etc... I think career length is a good indicator, as well as productivity early on vs late (your not going to compare the prime as opposed to their time near retirement)

Russ is unique because he’d gotten obliterated when he was a Seahawk, but has phenomenal preparation and arm talent and is still going.

I personally wouldn’t put Alex smith in the same category as a Russ/Lamar/Vick, he was a good game manager with mobility, but not a pure rushing threat. He was forced out of KC with Mahomes and then has “the big injury” 

I also just think, it makes sense… like if you asked a bricklayer at 35 to do something strenuous compared to someone in an office 9-5, the bricklayer is going have the more beat up body. If you ask a QB to make throws in the pocket at 35 years old when all he’s done is take sacks, compared to another guy who’s taken sacks AND dozens of tackles a week for 10 years, the latter is just going to typically have more wear and tear, be less effective and have a shorter career.",2.0,steelers,t3_xopocw,False,0.0,:SOTN1::SOTN2::SOTN3::SOTN4: Shut Out The Noise,2022-09-26T14:28:28Z,steelers,0.0647934499314129
16569,100947,100947,ItsYourBoyD,"It’s the number of shots, not that “burrow gets creamed”

You can get sacked 9 times like Wentz on Sunday, or you can take 25+ hits like Hurts does running every third play and also taking sacks. The latter gives a lot more wear and tear on the body. Might not show up week to week, but definitely does over the years.

In addition, there’s a reason guys like Ben, Brady, Rodgers can play till they’re 35+ meanwhile a guy like Vick looked like hot dogshit in his stints in New York and Pittsburgh, while having MVP calibre seasons in Philly and looking great in Atlanta. When a running QB is young, they’re ELECTRIC. Once they hit that age wall, they lose a step, can’t make as many plays with their legs and typically don’t have the arm talent to become pure pocket passers late in their careers. McNabb is 8th all time in QB rushing, but nobody remembers his older years in Washington because he was fucking awful. He was very good in Philadelphia though.

Right now, 1:1 I’m taking Lamar. We don’t know what we have in Kenny. If you asked me if I had to pick between Burrow/Herbert or Lamar, I’m taking either of the former. If Kenny is anywhere close to those 2, I’m taking Kenny as well. Right now, you don’t know, so Lamar is the safer proven commodity.

Just because I’m interested tbh (totals at the bottom if you don’t want a full breakdown):

Left tackles: Buffalo: Dion Dawkins; 2017 2nd round pick; ~$7M against the cap. Pittsburgh: Dan Moore Jr; 2021 4th round pick; ~$1M against the cap.

Left guards: Buffalo: Roger Saffold; FA acquisition (former 2nd round pick); ~$4.2M against the cap. Pittsburgh: Kevin Dotson; 4th round pick; ~$1.1M against the cap.

Centres: Buffalo: Mitch Morse; FA acquisition (former 2nd round pick); ~$8M against the cap. Pittsburgh: Mason Cole; FA acquisition (former 3rd round pick); ~$2.6M against the cap

Right guard: Buffalo: Ryan Bates; FA acquisition (former UDFA); ~$2.4M against the cap. Pittsburgh: James Daniels; FA acquisition (former 2nd round pick); ~$4.2M against the cap

Right tackle: Buffalo: David Quessenberry; FA acquisition (former 6th round pick); ~$1.8M against the cap. Pittsburgh: Chuks; 3rd round pick;  ~$4.4M against the cap.

#Totals:

Buffalo across the Oline: ~$23.4M against the cap; one 2nd round draft pick.

Pittsburgh across the Oline: ~$13.3M against the cap; one 3rd round draft pick, two 4th round draft picks. 

Buffalo has gone out and bought a better Oline, thus spending around $10M more against the cap this year than we are, but we have sunk more draft capital into ours (they only drafted their LT, whereas we drafted our LT, LG and RT). 2 of our 5 linemen are also on rookie contracts, whereas none of theirs are. It’s actually somewhat of a comparable investment to the offensive line, offsetting the draft capital with the cap difference due to rookie deals.

I agree with this, but I think the issue is, next year this team needs to be competitive. Their only real shot of contending any time soon is while he’s on a rookie deal, unless he comes out looking like the second coming. Now I’m not saying contend for a Super Bowl next year, but at least contend for a playoff spot.

Next year we’re going to be playing a 4th place schedule, with a premium draft slot this year to replenish some talent (top 12 or better most likely), the entire offense outside of Gentry and backup linemen returning (assuming they don’t come back, which they honestly probably will)…

He’s in a perfect position next season with the talent and schedule to show what he’s got as a day 1 starter. We have talent on offense, literally across the board. Yet ineptitude at QB and with the OC make it seems like we have a bottom 2 offense. Teams with a full receiver room, good young TE, top RB and growing Oline don’t typically look THIS shit.

Good thing the multi-billion dollar franchise has staff to go out and actively look for them, as you know… their job. Where they can interview several candidates and hire the one best qualified for the job. 

>things could always be worse

I believe Mitch Trubisky has the worst yards per attempt of any starter since 2010. We are the 30th ranked offense and that’s with playing essentially a 5 quarter game in week 1, where the yardage should be artificially boosted in average. We are bottom 10 in literally every metric on both sides of the ball, besides points allowed on defense. 

It doesn’t get worse. 

>way worse

We’re going to be 1-7 or 2-6 going into the bye. What is way worse? 0-8? The defense alone has too much talent to go winless, so… not really. The only reason we ARE losing is because of how dogshit this offense is. It’s just to be seen if that’s solely on Mitch, or if Canada is just as bad.

No.. just the third worst.. lol great improvement from last year right? When we were also bottom 5. 

>that defense is something special

Doesn’t matter when they’re on the field for 10 extra minutes a game, can’t stop the run, can’t get off the field on money downs, can’t cover anybody, nor can they get after the QB without Watt. 

This team isn’t beating Buffalo. They’re not beating the Bucs. Maybe (?) Miami, and not Philly either. 

At best we’re looking at 3-5 going into the bye, with 4 divisional games still to go. This isn’t a superbowl team. This isn’t a division winning team. This isn’t a playoff team. It’s an utter disappointment, and it’s more than ok to feel doom and gloom when we SHOULD have been 4-0 through the first four, after winning the most difficult of those games week 1. Instead we’re either 2-2 or 1-3 and about to fall into a hole.

The offense is what it is. Personnel wise, we’re going to see the exact same offense next year, except with an actual NFL QB and hopefully a different coordinator.

As a guy who has played in both eras where these hits have been both allowed and banned, I think he's got a great take on it. 

I've heard lots of players, offensive and defensive, talk on podcasts over the years about these new hit rules. When you give these defensive players a microsecond to alter their angles or be penalized the result is more ""dirty"" hits against the offense. 

This doesn't mean there aren't dirty players, dirty hits, or targeted hits. But it does feel like we've simply relabeled ""hard hits"" as ""dirty"" now. Which is fine. Player safety is of the utmost importance and teaching good fundamentals should be encouraged. But that goes for the offense as well. 

QB's shouldn't be incentivized to throw those ""hospital balls"" because the defensive player isn't quick enough to alter where their bodies are oriented when moving at top speed.

Mitch is not good, never was.  He has flashes, but that's not going to sustain.  His reads are elementary at best, and typically seems lost.  His mechanics aren't great either.

Canada's play calling, at least for me, isn't doing us favors with the QB we have.  It would be interesting to see Pickett try and run this outside of preseason, but as someone else has already said in another post, Tomlin has a plan, and is sticking to it.

Defensively, we're solid.  Where we aren't solid is having them on the field defending the most offensive plays of any team going into last night.  They are worn down and exhausted, so that means tackles are missed, coverages are busted, and other mistakes are made.

I know one player doesn't make the team, but the absence of TJ is killer, even with as much as the defense is in the field, he is a huge difference maker.

On top of all of that, DJ had some awful drops that could potentially have turned the game around, same for a couple offensive fouls (big run by Warren being called back).
