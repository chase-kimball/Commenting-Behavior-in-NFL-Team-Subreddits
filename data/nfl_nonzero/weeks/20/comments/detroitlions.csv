Same deal with Philly, they've got as good or better OL, better WR/TE, significantly better QB on a rookie deal, and a *way* better defense. They can afford the more ""luxury"" type pick of RB because of these differences. 

These situations don't seem comparable to me cause they aren't just in the playoffs or on the verge, all 3 are/were legit SB contenders.

In 2021, we did pretty bad at the start of the year. Toward the end, when Goff got some weapons - Reynolds off waivers and Sun God became his favorite target - Goff did better. This year, we had the leagues top offense for like, the first 5-6 weeks. That momentum carried. But our defense was severely lacking. But then toward the end it picked up. The offense stayed relatively stable throughout save for a few tough games (which happens to every team every year by the way). 

I see no reason for the offense to regress. If Jamaal walks Holmes will find a replacement. If Chark walks, Jamo steps in and we will find a replacement. 

The defense has a lot of opportunities to get better in our weakest areas, namely secondary. The run defense should improve as well will some interior help. And our rookies entering their second year will have every opportunity to improve.

2. The weakness of the CB depth of ours actually makes me fine with the 2nd rd CBs. While Okudah-Jacobs isn't amazing, they are at least capable enough to buy time for guys to develop in that range. Most CBs aren't good immediately anyways.

So while our CB depth is bad, it is either we address it at 6 which doesn't conflict with drafting Bijan. Or we don't, in which case EVEN WITH our awful CB depth I still don't see it as impactful as adding Bijan simply out of how CB development typically goes.

31228,181071,181071,Skraxx,"My counter to this argument:

1- They were only 2nd round picks due to the recent devaluation of RBs. Had they been in prior draft classes, they would have likely gone much higher. This contrasts TE, which has never been a highly valued position.

2- The TE position has completely different expectations than RB and the reason why the two are devalued are for completely different reasons. The ""typical"" TE that's able to be drafted is there for solid blocking ability, maybe some receiving ability. They are not expected to make a sizeable impact. On the other end, a RB who isn't expected to make a sizeable impact will not be drafted. The average draft RB will extend the team's ceiling a lot higher than the average draft TE. RBs are only being devalued nowadays because of injury concerns, as a high-risk high-reward pick like a RB does nothing to help an *offence that is more than a RB away from winning.

Bijan Robinson is not a Jahvid Best tier RB. Bijan Robinson is a Todd Gurley, Christian McCaffrey and Saquon Barkley-tier RB. If you add Bijan to a bad team, then you'll likely get what you saw from early Barkley and CMC. Really good talents that ultimately don't change much for their bad team. But if you add that tier of RB to a team that's ready for it, you get how Todd Gurley was instrumental in the Rams super bowl run (which flamed out when he got injured). McCaffrey on this SF run. Arguably, Barkley was the only reason why the Giants offence got this far in the first place.

While I somewhat agree with RB devaluation, the degree to which it has been, is kinda insane. I no longer think it's probably worth it to draft a RB if you finished bottom-10, risky even if bottom-15. But if you are at the verge of the playoffs or in the playoffs, and have the ability to significantly improve your RB game... You should. That's why there are rumours the Eagles will go as far as pick him with their Saints pick. It's not cause Howie Roseman is dumb, he's built two SB contenders.

You have to remember that we only get half the scoop as fans. NFL scouts - at least those worth a damn - are looking at every doctor report, talking to college team assistants/trainers, interviewing the players themselves, finding out on rehab progress and physical well being, etc. etc. before they're doing anything with one of these guys. No GM worth his weight in shit is going to draft a guy without knowing more about his medical history than even the player probably knows. If there was any indication that Jamo wasn't going to recover completely, there's no way they would've taken him, let alone traded up to get him. 

As it is, we've seen for ourselves that Jamo is just fine. The bonds are already maturing. Jamo was a safe pick. Levi was more of a risk, being that he had a nastier injury and the Lions knew that he'd potentially need fusion. They gambled on that and may well have lost.

36251,217934,217934,Wiggymaster,"Look, man... I fancy myself a bit of a sports statistic nerd, but this is taking it way too far. I really couldn't care less what some model predicts as to whether or not a receiver is going to make a catch or a quarterback is going to make a throw - I just care that the throw and catch are made. As a weather enthusiast who actually uses computer models to make my own forecasts, I know how silly it is to rely on one model or method to try to predict the future even with very sound, reliable mathematical figures that track observations and update every few hours. To paint an accurate picture, you often have to use an ensemble of models that use different methodologies to plot solutions and try to find what's the most likely based on what the ""spaghetti plot"" gives you. Even then, it's rarely on point, especially more than a few days out. Either way, the object of weather forecasting is to try to figure out whether or not you should take an umbrella, or whether or not damage to life and property are possible in a region due to atmospheric phenomena. When it comes to ""sports forecasting"", the obvious motivation is gambling. 

The bottom line is that Goff completed X number of passes out of Y number of throws. His receivers dropped Z number of balls. Opposing defenses caught I number of bad/tipped/missed throws, and our receivers made it into the end zone T number of times after making a catch. As long as T is a relatively high value, I is a relatively low value, and X is fairly consistent/high as it relates to Y, chances are I'm going to be happy with the quarterback in question. There are other numbers I like, such as D yards gained and A average yards per throw. Goff is high in all of these *very real* figures.

44782,273826,273826,jimmyslamjam,"Picture this: ‚Äã


The year is 2049. Dan Campbell just finishes his shift as a milkman. He loads his empty milk crates back into his truck and takes it back to the depot, before picking up his own two bottles and heading home. ‚Äã
Campbell pushes the door open - it's 04:48. His wife, Jennifer, is still asleep. ‚Äã


Campbell sits down on his sofa. He peels the foil off the top of the milk and gently brings it to his lips, pausing briefly. Is someone watching him? No. Of course not. ‚Äã


With a sigh, Campbell pushes himself out. He's older now than he cares to recognise, not what he once was. ‚Äã


Moving over to the bookshelf, he moves a dusty metal mouthpiece from the top of a slightly cleaner book. A photo album. Memories. Campbell sighs again. ‚Äã


Peeling the pages apart, like how sweat would later stick himself to the bedsheets, he grins. Resting between the pages were the still faces of those who had once tried to stop him. ‚Äã


New clippings - headlines - internet posts. All of the fighting. All of the drama. ‚Äã


And what for? ‚Äã


Campbell slumped down into the privace of his chair - his body clicked and a grimace followed each shaky movement. ‚Äã


The chair itself rattled as he pressed his weight into it - the Honolulu blue and silver metal shooting light across the room, into Brad Holmes' line of sight - though partially blinded, he could see the chair clearly enough to tell it was made of metal kneecaps. ‚Äã


Campbell coughed - a hollow, haunting noise. His bald head hit the back of his makeshift throne. Movement came from upstairs - Jennifer was up. ‚Äã


In pain now, and through a raspy breath that sounded so familiar, he called: ‚Äã


""Jennifer?"" ‚Äã


She came into the room - her long pink night gown trailing behind her. ‚Äã

Jennifer had a chiseled face. Stubble spread across her chin and decorated her neck, trailing off until the hairs disappeared under the soft, pink fabric. ‚Äã


Her short blonde hair stood with the weight of an expensive gel. ‚Äã
Brad Holmes watched the scene in Awe. Jennifer - Jared Goff - walked over to Campbell and held his head up gently, caressing his neck with adoration. He was old now. ‚Äã


Brad Holmes turned around. Campbell was dying. It was no place of his to intrude. And so he left.

Violations of NFL's personal conduct policies

In 1996, Favre was temporarily banned by the NFL from drinking alcohol,[251] after he admitted he was addicted to Vicodin,[252] and spent 46 days at a drug rehab clinic before the start of the season.[253] His condition was serious enough that he had a potentially deadly seizure.[254]

Sexting allegations and investigation

In 2010, the NFL investigated Favre for allegedly sexting and leaving inappropriate voice messages for Jets ""Gameday host"" Jenn Sterger during the 2008 season.[255][256] According to the NFL, forensic analysis failed to prove Favre sent the objectionable photographs to Sterger.[257] Favre was found not to be in violation of the NFL's personal conduct policy, but was fined $50,000 for failing to cooperate with the investigation.[257]

Mississippi welfare funds scandal

Main article: Mississippi welfare funds scandal
In 2020, Favre's involvement with the development and promotion of a concussion treatment drug, Prevasol, by the Prevacus corporation, came under scrutiny. The nonprofit Mississippi Community Education Center (MCEC) received $2.5 million in federal grant funds diverted from Mississippi's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families welfare funds (TANF), as well as tens of millions in public funds as an element of the scheme. The Mississippi state auditor has termed the scheme ""the largest public embezzlement case in state history"". A grand jury in Hinds County indicted MCEC founder, Nancy New, and her son Zach in the scheme. Favre had introduced MCEC's founders to top state welfare officials.[258] Former Governor Phil Bryant is also involved in the scandal.[259]

No-show speaking fees

On May 4, 2020, an audit in Favre's home state of Mississippi alleged that state's Department of Human Services misspent $94 million intended for at-need residents, including $1.1 million paid out to Favre's company for two speaking appearances he did not make.[260] The Mississippi auditor later announced that Favre intended to repay that money.[261] On October 12, 2021, the Mississippi State Auditor notified Favre that he could face a civil lawsuit if he did not pay the state $828,000.[262] Favre paid $600,000 on October 26, 2021.[263] The Mississippi State Auditor said Favre still owed $228,000 and referred the matter to the state attorney general's office.[264][265] Favre was questioned by the FBI over the misappropriated funds. His lawyer has stated that Favre did not know the money was misappropriated from funds used to assist poor families and has not been charged with a crime in these matter.[266][267]

Diversion of funds for volleyball facility and biotech venture

A lawsuit filed by the state of Mississippi alleges Favre orchestrated the diversion of federal welfare funds to non-welfare related causes.[268]

On September 13, 2022, Mississippi Today published text messages between Favre and former Mississippi governor Phil Bryant showing Favre's involvement in a plan to divert $5 million of the money toward a cause championed by Favre, a new volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi, his alma mater and where his daughter played volleyball.[269] The text messages had been entered as evidence as part of a civil lawsuit.[270] In one of the texts, Favre asks, ""If you were to pay me is there anyway the media can find out where it came from and how much?""[271]

Favre helped arrange for $2 million of the funds to be invested in a biotech startup in which he had already invested.[268]",9.0,detroitlions,t3_10haiaw,False,0.0,DETROIT -VS- EVERYBODY,2023-01-20T17:24:16Z,detroitlions,-6.292314995589308e-06
