6260,45920,45920,Cidolfus,"I know rushing quarterbacks like Jackson are really exciting, but until somebody proves that they can do it and stay healthy for a long time, it feels like organizational malpractice to build your team around that skillset long term. In the past two seasons, Jackson has missed ten total games and in two of the games he did play he had only four attempts before leaving due to injury. Since his string of injuries beginning with his week 10 absence in 2021, Jackson has been on a worrying trajectory.

Even ignoring the two games in which he had a combined eight attempts before injury since week 10 of last year, Jackson has passed for 2649 yards, 19 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and a completion percentage of 62.1% on 391 attempts in 13 games. He's added 878 yards and three touchdowns on the ground during that stretch on 136 attempts as well, but also eight fumbles (two lost).

On a per-game basis, he's still putting up the yards (271.3 yards per game). That's right up there alongside his pace during his MVP season (270.8 yards per game), but his scoring has fallen off a damn cliff and his turnovers are way up. In 2019 Jackson had 43 total touchdowns and only 8 total turnovers, a phenomenal 5.375 : 1 ratio, but over this stretch since injuries started piling on, he's down to only 22 touchdowns to 14 turnovers, an absolutely dismal 1.57 : 1 ratio.

Obviously there are a lot of factors that the numbers don't account for here, but I don't understand how this dramatic drop in production gets so easily dismissed when people talk about Jackson's contract negotiations. The Ravens aren't suddenly going to be able to afford putting better weapons around him by paying a massive contract with huge guarantees. Maybe you hope things improve with a new offensive coordinator, but Jackson's health and production have to be worrying, and I think anyone, whether it's the Ravens or another team in a tag-and-trade, who gives Jackson the type of guarantees he's interested in is taking on an absolutely massive risk based on his current trends.",5.0,nfl,t3_10k8xwr,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-01-24T13:54:41Z,miamidolphins,-0.0137173525080666

Their window will be open for a decade, but it may take some flukey shit or a ‚Äúspirit over roster talent‚Äù year for them. Because the 2021 team was unreal. I mean they‚Äôre still good af but the team was putting up better numbers and playing better last year.

32630,244370,244370,finsnfeathers,"Pete Caroll has been evolving his system the past few seasons to be more multiple with his coverages and add disguise. They still base out of their cover 3 but it is much more intricate with man/match principles unlike Boyer and Flores Cover 3 they coach that we based out of this past season and a half. Ours is way more simple and more old school spot drop. Their corners actually press in their cover 3 while reading the other receivers routes instead of last year when our corners would show press then bail to their 1/3 while watching the QB. 

Front wise they aren‚Äôt as multiple or blitz heavy like weve been, but they use way more different 4 man stunts where Boyer mostly used 5 man stunts. And when they walk guys to the line it‚Äôs to usually just rush 4 or 5 and disguise who‚Äôs coming and who isn‚Äôt.


Things that will change:

Bye bye Boyers cover 0

No more weird prevent formations that give up easy 15 yard completions

Requiring our corners to be incredible man coverage defenders

Things that won‚Äôt change:

Requiring our corners to be big and physical press defenders

Exotic blitzes that send DBs and drop DLinemen

I think it‚Äôs a great fit for our personnel because we already ran a lot of different fronts especially odd fronts. Despite this scheme being a 4-3 scheme there‚Äôs still 5 men on the LoS, just some will be in different gaps.  Baker will do fine as one of the off ball LBs but the rest of the room might be gone aside from Tindall

Our secondary will require big/long corners so guys like Kader and Needham will not be ideal for the outside, but should be fine in the slot and even FS. So CB2 opposite Howard would be a big need. Holland would fill the Earl Thomas role and Brandon Jones the Kam Chancellor/Jamal Adams.

TL:DR
Scheme is Zone heavy but with man principles which should lead to tighter coverage without having to have two 20 some million dollar CBs. Less all out blitzing and more disguise.
