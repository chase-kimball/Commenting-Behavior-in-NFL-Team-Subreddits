1676,9003,9003,ASuperGyro,"I actually do have a question about it, it seems that all the hot teams have offensive leaders. Even the Bills, with a defensive HC, had offensive issues push come shove in the playoffs and underperformed, meanwhile their offensive guy that went to be the Giants HC overperformed by most metrics. 

The Chargers with their defensive HC had both a bad offensive second half and bad defensive second half, partly in due to their uninspiring OC and having a defensive minded HC. 

Tomlin and Bill B are certainly great coaches, but without an offensive guru in the building, whether that be an OC or HoF QB, their offenses look very lack luster. 

So my question is why are any defensive HCs in hot demand when it just doesn’t seem like that is a recipe for success in the league currently. If you get a top level offensive guy they’re probably going to be the target of teams who fired their HC previously.

I don’t mean this to take away from Ryan at all, great guy and great coach and the defense is impressive, but is that a recipe for success in the current league?

The way the game is moving im not sure he doesnt play a similar role as CJ Gardner-Johnson who plays a hybrid safety/slot corner position or like Brian Branch plays in Alabamas defense the ""star"" position. This basically takes a safety off the field and leaves Minkah as the 1-high safety allowing for an extra lineman or linebacker to get after the QB or rush the passer. The Steelers also played a lot of 3 safety sets late last season and looked pretty good. Kazee looked good but hes going to be 30 before the season starts, same as Arthur Maulet. If he rides the bench in year 1 it wouldnt be the worst thing in the world and he could learn behind some vets rather than being thrown to the wolves. 

Steelers play a lot of zone and very little press coverage.

As far as the ""Edmunds things"" ILB is much easier to come across than a starting LT which is why you dont see 3ILBs taken in the first round every single draft like LTs especially in the top 5-10 picks. If would be silly to tag him at a top 3 paid ILB or try to trade him. Their market value is about 15% lower and they tend to be easier to come by in the middle rounds of the draft...

I agree with you here I don’t want to kick the can too far down the line, but also look at it this way. Heyward is only under contract for 2023/2024, so shifting his amount owed to next season when we have over $100M in space and none of the young guys are due doesn’t really hurt us in any way. Watt would be the big one that could hurt us in some way, but I also believe you can spread that money out over several years, so in this case it wouldn’t hinder us too much, and wouldn’t really affect anything when Pickett is due.

> also a 6.5M hit

Yeah I had no idea what number to toss out here. Some of those guys wont even be making $1M. Then guys like Gentry or Kazee may demand $2M+.  But RFA’s and ERFA’s aren’t making much. As for the backloaded thing, I was thinking more so making 2024 larger hits for guys like Edmunds and Spillane to keep capital free’d up rather than guys like this.

I doubt he’s playing until he’s 39. He’s got 2, maybe 3 and then he’s going to be done. You also have to factor in:
