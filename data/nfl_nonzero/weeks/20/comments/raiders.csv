AR has elite arm strength and the skills to be a serious running threat. I saw a guy once who had a worse accurate arm and a more willingness to run named Cam Newton. If anybody remembers Cam in his first camp he was wild. Run back his preseason throws he was skipping balls off the turf. 

But Cam, being the elite athlete he is and presumably AR is, developed into a very competent passer. Literal MVP level. I don't personally like projects, I hated having Pryor as our QB.

32294,238075,238075,fsckedagain,"What Happens if the Packers Trade Aaron Rodgers?  
  
Rodgers does not have a no trade clause in his contract so he could be traded to a team as well.  The timing of the option should give the Packers all the way until the end of training camp to move him. The cap charge here would depend on when he was traded. If Rodgers were to be traded prior to June 1st the Packers would take on a $40,313,750 cap hit in 2023. If he was traded after June 1st it would be a $15,833,570 cap hit in 2023 with $24,480,000 due in 2024. This assumes that the Packers did not exercise the option before the trade. If the option is exercised then the trade number spikes to nearly $100 million. There should be no need to exercise the option until the last possible day.  
  
For the team acquiring Rodgers they would be on the hook for the salary for the year. The cap charge would be $59,515,000 if they do not exercise his option and $15.79 million if they were to exercise the option. Rodgers has an injury guarantee of $49.25 million for 2024 but that does not become fully guaranteed until 5 days after the 2023 Super Bowl. If Rodgers was cut after 2023 it would cost the team $43.725 million on the 2024 cap.

Regardless of how Las Vegas parted ways with Carr, why would I cost my new team anything if I had a choice???  

The way I understand it, Carr has the choice of which team he will allow the Raiders to trade him to.  If he isn’t traded by February 13th, he either gets cut or we pay him his 33mil and keep him on the roster.  If this is the case, why wouldn’t I just deny the trade and proceed to get cut.  Then sign with the team I would have chose if I was to allow the trade with the Raiders.  Now my new home has all the tools they need to make my time with them even better.  

If my understanding is correct, Carr would be absolutely crazy to agree to any trade.  This wouldn’t even be made out of spite, it would make great business sense and as all Carr haters pointed out when he was benched, this is a BUSINESS.

Pros: fantastic arm talent, great at presnap reads and is super durable 

Cons: while he’s actually fairly athletic he hates scrambling and doesn’t do it often enough, he doesn’t have that Joe Burrow mentality of staying in the pocket and handling big hits, and honestly his accuracy and decision making really took a nosedive this season

Overall he has the physical tools to be elite but he’s too inconsistent to be that kinda guy

Many guys over the years have been picked up by the Raiders, played amazing under Carr for a year or two, and then gotten big contracts by another team. Zay and Nelson to name the most recent two. I think if a team with a top 10 defends needs a QB, that they’ll go the furthest with him. He’s not Mahomes or Brady so no he won’t go and score on 90% of drives, and he won’t always be able to drive the field in 18 seconds. He CAN have game winning drives, but last year he was inconsistent. People here will probably argue against that but before the loss to the cardinals this year, he was 9-0 in OT games and leads the league in 4q come backs since 2014.
