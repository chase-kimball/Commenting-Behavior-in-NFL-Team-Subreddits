Probably because they’re playing each other’s defense. 

>No one is as impressed by beating a team without their starting QB

So if the Eagles win this weekend and Hurts has a good game against the best defense in the league, it won’t be impressive because a 3rd string QB happens to be playing on the other team?

>Dak puts up big numbers agaisnt bad defenses

He can put up big numbers against any defense. Just not every single time, which if he was, he’d be breaking records. He just shredded the Eagles defense this year.

>A QB on his first contract would be much less expensive and could produce similar results

That’s not guaranteed. QBs bust way more often than not. And when they don’t, year 3 seems to be when they actually break out lately. Right now, Dak is the one who has led a top 3 offense for 4 years in a row when healthy. It’s not that easy to replace.

Dak because that’s literally what we’re talking about. Hurts as an example because you seem to believe Minshew would’ve continued to match Dak’s scoring drives even though Hurts didn’t have a performance like that against the same defense. 

>Pollard being a top 5 running back has more to do with the scoring offense than Dak

Except Pollard played the whole season. The offense only sky rocketed in production when Dak returned. The real reason is 3rd down conversion rate and then redzone scoring rate. The Cowboys were 1st in both with Dak. 

If you want to credit Pollard with the redzone scoring rate, it’s still important to note that when you convert 3rd downs, you extend drives and are more likely to reach the redzone to score. That’s what we weren’t doing with Rush, but then were doing better than anyone else with Dak. 

And before you try to credit Pollard with the 3rd down conversion rate too, even if you just limit it to passing plays on 3rd down, the Cowboys converted them at a higher rate than any other team during the weeks he was healthy (implying it was Dak throwing the ball to convert those 3rd down). 

Rushing 3rd down conversion rate stayed consistent. 3rd with or without Dak. Passing went from 29th without Dak to 1st with Dak. Astronomical impact.",1.0,nfl,t3_10j33gz,False,0.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,2023-01-24T13:40:42Z,cowboys,7.465036325594863e-07
1421,17668,17668,BilllisCool,"Again, he was scoring whether it was a short field or not. It might’ve been a lower scoring game without the turnovers, but you can’t just assume Minshew would’ve kept matching his scoring if it weren’t for the turnovers. It’s still possible for the defense to get a normal stop. 

In the game he played in, Hurts scored on 5 drives and punted 4 times, also with the help of 4 short fields. In this game, Dak scored on 8 drives and punted 1 time. Then of course the pick 6. No reason to think Minshew would match that. 

I agree he had a down year due to the picks, but that’s it. Still led one of the highest scoring teams since his return and was #1 on 3rd down, both with the offense as  a whole and only looking at passing on 3rd down.

1422,17669,17669,BilllisCool,"The defense played at their highest level at the beginning of the season (until the playoffs, at least). As I said, Dak was scoring 2 more touchdowns per game than Rush.

There was a very clear difference in offensive production, specifically when Dak came back. Not even just points, but everything that led to those points, such as being first in the league on 3rd down. Also 1st among QBs when passing on 3rd down, since I’ve already had someone try to credit the RBs for that. 

The team is obviously good, but the offense isn’t as stacked as people make it out to be. Pretty much just Lamb and Pollard, with some good line play every now and then, but they were constantly injured. Multiple people have also gone through the picks and 7 of them were on the receiver.

It went from CMC getting 0 touches per game (because he wasn’t on the team) to 19 touches per game. The offense also wasn’t one of the worst. It was still good without him and became one of the best with him.

Now here’s my favorite part. From weeks 2-6, the Cowboys were 29th in 3rd down conversion rate for passes at 26%. So Cooper Rush only. When you remove the runs, they move from 24th to 29th. So the RBs were actually helping Cooper Rush convert more 3rd downs. For Dak, the team is 1st regardless.

However, if Dalton is gone we’re also going to be even more in need of another playmaker (doubly so if Pollard walks). 

An outside corner and another weapon are the two biggest needs IMO. Another weapon should likely be dealt with in the draft, especially with this piss poor free agency WR class.

Sean Payton? Nah. If the concern with Mike McCarthy is the narrative that he is just a regular season coach that can’t win in the playoffs, then Sean Payton is the same thing lol. Especially if we have to give up expensive draft capital to get Payton.

Hopefully Quinn isn’t gone but if he is, maybe Fangio is a great guy to replace.

Problem is Dak has a no-trade clause. Every Qb has it. Romo, Brady, Mahomes, even Carr. Meaning you can't really talk about shipping them off. And even if they do say ok, they  may get the last say if they want to go there (not sure on Dak's contract).

IF, and big IF, Dak wants a trade, his deal is still on our books. Romo's fat deal was getting paid out 2 or 3 years after he retired. That's the reason extending Dak is smart. You take all this big money owed in bonuses, base, pay, etc the next 2 years and you spread it even further so they pay is less but for longer so it sort of balances itself out. The QB has the final say if they agree to that tho. That 40 mill next year drops to whatever the new deal is (say 30 mill), and you can manage that a lot easier if you cut him loose (so you'd save 5-10 million a year in cap space and allows you to spread the cap hit of whatever to how many years were left on the contract).",5.0,cowboys,t3_10kl7xv,False,0.0,Roy Williams,2023-01-24T20:27:24Z,cowboys,0.0316083338572797

Fair, although the offensive line was still pretty elite in 2016, two years after his departure. He was definitely the reason it ever reached that point.

>I have a theory as to what happened and it wasn't because Callahan couldn't cut it as OC, which is more of what the team wanted people to believe as compared to what actually happened.

What is your theory? I struggle to see why they would push him out of that role so quickly if he was actually a step up. From my view watching the games, he wasn't it.

>The team had the 3rd best passing offense in 2012 in Callahan's 1st season.

Callahan **was not the offensive play-caller** (nor pass-game coordinator) in 2012. They made a big show of taking away play-caller duties from Garrett after the disappointing end of the 2012 season.

>In 2013, his team passing and running game were not as good (both were outside of the Top 10 and the running game was bottom 10) but we were 5th in scoring. But we were still putting the O-Line together and getting them comfortable and we hadn't yet fully leaned on Murray just yet.

I beg of you, please refer to DVOA when measuring how effective a unit of the team is and how they compare to the rest of the league. It accounts for strength of opponent, situation, and is superior to using volume stats to measure their performance. Abandoning the 4th-most effective run game by DVOA to the tune of being 31st in rush attempts will depress the yardage ""ranking"" of the run game while artificially inflating how effective the pass game was in the eyes of volume-based metrics. Same reply goes for your next paragraph.

>Personally, we should have kept Callahan on as O-Line Coach and Run Game Coordinator and brought in someone else to develop the passing game and call plays.

We... literally did this. It pissed him off and surely fueled his desire to GTFO as soon as his contract expired.

>The offense wasn't radically better with Linehan and his lackluster playcalling in regards to the running game and passing game got exposed quickly.

Our 2014 offense was decisively better than 2013. 2016 was much better than 2013 as well. Please refer to the advanced metrics that adjust for the context and better measure true effectiveness. Our run-heavy, ball-control offense heavily impacted how we ""rank"" in the old world of using counting stats to stack us up against other teams, but the more context-aware stats universally regard the Linehan years well above the Garrett and Callahan years.",2.0,cowboys,t3_10l3esz,False,0.0,Kellen Moore,2023-01-25T16:16:36Z,cowboys,0.012768034705819

Despite improved red zone efficiency thanks to the emergence of Murray and a viable run game (resulting in being 5th in points), the offensive DVOA went from 12th under Garrett to… 11th (Linehan had multiple years inside the top 10 as our OC). The effectiveness of the passing game fell outside the top 10 for the first time since the 2010 Kitna year and despite _drastically_ improved effectiveness of our run game (in the 20s to 4th best), he still abandoned the run just as often as Garrett.

I guess, but we were the 4th-highest scoring team in the league this season and (I believe) the highest or 2nd-highest scoring team once Dak returned.

30066,259288,259288,firstandfive,">Purposely defining your question narrowly so you can’t be wrong doesn’t add any semantic value to a discussion. 

Kellen Moore is an offensive coordinator. We are talking about offensive coordinators. The majority of offensive play-callers in the NFL are offensive coordinators. But even if we include play-calling head coaches, you still haven't expressed a view that Moore is outside the top 8? 10?

>If you know anything about the way the NFL operates, you know that good OCs don’t stay OC for more than a few years. Sean McVay got an HC job offer after two years of excellence at Washington. Kyle Shanahan ran the Falcons offense for two seasons before getting an offer from SF. I could go on. FOs around the league don’t need much proof a guy has figured it out to promote them.

Oh, you beautiful, naive, sophisticated newborn baby. Kyle Shanahan had **9 years** of NFL offensive coordinator experience (and 4 additional years in different coaching roles) before getting his shot at head coach. McVay had 3 years with the OC title and 8 total NFL years of NFL coaching experience  before getting a shot at HC, and even that was seen as a surprise hire. Of the offensive-minded head coaches:

* Andy Reid: 7 years total, 0 as OC
* Kyle Shanahan: 13 years, 9 as OC
* Sean McVay: 8 years, 3 as OC (play-caller for 2)
* Doug Pederson: 7 years, 3 as OC (non-play-calling)
* Brian Daboll: 21 years, 8 as OC
* Josh McDaniels: 8 years, 3 as OC for his first HC gig (with all the Patriots luster), 7 more years as OC before getting another chance which he backed out of
* Sean Payton: 9 years, 4 as OC/Pass-game coordinator
* Kliff Kingsbury: 9 years in college, 6 as HC and 3 as OC
* Kevin O'Connell: 7 years, 3 as OC (non-play-calling)
* Dan Campbell: 11 years, 0 as OC
* Matt LaFleur: 10 years, 2 as OC (play-caller for 1)
* Arthur Smith: 12 years, 2 as OC
* Mike McDaniel: 15 years, 4 as OC/run-game coordinator (non-play-caller)
* Nathaniel Hackett: 13 years, 7.5 as OC (play-caller for 4.5)
* Zac Taylor: 6 years, 1 partially as interim OC, plus 1 year of college OC experience
* Kevin Stefanski: 14 years, 1 as OC
* Frank Reich: 12 years, 4 as OC (play-caller for 2, I think)

So nobody with the mere 5 years of NFL coaching experience that Moore currently possesses, even if you cut out some of the years where people had titles like ""intern"" or ""quality control."" Additionally, not being hired as a HC is not an indictment of him as an offensive play-caller. Some people are just better cut out for coordinator roles than for being a head coach over the entire team.

&#x200B;

>Kellen Moore has been the Cowboys OC and play caller for half a decade. The fact that he hasn’t been poached yet pretty much makes my argument for me. Not every FO in the league is stupid. They can all see that there’s too much Garrett in Moore.

I think we can agree we just established that your argument is flawed.

As for your criticisms of Moore, some are valid, others are exaggerated.

>His situational playcalling is atrocious. It’s like he doesn’t understand down and distance. Admittedly this point is partially covered by the 2nd and 10 runs point.

Is red zone not situational? An area where we had literally the best offense in the league at converting red-zone trips to touchdowns? Is third-down not situational, where we had the 6th-best conversion percentage? Is fourth-down not situational, where we had the 5th-best conversion percentage?

>He consistently runs away from success. We had the best success this season on offense with lots of pre-snap motion, no huddle tempo, and play-action passing. Why didn’t we do those things a lot more often? Smart football people like Shanahan, Reid, and McVay weaponize those aspects of play calling and use them consistently.

Our at-snap motion rate was comparable to the Chiefs this year, and we saw more of it when it mattered (in the playoffs), but I do wish we used it more so we agree on that. Our play-action rate was inside the top 10 as well, but it wouldn't hurt to use it a little more as well.

>Finally, my biggest indictment of him is that the offense performed significantly better in no-huddle tempo, when the play caller takes a back seat to the QB. Just like Garrett’s offenses with Romo.

Lol. You don't think that's something they work on specifically with Moore during the week? 

>I’ll bet I can find a position coach to upgrade to OC somewhere that understands these things, and I’ll bet that position coach will be a better OC than Moore.

Name names.

In all, I can agree with some of your criticisms. I do wish he was less stubborn with some of his early down runs (although I wonder how much of that comes from edicts from McCarthy or the Jones', since Moore has expressed a desire to be more pass-happy on more than one occasion). I think he should use more pre and at-snap motion, plus more play-action. We've seen more rub routes than ever during the Garrett/Linehan era, but would love to see some more. 

But just because I want him to continue doing *more* of the good stuff that he already does (and has improved at during his time here) doesn't mean he should be fired or would be easily replaced. Either you weren't a fan yet or you've already forgotten how stale the offensive approach got under Linehan. You forget how much of an improvement Linehan was over Callahan and Garrett's play-calling.

Because the topic wasn’t “offensive playcallers” in general, I quite clearly stated offensive coordinators… as in the role currently held by Moore and the role we would be hiring for if he were to leave or be fired. There’s a lot more to consider when evaluating a play-calling head coach beyond someone just in charge of the offense. On that front, though, Daboll is not currently an offensive play-caller.

> Daboll developed Josh Allen and built the Bills offense. 

Daboll also has a lot of years of running bad offenses on his resume. Credit to him for Allen, sure, and so far he seems to be cut out for being a head coach in this league, but his resume as an OC was not as sparkling or “consistently developing QBs” as you stated it was.

> He took Daniel Jones and made the playoffs with him. He’s done more as an OC and he did it again as an HC.

Kafka runs the offense and calls the plays in New York. But surely you already know that because even I know that and I don’t know enough about football to have a fulfilling discussion with you :)

So have you thought of any **Offensive Coordinators** yet who are better than or on par with Moore? As far as play-calling head coaches go, I’ll grant you Reid, McVay, Shanahan, and McDaniels as better than Moore. Moore’s better as a play-caller than half the play-calling head coaches though too. As far as OCs go, Steichen is up there with him and I could certainly see the argument for picking him over Moore. Ben Johnson is definitely right there too, and Kafka will be if he keeps it going in year 2. Other than that though, I don’t think there were any other OCs on par unless I’m forgetting someone.

30101,259334,259334,firstandfive,"Watched about 8 minutes of the video and do have some actual feedback.

## On the content

Think about how you want your show to answer the question: ""what do Cowboys fans get from your show that they don't get from the prominent podcasts or popular channels like Voch Lombardi, Jeff Cavanaugh, etc?""

* Do you want to provide in-depth analysis from watching the film? Dude on the right mentioned watching some niners games but didn't really touch on anything below surface level.
* Do you come equipped with detailed stats that we may not hear from other shows? Dude on the right said the Niners play mostly in base on defense... how often do they do that and how does that rate compare to the rest of the league? How has Dallas fared against that type of personnel group?
* Do you two have a rapport or a way of discussing these topics that people find interesting or entertaining? This video very much felt like y'all were trying this out for the first time (which is to be expected) and still working on finding the overall voice of the show. Do you want the show to be entertaining or insightful? You can certainly have shades of both, but I would think about how you want people to view your show and focus on accomplishing that.

## On the production value

If you're not going to have visual graphics on the screen, I would treat this more like a podcast (although you can still upload video to YouTube as well of course). That means trying to cut down or limit uhhs, umms, and ""do you want to talk about the Niners offense or defense first?"" A lot of that will come with more practice and getting comfortable with recording, but it also helps to have the plan for what to talk about outlined before hitting record, or editing out the decision points before uploading. For example, ask the question, then once you decide, have one of you record a lead-in to the segment y'all decided to cover, then just chop out the part where y'all decided.

Audio quality could also be better, but I think y'all need to answer the previous questions before upgrading microphones unless y'all have other uses for mics and the disposable income to spend. There are some ""getting started podcasting"" guides out there that have relatively cheap starter mics that will at least be an upgrade over those earbud mics.

For these first few episodes in particular, y'all should both be watching it back and evaluating what you and your co-host needs to work on. Back when I had a fantasy football podcast, I would always go back and listen for my ""uhh"" and ""umm"" or when I would overuse the same phrasing (""it'll be interesting to see..."") and at a certain point, I would start catching myself about to say these things while recording and could correct it right then and there. You might even consider recording the same segment a couple of times trying a few different approaches until you figure out the voice you want for it or what feels the most compelling.

&#x200B;

Overall, it's not something I would tune into yet, but if y'all think about these questions and keep working at it you can get there. Dude on the left already has a good presence for the medium (just need to cut down uhhs/umms and find a groove with the outline of the show and intros/transitions), dude on the right seems new to recording but will grow more comfortable with time. Wishing you luck, feel free to come back after some more episodes to see what progress you've made.",5.0,cowboys,t3_10gzt60,True,0.0,Kellen Moore,2023-01-20T11:09:59Z,cowboys,0.0394478792413146

A foundation is in place for Elliott to sign a contract restructure that better aligns him with today’s running-back market.

We lost Cooper, Collins, and Gregory in the offseason and everyone in here was in agreement we were in a soft rebuild and 9-8 was the ceiling. We went into the season with a WR corps of CeeDee, post ACL injury Michael Gallup, and Noah Brown as our top 3 WR. We still went 12-5 and won a playoff game before losing to the team with the best roster and defense in the league. Yet, everyone who said we weren’t gonna do anything this year is mad that we lost to probably the best team in the league despite far exceeding the expectations they had at the beginning of the season. 

In the end, this is a failure by the front office. Instead of building off of the 12-5 season we had last year, they decided to go into rebuild mode for no reason when we had a roster that could contend. Teams like the 49ers and Eagles made huge additions to their teams while we subtracted and did nothing. Fortunately, we were able to make up for losing Collins and Gregory, but there was still a glaring hole at WR2 all year. If we want to win a Super Bowl next year, we MUST be aggressive in the offseason and get an upgrade at the WR2 position.
