4060,14095,14095,AssssCrackBandit,"It's not just possibly a single 1st round pick. The report is that the Saints want more than a first round pick, potentially multiple 1sts

https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2023/01/21/saints-want-more-than-a-first-round-pick-for-sean-payton/

To me, the money matters not bc of the cash flow or revenue or anything but rather the alternatives that it leaves the Chargers. If Payton gets a monster 5-7 year. $20-25MM/yr contract like most are predicting, it basically ties you to him as a coach no matter what. He can come out and go winless his 2 seasons and we would have no recourse but to keep him as coach for the next 5 years after that because of the enormous amount of money committed, not even thinking about the amount of assets you had to trade to get him.

Like Gruden got half the salary than Payton is expecting and despite having a pretty horrible run at HC, the only reason the Raiders were able to move on is because of the email scandal and the fact that Gruden was forced to resign. 

And this is not even going to Payton's character concerns and my doubt that Spanos/TT would want to associate with something like that 

But my biggest issue is with the compensation. At this stage in Herbert's career, with his contract looming, we have to start building thru the draft since our cap is gonna be very tight moving forward. Giving up even a single 1st, tho it will be more than that, would go completely in the face of this. And even then, its not a guarantee that Payton will make us a contender.

I spent plenty of years reading complaints about the Bengals organization during the Dalton years and in general, and remember people wanted heads to roll after Burrow went down and they spent a 1st on a WR in that off-season. Just think the org realized what they had in their hands and either trusted Taylor's process or what but it worked for them.

Also lots of luck. Injuries were decimating the line last year but the team got hot in the right moment and their other pieces (Mixon, Higgins, Hurst) were getting hot as well so you got a great combination too.

If we were to take Robinson, it would actually be more like a 50/50 share. I don't hate the idea of taking him because that RB duo would be dangerous and could actually help develop deep passing opportunities if we have to keep defenses honest to a strong running game. That's part of the reason why our deep passing sucked. It was less about having a fast WR and more about our offensive scheme plus a weak run game that opposing defenses didn't have to worry about too much. I think it's extremely unlikely Robinson is there at 21 but a man can dream.

That said, while it would be nice to have a speedy WR, I don't think it's 100% necessary if we fix the offense. Other teams have no problem opening up the passing game without a burner. We just need to get those WRs open, whether that be by speed or scheme. I do hope we take a faster WR but it doesn't have to be in the 1st round.
