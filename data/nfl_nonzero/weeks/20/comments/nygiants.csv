Every successful team in the NFL today has either a top 5 QB or a strong running game. Even the most arduent Jones defenders can agree that he isn't Patrick Mahomes, so unless we plan on upgrading at QB then we need to build a strong run game. We can either invest in the line over the next 2-3 years (which will cost $$ and draft resources) or we can sign Saquon.

We aren't finding a WR1 with $13M. It's questionable whether or not a WR1 would contribute to the offense as much as Saquon. OBJ was incredible for us but we still didn't win many games without a running game.

The last thousand yard rusher we had before Saquon was Bradshaw, who received a second contract with us (along with Jacobs) and was running behind a significantly better line than what Saquon has infront of him. 

If we want to maintain Saquon's production we're going to have to at a minimum channel the $13-15M/year that we'd spend resigning him towards shoring up the interior offensive line and then probably spend a mid-round pick or two on a RB.

> No one is paying him 35M no matter how much you try to will it lmao. He threw for 15-5, 3K yards, and a 92.5 rating. That isn’t 35M a year and no front office is that stupid.

This is not me willing it into existence, this is what surveyed NFL GMs are saying and it makes sense. There's no reason for him to accept anything less than that since the franchise tag will be around $35M this season. To say otherwise shows a lack of understand in how NFL contracts work.

> Henry is an outlier, how on earth can you try that argument then use a guy who looks like a HOF RB who isn’t slowing down lol.

The irony of saying Henry is an outlier and then naming Todd fucking Gurley lol.

Also you just straight up lied above. Shady had a 1100 yard season for Buffalo at age 29 and his last season with the Bills he was 30 (the age I said above that RBs fall off). No need to resort to lying to try and make your argument my dude. Also naming Fournette is kinda weird since he's never been a player even close to the caliber of Barkley. Zeke has fallen off, I'll give you that, but he has an extremely physical style of running and doesn't have the body of Henry to sustain all of those hits.

> Our linebacking corp as a whole is making less than 12M a year, lol. That’s a lot of money for simple upgrades across the board and the difference between signing Jaylon Smith to 1M a year over a better LB at 5M. 

And our linebacking corps is trash. How many good linebackers do you think you can sign for under $12M/year? You can't even sign two Mark Glowinskis for that money. The fact that you think we can sign a good linebacker for $5M/year is laughable. 

$12M is not a lot of money no matter how you try to slice it. You ain't getting Saquon production spending that money elsewhere, period.

> Cool, cause we’re not giving Jones 35M either.

It will be tough to resign him for anything less. He's a young QB coming off of a ""career"" year and just won a playoff game. Someone will overpay him if it's not us.

> Running back contracts aren’t cheap at all. You overpay heavily per yard of production compared to other offensive positions and they’re readily replaceable.

This argument makes no sense. Saquon was 5th in the NFL in yards from scrimmage and the only non-RBs higher than him were Jefferson and Tyreek Hill. Those guys will have contracts that are twice as much as his hypothetical contract he'd get this offseason. RBs are actually some of the cheapest contracts in terms of yards per production.

> They’re also prone to leaving massive deadcap issues when an RB hits age 27-28 and just falls off a cliff.

This is somewhat true but the age is usually 30, not 27-28 lol. Look at Henry this year coming off of a major injury at 29 years old. He didn't miss a beat.

> Dumping something like 50M-4 or 60M-5 is ridiculous, especially if you’re talking a guy than produced only 3/5 seasons he played and already has an ACL year in those years he struggled to come back from initially. 

50/4 is nothing lol. Again, what would you do with $12.5M/year that would make more of an impact on our team than Saquon did this season?

This isn't a rebuild, this is us building a team with the best pieces that we can find at reasonable cost. If we can't bring back SB, as OP posited, then IMO the next best thing is to take that money and use it elsewhere, rather than spending 12MM max on another RB, which most of these top tier RBs would get (none of whom are Saquon). 

Put another way, if the most I'm willing to pay SB is 12-13MM, then another back in the FA crop isn't likely to get that amount from me as well. I'd rather spend less at RB and more at WR, for example. 

It's not just FA either. There are several teams that are over the cap and have to make tough decisions. Decisions such as parting ways with their pricey WR for little in return via trade, or for nothing if cut outright. Here's an example (I'm not saying we should or will do this):

Chargers are way over the cap. Mike Williams, has a cap hit of $19MM this year for them. IF they are willing to trade him to unload his cap hit, then perhaps we can get him and restructure his deal to something more reasonable, assuming he's healthy. Teams looking to clear cap space are usually willing to part with players for less than what they'd usually be worth from a draft comp perspective (so, let's say a 4th).",1.0,nygiants,t3_10l7320,False,0.0,:Giants-logo-vintage:,2023-01-25T15:06:34Z,nygiants,0.0440940186381118

From a pure production standpoint, that means finding a WR that can be a true #1, which likely can only be found via trade, unless some WR gets cut. There are a few cap strapped teams that will have to make tough decisions.

I haven't looked yet, but odds are there is some cap strapped team that has stud WR that will be willing to trade. Hopkins' name has already been mentioned as someone who is available. Tee Higgins might be as well if CIN doesn't think they can afford to keep him.

They are enamored of Gates, but the Giants preferred Feliciano at center and* ***Bredeson played more snaps when rotating with Gates at left guard.*** *Plus. truthfully, the offense seemed to play better when Bredeson was on the field.*

***Mark Glowinski isn’t a great right guard,*** *but he is at least adequate and would carry an $8.65M cap hit as a pre-June 1 cut. He is unlikely to be let go.*

*Do the Giants see third-round pick* ***Josh Ezeudu*** *or fifth-round pick Marcus McKethan, who both landed on IR, as part of the solution? After two years lost to injury, what to make of Shane Lemieux?*

*Will they draft a center or an interior offensive lineman with a premium pick? Will they look for established help on the free agent market?*

*The Giants had a mish-mash at these spots in 2022, both because of injury and performance. How will they stabilize, and improve, that part of their line in 2023?*

What Daniel Jones did with absolutely the WORSE receiving corps this year, plus injuries to that already decimated roster, tells you what his ceiling is with Great Value rosters. There is absolutely NO INDICATION that Daniel Jones would get worse than what he was this year if given more tools, in fact, THE OPPOSITE is true.

Not upset with Hodgins/Wandale/(Slayton OR FA signing)/Rookie WR being the main group. Obvious they bring Hodgins back, but Slayton depending on price vs FA WRs. Parris Cambell is a guy im looking at that can take Slayton's role for cheaper. He's a speedy guy with a injury history but had a breakout year last year fully healthy. I think he can be a cheaper option using injuries as leverage if they believe Slayton is asking for too much. 

Others guys like Chark, Jakobi, JuJu are WRs Giants can afford and would probably be better but, too expensive for their potential production imo.

The first point I mean, he's a free agent right now. I'd don't see any problem with him making a spectacle out of it. I don't take it personally and other fans shouldn't too. 

The interview with Lil Wayne is just him calling out the NYG organization. I don't think he threw Eli under the bus. This is when they drafted Saquon and he questioned why they drafted him if Eli needs help. He stated that Eli wasn't a guy to get out of the pocket and it was a time issue they can't even throw the ball enough and all he's getting is short routes/slants. 

The whole interview he was calling out the energy of the NYG org and questioning the direction they want to head in and asking them if they even wanted to win. Valid points imo, again, org was ran like shit. He never was a locker room issue as far as we know. 

The rest is just him being a diva playing it up for the media and the media eating it up. If that's the worst he is, a douche and a diva at times, Daboll could easily work with that. That is not much different than other big name NFL players, the difference is OBJ has a bigger social media following. 

If he can still play and the money's right I don't see why some fans are clamoring to not sign him.

The issues with OBJ are so over blown imo. He has a big ego but, people are comparing him to AB and it's not fair at all. OBJ's not online showing his dick in public, talking about Brady's wife, that whole bucs on field thing, kanye thing, etc. 

The worst thing he's done is be a jerk on a plane. Feel like he gets more backlash than some nfl players who have committed acutal crimes because of his social media celebrity status. 

His time as a Giant he was extremely vocal and critical on how bad the Giants org was run and he was right, Giants were so poorly ran. He wanted to call out all the NYG BS and that got him in trouble. 

I also don't recall him having any issues in the locker room with players. He even currently tweets supporting the Giants this season.
