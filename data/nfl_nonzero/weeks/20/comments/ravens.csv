What it does mean is that they’re not going to reach for the 30th guy on their board there just because they need a receiver.  They don’t do stuff like that and they still won’t this year.

We have found ourselves scraping the bottom of the barrel for WRs midseason multiple times over the past couple of years because the talent on the roster was so awful.",1.0,ravens,t3_10htaab,False,0.0, :SHADES:,2023-01-22T12:42:56Z,ravens,-0.03135387636104

31381,177804,177804,ZombieFeedback,"Fresh perspective. When you elevate an internal hire there's a very hard-to-fight tendency to keep the old way of doing things. They know it, the players know it, inertia is one of the hardest forces to fight. An external perspective forces you out of your comfort zone and makes you try new things. Given how many passing game coordinators our run first team is interviewing, it seems pretty clear that trying new things is a big part of the move's goals.

I don't remember who said it, but there's a quote I really like. ""Good coaches come up with good schemes and get players to fit. Great coaches fit their scheme to the players who they have.""

Greg's run scheme was legitimately impressive. As bonehead as his passing game was, the different combinations of pulling linemen, the use of motion, there was some genuinely great stuff in there. But it never changed, never adapted. If someone had an answer to Greg's scheme, or the talent to run it wasn't there due to injuries, he had no other answer. He just kept hammering the system and hoping for it to work.

42464,251853,251853,reddituseerr12,"Agreed - Ravens have the luxury of taking these guys because they’re pretty smart at building their roster at most every position (outside of WR). I wasn’t super high on the Linderbaum pick (love the player but I’m not high on centers in the first) but still a good pick given that’s your center for the next 10 years. 

A WR at 25 would’ve been nice but when drafting mid-late 20s you usually are looking at the high ceiling low floor guys vs. a safe bet in Linderbaum. Christian Watson would’ve been a huge risk, but on the other hand, he looked like the best WR down the stretch in a loaded WR class. Those are the kind of picks Ravens will probably have to make in the future if they’re serious about building the WR room and if they don’t want to spend cap/trade assets on them. Luckily, Ravens are really good at manipulating the board and will probably be able to get the right value. 

This year those high risk/high reward WRs are guys like Zay Flowers, Rashee Rice, & Jaylin Hyatt. I can see them moving back, taking one of those guys, and picking up a couple picks.",4.0,ravens,t3_10l6y15,False,0.0, :OLD1:,2023-01-25T15:03:36Z,ravens,0.0129848600506782
