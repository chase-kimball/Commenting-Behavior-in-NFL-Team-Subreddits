Especially during rush/peak hours.     

LA is a clusterfuck. People out there are fucking insane.

A  playoff game in a hostile stadium with a good defense can make Brock‚Äôs life miserable. Great coaching can't make up for experience.


**Pet theory**

Admittedly, this is a stretch on my part so take it with a mountain of salt. It might just be a coincidence 

But a strange pattern I noticed about Brock is in away games Brock is slightly less accurate than his  average.

 And in those two away games, the 49ers win but by their smallest margins  of Brocks 6 games as a starter

Here is my take : even if we were equally skilled in every position the QB vs QB comparaison is the huge tie breaker.

Sorry for Purdy but he is still a green QB that has literally only played 2 away games in the west coast. Both tight games against two poor Seahawks and Raiders teams.

Just show Ndamukong Suh the fine print in his contract. The one about a SB bonus and ask him to show Purdy around Sackville.

We made the playoffs last year by virtue of our schedule and a weak division.

With a harder schedule maybe we only get 7 or 8 wins. In the playoffs, Brady and the Bucs demolished us. 

Jumping from THAT to the #1 team in all of football is a hell of a story. We were 13-1 before losing Hurts for a couple games to injury but still got 14 wins, most in franchise history and tied for the league lead. We had a tougher schedule, thumping you twice in the regular season, beating the Cowboys, Vikings, and Jags as well as a few other good if not playoff teams (Lions, Packers, Redskins, Steelers). Hurts went from a question mark to an MVP candidate. The D went from a weakness to a strength. Hurts, Sanders, Brown, and Smith broke all sorts of team records even when accounting for the extra game. The OL continued to dominate despite getting another year older.

Yes we were not an overnight success in that we did not go from terrible to the playoffs, like the Jags. But we did go from bad to very good in the course of just two years.

You can explain some of our success based on roster construction, but that defense could also be made for the 49ers. And the 49ers were also a playoff team last year; one that went to the NFCCG and barely lost to the ultimate champions.

Shanahan deserves a lot of credit for surviving injury losses at the QB position but, again, the team is stacked elsewhere and Purdy was a good college QB and was clearly underrated in the draft.

Under those two Wentz greatly regressed and the offense became extremely stale. Pederson wanted to keep Groh following the 2019 season and Lurie forced him to fire him, which in my opinion was warranted. Pederson the following year didn't want to bring anyone in, so Howie/Lurie hired a bunch of guys who were in there are senior advisors which seemed to clash with Pederson and not work. Then instead of bringing an outside guy Pederson wanted he wanted to go with Press who which is just more internal guys and no outside voice again which is a problem. There were also a lot of reports that Press was buddy buddy with Wentz and wouldn't really call him out and be hard on him when he would fuck up which may have also been part of the issue of not wanting to promote him.

His other experience was ""Calvary Baptist Academy"" a HS in Louisiana.

So yes, you could say at least he had previous NFL coaching experience and he had been part of a very successful staff and was part of a great coaching tree.

But I am saying it's possible for a long time NFL player who knows the game, to also be a great leader and manage to be a highly successful HC.

Guys who stomp around and walk out after losses aren't making the team better. If you're looking for that extra 5% to get over the hump it comes when the team feeds off each other. When one player or one unit makes an impact when the other is struggling.

Diggs is a great player, but I think he could be a better leader and example. You can let your emotions flow while still keeping composure. Dawkins was a master example of that.

Right now the Bills need to have a focused kind of anger that passes through their whole team. Their window is wide open. 

They don't need the unfocused frustration that makes people feel like it's a lost cause and they need to blow up the dynamic. They certainly don't need someone feeling like they are better than the rest of the team. End of the day, that energy is selfish and it can absolutely destroy a winning locker room.

My own thought on it is additional NFC championship wins with more superbowl losses only makes things worse.  One ring out of the 5 probably isn't enough to keep in after 2012 (things were really BAD).

They're here deservedly. 

I don't think Purdy's going to be intimidated by either the crowd or the bigness of the occasion, but I also have a lot of faith in our defense, especially if it turns into a passing shootout. The Niners defense lives on passing over the middle to Kittle and Deebo and Aiyuk, which is one area our D isn't especially strong in. It'll be a good challenge. 

Defensively, they have three All-Pros in Bosa, Warner, and Hufanga, but there really isn't a weak link anywhere on their D, and we saw yesterday they know how to hit. What's interesting is Prescott had only 4 rushes for 22 yards, so they have the capability for keeping a running QB in check. The key is turnovers: they're 2nd best in creating turnovers, 3rd best at not giving them up on offense (Eagles are 5th and 4th, respectively).",1.0,eagles,t3_10j1r0z,False,0.0,:eagles: Eagles,2023-01-23T06:26:22Z,eagles,0.1028108013740078
