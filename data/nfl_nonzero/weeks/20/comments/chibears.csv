Kyle Shanahan licks his fingers and puts out the tapered candle that lights his laboratory.  The storm is beginning to pass and the sun has started to rise;  its shine begins to filter through the shutters that line his basement windows.  He no longer needs the candle to light the way of his scalpel as it disects Trey Lance and Jimmy Garropolo's remaining viable organs.  ""Finally,"" Shanahan thinks as he continues to sew their parts onto his new QB's previously irrelevant limbs.  

The sky screams out at Kyle's inhumane acts with one last bolt of lightning!  Mother Earth is angry, but the work is done.

""It's alive,"" mutters Kyle.  ""I have done it...  IT'S ALIVE!""

My friend is a huge Browns fan and is from Ohio. Hes also an OSU fan and loooooovvvves Fields from his college days (and still does).

So when we found out the draft was in Cleveland, a bunch of the guys made it a boys trip there and we went to the draft.

So, here I am, out in the freezing cold, watching each pick go. All the QBs, other than Fields, go. Then, QB needy teams (think CAR, DEN etc) pass on Fields to get other positions. 

One of our friends that is there is a huge Giants fan. So, we are all anticipating what the Giants are going to do. Had no idea a trade might happen, let alone the bears. 

Then, all of a sudden, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

Kidding!

Then, its announced. The giants have made a trade. We basically all knew it was the bears moving up. Me and CLE guy are like hugging and jumping all crazy. Then, the trade is announced and the bears are involved. Then.... ""bears select, Justin Fields.""

Holy shit, we all went fucking bonkers! One of the other guys that was there is the kind of guy who shits on OSU and Bama qbs for their poor history and even he is excited and just we are all in disbelief.

I dont think another draft pick will ever live up to that.

EDIT: Shit, I forgot my least favorite. I think im going to have to go with Mitch. And I love the guy, knowing the kind of person he is. But, I was out with some friends for dinner. I kept refreshing my phone to see who we would pick. See that we made a fairly big trade to move up. Then, bears gets Biscuit. I wasnt disappointed, just, was, MEH.  I wanted Watson tbh. He was the obvious choice with the big game performances, but wanted to give him a chance. 

I still do think, with a small part of me that, if he was put in a position to use his strengths, instead of Nagy forcing shit on him, hed be atleast an avg starter. We saw what he could do, when Lazor took over the play calling. It was much more focused on what he was good at. Problem was that he was always getting his shoulder hurt on the RPOs and called QB plays.

There’s an element of human randomness that’s present in all sports to varying degrees, but in football it’s most prominent imo. One reason being the massive 14 point swing a single touchdown can have. Another being only 17 games in a season. Within the game itself, there are only around 120 snaps. There are 22 moving parts on the field at a time. There’s only about 12 actual minutes of play time. Each individual play is only used a couple times at most in a game. 

Like you can go on and on and on, there’s so little room to actually try and see true deliciously meaningful patterns. Its part of why this league has the parity it has. It makes sense that TDs are fluky in general given how few are scored by a player in a season. I do think this stat generally has a good bearing on how the QBs did this year, though.

However, one thing I will say that a good few, more than most QBs, of Fields’ fumbles occurred as a dumb error behind the line and were immediately recovered - which speaks to why the recovery rate was so high. Other QBs also probably experience this, but I wanted to give some context to the 14/16 stat.

That being said, I just don’t think you can ever have enough edge rush and if you made me pick today the pick would be Anderson. I think he fits the personality and culture the team is trying it build, and there are more options at DT in free agency. Payne is obviously the jewel of the bunch, but guys like Fletcher Cox, Javon Hargrave, or David Onyemata are all in the 29-31 age range and could be great fill-ins for a few years. Or a guy like Greg Gaines from the Rams who is younger, cheaper, solid against the run and has enough pass rush chops to chip in (10 sacks over the past two seasons). 

Really until free agency happens it’s hard to know, but that’s at least where I sit today.

edit: one more thing to add to above, I think a lot of mock drafts don’t do trades but still expect the Bears to trade down with the Colts as the most likely scenario.
