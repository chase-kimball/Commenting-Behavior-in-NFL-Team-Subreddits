I don't think he'll go for 2. But you have to start asking from there and work down if you're Gute.

I remember when the first inklings of trade demands emerged from Houston for Deshaun, even after his misconduct cases, was that they wanted 3 firsts and 3 seconds.

He ultimately went for much closer to the 3 firsts.

12729,80366,80366,Goodbye_Hercules,"I'm not saying he'll be a future HoFer, let alone our next franchise QB, but I swear there's been a lot of goalpost-moving (maybe even gaslighting?) by so many of the Jordan Love haters. 

Most fans in general (rightfully) criticized Gute for wasting the 1st-rounder in 2020, and gave Love flak in 2021 for his inconsistency (while lauding him here and there). But the haters are so reluctant to give him even an ounce of praise. 

Every improvement Love has shown in 2022, and every good play he's made, is immediately dismissed. We criticized him for making dumb decisions and holding it for too long in '21; suddenly it's ""garbage time,"" ""prevent defense,"" ""it's just checkdowns"" now that Love appears to be going through his reads & getting the ball out a lot more quickly. A few also still seem to be doubting his arm talent/mechanics, as if that Cover 2 hole shot to Jones isn't proof otherwise, but I digress. 

I don't know if it's them letting Gute's draft decision cloud their judgement, or what, but again: you can highlight Gute's draft failure while also recognizing Love's talent and improvement from Years 1-3 at the same time. A bad draft pick doesn't necessarily mean a bad player, which is what we're seeing with Love right now; maybe it's time for some of y'all to admit you were kind of wrong.",9.0,greenbaypackers,t3_10ka1rq,False,0.0,:17:,2023-01-24T16:14:55Z,greenbaypackers,-0.0642304663943573

Let's just go at the emotional perspective which is all Scott is talking about... this is the guy who has demanded contract extensions twice in the last 3 yrs. This is the guy that hasn't shown up until mandatory camp to help our rookie receivers. This is the guy who repeatedly says he's not interested in being here through a rebuild and has publicly let it be known he'd like to play for a team closer to Cali. He teases us with retirement and fights with the GM publicly.

I don't blame him for ANY of that. Really, that's his decision and he's earned the right. To turn around and then say that we owe him something because of the feels is completely missing the point. This is a business relationship. When it's time to move on, good businesses move on. We cut Jordy, let Randall walk, Clay finished in another city, Woodson left, Davante got traded... why is Aaron different? 

Again, I love this dude, he's given us so many good memories and I don't have any issues with the way he conducts himself but he is trying to get paid and even he understands that if it's better for the team, they'll trade him. 

Why do we always want to act like this is emotional when it's pure business? Trade him. Start the J Love era with extra picks and cap space so we aren't completely strapped.

Edit: the role model thing is subjective, I guess.
Rodgers is squeaky clean when it comes to criminal records, he has proven to be thoughtful and respectful to others’ plight during the anthem protesting, compassionate towards his hometown donating all of that money after the fires, convicted in beliefs and willing to say something is wrong like speaking out against how the NFL treated Johnny Jolly, and at least to his inner circle, a good friend.

Anything the Packers get back for Rodgers is a bonus (although I'm sure they'd like as much as they can get, obviously).

Keeping him for next year just makes the dead cap hit for the following years even worse, at the same time that the likelihood of him retiring keeps increasing after each year (and we're gonna take that cap hit whether or not he's still playing).

If he still wants to play, trading him this year is absolutely the best option for 3 different parties. 

* Rodgers gets to keep playing  and go to a team with a stronger roster & with more flexibility to add players for a run or two. 
* The team that trades for him gets a player who still has elite potential, who even in the worst year of his career was better than around half the league, and who is almost certainly an upgrade over their existing options. Because the Packers are stuck with a chunk of his contract, they get him for a year or two on a deal that's pretty easy to manage compared to the potential he brings.
* The Packers get out from under Rodgers' contract which otherwise will continue to hurt our roster even more over the next few years, whether or not he's even still playing. They get to give Love a legitimate chance and find out whether he can lead the team moving forward or if they need to look elsewhere.

In that scenario, Rodgers can pretty much pick his destination from among whatever interested teams there are, and the Packers will have to accept whatever they can get for him.

Best case for the Packers is if he's not picky about where he ends up in which case there might be some bidding for him, but if Rodgers has a specific destination in mind then he'll have the leverage to make that happen.

I'd be happy to get a single 1st for him, maybe even sending back a later pick. The value to the Packers will be taking a big (but MUCH smaller than if he played for us in 2023 or was cut) cap hit this year and then being out from under his contract completely & able to either build around Love or look at other options in 2024.
