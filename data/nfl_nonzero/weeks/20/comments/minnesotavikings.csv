If it rains outside you might not go to the store, especially at night. You figure you'll just wait it out. You might have somewhere to go and you tell yourself I don't want to go there.

Saint fans like to focus on the bounty penalties part of the story and wether or not the penalties were fair. They don’t like to talk about that their scumbag HC and scumbag DC told their players to injury the opposing QB and they did it AFTER THE PLAY. And they didn’t get any calls for it (video link below).



Then the want to whine about the Rams call, AND NO ONE IN THE MEDIA ever points out the THREE(!!!!) calls that gifted them the game in OT back in 2009. The worst being the Pierre Thomas 4th down run that was a fucking turn over on downs!

The last play of the season exposed 3 critical weaknesses we have on offense.

* When JJ goes deep, he gets triple teamed because we don't have anyone threatening on the other side of the field. 
* Our QB has no pass protection. 
* Our QB, when stressed, forgets where the defense is and can't read open players. 

So even if we solved the first problem, it wouldn't make much of a difference until we solved the second problem. Those two problems alone probably account for half our draft picks.

Obviously theres a huge possibility for him to improve and develop on the offseason and preseason now. But until that happens he shouldnt be looked at as a starting option. Hes never played at starter quality and rg free agents will be available.      
      
We have one 1st and no 2nd. So if we want to draft a center prospect early than it has to be our biggest move in the draft. I think thats a tough pill to swallow this year and bad process for center in general. Kirk prefers centers helping a alot with protections and a veteran makes a big difference there. Rookie lineman take more time to develop than a lot of positions and its common for them to start being good right as contracts expire. Centers are also the lowest paid lineman. The upside of signing a free agent center who should still be a snaller cap hit among the team but already know whay hes doing and have nfl size and traits to scheme around seem like an easy pick over the risk reward of drafting a center if bradbury leaves. I wouldnt mind drafting a backup developmental center since they can be found later in the draft though at 3rd rd+. Having someone to learn behind helps lineman a lot too.      
      
Super happy with darrisaw cleveland and o'neill and I would love to see how they play with more proven players between them. I think our tackle depth is in a pretty good spot right now too.

If Ed Donatell makes a play call that results in a guy wide open for a 15 yard gain, how can a player be blamed for that or graded poorly?
