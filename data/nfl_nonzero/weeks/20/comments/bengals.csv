The Bengals were playing for three things in that game: 

1) A potential chance at the #1 seed, however this was entirely dependent on the Chiefs losing in week 18, which was obviously unlikely. Nobody is really angry about losing out on it. 

2) Control the #2 seed going into week 18, meaning that the game yesterday would have been in Cincinnati. While moot now because the Bills played so bad (and the Bengals played so well) the cold and snow should have been a major homefield advantage for the Bills. 

3) To win the division outright. 

The Bengals lost out on all those with the scenario put in place by the NFL, while simultaneously coddling to both the Bills and Ravens. Bills get the #2 seed and a potential neutral site championship game, and the Ravens had the potential of hosting a playoff game on a coin flip, even though the Bengals won the division on a no contest.

Wilson was a 1 year wonder on a decent BYU team that played a horrendously soft schedule that one year.

The thing about Vegas odds is that they have nothing to do with who they think is going to win the game.

If the opening line is Bengals by 11.5, everyone will hammer the under because the Bengals will probably not beat the Chiefs by 2 TDs. Once so many people bet the under that it becomes unbalanced, they’ll move the line down to say 4.5. Now people might think the Bengals will win by a touchdown so they’ll start betting the over. And once too many people bet the over, they’ll Jack it back up to like 8.5. The goal is to have 50% of betters on the over and 50% on the under. But none of this has anything to do with who they actually think will win. They’re just as clueless as us in that department.

19843,139806,139806,PeeeCoffee,"Before the season:  
""Bengals will have Super Bowl hangover. They will regress this year."" - Vegas had Denver and even Cleveland at better odds than us to win SB at the start of the season. Most national analysts viewed our SB run as a fluke and didn't even expect us to make it back to the playoffs.  


Start of the season:

""0-2 teams rarely make it back to the playoffs""  


Middle of the season:  
""This team is lucky, they play only one good half of games and eek out wins. No way they can replicate that in January""  


End of the season:  
Whole MNF debacle - crowned AFCN champs before week 18 (having to play first-place schedule next year and a lower draft pick), but not guaranteed the benefit of home-field advantage in the WC round. So have to play starters in the final week to ensure that and lose our best OL in the process. NFL sets up contingencies for BUF vs KC AFCC because Buffalo could have won the MNF and retained 1 seed. But nothing was put in place in case the Bengals won the MNF game where we would have been the 2 seed and could have hosted the Divisional round.  


Playoffs:  
Lose another OL. Vegas has us as 6-point underdogs on the road. ""No way can Burrow do anything when he has no time to throw."" ""Buffalo has the 6th ranked defense and will smother the Bengals offense."" There is even a graphic where all the analysts at the desk took Buffalo to win and only Boomer (former Bengal) took us.   


Say what you will, but we've been doubted pretty much all season. The MNF debacle is what really sent the team and the fanbase into an us vs the world mentality. An unprecedented in-season NFL rule change was made within a week where most of the league voted to adopt rules that benefited KC greatly, BUF pretty well, and even BAL some, and we got zero benefits.",22.0,nfl,t3_10jmkuu,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2023-01-24T09:17:33Z,bengals,0.0498452345662482

Burrow had one injury, that isn't a pattern, and we're not talking about percentage of games played, it's an issue of risk with the future. It's why the Ravens are hesitant to pay guaranteed money.

21768,154822,154822,Razzberry42069,"We all pay attention bro, there's a reason it's almost exclusively Eagles fans that think Jalen Hurts is some kind of top 3 QB. He just isn't. No one says he's trash, but we are saying that he isn't on the upper levels of QB. He's above average at best. The next 1-2 games will be the real test for him. He hadn't seen real pressure, the only legitimately good team the Eagles played this season was the Cowboys, and Jalen did not play when Dak was playing. He hasn't had to play from behind, he hasn't faced an equal team that's pushing him in win or lose it all scenario. If he comes out and plays like a stud against the 49ers and in the Superbowl, it'll go a long way to convincing us that he's a guy. Not because you have to win a Superbowl to be good, but you have to show that you can be the guy that doesn't crumble. Hell of a time for that test, the stakes couldn't be bigger, but that's the way it worked out. If he goes to the Superbowl and hell, he doesn't have to win, but if he plays well, he's that guy and he'll be up there. Hell, he doesn't even need to beat the 49ers, if he shows up, he's that guy.

We just need these guys to prove it. I mean, look at Cam Newton, everyone was convinced he was that guy and that the Panthers were absolutely unstoppable. They cruised their way to the playoffs and then got absolutely obliterated. Cam was a mess that game with everything on the line. No one looks back at that season and thinks that he was a monster, we remember who he turned out to be.

There should have also been a coin flip scenario with KC in the instance that KC lost and Cincinnati won because it was the exact same scenario as Baltimore. 

That's the key thing people keep ignoring to pretend the Bengals don't have a reason to be mad. The Bengals were AFC North champs with a win or a tie that game, they clinched with both of those. Instead, Cincinnati had to beat Baltimore or they'd face a coin flip for home field advantage because Baltimore would have the tie breaker, but no chance to get a tie because the Bengals played less games. Meanwhile, the Bengals had a tie breaker with the Chiefs and would be the AFC Champions by winning in Buffalo and KC losing to the Raiders, but the tie was no longer possible because the Bengals played less games. This shows that the league wanted to make sure the Bills and the Ravens got considerations and the Bengals were punished. There was no special consideration for this team, no chance at a home game in the AFC Championship or the Divisional round. 

On top of all of this, the NFL started heavily hyping and marketing the neutral site AFC game.

21792,154849,154849,Razzberry42069,"I can't tell if this is just an attempt to be facetious or not, but I'll take the high road and explain it for the billionth time: 

The Bengals were about to go up 14-3 and that game was playing out identically to the final product. Tragedy strikes, teams agree to postpone. The NFL then declared that an AFC Championship game between the Bills and Chiefs should be played at a neutral site because neither team got what they needed to win the 1 seed. Bills needed to win out, Chiefs needed to win out and have the Bills lose a game, Bengals had to win out and have the Chiefs win the game. 

The result of the first matchup was going to decide whether or not Cincy or Buffalo would rank higher. The NFL only gave consideration to the Chiefs and Bills. Considering that game would've decided who got home field advantage in the playoffs, and they made considerations for the Chiefs/Bills, the right thing to do would be to do the same for Bills vs Bengals. If anything, it made more sense for Bills vs Bengals to be on a neutral site than the Chiefs. The NFL essentially decided it wouldn't be worth the effort and cost to have two neutral site games. 

The Bengals went from having a shot at the 1 seed to being locked into the 3 seed. The real kicker here is that the NFL also threw in an extra stipulation that since a Cincinnati loss would've given the Ravens a shot to win the division by beating the Bengals week 18, the Bengals would have to flip a coin in the case of a Ravens win. At first glance, this doesn't seem that crazy. However, the difference between the Bengals and Ravens was identical to the difference between the Chiefs and Bengals. The Bengals needed to win and the Chiefs to lose a game. Ravens needed the Bengals to lose twice and win the final game. There was no coin flip on the table for the Bengals vs Chiefs.

So we already see how bizarrely one-sided it is. Essentially, the NFL gave the Bills a tie by the way they settled things. However, if the Bengals and Bills tied, the Bengals would've still clinched the division. Instead, the Bengals were handed a loss, because they had to win that last game or possibly be handed an even worse fate than losing the AFC North: the NFL declared them winners, but they could've been the champs and have to play on the road. That would be the same as becoming the wildcard team, yet having a first place schedule and so on. 

Every aspect of the ruling was a jab at the Bengals. They've been ignored downplayed, and insulted all season as the reigning AFC Champs. They had the NFL try to screw them for choosing human life over rating. They have every right to be pissed. On top of all of this, when the Bengals should've been free to sit the starters week 18 after the Chiefs beat the Raiders, they had to play their starters while the Ravens got to sit their offense. Ravens did not sit their defense, and they were completely ignored by the refs as they blatantly headhunted Bengals players. They took Tyler Boyd out for a short time, injured Tee Higgins who was limited in both games. They ended the season of two offensive linemen. All of this in a game they shouldn't have had to play.

Two, he will be extremely limited with mobility. So much of the Mahomes magic is how he runs around crazy and makes wild throws. If the Bengals pass rush holds contain, he will be a statue. Even if they don't, he may not be able to escape very well.
