* Michigan v. Ohio is a HUGE opportunity for capitalizing on that rivalry, but Detroit only plays Cincinnati and Cleveland once every 4 years each.
* Dallas v. Houston would make a great annual 'Texas Bowl' between Texas' two largest hubs.

He starts games slow but when he's in a rhythm he's making solid quick reads. His instinct and ability to make plays outside of the pocket aren't his main issues his biggest issue is his accuracy. 

He started slow in those first four games but you could see him calm down and make improvements and  improvisations as those games progressed. He's made the expected rookie mistakes. He also has the huddle very well under control as a rookie. I expected a lot more technical penalities and false starts when he took over but he manages that well.

In the NFL he has 3 years as the Texans RB coach. Those 3 years Houston had a RB get over 1200 yards and gave Houston a rushing attack that would allow them to make the playoffs one year even. 

Eventually left to pursue becoming a QB coach. That didn't pan out until he had 3 more years as a RB coach with da Bears that had one fruitful season then came to Atlanta and got the QB coaching job he was looking for.

I'd say his past successful years as a RB coach would give him plenty of looks especially now with extra experience as a QB coach.

It‚Äôs a run first offense that AS brought over from Tennessee, the team that mimics the Ravens a lot in the AFC and actually knocked them out as a 1 seed. We have big threats that Lamar never had in Baltimore, with Pitts and London. We have a 1K bruising back in Allgeier and CP. We have a solid run blocking Oline. 

One of those articles said you have under 25 year olds at WR1, TE1, LG1, and HB1. That‚Äôs a wonderful young core. 

He would come to a weak division void of franchise QBs, in a conference much weaker at QB than the AFC (let‚Äôs say Rodgers goes to the Jets and Brady to Vegas. Even worse of a conference at QB). 

He would sell tickets to the Benz, jersey sales would be top 5 in the league (yes I‚Äôd def get one), and energize a city that‚Äôs Black Mecca in the US right now, and a fanbase that remembers Vick and what could have been. 

Lamar is a fit for many reasons. 
Lamar is also an expensive ass fit for many reasons. 

All it comes down to is what the owner wants, the GM and HC want in a QB, and what Lamar wants.
