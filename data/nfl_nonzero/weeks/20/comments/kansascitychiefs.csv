First, this is just a blatant lie. He had 7 games allowing under 30 yards and 9 allowing under 50. That being said, ""allowed yards"" isn't how you measure how well a CB does... His PFF grade is 52.4 in coverage. His worst season in the NFL. He allowed a 102.9 QB rating this season... he had four games where he allowed 140+ QB rating, two of them perfect 158.3's. He gave up 732 yards on 50 receptions on 84 targets (15 yards per reception) and 4 TDs... He also had 0 INTs

Our 7th round rookie also had a pretty meh year, but he's a 7th round rookie...

59.8 PFF grade, 91.9 QB rating given up, 489 yards on 45 catches/70 targets, 4 TDs and 2 INTs (1 a pick six to win a game)

Which isn't to say you are wrong, he might look really gimpy (albeit looks fine in practice shots) or he could end up aggravating his injury by playing and it become a persistent issue. But it so far doesn't seem to particularly severe.

So far the only injury he's had in five seasons that made him miss time was a freak dislocated kneecap where he missed two games. 

He also got a concussion two years ago, coincidentally also in the AFC divisional round, that took him out of a game early.

Mahomes has had a few injuries, most of them he's been able to play through. None of his previous injuries so far seemed to have had a noticeable long term impact on his ability/health.

I wouldn't say his health is a *non-concern* or his playing style keeps him particularly out of danger. But it also isn't a particular concern either. 

His play style is not dissimilar from Rodgers, and so far as a starter he's been able to avoid injury better than Rodgers and Rodgers is about to enter his age 40 season.

I get where you're coming from with them providing a forum for thoughtful talk about player performance, because that's clearly one of the major purposes of the sub. And I also get the difficulty of having to thread a needle between fairness and not letting the sub devolve into a pile of low-effort posts.

I personally would prefer them all gone, because as has been said there's no effort or quality to them. They feel so redundant and predictable, and I think the post-game threads are where that kind of conversation should go, but I know others would disagree.

I'm sure there's a compromise somewhere, like only allowing it after games, and only allowing one (and rotating rights to do so as previously mentioned), or allowing posts praising player performance but disallowing the low effort player profile images and ""literally just a"" title, in the same way that ""x fan here"" posts are not allowed.

All the people in the KC-JAX game thread who were losing their minds that Mahomes was playing on a sprained ankle just gave me the impression that they wanted us to lose for any reason.

This is why spags is the way he is. There's criticism all year of him making it too complicated, young players thinking too much causing wide-open coverage busts. First 3 months of the season there's constant calls for him to be less complicated, play to the strengths of all these rookies, let then play and not have to think too much. 

But come the end of the year, they have experience, they've played tons of different coverages and weird blitzes. 

Because a simpler scheme works well in September and October. But in January when you're up against the best of the best, a simple scheme will get picked apart all day. And you can't just suddenly come up with a brand new bespoke game plan for a specific opponent and expect your players to be able to execute without the experience. That's a good recipe for totally blown coverages. 

That's also how belichick and big Lou work. That's why they value smart veteran defenders, so you can make these very opponent specific schemes and reasonably expect the team to execute, even if they haven't run that defense all year.

 We're at a disadvantage with the youth, but it's also why they have had some struggles this year, because keeping the scheme simple wouldn't let these guys get the experience.

What the Bengals do have is a very good team comprised of very good players who are very well coached. The consistency you guys have especially on the playoff stretch is the scariest thing about you. Your team just doesn’t make mistakes. 

It kind of reminds me of playing a Payton Manning or Tom Brady led team where they might not beat you with flashy plays or “my guy is better than your guy” type plays. They will beat you with a methodical approach and will break out on a big play in busted coverage or making one guy miss. 

Your defense doesn’t scare me, but your defensive scheme seems to adapt so quickly that the offense can’t react in time and never get into a rhythm. 

I think as far as matchups go, Chiefs hold a slight edge in most categories which is why all of our games seem to come down to the wire, and when we lose it’s usually because of an unlucky turnover or a mental mistake at the very end (see OT turnover in last years AFCC and the Kelce strip fumble earlier this year).

They already locked the 2 seed if they won out before any of this happened. 

>- if you can understand the above I can go into the increased probability of winning superbowl as a result.

I like how you're acting like you're some big brain analytics guy by citing things that don't matter. 

A team that gets a bye plays one fewer game. Of course they have a better chance to win the super bowl, having to do less to get there. Teams that get byes are also better teams than everyone else in the conference. That's why they get a bye. 

>Pretty clear here. I doubt this will change your mind though lol. Seems like you are pretty set on believing the league hurt KC with this ruling for your own bias fan mentality.

I believe the league changed the rules which fucked the Bengals, the Ravens, and the Chiefs. The only team it remotely had a benefit for was the Bills. Teams having uneven games isn't even a new problem, and the rule change was unnecessary. 

Because you're an absolute clown and need things spelled out, here's what happened:

* the ravens lost a chance to win their division
* the Bengals lost a chance at the 1 seed, HFA, and the bye
* if the ravens won the cin-bal matchup, there was a nonsense coin flip involved for HFA with the Bengals, further fucking the Bengals by not allowing them to host a playoff game AT ALL that they were entitled to host one by rule (division winner, 1-3 seed) 
* the chiefs by rule should have gotten the bye and the HFA after the game was called. They got a bye they were already entitled to and lost HFA.
* the bills lost the 1 seed and the bye. They will not have to play a hostile field in the playoffs. They were not entitled to a bye by rule. 

Now, who got the biggest benefit? Who lost things they were entitled to BY RULE? Buffalo didn't lose a single thing they were actually entitled to after the game was called.",2.0,nfl,t3_10i4qpp,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2023-01-22T12:07:00Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0129748328254522
54120,375358,375358,smdaegan,">They didn't follow the rule book in the decision to cancel the game

What the fuck are you even talking about? Article 4 of the NFL Rulebook explicitly gives Goodell the ability to cancel the game.

At question was whether the game should be ruled a Tie, rescheduled, or canceled.

Them deciding on No Contest is also valid within the framework of the rule book.

In the event that teams play an uneven set of games (as has happened in the past during the lockouts), then they should use the Winning Percentage of teams to determine the playoff seeds.

Since KC won more games and played more games, they were the #1 seed by rule.

The rule change absolutely *fucked* Cincinatti.

Not only did they have a shot at the 2 seed (and the 1 seed if the Chiefs lost the game vs Raiders), but the rule change handed BUF HFA through the divisional round, and then a neutral site game if they made it to the AFCCG.

They took the possibility of the 2 seed from CIN, which also had a legitimate shot at the 1 seed.
