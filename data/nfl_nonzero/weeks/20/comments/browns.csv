**Key notes from the 2013 season:**

They failed to improve on their 5–11 record from 2012, finishing the year at 4–12 their sixth consecutive 11+ loss season. This was the first season under head coach Rob Chudzinski (who was later fired after the season) and new general manager Michael Lombardi (who was later fired in February 2014). This also marked the first full season under owner Jimmy Haslam.

* 2013: SEA (1st) vs DEN (22nd)

* 2014: NE (8th) vs SEA (1st)

Not a single year since 2012 has a team in the bottom half of the league in defense won a Super Bowl. In fact, in all but 2 instances, the team with the stronger overall defense overall won. And why? Because every goddamned team in the league is desperately chasing their Tom Brady unicorn and sacrificing every other aspect of competent team building to do so. Completely forgetting that while Brady himself played to a HOF level, he also nearly every year had a defense in the top half of the league, if not in the top 10. It's why going to get Deshaun only made sense if this team was set on the other side of the ball, and they clearly, bluntly, were not.

Coming out of 2022, our remaining teams are 1st (SF), 5th (CIN), 8th (PHI), and 16th (KC). Hell, in the last round alone, you also had the 2nd (BUF), 6th (DAL), and 12th (JAX). You could argue that, of those 7 teams, all but 1 (SF) have their long term QB in place, and that all drafted that QB in the last 6 years, but also, all 7 of those teams also drafted that QB, built around the strengths and weaknesses of that QB, and, most importantly, ensured the other side of the ball was ready to go.",1.0,browns,t3_10kixhq,False,0.0,:brownie-elf:,2023-01-25T09:13:22Z,browns,0.0608260221369925

Corey Coleman has actually played a down in the NFL, youre right.

Until a guy actually steps on an NFL field, there is a wide range of potential outcomes - and when hes on there, there still is a wide range of outcomes.
Ever took a moment to think why the draft is such a crap shoot and good GMs have a hit rate of around 50%?

Every single year there is guys that everybody is convinced are guaranteed hits and that there is no eay they are a bust - and then 2 years later they are catching balls from Johnny Football in the fan controlled league. Thats a story that is literally as old as the draft itself.

>Decent slot corner for the browns. Didn’t he grade out PFF at 70?

By that logic you would have to cut Ward

>You can find a quality slot corner like I said

Damn, i wonder why not more teams do it since its so easy. 

Thats like walking up to an NFL GM and saying ""have you ever thought about drafting good players?"". Yeah, duh lol

>Greg Newsome will be a good solider but he’s clearly frustrated playing in the slot

So ill take it you have some insider info that you have been hiding from the rest of us?

>That’s where he’s best.

Man if only the 2015 Broncos had you as their GM, they could have traded that scrub Chris Harris jr and might had actually won the SB... oh wait

>Newsome + 2nd is probably worth a late first rounder. Garrett Wilson went in the 10 top. We don’t have enough ammo for that my friend. 

Why stop at the top 10? Throw Njoku and Wills into the mix and gun for the 1 overall pick. 

>He’s worth that type of package and more

Not even close.

>His stock is slightly slower because of the injury. That allows a team like the Browns to get s great player at cheaper value. Duh.

Garrett Wilson went top 10 in a stacked WR class, JSN is lucky to go in the first in a weak WR class, just for reference. Oh and btw the first WR off the board this year had a torn ACL, just for the record.

>This same place was begging for Garrett Wilson for Baker

That is such a false equivalency lol.

People were for Wilson, when the cost was 1 1st round pick, not Newome + 2nd + whatever

>You’re getting a great receiver. 

JSN has played exactly 0, in words zero, downs in the NFL. He is literally as likely to end up like Corey Coleman as he is likely to be as good as Olave.

So in your masterplan you are giving up a young, cheap high quality CB who has already proven to be good and is under team control for at least another 3 years, for one lottery ticket on a guy who you hope might be as good while giving up additional assets in the process. 

Thats tanking your franchise 101 right there.

And since you professed your love for football strategy, we havent even touched on the fact that in todays NFL you need at least 3 good CBs, minimum, not only as depth but also because a substantial amount of time teams play in nickel or even dime.

Oh but i forgot, finding good corners ""cant be difficult"" since the Browns traded away a 30 year old vet with 1 year left back to the place where his family was for a 5th round pick.  Youre right, silly me. I wonder why none of the nfl GMs has picked up on that yet.

I the last 10 years the Steelers WR draft picks were: (correct me if i forgot someone, was just going off memory here)

Toney Clemons (2012), Justin Brown and Marcus Wheaton (2013), Martavis Bryant (2014), Sammie Coates (2015), DeMarcus Ayers (2016), JuJu (2017), James Washington (2018), Diontae (2019), Claypool (2020), Pickens and Austin (2022).

Out of those, Diontae is the only one i would comfortably call a draft hit. Pickens looks the part but has to prove he can do it again.

Claypool and Washington are meh, Bryant showed flashed but flamed out. The rest is essentially 6 guys named Fred. 

If we are being very generous, thats roughly a .50 success rate. I dont know if i would call that amazing luck, tbh.

Guys like Pickens, Callaway, Josh Gordon et al are not for everyone, and i get it. The draft already is a crap shoot as it is, so taking a gamble on guys like that adds even more uncertainty to the mix.

When i was young a talent scout brought me into one of my country's pro teams. There we had a very talented squad of U16s, probably the best in the nation.

Our coach, however, was one of the old school type who would constantly yell, lash out and throw fits when something went wrong.

Now, when you first encounter that as an impressionable youth (inwas 14 at the time) it scares you - when you play scared, youre more prone to making mistakes. Furthermore, after a while you just grow numb to the yelling because you expect it, and youve heard it all before. The point is, many people underestimate the negative demotivating aspect such a behavior can have on some players.

Save to say, we finished 4th and were behijd the expectations. The coach ""retired"" (aka was sacked) and in came a new, younger one. He was the complete opposite, he was calm and methodical in his approach. A lot more focused on tactics rather than yelling, and when we made mistakes he would explain in the team meetings what exactly went wrong, what he expects us to do differently in this situation etc. He gave us constructive criticism and essentially a toolkit to deal with whatever we encountered in the pitch.
We finished 1st the very next year. (Shoutout coach P.)

BOB was a confrontational, egomaniacal dick who ran two GMs out of town. He wanted that power and, with it, he anointed Jack Easterby as his right hand man. 

As a coach, his crowning achievement is a divisional game where he turned a 24-0 first half lead into a twenty point blowout. The man constantly estranged players (usually the best ones) while rewarding subpar guys who were loyal to him. By the end, he had become such a colossal prick that JJ Watt cussed him out on the practice field. 

The only thing I'll say in his favor is that the QB situation in Houston sucked for most of his time there, though I wonder how much of that was because he wanted certain guys (with Hoyer being the obvious example). Regardless, for a guy billed as a QB whisperer and offensive genius, his offenses never came close to the hype.

Kittle and Njoku are the same.

The Bengals have got all those things. Landed ass backwards into having an elite QB and elite WR both on rookie contracts, so everything else on the salary cap side is EASY MODE because their most expensive pieces are cost controlled, but they should be credited for how they've spent that cap wisely and in such a way that their roster doesn't have any shit players. 

Everyone they have is functional/playable or above and their assistant coach group are all really good. I dont rate Zach Taylor much as a schemer or on anything other than his leadership, honestly, but with our Callahan's son as their OC and Lou Anaroumo as DC they've completely mitigated any weaknesses they have around Burrow.

36821,256008,256008,tohearnnr,"I feel like if you are wanting a WR2, thats going to have to be in the draft or your rolling with DPJ. Unless getting closer to the start of the new NFL year, when players get cut instead of receiving bonuses there becomes a guy, there is just not many WR candidates that excite me for top line guys. Juju, Jakobi Meyers, and Allen Lazard are the top 3 in catches. 
Honestly if we do WR in free agents, I'd like maybe a Greg Dortch who looked good in the Slot for Arizona when he got time to play and has played with a mobile QB. A Parris Campbell who has injury concerns that hopefully we could straighten out. Or a super cheap option would be Zach Pascal who can be really good as a run blocker and is good on shallow crossing routes. These guys aren't Number 2 options but could provide the team a solid option",1.0,browns,t3_10kerje,False,0.0,:dawg:,2023-01-24T15:00:24Z,browns,0.0467017373713333
