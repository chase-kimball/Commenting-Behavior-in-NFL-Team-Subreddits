They ran the crew for Saints-Rams and had the missed PI. 

I‚Äôm sure there were more, but it‚Äôs hard to breakdown the ref information. Teams would know more & I‚Äôm reminded of Joey Bosa‚Äôs reaction to Vinovich following the SB. BV‚Äôs crew called the least amount of penalties this year but over 1/3 of them came on first down.

We have both already established that Lamar clearly doesnt have many weapons either.

The year is 2023, we have ascended from the ability to play QB solely from arm talent, it is far more complex than that now with RPOs, read options, and sheer improvising talent.

24524,170801,170801,ThanosIsDoomfist,"Well, its a pretty grey area. I think the only side of the ball we looked beatable on was offense. That can potentially be chalked up to a few things, such as the Cowboys having good players defensively coupled with Dan Quinn being Kyles boss a while ago. So hes probably familiar with a lot of the things Kyle does because he overlooked Kyles offense once upon a time, Kyle has never had a matchup like that before til then. 

Yes, the throw to Diggs shouldve been a pick, and him dropping it is the only reason Purdy didnt have any turnovers. But that is the one time I recall that almost happening, and im willing to give him one ugly play vs a defense as good as the Cowboys.

WRs, TE, and RBs are all top tier but also position-less to stress defenses out and create poor match ups. Young but calculated rookie 3rd string QB playing point guard for the offensive ideology.

If you're DC Dan Quinn, you watching that 2022 Denver Game/Falcons game? Probably both, but how about that Titans game from Christmas eve last (day before the day before)? Cut ups of Purdy from college, who is chewing those up this week? Quinn's background is D line coach, he's a well rounded D coach (seems to subscribe to position-less models for Defense) but his roots lay there, in the trenches. cliched, but this game will be won in the trenches. If our line plays a little better than last year's game, I like us turning three drives into 21 points, not settling for nine.

""What are your thoughts about the game last year""

We won, but any advantage the Cowboys gained was as a result of self inflicted mistakes by our 49ers.

 * ""false-start penalty that would have iced it on a QB sneak and gave the Cowboys their last shot""

I remember that, but the game was only close because of earlier, self inflicted mistakes. If I remember the facts from that 1st half, we left 12 points on the board. And we only scored once in the second half. fuck this shit, we're going to win this playoff game with offense and while each NFL team is different each year, these cores are pretty much the same on both sides of ball, both teams. We have more weapons than last year and more experience than last year, and a will to win that is emergent (where last year, we made plays, but it was hard to measure). We still have to react to what they call, but we are better team and we are playing very good football.

41166,291260,291260,r1kng,"My 3 Keys to Victory


1.  Win the Time of Possession

In the Eagles loss to the Commanders, they were at one point in the game quadrupled in TOP, ultimately losing 40:19. If the Niners can control the clock, hit some key 3rd downs and most importantly keep Hurts and company off the field it‚Äôll be the Niners best chance.


2.  Win the Turnover battle 

The 49ers led the regular season in INTS and Turnover differential at +13. If the Niners can force some early turnovers and capitalize on points (TDs not FGs) it‚Äôll be huge. In WK10 vs the Commanders, the Eagles lost the Turnover margin 2:4


3.  Win in the Trenches

The Eagles arguably have the best OLINE in football with Two All Pros in Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson. We all know how good our run defense has been all year but this easily will be our toughest task to date. 


On the opposite side of the ball, the Eagles allow the 17th most yds per game vs the run (maybe their lone ‚Äúweakness‚Äù if there is one) I bring up WK10 again bcus this is a game they did lose (however, before they went out and signed guys like Suh/Linval) and even tho they only allowed 3.1 YPC the Commanders as a team rushed for over 150+ on the ground ‚Äî something I believe the Niners can have success with albeit a healthy CMC


On paper the Eagles boast a rising star at QB, four guys who have double digit sacks + Fletcher Cox, two 1K WRs and the stingiest pass defense in the league. All that to say, I still believe we have the pieces capable of beating them. Should be a good one Sunday!
