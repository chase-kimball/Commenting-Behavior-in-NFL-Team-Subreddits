They ran the crew for Niners-Chiefs and had the no call hold on Bosa. 

They ran the crew for Saints-Rams and had the missed PI. 

I’m sure there were more, but it’s hard to breakdown the ref information. Teams would know more & I’m reminded of Joey Bosa’s reaction to Vinovich following the SB. BV’s crew called the least amount of penalties this year but over 1/3 of them came on first down. 

Do with that what you will, but I still think Armstead made the right call in the split second. I also think QBs should be penalized for fake sliding/going down and fighting for more yards.

I’m not saying that Purdy is anywhere near as deserving as Dak who started 16 games and went 13-3, but my point is the fact that most thought it would go to Zeke only for us to get surprised is indicative of the fact that the media has a huge QB bias that even we as fans underestimate. In a year where the OROY field is not very strong, just don’t be surprised if that media bias shows out again and they just give it to Purdy as the best QB / best story as Mr. Irrelevant.

In fact, in contrast to the other teams in the top 5 by CCG appearances, we have over twice the number of losing seasons (13) compared to CCG berths (6). Extending this, of our remaining 4 seasons, we had 2 seasons going 8-8 (2010 and 2014), and then just two seasons (very early in the century too, 2001 and 2002) where we had a winning record but did not make the championship game (lost in WC and Divisional).

If we want to go by the stats, why do we completely fail to mention that he had a 83 QBR that season? That is a higher QBR than Aaron Rodgers (74) the year he won MVP 2021. Lamar had a higher passer rating as well with 113.3 to Aarons 111.9. 

We have both already established that Lamar clearly doesnt have many weapons either.

The year is 2023, we have ascended from the ability to play QB solely from arm talent, it is far more complex than that now with RPOs, read options, and sheer improvising talent. 

As for Roman, pick one only a few yards from the goal line:

1.	Chiefs - high octane offense with skilled position players that push the ball down the field in chunks. Mobile QB that can improvise but also make accurate pocket passes in the face of pressure. Respectable defense with DL being the focal point for pressure 

2.	Eagles - dynamic offense that has two WRs that can stretch the field. Heavy rush attack led by a mobile QB that has come into his own in respect to throwing accurate timing routes. Elite defense led by incredible DL along with a lockdown secondary 

3.	49ers - Heavy rush attack with play action being a focal point to try and steal chunk yardage. WRs, TE, and RBs are all top tier but also position-less to stress defenses out and create poor match ups. Young but calculated rookie 3rd string QB playing point guard for the offensive ideology. Elite defense led by All-Pros at every level (Bosa, Warner, Hufanga)

If our line plays a little better than last year's game, I like us turning three drives into 21 points, not settling for nine.

We won, but any advantage the Cowboys gained was as a result of self inflicted mistakes by our 49ers.

 * ""false-start penalty that would have iced it on a QB sneak and gave the Cowboys their last shot""

I remember that, but the game was only close because of earlier, self inflicted mistakes. If I remember the facts from that 1st half, we left 12 points on the board. And we only scored once in the second half. fuck this shit, we're going to win this playoff game with offense and while each NFL team is different each year, these cores are pretty much the same on both sides of ball, both teams. We have more weapons than last year and more experience than last year, and a will to win that is emergent (where last year, we made plays, but it was hard to measure).

41166,291260,291260,r1kng,"My 3 Keys to Victory


1.  Win the Time of Possession

In the Eagles loss to the Commanders, they were at one point in the game quadrupled in TOP, ultimately losing 40:19. If the Niners can control the clock, hit some key 3rd downs and most importantly keep Hurts and company off the field it’ll be the Niners best chance.


2.  Win the Turnover battle 

The 49ers led the regular season in INTS and Turnover differential at +13. If the Niners can force some early turnovers and capitalize on points (TDs not FGs) it’ll be huge. In WK10 vs the Commanders, the Eagles lost the Turnover margin 2:4


3.  Win in the Trenches

The Eagles arguably have the best OLINE in football with Two All Pros in Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson. We all know how good our run defense has been all year but this easily will be our toughest task to date. 


On the opposite side of the ball, the Eagles allow the 17th most yds per game vs the run (maybe their lone “weakness” if there is one) I bring up WK10 again bcus this is a game they did lose (however, before they went out and signed guys like Suh/Linval) and even tho they only allowed 3.1 YPC the Commanders as a team rushed for over 150+ on the ground — something I believe the Niners can have success with albeit a healthy CMC


On paper the Eagles boast a rising star at QB, four guys who have double digit sacks + Fletcher Cox, two 1K WRs and the stingiest pass defense in the league. All that to say, I still believe we have the pieces capable of beating them. Should be a good one Sunday!
