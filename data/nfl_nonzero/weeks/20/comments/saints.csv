2. There was a documentary filmmaker shooting footage for a Steve Gleason piece, and he caught Williams spouting some pretty inflammatory and reckless shit to his defensive players, adding some unwanted color to the program's purpose.

7593,73689,73689,Jopplo03,"I‚Äôm going to copy and paste u/ daybreaker comment because BountyGate deserves more than Roger Goodell‚Äôs investigation which a federal judge called ‚Äúfundamentally‚Äù flawed:

tl;dr  The coaches never admitted to paying for injuries (despite what r/nfl would have you believe). They said there was a pay for performance pool, which paid for interceptions, fumbles, and yes, big hits - but players didnt get paid if a hit was illegal or flagged. Goodell also never produced any solid evidence to back up injuries - just circumstantial evidence and evidence backing up the pay for performance pool.

 Roger Goodell claimed the Saints had a system from 2009-2011 where they would pay to specifically injure other players. He claimed to have several thousand pages of evidence of this, but refused to show it to anyone. Instead, he said what some of the evidence was, and the media went to town taking his word for it.

The coaches and players never admitted to any bounties - only to a pay for performance program, where you would get bonuses for interceptions, fumbles, big hits, etc.

But by then, public opinion was easily swayed by the media showing one hit on Kurt Warner, a few hits on Favre, and playing one audio tape by Gregg Williams, over and over and over and over, while still not asking to actually see any of the other evidence Goodell had.

To further advance the farce Goodell brought in a ""special investigator"" Mary Jo White, who claimed they had received a signed confession from a player, so the case was basically open and shut.

But then the NFLPA leaked the ""confession"" and it wasnt a confession.

Goodell said he had the bounty ledger, full of pages of a history of payments for ""cart offs"" and other injuries. Except when they released a page that had ""cart off"" payments on it, it was for a game where no one had been injured. The NFL quickly revised their statement saying it was actually for a different game.... that also didnt have any injuries in it.

The NFL then said they had a powerpoint presentation from Gregg Williams to the defense that specifically references bounty payments.  Except the NFLPA leaked that one too, and it was a ridiculous Dog the Bounty Hunter themed presentation that was just creating metaphors for their gameplan to the popular-at-the-time TV Show.

Those are just a few examples. Basically, any time Goodell said he had evidence, and it got leaked, that ""evidence"" didnt say what Goodell said it did.

And yet no one in the media really cared about all the inconsistencies. They kept writing their articles about how shameful all this was. Getting on their soapboxes. Pete Prisco, in 2011, had said the Falcons shouldve injured Drew Brees to keep him from breaking the passing record against them. But then he became the biggest critic of ""Bountygate"".

The whole thing was a giant media shit storm created by Goodell, because the league needed a scapegoat to look like they were ""tough on player safety"" ahead of the retired players concussion lawsuit. And it apparently worked, because the league got off BIG TIME with the relatively small settlement the judge awarded.

Basically, Gregg Williams is an over-exaggerating asshole who uses harsh language to fire up his team. But to this day there is no solid evidence of any payments for actual injuries. The details of the pay for performance plan even specifically pointed out that players didnt get paid a bonus for any illegal hits. And from 2009-2011, the Saints were near the bottom of the league in personal fouls and opposing team injuries.

Now, pay for performance was certainly illegal in terms of violating the salary cap. But the media firestorm and outrage wasnt over the salary cap violations - it was over the injuries. Which were never proven. We had several players suspended for a year, Coach Payton suspended for the year, our GM Mickey Loomis suspended for 8 games, and ou assistant coach Joe Vitt suspended for 4 games. We also lost two 2nd Round draft picks, and were fined $500k.

Paul Tagliabue was later brought in and voided the player suspensions. Goodell also said that if the Saints cooperated, and helped the league start several safety initiatives in high schools, we would get our 2013 2nd Round pick back. Benson never spoke out against Goodell, and was entirely cooperative with anything he wanted. We never got our 2nd Round pick back.

Many people will claim there is proof of a $10k bounty on Favre from Vilma, or that it wasnt from Vilma, but actually from Mike Orenstein (who was in jail at the time and couldnt have actually sent anyone anything). There's never been any proof of these things - these all come from just one source, Mike Cerullo, who had actually been fired from the Saints for several reasons and had to be escorted from the facility by the police. Seeing as how he's the only ""witness"" Goodell ever had, it's pretty easy to call into question his reputation.

We were pretty much victims of trumped up charges that a lazy media did nothing to refute.",30.0,nfl,t3_10h7l8n,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints :Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-20T18:10:45Z,saints,-0.0093781053648511

8151,79768,79768,Kitchen_Net_GME,"I got more tin foil on Drew. Drew‚Äôs last season was 2020. In the off-season prior, Drew was doing very intense strength building and arm velocity building. 

https://theathletic.com/1986561/2020/08/11/how-drew-brees-is-using-his-legs-to-take-10-years-off-his-arm/?amp=1

‚ÄúHouse, a former Major League Baseball pitcher and coach who has built a second career as a throwing specialist for pitchers and quarterbacks, knows that each mile per hour of velocity Brees could achieve would translate to 1 yard of distance on his throws. They spent a month strengthening his arm and shoulder using various functional strength training techniques.‚Äù

And this: 

‚ÄúAfter a month in the gym, Brees took his arm to the field. In early July, House said Brees was throwing ‚Äú45-, 50-yarders like he was 25 years old again.‚Äù By late July, House said he was throwing ‚Äúballs 57, 58 yards without even trying.‚Äù

So a lot of people were excited when training camp started that the Brees deep ball was coming back. 

And then in training camp, we saw‚Ä¶‚Ä¶nothing. Three weeks into to basic 7x7 drills there was not one single deep pass from Drew. 

In training camp Drew has QB challenges for fun after practice. They try to hit targets and what not. 

I finally sat down to watch it and saw something immediately. Drew had a ‚Äúhitch‚Äù in his mechanics. Clear as day, and I have studied that man since 2006. 

I think he went all Tiger Woods on his shoulder and did more harm than good. I believe he had a significant injury from that training that never hit the press. His passes never were the same. 

To add on that, Brees broke like 11 ribs several weeks later. 

I think when he writes a tell all book there will be things that shock a lot of people regarding his health.

Edit: another example was 2010 season for Drew. He was not playing well at all. His 2009 was MVP worthy, as was his 2011 season. But by comparison his 2010 was awful. 

It later came out that he played the majority of the 2010 season with a torn MCL.",126.0,nfl,t3_10gy9lu,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2023-01-20T11:34:52Z,saints,0.0033425358395518

The very next pass was a routine throw on a slant to MT. This was a terrible throw and it skipped on the ground before it got to MT. 

The next throw was the infamous non call. The pass itself was very very soft. As mentioned earlier, the cornerback could have just played the ball for the pick 6. 

The corner imo was surprised how slow the pass was and arrived way to early. 

Then in OT Brees could not throw good passes. 

I‚Äôm 100% convinced he literally threw his arm out and he may not have been even able to play in the SB.

This is a weird hill to choose to die on bro that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm gonna say. Jamies is a Big Ben comparison in terms of athletics, Lance is closer to Jalen Hurts. There is not comparison in their play styles.

15047,142001,142001,Skullkid1423,"Gregg Williams (our defensive coordinator for a few years, including our Super Bowl) was known for fast and hard hitting defenses. For years the NFL was trying to prove he lead a pay for injury program. The NFL investigated us by looking into sound bites from games and locker room speeches, interviewing coaches and players, as well as watching game film.  There was a lot of smoke to it, but the only thing anyone admitted to or could be proven was pay for performance pools. Basically whoever lead the team that week in big hits, TFLs, INTs, Fumbles, etc. would get the ‚Äúpot‚Äù of money that coaches and players contributed to. This program circumvents the salary cap by providing in house bonuses/bets. The NFL was also getting a lot of heat about CTE at the time (less about it being a thing and more about the NFL knowing about it and not acknowledging it) so this was a perfect way for the league to look like they were tough against injuries and made sure to hammer home the title ‚Äòbountygate‚Äô and try to punish the organization as much as possible. 

The league tried to suspend some key defensive players for a substantial amount of games, as well as Payton a full year, Gregg Williams and some defensive coordinators claimed to be involved indefinitely. The Saints appealed and the case went to former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. After he reviewed the findings along with the NFLPA Head (the guy literally in charge of keeping the players in the nfl safe) he determined the investigation the NFL lead contained no tangible evidence towards an actual bounty program, but rather pay for performance. Tagliabue did note there is a lot of stuff in there that could lead to the thought a program existed, however it was not substantial and he reversed the suspension of the NFL players and lowered the suspension to the coordinators to 6-8 games as the coaches did break that rule. He kept the suspension to Payton and Gregg Williams. The saints lost draft picks and were fined. 

Goodell and the league still won though, the headline of Bountygate stuck and not many people outside of saints fans actual researched the Tagliabue findings.

ETA: obligatory fuck Gregg Williams. 

Also, I‚Äôm not saying we didn‚Äôt have a bounty system in place, we probably did.

Jalen Hurts has looked solid this year, but he‚Äôs obviously on maybe the most talented team in the NFL. The only other team that may be more talented is the 49ers

Hurts has a receiving corp of aj brown, davante smith, Dallas Goedert, and an elite OLine

The Cowboys made this mistake earlier: Dak was only as good as his surrounding talent, and paying him made the Cowboys lose WR Amari Cooper, RT La‚ÄôEl Collins and they didn‚Äôt have money to sign skill player free agents

Dak = Hurts, and I think the Eagles could trade up for a better QB with the few first round picks they have

When Deshaun chose Cleveland, suddenly we were in a weird position of ‚Äúdo we just eat the restructures or go all in in a shitty division‚Äù

Also, I‚Äôd like to note that if we had hired Daboll, OConnell, McDaniel, or pretty much anyone other than Dennis Allen or Nathaniel Hackett we would‚Äôve won the NFC South and nobody would say it‚Äôs terrible
