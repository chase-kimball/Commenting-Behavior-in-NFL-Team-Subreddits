I met Cris Collinsworth when I was 8. He lives near where I grew up. His wife went to the same high school as my dad and every year there was always this ""pancake breakfast"" that the high school would throw. The year before he was there and the following year I brought two of his football cards for him to sign. He signed them and told me the story of one of the games in the cards. I will never forget that as a kid and I will always respect him for it.

Chiefs play the AFC East and West, NFC North, and Eagles/Jags/Bengals

Bills play the AFC West and East, NFC East, and Jags/Bengals/Buccaneers

Bengals basically have the same schedule as us just with the NFC West instead of South. I can forsee our records being very similar at the end of the season, maybe with the Bengals edging us out by one or two games, barring injury and major regression by both teams.

Chiefs have an arguably tougher schedule. AFC East gets you Bills, Dolphins, Patriots, and a possibly much-improved Jets. NFC North is also definitely tougher than the South, and arguably tougher than the West. The Lions are on the rise, the Vikings are a solid team with potential to outperform, and I just don't feel comfortable counting the Packers out (Bears could also get a haul in the draft and be one of the most-improved next year).

Bills have the worst of the 4. NFC East is definitely the toughest of the 4, and they only make up for it by getting the regressing Buccaneers (possibly without Brady). They have to play the AFC East and West, which I think are marginally more competitive than the South/North.

I'd wager Bengals go 3-3 in division, 3-1 against the South, 2-2 against NFC West, and 2-1 out of the others for a record of 10-7.

Chiefs I'm betting will go 5-1 in the division, 1-3 against the East (upset from either the Pats or Jets), 2-2 against the NFC North, and 1-2 against the others for a 9-8 record.

Bills will go 3-3 in the division, 3-1 against the West, 1-3 against the NFC East, and 2-1 against the others for a 9-8 record.

I figure 6-3 or 7-2 out of that stretch of games.

Ravens, Bengals, and Steelers will all be tough games, and likely the Browns too, assuming that sex criminal Deshaun Watson shakes off the rust and the rest of that team continues to perform. I'd wager 2-2 if we're being honest, 3-4 if we're lucky.

I think Bills/Chiefs/Niners will all be hard fought games and could be 3-0 or 0-3. It really depends on how we come into those games, how they come in, injuries, luck, and like you said, timing within the season. They should be some of the best games of the season, hopefully.

Outside corners are good. Slot corner and linebackers are ass expect a lot of passed to be caught over the middle on these guys. It also means we suck at guarding the flats.

Dline is also kinda ass but they can randomly play better in the middle-end of the game. Obviously Josh allen and Travon walkers are the guys to watch 41 and 44 since they are our high draft pick pass rushers.

Our safety Andre Cisco had a good game against Mahomes last game. Whatever offense kc runs and the defensive scheme they used was a good matchup for him. He really didn’t get fooled by Mahomes trying to look him off and throw to the other side of the field. Led to some big hits and and INT.

On offense

ETN is really good he kinda looks like Barry Sanders with the way he gets 5 yards on a play that look like it should have been a loss. 

Kirk is just amazing at getting open but not really a threat to break off a long TD.

Zay just does everything well, but can have drop issues but seems to get open a lot deep for not having crazy speed.

Engram has been playing amazing for us. His speed for a big guy is crazy.

Marvin Jones makes some crazy catches but you should know that since he was drafted by the bengals.

Trevor can be hot and cold he can sail some passes occasionally, but once he gets hot he’s hard to stop. The best thing about him is he is aggressive he will always go for the 20 yard play over the 5-6 yard play.

He deserves all the credit he is getting for bringing in pieces to accelerate Trevor's development, even if he did have to overpay to get them.

Dorsey should also be evaluated at minimum but I have to believe the regression of Gabe Davis and Isaiah McKenzie significantly stunted this offense more than is readily apparent.

9209,77610,77610,HolographicHeart,"It was a nagging thought during the playoff run but the 2022 draft class has the potential to absolutely bite us in the ass. Walker had some decent games down the stretch but has not once looked the part of a #1 pick outside of the 3rd quarter in Week 1 and the 4th quarter in Week 18. Devin Lloyd was incredible out of the gate but has since been mitigated by teams realizing his coverage skills are egregious and Chad Muma is passable, but someone you might be looking to replace if no signs show next season. Josh Allen is solid but he's never going to be the TJ Watt type of LB who just completely wrecks gameplans singlehandedly and we need to stop expecting him to do so. And finally, Oluokun is a tackling machine but is asked to matchup with players he has no business covering simply because he is the more experienced LB.

Outside of that, it is difficult to really evaluate Caldwell because the middle of the defense has been so disappointing. I do wish he would show more exotic packages and blitzes but you can only do so much when your LBs get shaken in coverage so easily and the D-Line can't be depended upon to get a significant push at the LoS. So instead we just sit in zone and get picked apart by any of the great QBs who understand how that coverage functions. Front seven has to be the priority this offseason and if we're at the same point middle of next season then I'll start actively campaigning to oust Caldwell.

The Chiefs are in the exact same boat as the Bills (most of their capital invested in a few key pieces) the difference maker is they have offensive genius Andy Reid calling the plays.

Frazier needs to go as well, he absolutely refuses to be aggressive in big games and the Bengals punished him summarily for it all afternoon yesterday.

3. Red zone trips have to be touchdowns. Your defense isn't keeping Mahomes out of your end zone so you better make your own trips count.

Defense Keys:

1. Bracket Kelce, you cannot just let him sit in the open spot between zones, he absolutely kills teams doing that.
2. Keep someone on McKinnon at all times. You cannot let the layup go for 8+ yards every time it's thrown.

One I just did from there. I do like how they give you trades - though the one they offered me was a bit unrealistic. I gave up pick 88 to KC and received picks 94, 132, 165, 216 and 218. KC picked up Isaiah McGuire (DL) with the pick. I ended grabbing Jaylon Jones (CB) with 94 - who I think was a steal here.

I'm only gonna list the top 3 rounds in detail, though I ended up with total of 13 picks through the whole thing due to he trade from KC.

1.24 **Paris Johnson Jr. OT/OL -** Kind of wanted to grab a CB in the 1st, but with Gonzalez, Smith, Porter, Ringo, Witherspoon and Phillips all off the board before 24, I just couldn't see the value. Especially with Johnson Jr. available here. If we keep Taylor, he could easily move interior as he has played guard before. Or he can be depth. Who cares - OL is hard to find talent for. I doubt he falls this far, though.

2.56 **Dalton Kincaid TE -** Even if we resign Engram, we were lacking a serious #2 TE this year. There are a lot of mocks having Kincaid go to a team (even us) in the 1st round. To see him fall here was like mana falling from heaven. Couldn't say no. He was one of the best pass catching TEs in college, and has the hands and size to be a huge contributor in the NFL.

3.94 **Jaylon Jones CB -** I couldn't go longer without a CB pick, and Jaylon was a good fit at 94. He didn't have the best 2022 - no where near as strong as his showing in 2021 - but a lot of that might have to do with overall team. He was a 5 star recruit. He has the size, speed and explosiveness you want out of an early round pick. Just not all the numbers, which is why he drops into the 3rd. I think he could be a great grab here.

Rest of the picks without explanation (would take too long since there are another 10):

4th: Rakim Jarrett (WR), Byron Young (DL), DeMarvion Overshown (LB)

5: Jay Ward (S)

6th: Jaxson Kirkland (OT/OL), Hunter Luepke (RB), Eku Leota (EDGE), Jonathan Mingo (WR), Jake Haener (QB)

17138,125909,125909,Oopiku,"It's a weird one because a lot of the reason he improved is taking chances. That sometimes leads to it going the other way. 

Eagles game I chaulk up to a fluke. Don't see that happening again. He had 5 fumbles lost beyond that. 

And what games do we truly put on his turnovers as the difference makers? The only two I can really say is Denver with the two INTs, and the Eagles with the fumbles. And both of those happened in the first half of the year before he and the team turned it around.

How many games are we in BECAUSE of him, though? How many big games would we have lost down the stretch without him taking chances? Dallas, second Tennessee game, Ravens, Raiders...

Let's look at some turnover stats for some big QBs. Just the season games, not gonna include post season because not all of them played the same amount of games. Total turnovers will be ints+Fumbles lost.

Trevor Lawrence: INT: 8, Fumbles: 12, Fumbles lost: 9, Total Turnovers: 15

Patrick Mahomes: INT: 12, Fumbles: 5, Fumbles lost: 0, Total Turnovers: 12

Tom Brady: INT: 9, Fumbles: 5, Fumbles lost : 4, Total Turnovers: 13

Josh Allen: INT: 14, Fumbles: 13, Fumbles Lost: 5, Total Turnovers: 19 (crazy they only lost 5 fumbles)

Joe Burrow: INT: 12, Fumbles: 6, Fumbles lost: 3, Total Turnovers: 15

Justin Herbert: INT: 10, Fumbles: 8, Fumbles lost: 3, Total Turnovers: 13

Didn't include everyone, of course, just some names that are considered top shelf. 

Honestly, if those others get unlucky and lose more of those fumbles, each of these guys would be super close. Heck, they already are. 

Honestly, I don't think his turnover issue is a big deal. Always want to improve, of course, but I think he does as good a job protecting the ball over the course of the year as any of these guys.

Honestly I was going to go into some more details about the secondary/LB group, since that will also be important tomorrow, but I was dead tired. Got off work really late and was scrolling through Reddit before bed and just had to answer before falling asleep, lol.   
Ultimately I think a better performance from the front will help the secondary drastically. Even with Smoot down, improved play from Robertson-Harris (who I somehow didn't mention above) and outside rushers like Josh Allen has been huge the last few weeks.   


I agree about Toney. He's dangerous. Some of those big plays last time to Toney attacked  Devin Lloyd and Chad Muma. KC loves using motion and misdirection and Lloyd especially bit on that a few times in week 10, causing huge gashes on screens and short throws. It makes it even more concerning that KC has seen better play from their RBs out of the backfield, especially McKinnon.   


In the first nine games of the season, including the one vs the Jags, between McKinnon and Pacheco KC saw these numbers receiving: 28 Receptions on 36 Targets for 225 yards and 1 TD.   


Since that point, in the following 7 games this is the production: 41 receptions on 49 targets for 417 yards and 8 TDs. 

  
I honestly believe this is the most dangerous area of the field for the Jaguars. We know Kelce is a matchup nightmare, and Jacksonville has trouble with TEs this season - but with how KC blew up plays out of the backfield last time around mostly using Toney, and now have seen much better production from McKinnon back there - it IS scary.",2.0,jaguars,t3_10gry83,False,0.0,:JAX0:,2023-01-20T14:19:40Z,jaguars,0.0031717068708908

17183,125966,125966,Oopiku,"Welcome!   
Ultimately, football is won in the trenches, and in the trenches is where the Jaguars have seen the most improvement over the course of the year.   


O-line:   
In their last matchup vs KC in week 10, the Jaguars gave up 5 sacks. They were 3-7 and had given up 17 sacks on the year. Trevor had a QB rating of 89.7 and TD/INT different of 13/6.   


Since that meeting, the Jaguars have gone 7-1. They have given up 12 sacks in those meetings. Trevor has a QBR of 97.9  (this is all including the LA game last week) and a TD/INT different of 16/6. Keep in mind those stats would be even better if not for the weird first 20 minutes or so last week.   


Trevor is a VERY different passer when pressured. He has a 105.9 QBR and 71.8% completion rate with a clean pocket. When pressured that drops to 55.2 QBR and 49.7% completion rate.   


Through the last half the season, when you watch you can see a lot of things that have improved on the offensive line - RT Jawaan Taylor has had by far his best year. I can't find it anywhere, but I'm pretty sure he allowed no pressures from Joey Bosa last week. Walker Little at LT has also been doing very well, considering he is only starting because LT Cam Robinson was hurt six weeks ago. Both tackles have been extremely solid.   


This week the interior will be where we'll need to watch. Chris Jones is simply a beast. In the week 10 matchup, he accounted for 50% of KC's pressures on Trevor. RG Brandon Scherff, a big offseason signing this year, allowed three pressures and two sacks in that matchup. That simply cannot happen again this time around.   


D-Line:  
The Jaguars defense has seen some major growth and changes over the course of the season. Mike Caldwell has been extremely... fluid. This defense has a lot of talent on it, but the disaster that was the 2021 season made it so knowing the strengths and weaknesses of a lot of the talent was hard. As the year has progressed, the unit has found its stride and figured out what it does best.   


Typically a 3-4 front throughout the year, while bringing in a fourth man to the line during 3rd downs and other major passing downs, look for them to run more 4 man fronts with Josh Allen, Travon Walker and Arden Key rotating onto the line. All are athletic enough to cover, as well.   


The team as a whole honestly feeds off of the defense. The players are vocal with each other - and their energy when making plays energizes the entire team.   
Ultimately, I think that is where the game will be won.   


Can the O-line limit pressures, and shut down or limit Chris Jones?

Trevor had that plus all the Urban shit.

We still lead the league in drops after signing a bunch of receivers and drafting ZERO.

- Spags blitzes were fucking nuts, free runners all the time

- Kelce destroyed us

- we were always one step behind them but the Kirk pass and the Agnew fumbled couldve easily swayed the momentum to us.

- Hamilton had a really noice game on the inside

- EDIT: DC Caldwell needs to be better schemewise, Cant have EDGE rushers on TEs. He did get creative a bit with 3 safety packages at the end. But needs more consistency

OFFSEASON needs

- Shaq Griffin cut, we need every penny of his 13mil cap

- restructure RRH, Sherff, Jenkins, Kirk, Zay Jones, Oluokun to create cap space.

- hot take: Trade Cam Robinson. There are very desperate teams that need OTs and we have Little who played better LT than him. Jets maybe or Rams?

- bring back J. taylor, Smoot, Engram, Key, Wingard (i know im missing someone)

- early draft selections: DL, CB, IOL

- Mid round: WR, TE, EDGE

Also, were the productive players he brought in a product of good signings or excellent coaching? I’m leaning towards the latter, since these guys had average careers until they played under Doug.

* 2 helmet color options - black and TEAL(!)
* Jerseys in teal, black, and white
* Pants in teal, black, and white

Other notes --

* Retooled the JAGS badge from our previous set with a similar DUVAL badge
* Also have DUVAL on the helmet bumper, but would probably switch that out for a new wordmark
* went with black numbers on the home (teal) jersey to differentiate it from the throwback and to give us a cohesive look with other combinations using black helmets/pants

Now was doing something different on those couple of plays worth a 5th/6th round pick? Probably? Idk 🤷‍♂️

On the OL, Robinson needs a new contract and I don’t think he’s worth the money he’ll demand. Fortner and Little I am happy with until their rookie deals are up and we can reevaluate then. Scherff didn’t perform at a Pro-Bowl level, but he was solid. Shatley and Bartch are back ups in my opinion. Taylor is the big question mark to me. He had some flashes again this season where he looks like he could be excellent, but his penchant for false starts scares me, so I’d say we could really use a solid LG, and it wouldn’t hurt to pick up another OL later on in the draft. If there is one available, that is my top choice.

On the defensive line, Hamilton and Fatukasi both are still under contract, but they’re both big bodies in the middle more than edge rushers. RRH really came on at the end of this year, but I think to shine he should be a rotational player and I would like to have an pass rush DE for each side anyway. Unfortunately the chance or a game 1 starting DE falling to 24 is pretty low, so I would rather take someone we can be sure of at a different position.

At CB I’ve been really happy with campbell and williams play on the outside, but we have no one who has been any good on slot receivers or tight ends. It’s possible a nickel specialist is around at 24, so that could be a possibility as well.
