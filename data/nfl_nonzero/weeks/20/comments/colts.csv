Reich, a winning coach overall, shown the door after end of season and beginning of next struggles in the first half of the season replaced with a person who has ties to the owner and was against the wishes of the GM.

So, you walk into this with an overall good team and a good chance at a QB of your choice. But, you also deal with a GM that is essentially relegated to top scout. Also, you deal with an owner that is over-emotional in his decision making and your past performance makes little difference (mind you all, this is shit that bad teams do).

1- When working at a convention hotel whose banquets department grossed about $30-35M annually, we lost our food and beverage director suddenly. Like I've never seen someone in that position just outright quit. But he quit. The company did interviews, but in the time it took them to do interviews, I think they realized nothing was operationally not happening at a high level. So a decision was made to NOT fill the position unless it became apparent that it was necessary. And literally until the day I left, the position was never filled. This $120k/year job (in a low price market) just wasn't needed.

2- Saw someone SUPER qualified get passed over for a managerial position at the hotel because they didn't know what's called ""room blocks"" (basically how to assign groups of rooms to a specific group coming into the hotel). That was the feedback on the candidate. Room blocks can be taught to someone in literally an hour. It is the simplest of tasks. The candidate that was hired instead within a year had a nervous breakdown, laid on the floor of her office and cried, and now is a stay at home mother.

3- In the grand culmination of my opinion, I started my own company! No experience in the industry or sales. And the company has been very fruitful.

23184,159452,159452,boyvsfood2,"Two reasons I'm okay with Saturday if that's who they decide:

1- Coaches are so much more the benefactor of their roster than the other way around. And we see examples all the time. As a Colts fan, Pagano was a ""defensive-minded"" head coach. Came to Indy and our defense was never better than average. Why? Well, in Baltimore, his roster was Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Haloti Ngata, Chris McAllister, Darth Sizzle, etc. In Indy, Grigson got us Laron Landry, Greg Toler, Art Jones, etc. They were all terrible pickups. Other examples would be Rex Ryan (same Baltimore roster that got him a head coaching gig) and Matt Nagy (had KC's offensive weapons and then went to Chicago where he got Trubisky to lead a lackluster squad). Coaches play a role, certainly, but not as big as people make it out to be.

2- This one is more about life than just football, but people overhype the amount of experience needed to be competent. Most jobs I've had that say ___ years experience required, when I'd think about it, you could learn all the things that job required in a week, and you could get really good at them within about a month with repetition. I know we'd all like to think being an NFL head coach is vastly different, but I doubt it. A coach can learn in a season or two what they need to know to be successful...given the right roster.",-14.0,nfl,t3_10kxazi,False,0.0,:Colts: Colts,2023-01-25T06:41:44Z,colts,-0.0016510622634407

So let me get this straight. You’re telling me you’re sticking with your claim that Saturday “got more out of the offense than Reich” did based on a single data point, ppg, as I mentioned earlier? And then asked me some asinine hypothetical question about who I’d rather hire based on stats that favor Reich, which you cherry picked and don’t favor Saturday, despite your nice little attempt to justify Saturday by being worse because he didn’t have a full staff at his disposal. 

What are you talking about dude?

Not only is everything you’re saying and arguing ridiculous, but it’s so narrowly focused that all you’re doing is showing your biases. Although your motivations for going on this crusade are unknown, I just can’t help but think you just didn’t like Reich because you blame him for everything even though not everything was his fault. So each time someone tries to make an objective argument about him as a coach, your dislike of the guy clouds your judgment and you resort to just making stuff up. 

Looking at Reich’s years in Indy and evaluating its totality, I’m led to believe it was a success overall, especially for a first time HC. The situation he was provided during his tenure was even worse than Saturday’s imo. Some of that responsibility he has to bear, to which he was ultimately judged and fired accordingly. The rest of it was a calamity of errors that starts at the top.
