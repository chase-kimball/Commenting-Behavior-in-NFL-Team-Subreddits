1809,18445,18445,Bieber_hole_69,"I don't see the value for the Bengals in packaging a day two pick with Higgins.

Using the Drafttek trade value chart, the Bengals would be giving up Tee Higgins + 300 dcap in exchange for 490 dcap + 420 dcap.

That's 610 in net draft capital for Cincy, or the equivalent of about the 30th or 31st overall pick. Chase Claypool with a year left on his contract was traded for the 32nd overall pick, (although as it's a 2nd rounder, it's worth less than the typical 32nd overall pick,) so I just cannot see the Bengals feeling like that's fair value for Higgins.  

For that compensation it would probably just be worth it for the Bengals to keep Higgins for another year and see what they can do about an extension, or just wait to get a 3rd round comp pick when he leaves in FA. Burrow won't get expensive until 2024, it would be worth it to get another year of Higgins before then even if he just walks. I also can't imagine that we wouldn't be outbid for Higgins if this was the offer, somebody else would be willing to pay more.

Now without that 2nd pick coming back to us with Higgins, that would put the net draft capital the Bengals receive in return as 910, or the equivalent of the 18th or so pick this year. That's about the return we got for AJ Brown last draft with similar leverage, (1,003 dcap,) and that feels about right Higgins' trade value.

You don't want to shake things up more than you have to when you had a top-10 offense the year before. Dorsey has been Allen's QB coach every year that he's been good, and if you hire externally for an OC there's a decent chance Dorsey leaves after being passed over for the job since he was getting OC interviews already after 2020.

And it's not like the offense was bad in 2022 or anything. IMO you just have to stick with Dorsey and let a first time OC work out the kinks in year two. I'm sure pretty much all 10 of the teams looking for an OC right now would be thrilled to hire Dorsey if he became available tomorrow, not even just based on 2022 but also because of his pedigree as a QB coach before then.

1815,18452,18452,Bieber_hole_69,"I think Vrabel wants to go with an outside option with this hire. Even Tim Kelly is not exactly an ""internal promotion,"" in the same way Steckel would be. Steckel's been with this team since 2013, pretty similar to Arthur Smith in the way he's been able to keep the job through a bunch of different HCs and OCs with way different backgrounds and philosophies.

In his time as HC here, Vrabel has made only one outside OC hire of the three he's had so far. LaFleur was the only one, and being it was on his first staff here it's not like he had much of a choice. What was Vrabel gonna do? Promote Jason Michael to be OC? He had to hire outside.

And say what you will about the decision to promote Downing in hindsight, but the exact same process got us Arthur Smith in 2019. We had a top 5 offense for a season and a half with Smith, there was no reason to shake things up when he left for Atlanta. So they promoted the TE coach in Downing that also had an outsized hand in designing a red zone offense that was historically efficient.

Obviously though, the hire did not work out. It does provide Vrabel with the perfect opportunity to shake up the offense with an outside hire at OC though.

Maybe Steckel will be the next Arthur Smith or maybe he'll be the next Todd Downing, who knows. Whatever the case may be though, the same basic offensive formula we've had during Vrabel's entire tenure has likely passed the expiration date here and is in need of refreshing.

This seems more conditional though, iirc Kingsbury had put ink to paper with USC and they were not happy about him leaving, but I don’t think Harris has done the same yet here. Teams are waiting for playoffs to end or teams to get eliminated before finalizing hires for coordinators, so all DC jobs, or DC jobs Harris is interested in, may not be filled until February.

1822,18459,18459,Bieber_hole_69,"There definitely may be something to the fact that Robinson was very set in his ways about traditional player evaluation, and the moment that system was completely broken with COVID in 2020 he suddenly started whiffing on more picks than usual.

They got the combine in for 2020, but there were no pro-days or private workouts. Getting hands on with players and seeing them in person seems to be a large portion of how J-Rob evaluated players. Look at how many Senior Bowl guys we've drafted over the years lol.

Then for 2021 in-person meetings for player evaluations were once again limited, but also there was such a limited college season for tape evaluation as well as players just straight up opting out of the 2020 season.

Then when we're essentially back to normal for the 2022 draft process and it ends up being a pretty good draft class for J-Rob and company.

Obviously nobody could have predicted such massive changes to the scouting process would happen in 2020, and it seems there's some correlation between J-Rob's drastic downturn in draft quality that took place concurrently. 

Adapt or die though, he could have weathered the storm better if he wasn't so stubborn and set in his ways. Some analytics or less traditional means of scouting could have prevented some of the worst whiffs. Some of the more forward thinking orgs around the league, (Eagles, 49ers, Ravens,) didn't seem to have the same level of difficulty navigating the COVID drafts. 

With the 49ers, Trey Sermon is the one big whiff of those two classes, but by my count all 12 other draft picks across those two classes are still on their roster. Meanwhile here in Nashville 8 of the 14 picks we made in those same classes are still on our roster. 2 of those misses are out of the NFL entirely within three seasons. Only 5 of the 12 are regular contributors for the team as it stands.

Obviously COVID didn't cause J-Rob to spend so much money on Beasley, Clowney, and Dupree. Or trade AJB. Or trade for Julio.

but 3 1sts are 3 1sts, and even sauce would be considered tradeable at that price point, even an average talent scout could probably net you 2x Elites or 3x Great level players at a high positional value. with that trade and being able to have that talent on cheap rookie deals for 4+ years, that can be a game changer for a franchise as far as cap is concerned.

My point is that a great Qb gives you more margin for error with the rest of your roster versus the other way around (which is how we have been doing it in Tennessee)

The Chiefs were a good team before Mahomes got there. But like us in 2019 and 2020, they hit the ceiling with Smith, which is why they drafted Mahomes in the first place. We were at the ceiling last year, and now we have regressed.

This idea that we can just build a great roster around RT or an average QB and win a SB is fantasy land.

Those aren't great odds and path to buildning a consistent winner to ME. But that's MY opinion. I would rather do what it takes to trade up and draft a QB this year.

It's just the plays, zoomed out, shown twice, and nothing else.  And those views show you things the broadcast view may not pick up - like Karras wacking Simmons before Simmons hit back, or that the player who supposedly 'dove at their knees' actually just fell straight down on the ground in his stance without moving forward at all.

The downside is the player itself sucks - it's absolutely basic.  The controls are play/pause, 10s forward, 10s back, and a slider bar that lets you skip around.  No frame by frame, and the overlay hangs out for several seconds obscuring the screen when you do seek, so you have to go a little farther than you meant so it will be out of the way when the play comes.   If you wanted to do analyst videos or something you'd have to screencap or download the whole thing - and I don't think there's a download button.  Probably would have to go jack the video source file directly, especially if you were going to make analysis videos for youtube or similar.

As for the rest, it's a mixed bag.

I used to have Sunday Ticket and it was nice to be able to record and replay the games I wasn't going to see live anyway, and this is similar -  except you can only watch the live games on a phone or tablet using the NFL app, not your TV, or even a computer.   There are ways to hack around that of course but it's not built into the service.  The other stuff can all be watched on a computer, but not the live stuff.

The replays have 3 versions:  Full broadcast, Condensed (same as full but all the dead time between the whistles is trimmed out so it's just plays), and the All-22 which I described above.  It's nice to be able to watch a condensed out of market game in an hour and change without having to skip through commercials and dead air.

The archive right now goes back to 2009 or so, so the world is your oyster as far as rewatches go.   If they eventually add more that would be killer - it'd be nice to see like the coaches film on the 1972 Dolphins or whatever - but I doubt footage that old even still exists to archive.  But if they do keep adding it'll be cool IMO.  I definitely used it to watch some Chris Johnson highlights in All-22.
