His two worst cover grade games were a 43.3 in Week 13 against the Panthers and a 54.2 in Week 5 against the Saints.  

His 15.1% missed tackle rate is higher than where it was the last two years with the Seahawks.  Most of those came in the first half of the season.  The only game where he missed more than one tackle was against the Falcons in Week 3; that was his 2nd worst overall grade of the season after the Carolina game.  He’s talked a little bit about needing some time after his return from injury to become less hesitant.

4736,39965,39965,Chessinmind,"Ryan Neal filled in really well for Jamal Adams and was having a career year before hurting his knee. He ended up being the highest graded safety in the league.  His best game was the win over the Chargers when he had a 93.9 grade, broke up three passes, had an INT, limited them to 3.3 yards a reception, and had four run stops.  Neal is an RFA and an easy second round tender decision. He can play all over the field, and there are options to use three safety formations next season when Adams returns from injury.  He was at his best when playing in the box, probably because it allowed Quandre Diggs to play his natural position.  

Speaking of Diggs, he had a very good year overall after bouncing back from a dislocated ankle and broken leg.  He allowed just 47.6% of passes to be completed against him.  He was at his best while playing single high coverage over the deep third of the field, when given that opportunity, with a team-best 31.1 snaps per target and 65.3 snaps per reception allowed.  He had 70+ grades in the three final games, as the defensive coaches hit a nice schematic groove, including a 91.1 overall grade in the season finale against the Rams.  

Rookie of the year candidate Tariq Woolen had quite a first season in the NFL.  A 6’4 corner with 34” arms, a 42” vertical, and a 4.26 electronically-timed 40, Riq the Freak was one of the most spectacular athletes to enter the professional ranks this season.  He allowed just 55.3% of passes to be completed against him.  He displayed an amazing ability to recover on plays where he initially misread a receiver or coverage assignment.  In addition to leading Pro Football Reference’s passer rating allowed metric, he also shared the league title for interceptions.  

Playing opposite Tariq, Michael Jackson had an interesting season.  On the one hand, he started all 18 games, shared the team league in pass breakups with Woolen, and allowed a respectable 88.4 passer rating allowed by PFF’s calculations.  Jackson had great coverage games against the Rams, Giants, and Chiefs.  There were times in that Chiefs game where it seemed Mahomes had nowhere to go with the football, despite lots of time in the pocket to make those decisions, because of some stellar coverage play by Jackson, Woolen, Diggs, etc.  He also had some terrible games: 122 yards and a TD allowed in the loss to the Raiders, six games with a coverage grade below 47.  This was by far the most he’s playing in the NFL, and he showed at times he can play well in this league. 

Coby Bryant had kind of a similar season as Jackson.  Both were starting for their first time in the NFL.  Both attracted targets every 6.9 coverage snaps, as some opposing quarterbacks sought to avoid Woolen and Diggs.  The general feeling is a positive one for both players, even though there was some inconstancy in play.  Great games against the Cardinals, Chargers, and Jets.  And some not so great games against the Falcons, Bucs, and Niners. He’s a very cerebral player with limited lateral movement to keep up with the speedier slot receivers. 

There’s no point in piling on ILBs Jordyn Brooks and Cody Barton.  They were the worst coverage linebacker duo in the league, but Barton is a free agent and Brooks had ACL surgery last week.  Brooks was just as bad if not worse in coverage during his first two years in the league.   On the positive side for the position, Tanner Muse looked awesome in coverage in the those final few games without Brooks.  They may have struck gold with Muse, but they won’t know for sure until he plays more next season.  Either way, they need to sign and/or draft a top ILB to help fix this defense.  They will also hopefully get better upfront at generating pressure, which will make everyone’s coverage responsibilities easier.",19.0,seahawks,t3_10j31lo,False,0.0,:sea1:,2023-01-23T01:16:03Z,seahawks,0.0215174541757227

8484,64615,64615,Esuu,">So for me his contract is going to be very telling. If JS gives him 3-5 and like 20-25mil. He is the guy of the future and we are not looking to draft QB. If we give him 1-2 and like 10mil, or wait to get him done till after the draft then JS really likes a guy and wants to try and get him while not fully thinking Lock can be the guy.

Back-up QBs almost never get more than 1-year deals. Some of the backup QB contracts last season were:

* Teddy Bridgewater - 1 yr $6.5m
* Tyrod Taylor - 2 yr $11m
* Jacoby Brissett - 1 yr $4.65m
* Case Keenum - 1 yr $3.5m
* Joe Flacco - 1 yr $3.5m
* Colt McCoy - 2 yr $7m
* Nick Foles - 1 yr $6.2m
* Andy Dalton - 1 yr $3m

Bridgewater, Taylor, and Brissett are all much closer to that bridge QB/borderline starter than Lock is so you can ignore those contracts. All of the others are at $3.5m or below. Given it's a new season and a higher salary cap I could see 1 year $4m for Lock being not quite huge overpay territory. I would expect something more like 1 year $3-3.5m or 2 years $7m if we are going to re-sign him.

I think too much has been made of Lock being involved in the trade. It was probably just an easy way to get an up-close look at a guy with good tools/physical traits and get a cheap backup in the process. For all we know Lock being involved in the trade was Denver's idea because they didn't want a backup for fans to clamor for if things went sideways this season. 

I wouldn't be surprised if they bring him back this year, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they don't and grab a QB in the late second or 3rd to be the back-up/developmental QB, assuming we re-sign Geno. Either way, don't read into it when they throw Lock 1-2 years and below $10m.

Geno was a Top 40 pick in the 2013 draft, dude was electric at WV but was mid during his time at New York and fell into a LONG stint as a backup.  For most highly-drafted bust QBs, that's how the story ends.   Either a backup for the rest of your career or a flameout

But Geno managed to takeover the starting role from the franchise's best QB at that point and actually have a great season. Not like an MVP-caliber season but a still insanely impressive season with all things considered.

The other finalists for Defensive Rookie of the Year are CB **Sauce Gardner** of the Jets and DE **Aidan Hutchinson** of the Lions

The other finalists for Comeback Player of the Year are RB **Saquon Barkley** of the Giants and RB **Christian McCaffery** of the 49ers

If I had to hazard a guess, I think the OROY goes to K9.   Garrett had quiet spells during the season dealing with poor QB play and Brock Purdy missed most of the season.   K9 has basically been *the* most consistent of the three and has a nice statline of 1,200 total yards from scrimmage, 1,050 Rushing Yards, and a rookie leading 9 TDs

For DROY, it's basically guaranteed to go to Sauce at this point.   Sauce was an AP First-Team All-Pro corner this year and Tariq finished 7th in voting.    No way the AP voters go for Tariq.    I want to be proven wrong.

For Comeback Player of the Year, it's a toss-up.   All of the contenders have great cases.   

Saquon and CMC both came back from multiple seasons of injury-shortened seasons and both had amazing seasons where they were the main offensive lynchpin for a playoff team.   Going off past trends, they would be great CBPOY winners.

With Geno it was a far more traditional fit.   Geno has a more prototypical QB skillset and the top end talent at skill positions and the revitalized O-line helped support his season.

To make long story short, it was the right place and right circumstances for Geno to succeed.

Canales was a pass game coordinator for Russ right around when he was getting into his ""Let Russ Cook"" phase of his career.
