7744,73077,73077,IAmSona,">	Brady proved that wrong when he won without Belichick

So because Brady is the GOAT QB, you value them over coaches? Bill Belichick and Brady were always great because Bill Belichick was able to keep talent at a low cost and because he was always able to scheme up great defenses. Brady is a master of picking apart zone defenses and never had to worry about his cast lacking talent until he hightailed to a Bucs team that was stacked with elite talent and another fantastic coach. If you‚Äôre going to make that argument, there are insane amount of underlying variables as to why the Patriots were a team (who traded a first for their HC, too) who had a dynasty for the better part of the modern NFL. 

>	Coaches are not worth a first rounder

There have been only 4 coaches AFAIK who have been traded for first round picks. Shula, Parcells, Belichick, and Gruden. The **only** trade that was not worth it was Parcells to the Jets, every other coach brought their team at least one championship. Sean Payton would only be the fifth coach in NFL history to go for a first rounder, and I think he absolutely is worth it if it‚Äôs only a mid first round pick like the Brown‚Äôs pick.",1.0,texans,t3_10hhn19,False,0.0,:nagatoro1:,2023-01-21T15:33:52Z,texans,0.0757965669393539
7745,73078,73078,IAmSona,">	explain why Andy Reid never won before Mahomes

He is literally won of the winningest coaches of the 2000s and was instrumental in making the Eagles relevant and was able to lift Mahomes into what he is now. Would you still say Mahomes would be the best QB right now if the Bears took him instead of Trubisky?

>	belichick can‚Äôt make the playoffs without Brady

He literally played a playoff game without Brady while Mac Jones was a rookie. 

>	Sean Payton only won with drew Bree‚Äôs

Drew Brees only won with Payton so what‚Äôs your point? 

>	McKay couldn‚Äôt win with Jared Goff but he won with Matt stafford?

He got outcoached by Belichick in the Super Bowl and stopped one of the best regular season offenses by keeping them to only 3 points. I guess Tom Brady willed the Rams to just not show up for that one? Also, why didn‚Äôt Stafford lead the Lions to many Super Bowls if he‚Äôs apparently the biggest reason for the Rams winning a ring?

>	Gary Kubiak won with Peyton manning 

Are we remembering this right? The Broncos had an all time great defense that suffocated the Panthers. Funny enough, the season where Manning had a historically good offensive season with the Broncos, the Seahawks completely dominate them and a lot of that is due to Pete Carroll out coaching John Fox. 

Any good franchise will prioritize a good coach and a good QB, but coaching legitimately wins and is much more important than individual QB stats. Otherwise, why hasn‚Äôt Rodgers won more rings?

I get that the lottery value of first round picks has a high ceiling, but it also has a roughly 50/50 chance of being a bust. So, in the case of Sean Payton, what you are doing is effectively trading away a 50/50 shot at a starter AND hoping that the guy you are promoting into their new job is a good HC for a coach with a 15 year winning record and a few million to spend in free agency. Some quick stats on rookie head coaches- their average tenure is \~3.3 years and between 2008 and 2020, rookie head coaches had a combined record of 437-522-1. That averages out to around 7-9.

Lamar on the other hand would likely cost us about what we got for DW4 which isn't the worst thing to get a franchise QB, however, and this what kills it: Lamar reportedly wants \~45.5mil/yr guaranteed.

24864,190533,190533,dajarbot,"Kafka is probably my 3rd or 4th choice, in a vacuum, and while it may be a little early for him to be a HC there is a lot to like about this guy. 

Earlier in the season on The Athletic Football Pod, they talked about how Daboll specifically reached out to Kafka, despite never having worked with him, because he felt Kafka complimented areas that Daboll was weak in. We'll never truly know, but it does seem like this offense was a collaborative effort. This does seem true because it looks very different than Daboll's Bills and an Andy Reid offense. 

Also, I don't think we can discount what Kafka did for Mahomes. Mahomes sat an entire year and while his prominence now seems like it was inevitable. There were serious questions about how his skills could translate to the NFL and how they could harness that insane arm talent. Good coaches take what they are given and build up players based on their strengths.

29707,231619,231619,randomscribbles2,"Of the top five candidates (not including Johnson since he took himself out), here's how I see them:

1. DeMeco - Hometown hero. Clearly a great motivator, schemes well, and prefers a physical, hard hitting style. Controlling the best defense in the NFL right now. Everyone who has worked with him seemingly would die for him. He doesn't solve out most glaring offseason question - ""how is our next QB going to be positioned to succeed?""- but otherwise the perfect coach for us. With the right style of OC in tow, he would be an A+ hire in my mind. 

2. Steichen - Smart, hungry, effective OC who has proven he can coach up a young QB. 

3. Kafka - Very similar to Steichen, but with both worse talent and worse (but still impressive) results. Both Steichen and Kafka are B+ hires to me. Smart, responsible hires that wouldn't make strong waves with anyone who isn't closely watching the situation. 

4. Payton - Expensive, both in picks and salary. Has nothing to prove, and that's both a compliment and a red flag. The comp that I feel most strongly is Bill Parcells coming out of retirement for another round. And that would be great for us, but not necessarily better than the alternatives, given the cost. He's going to Denver. Better fit there in pretty much every respect. 

5. Gannon - Nothing against him, but this would be a very average hire. I believe he can be an effective head coach, but see no reason why he's best guy for the Houston Texans right now. He neither helps answer the QB development question nor brings any true intangible to the table. A safe, if uninspired choice.
