1) Throws ball away to avoid sack

2) Terry dropped a perfect pass

3) Bad INT after staring down Cam and throwing off his back foot

4) Receiver caught the ball with a foot out of bounds 

5) Deep bomb that hits Jahan in the hands perfectly out of reach from the defender and is dropped

6) To an open Logan Thomas but tipped by DeMarcus Lawrence

7) Terry was covered but he tested the narrow window of some good defense by the CB. Ball placement wasn’t where it needed to be

Eerily similar to the knock on Wentz. I’m a Howell fan/supporter and believe he’s earned the right to compete for starting (and starting the entire season, that is). But let’s not jump the gun thinking he’s anything more than a single solid first performance. 

The call Scott Turner made for that difficult timing pass to be executed in the red zone by a rookie QB who’s had like 3 or 4 days of practice with the 1st string is absolutely retarded and another mail in the coffin for Turner resulting in his firing. That’s a high difficulty play for a seasoned veteran, and he dialed it up for Howell. Howell tried hero ball and attempted to squeeze a ball into triple coverage off of his back foot while evading the pocket… it’s a total Howell mistake because he should’ve just thrown the ball away or scrambled to extend the play. Instead he forced something into a shitty play call that resulted in a red zone turnover.

On the flip side, he was dropping dimes to receivers all over the place, and even Dotson and McLaurin dropped a ball each that was right in their hands in stride. That’s uncharacteristic of those two players to drop such a perfect ball, and unfortunately it goes against Howell’s stats for the game. If those guys catch those balls, it would’ve been an even more impressive performance for Howell in the eyes of the fans. But analysts will see that on film and recognize his ability. Still need a good OC/play caller to devise a game plan around his strengths and minimize his weaknesses, while coaching him up. Scott Turner is not that.

Jimmy G isn’t worth the money he’ll want. As a matter of fact, he’s worth nothing because he is always injured. Bring him in as a coaching consultant, but not a player occupying valuable space on a 53-man roster to be unavailable due to injury.

Curtis Samuel is nowhere close to Deebo Samuel in ability and performance. Deebo didn’t have that great of a season, was injured for a few games, and they also added CMC to their offense.  But this is a guy that just torched for 164 all purpose yards and a TD in the first round of the playoffs. Curtis Samuel has never made it to the playoffs, and didn’t have a single game of over 100 yards receiving this season.
