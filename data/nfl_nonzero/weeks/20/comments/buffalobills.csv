Abysmal offense - ten points is absolutely embarrassing in any NFL game, let alone at home in the playoffs.  Lots of dumb calls (e.g. deep bombs when we need two yards).  I'm most worried about this, as there has been a noticeable regression.  The entire league knows that Josh is good now - there are no more ""secret weapons"", and we have to find a way to utilize his talent that other teams haven't yet figured out and planned for.

I've never been one to call for coaching/coordinator heads to roll, but given the level of talent on the team, I think it's the next logical step, as *something* clearly needs to change.  We've fallen short for several seasons now - not even making it to the Super Bowl, much less winning, and another year of Josh's prime trickles away.  We were never the same after the bye.

9595,55973,55973,EagleRoxy2,"Ok so I will admit I haven‚Äôt been *super* into the football until about this season so I could be wrong on some of these, but here‚Äôs what I found 

1. We need a better D coach(or just a better D scheme). We‚Äôve been drafting high and getting free agent for D line but they couldn‚Äôt get any pressure on an o-line with 3 backups and a knee injury. We had one sack against Burrow, and it was Milano when he was out of pocket. In fact, Milano was the only one who didn‚Äôt look completely lost. The Poyer and Tre collision really sold this for me. We have some great players here but Chase and Higgins were consistory **WIDE** open. 

2. Our o-line sucks. Mitch Morse is great but besides that there‚Äôs not much else. Allen got sacked on a 3 man rush, that should be enough to tell you where the line is at. Dawkins had a bad year and the rest of the line might be worse then the Bengals last year. We need some actual players who can protect Josh, or at least open up holes.

3. Our WR room is a joke. 14 is the only one I can feel comfortable throwing to. Diggs gets doubled and our whole plan is fucked. Davis and McKenzie both have a ~50% catch rate which is way too low compared to Diggs ~70%. Knox also had a pretty good year if you look at catch rate, but he spent most of the year blocking or just not being targeted.

4. The coaches unwillingness to use rookies is insane. I‚Äôm always reminded about Milanos rookie year where he spent most of it on the bench despite preforming incredible. Elam is out performing Dane Jackson yet he was still on the bench all season. Don‚Äôt even get me started on Shakir, he had an amazing catch in the Dolphins game and has out preformed McKenzie by a land slide, yet he still barely got any snaps. I know he‚Äôs not a rookie but Hines is in the same boat. He‚Äôs an amazing Kick/Punt returner with some great speed so I‚Äôm fine if he doesn‚Äôt play too many snap, but really only 4%?

5. No run game. Why did we draft Cook if we aren‚Äôt going to use him? He averaged about 5 YAC this year and I‚Äôm fine with him sharing snaps with Motor, but why not sure then? The O-Line is terrible but they were still finding a way to make it work, yet they still didn‚Äôt get the touches. We need a more balanced offense.

But this is fixable. If I was the Bills, what would I do?

There‚Äôs a few routes we can go with this 

In the first round/second I‚Äôd draft a WR. The bills need another WR if there not going to use Shakir or if he‚Äôs just going to be in the slot. Drafting a good WR2 who could be a WR1 in some teams like Waddle is what we need. 

If we wait to the second round for a WR is draft a guard. We desperately need to beef up the O-Line, and either drafting a guard in the first and third or signing a FA.


We also need some Safety depth and if I‚Äôm being perfectly honest, I‚Äôm not sure where to get it. Poyer was injury riddled all season and as much as I love him, I don‚Äôt see the Bills resigning him and then keeping Edmunds instead because he‚Äôs younger and presumably cheaper.",8.0,buffalobills,t3_10jd611,False,0.0,58,2023-01-23T10:32:17Z,buffalobills,0.0036240317529486

As an example- expecting our receivers to separate by just sending them on a long vertical every play is crazy. 

This is now a time for introspection and self examination by the organisation. We need to scheme very differently. This will be good for Josh- he needs to work within the play design and take what‚Äôs on offer.

> This one hurts. But of course it does! It adds to the fatigue we all feel. We‚Äôre tired ‚Äì tired to our core. We‚Äôve been beaten and shot and frozen and lost in a wilderness of powerlessness and trauma. And, so, we hang our hopes on our team. The one shining spot over this past year ‚Äì the Bills. They were our beacon, the cornerstone of an identity that was not associated with the unimaginable. Winners! But, then, today, they lost. And I think I might know just a tiny bit of the reason why ‚Äì they‚Äôre exhausted too. They are just as much a part of this injured city as we are; maybe even more so as they bear the burden of not just their own ordeals, ambitions and hopes, but of the hopes of all us. 

>And that‚Äôs a lot to carry. Yet they did, willingly and well. They fought and battled and carried on despite and in spite. Even when one of their own was felled and the outcome was unsure and unknown, they stepped up. But, somewhere along the way, and because they are human and are subject to human shortcomings, the tank hit a hard E. The players, the coaches, the staff; they‚Äôre all weary. I saw it today. When they came out on the field this afternoon, I didn‚Äôt see the spark, the fire, the heart they‚Äôve been rolling with since last May. All I saw was tiredness and a demonstrative, intangible weighty burden ‚Äì just like that which has beset the rest of us. Just like the city whose name, and hopes, they carry. And, you know what? That means the world to me! It means they care; for each other, for us. This past 12 months would, and has, laid low the heartiest of Buffalonians. They‚Äôve been through what we‚Äôve been through because they chose to. They could have ignored the city, the people and the abundance of distress we were going through. Many NFL teams do! But, over and over again, they praised us, the fans! They showed up. They connected. They believed in us as much as we believed in them. That‚Äôs character. And it‚Äôs exhausting. 

>I am grateful for the abundance of distractions, the frustrations, the elations and the hope the Buffalo Bills have brought me this season. They were my respite ‚Äì they were that for all that invested in them. But I‚Äôm even more grateful for seeing Josh Allen sign the teddy bear of a kid with cancer; for Dawson Knox at Roswell Park; for all the team making Buffalo not just where they play, but where they contribute just as much off the field as on. I‚Äôm sorry they‚Äôre not going further. Truly. And I hope they get the rest they so richly deserve. I hope we all do.

19615,135844,135844,PoogeneBalloonanny,"Yesterday I said that Josh Allen covers up a lot of bad for the Bills and people were quick to say he‚Äôs not without blame. And obviously, no QB is when their team loses that way ‚Ä¶ BUT I don‚Äôt think people realize fully how much he has covered up for people in that building

Sean McDermott likely isn‚Äôt going to go anywhere but for someone whose top qualities are leadership and defensive prowess ‚Ä¶ he always seems to get out coached in the big games and the defense always seems to be the ones crumbling

The last four playoff exits: blew a multiple score 2nd half lead, blown out by KC, 13 second kickoff and yesterday. The defense can bully bad teams in the regular season but can‚Äôt stop a good offense when they have too  At this point it‚Äôs a trend. An inexcusable one at that

Brandon Beane gets such high regard for finding Allen ‚Ä¶ but that 2018 class was the last of his that had ANY pro bowl players. So much capital has been wasted on undersized d lineman who can‚Äôt generate pressure against a backup o line

They drafted a CB in the 1st and were too scared to use him for most of the year despite the secondary issues. The big addition to the offense was pass catching RBs ‚Ä¶ only to never throw the ball to the RBs. The o line got ignored despite clear issues

And that‚Äôs the frustrating part - it‚Äôs like there was no real plan. The game plan didn‚Äôt fit the personnel at all. The Bills receiver room had 2 receivers who could win outside or downfield and a bunch of slot guys - and then operated an offense built around the deep ball

There was no quick pass aspect to this offense all year. Slot WR role vanished. Allen was expected to scramble to avoid pressure and find someone deep. Which is even harder when your best deep threat has questionable hands and routinely drops well placed ones (like yesterday)

The Bills hired a first year play caller in the most offensive driven era in NFL history, in their championship window, despite one not having won a Super Bowl in over 30 years. Just short sighted moves that never seemed to gel with any sort of actual plan

There was never any situational football with this team. Yesterday on maybe the biggest play of the day - 3rd and 2 they threw 40 yards down field then punted. It largely felt like Dorsey would pick a play at random. And not just yesterday, this was all year long

They can out talent teams in the regular season and Josh Allen is a unicorn who can play hero ball and save the day most of the time - but if he has an off game this team has no shot of beating an actual good team. This roster is very flawed and  now it‚Äôs aging with little cap

Take Allen off this team and I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôre .500. Turnovers have been an issue, but that‚Äôs to be expected when Allen is asked to match Mahomes/Burrow stats with his arm while also being the teams RB1. It‚Äôs a ton to ask of any player. Especially with this play calling

The approach to building this team needs to change. It can‚Äôt be, invest in the defense and Allen will carry the offense every game. If McDermott and Frazier can‚Äôt figure it out with so much invested into it, change gears.

If there was ever a time to change its now. The def see has been built around 6 players - 2 are FAs (Poyer, Edmunds), 3 are working back from severe injuries (White, Von, Hyde) and the other is Milano  Idk how they work around those contracts, but they have to try and mix it up

Start loading up around Allen and trying to outscore everyone. It‚Äôs basically what they have to do in the playoffs anyway.   I‚Äôm frustrated as I‚Äôm sure many Bills fans are right now. Will 100% be back next year, but really hoping we see some changes before then

Adding one thing here. No juice?!? In the biggest game of the season, at home, with Damar in the building.

DC

* Leslie soured me a lot after 13 seconds
* He has shown further stubbornness this year by sticking to his soft zone, vanilla pass rush NPC scheme
* Staley showed the league how to beat the Phins offense, we refused to do so 2 weeks after
* The Ravens showed us how to (nearly) defeat and nullify the Bengals offense, we refused to do so
* The actual defensive positive plays against Cinci came from us leaving the stupid NPC soft zone game
* No stunts or exotic pressures all year long and yesterday
* Barely any man or disruption at the LOS all year long and yesterday

DC wishlist, all ears for more suggestions:

* Vic Fangio
* Sean Desai
* Jerod Mayo
* Wilks if he is free

DL Coach

* Our pass rush has been just anemic for years, aside from the addition of Von
* How come Harry and Jerry get good as soon as they leave?
* Eric Washington needs to be fired, I as a fan don't know any suitors for a positional coach so am all ears
* OSU keep on producing elite DE talents, can we maybe look at their DL coach?

OC

* This one is harder to justify as Dorsey has only been doing so for one year in his young career
* But man was he bad
* No creativity, no motion, no ""easy gimme"" plays and the total abandonment of the short passing game from Daboll's bread and butter that made us so great
* Similar stats but way more reliance on Josh Allen highlight reel plays despite improved personnel

OC wishlist (am all ears again):

* Frankl Reich, Joe Brady internal promotion, even just hearing out Kingsbury or Hackett, Bill O'Brien, Tee Martin, Matt Nagy,  Sean Payton pipe dream
* Remember the Venn diagram for ""bad HC good coordinator"" is huge re: Nagy, Hackett and Kingsbury etc

OL coach:

* Biggest disappointment of the year for me, a guy with an actual reputation and pedigree (and thus expectation) comes in and brings no results
* Brown has regressed, Bates has regressed, Saffold looks washed, heck even Dion looks to regress

Four consecutive playoff appearances with no SB is certainly upsetting, but we have Josh for the foreseeable future. Anything can happen when we have a franchise QB. Fire Dorsey and Frazier or keep Dorsey and Frazier, the management has to know changes need to be made. I have faith that they will. 

I need a break from football. Bills games in the back half of the season were always edge of your seat stressful. I‚Äôm not really rooting for any team still in it, the Bills made it too far for me to get behind any other SB contender. Getting behind another playoff team is some drought era cope ‚Äî I‚Äôm a Bills fan, I‚Äôll watch the SB (probably not the conference games) and whoever wins wins. 

It‚Äôll be nice to be a strong playoff contender next year that everyone is nervous to face, as opposed to a vulnerable SB pick that everyone is licking their chops to knock down. Cincy probably won‚Äôt be scared of us but you know KC will, and that feels nice.

I felt the same way when the Chiefs lost to the Bengals last year... so many Bills fans were delighted out of spite, I thought it was concerning. You should, logically, want a team you went life and death with - and lost - to succeed, because it makes you look better. Chiefs winning the SB last year would've made our divisional performance look better, instead them losing to the Bengals foreshadowed our own downfall this year. Our best moment was losing to a team that lost the next week... yikes.

But ya know, on the other hand, Bills fans were complete dicks to Dolphins fans this year. We couldn't give you your hard-earned win in Week 3 (as if the heat wasn't affecting you guys at all) and then acted like our razor-thin snowstorm win was a shutout. And then struggled against your third string but acted like we beat Marino. We deserve the shit after how we got fucking killed yesterday.

Buffalo-Miami is a fun rivalry. Disappointed that we're out but excited for good divisional games moving forward. Great trilogy even though tons of bad officiating for both sides.

27899,195843,195843,Why_So-Serious,"This is not meant to take pitchforks and torches against anyone named. 

We don‚Äôt do a good job of self scouting. 

Above Average QBs look for #49 in coverage and throw behind his back. Continuously. You can watch it happen time and time again. 

# #49 is great at a lot of things. We keep asking him to cover above average players against above average QBs. Our opponents, not just in the action of game read that #49‚Äôs coverage assignment is open, our opponents actively look to create the matchup and know they can exploit it whenever they need. 

For 4 years it happens and for 4 years we do nothing about it. 


Burrow multiple times went to the #49 well in coverage. Cover 1 could do a whole session on Above Average QBs looking for #49. 

Additionally Self scouting on running doesn‚Äôt appear to happen. We are very susceptible fo big runs from pulling guards/centers. 

Bengals had almost 10 yards a carry and you can see time and time again they run some type of counter-ish play. Get our fast active finesse D to attack and commit one way. Pull Guards the other. Wham Bam 10 yards. 

It didn‚Äôt just happen against the Bengals. It happened all season. The premise of the D is ‚ÄúJosh go Brrrrr‚Äù get a lead and then our opponents go pass happy and play to our bend don‚Äôt break pass coverage. I would always wonder why our opponents would abandon the run. Teams that stick with the run especially their 2nd running back (Perine) in what looks like pass plays then run a guard pulling play. Boom 10 yards. 

Bengals were very well disciplined and didn‚Äôt scrap the plan. Run on pulling plays, Pass to 3rd and 4th options make the Bills D rally to the pass catcher underneath and rack up tons of RAC, and when in doubt look for #49 in coverage. 

The formula is so obvious and we have done nothing in 4 years to sure it up. 

It‚Äôs predicated on ‚Äúcomplimentary football‚Äù So when ‚ÄúJosh DONT go Brrrrrr‚Äù and we don‚Äôt get a lead. The defense just gets plowed over.

Tremaine is an imposing force, he has improved in coverage but is still a liability out there against elite QBs. You saw Burrow look for #49 and throw to his assignment. 

Of the two I think you can find a LB that can fill holes and cover closer to Tremaine than a Safety that QBs are afraid of in ‚ÄòPo. If Damar and Hyde were healthy then Yeah let ‚ÄòPo go but now I think you have to sign ‚ÄòPo and hope Hyde returns to form. Po‚Äôs injuries will be healed up by Pre-Season they aren‚Äôt long term injuries. People get banged up tackling fools and his career shows he makes it to game day. 

Find a LB to fill in with Milano seems like an easier fit.

The market will be there if the contract gets ugly this year. He has all the leverage. 

Best case the Bills work out some kind of elusive trade and sign deal in the NFL. Which is unlikely based on the nature of NFL contracts. We have to take on a bad NFL contract where the cap hit is too high to cut and they would get Tremaine‚Äôs rights with the Franchise option.

27908,195862,195862,Why_So-Serious,"Thoughts on the game: 

1.) The Bengals were very well coached and attacked our weaknesses extremely well. We have a bend, don‚Äôt break defense. They basically said fine, ‚ÄúWe will just bend you down the field.‚Äù They threw short to 3rd and 4th options and made the Bills D rally to the ball, while they got YAC. 

2.) Our O-Line is terrible and masked by Josh‚Äôs escapibility. The Dolphins and Bengals both overload blitzed and got in Josh‚Äôs face with DBs on stunts. Josh doesn‚Äôt look at the dump off so they threw off timing on continuous deep shots that Josh chooses to take. 

3.) We can‚Äôt road grate run because our O-Line is weak. 

4.) We can‚Äôt stop road grate running because our D-Line is finesse players. [We scratched DaQuan Jones a stout run DT and they just ran right down our throats against pass rushing DTs]

Thoughts on the off-season: 

1.) Rebuild the O-Line, or more accurately build for the 1st time an elite O-Line. Mitch Morse is probably going to retire. #26 is a great place to draft a Top Guard, #58 is great for the a top C/G, #90 is great for another guard. We have invested a ton of picks in the D. It‚Äôs time to go back and build out the O-Line from scratch. Josh is in his 6th year. The escapism isn‚Äôt going to increase. Build an elite O-Line. 

2.) Sign some vet D-Line that can stop the run. The formula the Dolphins, Jets and Bengals exposed is going to the recipe our opponents follow. From a macro trend perspective 9ers, Eagles even Bengals are showing running is important in the NFL, backs matter again. You‚Äôll see team‚Äôs reinvest in running.  Our opponents will Run at the D and dump off short. You can find vet Run stuffers for cheap. Load up this off-season. The off ball players are pretty solid on the Bills D. 

3.) Sign Po‚Äô. Damar was an incredible understudy. You can‚Äôt lose both. With the Google money use it on ‚ÄòPo. 

4.) Tremaine probably can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt fit. He will get 100M+ contract. Bengals went to Brady‚Äôs well and just picked on his coverage assignment all game. I think we can get a LB in FA.

Frazier needs to go. 6 years of beating up on mediocre teams in the regular season with an occasional shutdown of a good team to getting smacked in the playoffs by stronger competition. His time is up and we need a more modern scheme for our young and talented DLine.

Edit: I'm not sure how realistic it is but getting someone like Frank Reich in the building to help with Dorsey's playcalling and Josh's coaching would be really big.

Edmunds will almost certainly get signed. He's only 24 years old and really came into his own alongside Milano this year.

Oliver we might let walk unless he takes a huge step up on his own next season. He only seemed to be better this season when the majority of the focus was on Von.

Philips, Lawson, Klein and Poyer will walk. The biggest loss there is Poyer the rest are relatively replaceable and were cheap-ish contracts anyways.

MCDermott being a defensive HC has steered this team into investing everything into the defence. Twice as many 1st and 2nd rd picks into the defence and sadly those picks haven‚Äôt made a difference when it counts.

Meanwhile Allen is left to be 95% of the offence. No run game, a pretty weak WR room considering they brought in Brown and Beasley off their couches to start a playoff game.  O line has been ignored almost completely. Washed up guys like Safford get brought in to patch together a line that isn‚Äôt good at really anything. 

Lastly a OC that does even use the tools they do have properly.  

Then we have a DC who seems to have forgotten how to do anything but run out a base nickel D playing soft zone. Watching how the Bengals were disguising the pass rush yesterday just infuriates me. All this draft capital on defence to do nothing to disrupt the Bengals passing while at the same time letting Mixon rush for 5 yards a carry.  All they do is rush 4 drop into zone and get torn apart over the middle because our pass rush creates no pressure.  They only positive play on Defence all game was Milano spying and making a coverage sack.  


Lastly what is with this coaching staff and rookies. You spend a 1st  and 5th Rd pick on CBs, then refuse to play them. You spend a 2nd on a RB and barely use him.

He‚Äôs pushing Beane to load up on Defence instead of focusing on giving his MVP caliber QB the tools he needs to succeed. An O Line that can give him more than 1 sec before he‚Äôs scrambling for his life. A run scheme that can take all the pressure off Allen and makes defences stop the run. Some quality targets and a an play book with some screens, crossing routes and proper running plays, not this constant RPO bullshit that every team is all over. It‚Äôs not 2016 anymore, teams defend the RPO pretty well now. 

Up until week 6 and Cook finally got a rushing TD Allen was 100% of the offence. If he didn‚Äôt throw it or run it in himself they didn‚Äôt score. That is more than Any QB ever can take on and succeed. The fact the Bills won 13 games when the Bills scored 53 touchdowns and Allen was responsible for 42 of them and scored as many Rushing TDs as the two RBs combined is actually amazing.

nope, because the chiefs and bills/bengals played a different amount of games.

We have one of the best QBs ever to play the game.  We spent a couple years building around him, extending him, finding ways to scheme for him, building a defense to help him.

Then this year, we stopped doing that. We went into the season with an average-at-best o-line, handed the keys of the offense to a QB coach, didn't surround him with receiving talent, refused to rely on a run game that could help steady him and keep him healthier.

In spite of all of this and the ridiculous adversity this season brought, we managed to be 8 points away from an undefeated season. Allen looked like Superman, despite injury and mental exhaustion.

Then in the Divisional Round we just.. shit the bed. Uninspired and uncreative play calling, stubbornness and ineptness in the defensive coaching. Stupid game management from our HC that showed motivation to try to not lose rather than to win.

Frazier needs to go. Dorsey probably needs a year behind an OC that knows how to call plays. McD needs to find a way to be more aggressive in big games. But it sounds like none of that will happen and it makes me feel like we're headed for a similar season again next year.

Our defense was absolutely decimated by injury. Our best cornerback missed more than half the year and never really regained form, our best pass rusher and best defensive player was lost on Thanksgiving and our defensive line fell apart afterwards, I halftime of this game we were on our fourth string safety while the other one played on one leg. Despite all that, they still finished with the top five ranking in adjusted DVOA and kept us in every game of the season. If Tre comes back to close to what we know he can do, Von returns to form for the back half of the season and we address the safety position we can be in good shape. 
Offensively, I feel like although we put up really similar numbers to last year‚Äòs team we were far less consistent. I think Josh needs to improve his decision making and be more willing to take things underneath. I think Dorsey needs to do his part in reining Allen in, and commit to the running game more consistently like we saw in the back half of the year. I‚Äôm excited for what James Cook can bring to the table next season, I also think will see a bit more of Khalil Shakir. 
Our offensive line however is atrocious. Dawkins is our best lineman and even he was pretty average all year. Mitch Morse has played his best football and unfortunately I think is on the decline, we thought we might‚Äôve caught lightning in a bottle with Roger Saffold but he appears to be done. I like Spencer Brown, but he‚Äôs consistently graded out as one of the worst lineman in the league and Ike Boetger and Ryan Bates are pretty much replacement level. We don‚Äôt have the money to overhaul the line so we‚Äôre gonna have to hit on a bargain bin player and draft pick or two. Dorsey is also going to have to adjust his playcalling so the ball gets out of joshes hand quicker. Josh has got to be more decisive when it‚Äôs time to run the ball.

My point is that, therefore, the teams that hold out against the trend will essentially become head coaching pipelines for the rest of the league. Teams now basically have to find who they think is the right guy to run the offense and make him the HC to avoid another team poaching him.

41134,284920,284920,kit_mitts,"Let me start by saying I'm so proud of the players for getting this far after everything they've dealt with this year, including: 

* forced into being essentially the sole symbol of hope for a city that suffered a domestic terror attack and a once-in-a-generation storm that claimed dozens of lives (and caused a home game to be moved on short notice)

* multiple season-ending injuries to key veteran leaders

* seeing their teammate literally die on the field before the heroics of medical professionals brought him back

Emotional fatigue is real, and that's on top of all the physical fatigue. 

That all being said, it feels like we are further away from the Super Bowl than we were after 13 seconds last year. At this point, I want Beane to stop investing early picks on defense; his evaluation of D-line talent is particular is a huge weakness. We should throw everything at the offense and shoot for a replacement-level defense that a good coordinator can elevate in key moments (essentially the KC model).

Both coordinators need to go, and McDermott's seat should be getting warm. When the going gets tough, McDermott regresses into the poor game management decisions that plagued his early years. The continuity from Daboll to Dorsey seemed flawless after weeks 1 and 2, but with the benefit of hindsight it's clear that handing him the keys to an offense in a Super Bowl window was a mistake. It sucks to make a star QB change schemes, but we need someone who can both maximize Josh's strengths and most importantly reel him in when he indulges in his bad habits.

So I'll just keep to the raw data: The Bills average 137.6 yards per game rushing. That's 8th in the League. Just behind SF, who are constantly praised for their effective run game (the top three teams in that category are all out of the playoffs btw). We also rank 5th in passing yards per game. We are the only team to be ranked in the top 8 of both categories. [Source](https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/team-stats/)

\^What needs improvement here? This is as balanced as modern NFL offenses are ever likely to get. Remember balance doesn't mean 50% passing and 50% rushing. No coach thinks that way any more, not ones with jobs anyway. 

Also just a side note: why did we invest in all these fleet footed athletic O-linemen? Because when a PASS play BECOMES a RUN play in the blink of a Josh Allen eye, they can turn up field and try and get some blocks on the backers. The best NFL offenses are instantaneously dynamic. We have one of those offenses and we should be celebrating it.

I laughed my ass off ... but the more I evaluate the season, I don't think a *partial* rebuild is out of order. u/jxher123 and a million others have pointed out: it seems like the team COMPLETELY lives or dies by Allen. Look at Baltimore. They almost took out Cincy without LAMAR - an arguably top 5 at least top 10 qb! How many wins do you think we get w/o Allen?? (No disrespect to GOAT Keenum.)

We all thought we were going to have a hard schedule this year, but if you look at how the teams ended up, I would argue it was as easy if not easier than than last year! 16 games we played. Only 2 teams I would argue would be considered ""tough"" teams to the league (Chiefs w/ healthy Pat, Ravens w/ healthy Lamar). 14 of those games were with teams that either didn't make the playoffs or were frauds (maybe Fins being the exception but their EOY collapse makes that suspect) - and we lost to 3 of them! This same team does not squeak by 13 wins next year, full stop.

So how do we do it w/ cap, etc.? I vote we do it at the cost of our D. Chiefs are a perfect example. #1-3 offence in the league; mid D. One game from the SB ... for the FIFTH year!  Let Frazier get his HC gig he deserves; sell off our D talent. Get us a cement wall for an O-Line. I want so many WR1s they have to set up a fashion boutique at Highmark. Defense wins championships, but your mere-game-winning Offense is what gets you to that 'ship. Build our O. Let JA17 get his confidence back knowing the world is no longer on his shoulders.

1) Great QB play

2) Great Coaching

We can talk all we want about the talent differentials but we are top a top 5 roster bottom to top. The disparity between us and the other top teams in terms of talent is negligible.

What is massive is the coaching gap. 

We didn't have a gap on offense with Daboll. He was great at attacking teams' weaknesses and scheming guys open. That's why you saw Davis catching 4TDs and going for 200+ yards. He was WIDE OPEN. Davis is no different this year to last year. The difference is that Dorsey can't get him open and he's having a much harder time with contested catches. Dorsey seems allergic from doing anything but deep patterns. Where were the Beasely type option plays over the middle? Why couldn't he get the fucking RB involved in the short passing game? Why did every play take 5 seconds to develop??

That is why these other teams are killing us in these games. 

You all watched the game. These WR weren't winning jump balls over tough defensive plays. They were WIDE FUCKING OPEN. It's not talent that makes Tre play 8 yards off on 3rd and 2!

Last year, Josh managed to right the razors edge perfectly of when he should decide to go for it, but he only did it rarely. This year, the offense was struggling in nearly every game causing the pressure to mount. I honestly believe he was incredibly stressed this year during the second half as the offense struggled more and more during games. The pick of him at the end of the Detroit game really sticks in my mind.

So I think we should distinguish between the casuals and the fans who are thinking about it from a different perspective.

If you look at it from a stat standpoint we we are doing well, but then when you watch the game, you see that it's working because Allen is a fucking god and he's being put under ridiculous amounts of pressure to make huge plays. That's just really bad for the mental health of your players.

While I may argue with you about the talent, what is certain is everyone is familiar with Josh. That allows them to play together well and make plays out of nothing. And therein lies my issue. It seems like all the time we are having to make plays, instead of the play calls working. Or we hear of Josh saying no, run this route instead, or Josh directing during the play.

Literally the players are the only reason we are doing so well IMO. I hope if we ever change our OC again we get someone who is dedicated to running the football. Many will say, but Josh is so great why take it out of his hands, but he would be so much more effective with a real running game and it would take a lot of pressure off him.

Dorsey just seems to lack the creativity and game sense, that Daboll had due to his years of experience. Daboll clearly knows how to scheme open players, while it very much seems like Dorsey relies on his players to get open and for Josh to be superman all the time to win.

As for decision making, yes Allen is in the game and making those decisions but Dorsey is clearly not CORRECTING Allen.
