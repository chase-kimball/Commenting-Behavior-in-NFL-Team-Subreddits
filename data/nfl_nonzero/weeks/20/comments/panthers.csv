I get what you're saying here. To me, the reality of the QB position these days is that the top QB prospects are going to be coming from loaded programs far more often than not, and that's only going to be moreso the case now with NIL and free transfers.

- QBs drafted since 2017 who've shown flashes that came from loaded offenses (10): Deshaun Watson, Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray, Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Justin Herbert, Jalen Hurts, Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields, Mac Jones

- QBs drafted since 2017 who've shown flashes that weren't surrounded by NFL talent (3-5): Mahomes, Lamar, Josh Allen, Daniel Jones (maybe), Trey Lance (maybe).

And before y'all say ""that's 3 of the 4 best QBs in the NFL, that's my point,"" here's the list of the rest of 

- the QBs drafted since 2017 in the top 64 who didn't come from blue blood ""loaded"" offenses (6): Mitch Trubisky, Josh Rosen, Drew Lock, Jordan Love, Zach Wilson, Kyle Trask, Kenny Pickett. That's not including Sam Darnold and DeShone Kizer.

Avoiding guys who played with a bunch of 5*s in college isn't the silver bullet people think it is.

Richardson has elite speed but doesn't jump the gun on using it. In my opinion pocket presence is one of those things you can't teach. His main knock is accuracy which we've seen is fixable, and he would instantly have a top 5 arm in the league power wise.

38356,258016,258016,tank4trevor,"/r/panthers: Let's just re-structure all these contracts and free up cap space!

Also /r/panthers: Why don't we have any cap space next year?

I'll tell you why!

1. Taylor Moton - (restructured) - $24.5 million cap number - $18 million salary
2. Shaq Thompson - (restructured) - $24.5 million cap number - $13 million salary
3. Christian McCaffrey - (restructured, traded) - $18 million dead cap hit
4. Robbie Anderson - (restructured, traded) - $10 million dead cap hit
5. Matt Ioannidis - (void year) - $4 million cap hit

Between those 5 players alone that's $50 million of ""borrowed"" money. And yet we have NOTHING to show for it. That's 5 straight seasons with a losing record, and every year the Panthers had tens of millions of dollars in dead cap. There's a time to mortgage your future, like the Bills did signing Von Miller, but that should be a ""break glass in case of emergency"" tactic reserved for teams who have a legitimate shot to win the Super Bowl.

The Giants have the playbook for what the Panthers need to do. They took their medicine last year and refused to kick the can down the road any more. They ate their bad contracts and hit the reset button on their salary cap. And they still managed to make the playoffs! Now they have the 3rd most cap space in the league, 11(!) draft picks, and the flexibility to re-sign their free agents if they so choose.",7.0,panthers,t3_10jpc41,False,0.0,Tepper,2023-01-24T10:20:15Z,panthers,0.0383724565445769

I hate the thought of giving up a ton of picks to move up and I also hate the thought of taking Richardson in the top 10. I also think it's not crazy for the Jets to draft another QB. Wilson isn't the answer, so the Jets could sign a veteran QB and give Richardson time to develop. They have a more complete roster and more cap space than the Panthers.

As far as Levis going 1.1, I think he's QB3 but nothing would surprise me at this point. I think it's likely the Colts will trade up to 1 to get their guy, and it very well might not be Bryce Young. I've heard the Colts may have more concerns about taking a smaller QB than some other teams, and perhaps they would be worried about Houston taking Levis ahead of them if some other team were to trade up to 1.",1.0,panthers,t3_10hg24s,False,0.0,Tepper,2023-01-21T11:15:02Z,panthers,-0.032299092233181
38359,258019,258019,tank4trevor,"Fitt is actively un-fucking the salary cap. He traded away Robbie Anderson and Christan McCaffrey. The team will have tons of cap room in 2024. It sucks that they restructured those deals, but the existing salary cap situation kind of forced their hand.

It's also too early to judge the draft. Corral never got a chance to show what he could do. Cade Mays looks like a steal. Smith / Barno are both developmental players who could have a bigger role moving forward. Smith already played significant snaps on special teams. Overall it wasn't a bad draft considering the Panthers came into it with exactly one top 100 pick.

The reason everyone is high on Fitt is his really good 2021 draft. The first 5 picks were all hits. Then there are 3 more guys who are at least backup-level players (depends on how you view Shi Smith). Fitterer could have another really good draft with a full deck of cards this year.
