on the defensive side, Ahmad ""Sauce"" Gardner is a rookie cornerback who just had an incredible all-pro season and will almost certainly be the defensive rookie of the year. we've also got defensive tackle Quinnen Williams who's entering his 5th season and coming off the best season of his career, where he also was an all-pro

on offense, we've got rookie wide receiver Garrett Wilson who just had an incredible year, as well as rookie running back Breece Hall who looked unstoppable until he got injured week 7 and was out the rest of the year. Alijah Vera-Tucker is also a very good offensive lineman entering his 3rd season, who also just got injured week 7 and missed the rest of the season. that was a rough game

the biggest piece we're currently missing is a quarterback. a couple years ago we drafted qb Zach Wilson with the 2nd overall pick, and he turned out to be a complete bust (this is a few years after drafting qb Sam Darnold with the 3rd overall pick, who was also a bust). many of us are hoping we can grab someone decent in the offseason so we can maybe compete next year. our defense was elite this past year so whether we can compete next year really just comes down to whether we can get a good qb. but as a team we've historically had a lot of bad luck at that position, so who knows

the Bengals also benefitted from the NC because it guaranteed them the division and the 3 seed, which also guaranteed at least 1 home playoff game (*another situation that practically assumed the Bengals beat the Bills*). on the flip side, this fucked over the Ravens who were no longer able to win the division, and would be stuck with likely multiple away playoff games. the potential coin flip was how the league rectified this, and potentilly wouldn't have even occurred until the divisional round after each team already played a playoff game

13912,99475,99475,NannigarCire,"in the first 5 runs, there is one game-changing haul where 4/5 of the players picked are legit starters and the other one is a rotational piece.  I'd look at the others but it would take too much time to PFF search players i don't really recognize. In the remaining four, you find only 1 starter in any of them and barely a player worth starting in the other players within.

The chance of filling all these holes youre pointing out using these picks is astronomically low. and what you're actually giving up is 1.5 starters for a QB. That's actually what is given up. 1.5 starters on average. The draft is not for filling needs. This is not what its for other than QB. If you have a need, you look to FA. And if FA doesn't have an option, then you have to draft. But all short-term needs, like the ones that are necessary for next season they are/should be filled with veterans. Why would someone want a competitive team to play a rookie FS or rookie C or rookie LT in a competitive year? 

It's unnecessary, it's not a good trade off, and it's pushing a completely new issue onto the team of not even allowing them to take advantage of having 3/4 of their best players be on their rookie deals- the cap saving of that is almost the same as the amount of cap being saved by a rookie QB deal. It's a rare situation to be in because very few teams ever have 3 first round picks in 2 years all hit very well, but the jets have the same exact benefit in their hands as a rookie QB contract due to having so many good hits in such a short span.

13922,99488,99488,NannigarCire,"good choice imo. jets fans are notoriously pessimistic because they don't actually enjoy football, they just crave winning. but if you enjoy football, they're a fun team to watch as you can see how the ups and downs of seasons occur and how different team-building strategies affect teams differently, and also how sub-par personnel can be poorly used and sometimes really well utilized. It's fun to follow a bad team is what i'm saying, as long as you don't tie the Jets winning games as something that affects your emotional well-being or that serves as a personal accomplishment.

The best player is currently Ahmad Sauce Gardner, rookie cornerback who just had an incredible season. Other top players are Garrett Wilson (Rookie Wide Receiver) and Quinnen Williams (5th year defensive tackle). Another contender for one of the teams top players is Alijah Vera-Tucker who seems to be a god at all of the offensive line positions.

The Jets are outside the top 16 contenders for the superbowl almost entirely because they are missing a quarterback. If they find one of at least top 16 quality, they probably jump into the top 10 for Superbowl contenders and will be a force in the upcoming season.

13924,99490,99490,NannigarCire,"i'll bet he makes the HOF, but idk if he'll make the SB because that's kind of just luck. Marino made it there just once. it's not just about the QB to get there. Dak has been given good weaponry for most of his career, that's undeniable but this year his weapons are worse. and Burrow's weapons are incredible for every year he's played since his first. Top 5 WR in Chase, top 15 WR in Higgins, one of the best slot WRs that's underused in Boyd (who used to be a 1000 yard receiver when before all the other WRs joined), plus great receiving backs. Like the only thing they lack is a top 15 Tight end. Dak's had good weaponry in the past when he had the Lamb/Cooper/Gallup crew but he barely got the chance to play with them. Most of his luck has been in having good OL but you can't accrue big numbers just by having time to throw and yet, his numbers are still in a rare group of high efficiency players who also have high volume of production. and then on top of that he has a 70% win rate for his career.

Like if the cowboys had 1 of those interceptions purdy got lucky on caught and dak's unlucky tip intereception not caught, he's continuing to the NFC championship and might even had his superbowl run this year.

13941,99511,99511,NannigarCire,"This year was a bad year for him, but even with this years stats, his career production and efficiency is above average. But the concept you bring up- of 'should be able to transcend a weak supporting cast'- he did. He did when he won MVP in 2019 by throwing to Mark Andrews, Rookie Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead. He did in 2020, and he did again in 2021 although his interception rate that year was way higher than any other. He didn't do it in 2022. But the concept of turning water into wine constantly over and over again, isn't even proven in the accepted elite quarterbacks. Aaron Rodgers has two years in his career with some of the worst supporting casts imaginable and both years his numbers take nosedives in passing efficiency, just like Lamar, just like Carr this year, just like many other players. Lamar being unable to raise a sub-par offensive cast into a strong offense is already disproven by 2019-2021. Go look at those teams. They are not filled with talent. For his career, the best situation he's had is one good tight end Mark Andrews, one solid receiver Marqise Brown, and rotational pieces.

If the argument is then ""well his most recent season is the only one that matters"" then i'm sorry, it's a bad argument. It's going to fail historically, it's going to lose when i show other great QBs bad seasons, it's an easy argument to show as poor. It's recency bias where every possible ability to disprove is already within this argument.",2.0,nyjets,t3_10gya3b,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-20T16:22:39Z,nyjets,-0.021812967836707

13943,99513,99513,NannigarCire,">I hate this kind of assumption. There's also a possibility that Lamar is the limiting factor in an offense with better weapons and his passing numbers don't jump significantly. Until you actually see what happens you can't assume that 30% better receivers equals 30% more production, for example.

​i'm not assuming it, you can look through his year to year and see the worse receivers correlate with worse production. And this is the case for almost every QB in the league, but to a degree that is limited by their individual skills and sometimes by skill mismatch (Carr with Cooper/Crabtree was worse than he was without them, for example). But even so, bad QBs will still improve with better talent. And Lamar Jackson has two seasons that are above 75th percentile with below average talent. It's not going to scale 30% to 30% like you said, but it improves almost always.

IMO what this argument has to say in order to make sense is not that ""the improvement doens't scale"" but that Lamar Jackson is actually not talented enough. And that argument isn't going to make sense.  He is clearly talented.

There is no way the MVP of the 2019 season throwing 66% completion (76th percentile amongst all QB seasons from 2012-2022), 7.8 YPA (78th percentile), 1.5% interception rate (86th percentile), and a 5.4% sack rate (66th percentile) to top four receivers Mark Andrews, Rookie Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead while setting the record for all-time QB best rushing season is not talented.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10gya3b,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-20T15:56:46Z,nyjets,0.0274804574521417
13944,99514,99514,NannigarCire,"I'm saying, he can. He did in college. He ran a pro-style offense. He will still run even in a pro-style offense. But the Ravens built their offense around what they did because they don't have the ability to do anything else. Their roster does not allow for any other offense to be used. They're not going to get much out of a receiver room containing an injured Rashod Bateman, Devin Duverney, and James Proche and then one good quality talent in Mark Andrews. If he's an above average passer with that situation, he will likely be a significantly above average passer in the Jets situation.

As far as resources, the majority of the jets team's cap is tied in veterans that aren't useful. The money is better spent on a QB, and most competitive teams with QBs have no problem having both the competitive roster + the QB on it. Like to put Jackson on the roster you're selling Corey Davis + Carl Lawson + Jordan Whitehead this year. That's an easy sell. And FA rarely has good players on it regardless, because good players aren't usually allowed to walk. And as far as picks go, i've already posted it several times but whats one more- i made a draft pick roulette in excel that takes 3 random 1st rounders and 2 random 2nd rounders from the last 5 years. no filters, so even first overalls are in here to skew the results. Here's 10 runs of spending all those picks:

Kaleb McGary, Brian Burns, Saquon Barkley, Rondale Moore, Ezra Cleveland

Taven Bryan, Alex Leatherwood, Rashaan Evans, Marquise Blair, D'Andre Swift

Rashawn Slater, Saquon Barkley, DeVonta Smith, Courtland Sutton, DJ Chark

13945,99515,99515,NannigarCire,"mildly above average while having a below average supporting cast. His support is 1 good tight end and a bunch of rotational parts that are pieced together through injuries and bad luck. Even when he won MVP his supporting cast was very not good. It's a sign of his talent to be that good with that weak of a support.

I don't know if he'd be the same passer if he can't run, but teams are always putting a spy on the field for him and he's still outrunning them while also being an above average passer under a below average circumstance. This year it was even worse because they were using guys like Demarcus Robinson off FA, 36 year old Desean Jackson, and then horrible offensive line play due to trading away one tackle and losing the other to injury.

I genuinely think people are not doing any sort of analysis of Jackson and placing everything onto 1 player when the circumstances are clearly bad, something that also affects all the other potential QBs in this years market from Aaron Rodgers to Derek Carr to Daniel Jones just feels silly to me.

That's the point of adding more dynamic players onto the field, it forces the defense to pick their poison. if you're asking if he'll still be that when his body starts to wane, IDK but that's 3-4 years away at least.

looking at the last two years, because he has mostly the same offense during them, only 4 times has a team managed to keep him under 40 yards rushing. he won 3 of them going 62% completion (average), with 6.8 YPA (below average), 5 TDs and 3 INTS. and this on a team that's offering weak passing weapons outside of Mark Andrews, the one year of Marqise Brown, and Rashod Bateman when he's not injured.
