Which, certainly makes it possibly to make additional money with a lot of changes. Even with $20 million, they'd lose significant talent. That Von Miller contract better be worth it.

Edit: The tool, for example, says they can restructure Miller's deal to potentially open up $10 million. I wish I knew more details.

15611,139146,139146,Perswayable,"Normally I would agree with you, but I am reading they're in relatively unique circumstances somewhat limiting restructure ability. As an example, Dolphins are $14 million over the cap, but a few adjustments can position [them $25 million under](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/barry-jackson/article271255047.html).   


The Bills? Extremely limited. One route could put them [$11 million over the cap](https://www.profootballnetwork.com/buffalo-bills-offseason-preview-2023-free-agents-cut-candidates-team-needs/), but this would require straight cuts. Between the amount of free agents they have, it is going to put them in a difficult position -- not to mention the holes this creates and the money needed to sign their draft picks. Also, the $11 million theoretical would include cutting Hines, except Singletary is hitting free agency off a $2 million contract. 

[They have 2 big stars entering free agency this year, as well as losing their ""starting"" RB, possibly their punter, and backup QB.](https://www.profootballnetwork.com/buffalo-bills-offseason-preview-2023-free-agents-cut-candidates-team-needs/) Their RT is *awful*, they have a hole at LG with free agency, and they're losing DE depth if Shaq Lawson walks -- which, he played on the veteran minimum.   


Again, I 100% normally would agree with you. But, they are not in a normal circumstances unless the sources I've provided are all wrong or missing critical information (could be the case, I just can't find it). Often I roll my eyes at the cap space dilemma but really, their GM did not do a good job restructuring contracts. He barely got them to the $2.5 million mark in week 1.

15621,139160,139160,Perswayable,"I think the general consensus is to see what Patriots do in the offseason, first. Free agency is in March and the draft is in April. For example, there is a top OT in free agency available (Orlando Brown Jr) but no true WR1's available (some will be for trades though). Do we acquire an OT in free agency and use our draft picks to pick a WR or CB?  Do we trade draft stock for one of the top WR1s available for trade, and draft OTs in the later rounds? We have good success drafting OL outside of the first round. It all comes down to which direction Pats decide to go. 

BUT, to answer your question, **and you should totally look into it because it's cool and will provide rich draft info,** there is a draft chart that provides values for their picks and how much it *would usually* cost to trade up:  
([Source](https://walterfootball.com/draftchart.php))  


Round 1, Pick 14 overall  
Round 2, Pick 46 overall  
Round 3, Pick 76 overall (From CAR)  
Round 4, Pick 104 overall (from LAR)  
Round 4, Pick 114 overall  
Round 6, Pick 170 overall (From LV)  
Round 6, Pick 173 overall (From CAR)  
Round 6, Pick 178 overall

Say if Paris is projected to go 9th overall, that would cost 1,350 points. The 14th pick is worth 1,100 points. Therefore, we would need to add 250 points worth of picks. We would most likely have to trade our 1st round (1,100), 3rd round (210),  and a combination of picks to reach the last 40 points. Sometimes this is why teams will also add picks to offset the points (ex: Raiders trading their 1st and 6th round for Patriots 1, 3, and 4th) if there is a slight point discrepancy.

I really hope they make the proper adjustments to tackle. Also, thanks for giving insight into Wynn's draft projection -- I did not know he was projected to be a guard.

15629,139171,139171,Perswayable,"I am so thankful for this comment because I just had this conversation with a colleague.   
(This is based on 2 weeks ago): A lot of the focus on prospect OTs was Paris Johnson Jr and Peter Skoronski. There will be debates as to whether Skoronski is more of a guard than a tackle due to the limitations of his size profile, but 2 studs stood out in top 14 and potentially 4 OTs overall in the first draft.   


So, with rank 14, due to the early draft thought to be dominated by QB, DI, and Edge, a lot of top players could trickle down to us. This means there is a chance the top CB remains, top RB remains, top TE remains, etc.  My hypothesis is, if a top positional player does not remain in either OT or CB, Patriots have trade down leverage for teams looking to get one of them.  I have 0 faith in the Patriots WR drafting ability. TE could be selected as it's a super heavy TE draft, and Mayer is being compared to the next Witten, but we do have Smith and Henry this upcoming year.   


**If you wanted my honest solution:** Hire Brown Jr for $20 million, trade a top pick for a solid  WR, and now you enter the draft with 2 big holes fixed; select a CB with whatever round we can and get rid of Mills, freeing up $5 million with $1.2 million dead cap. Cut Parker, since we have a true WR 1, and free up an additional $6 million.  I wouldn't want to overspend on Meyers since the market will be hot for him.

Well, in a weird way I am not sure we need him as a starter. During the off-season of 2021, we lost Karras and Shaq - both being guards (Karras was more utility). We patched the guard positions by flexing Onwenu to the RG position and drafting Cole Strange at the LG position. Shaq Mason I believe is a RG. Onwenu belongs in that RG position -- he played all of college there. Patriots were just using him in other areas. 

Theoretically, we could hire Shaq Mason and flex Onwenu back to the tackle position, but I am not sure that would be the right decision. 

I just feel their approach specifically to the tackle position was not good. They hired Trent Brown one month before the draft (good move), had Cajuste and Wynn (both injury prone), and drafted one tackle in the 7th round who slid there because of injuries. It required them to sign Marcus Cannon in October to the practice squad because they had no real T depth...who was released by Houston because he only started four games in 2021 due to injuries.

15638,139180,139180,Perswayable,"Fair opinion for sure.  


Trent Brown has played RT for the majority of his career (especially the past 2 years). Wynn played LT his career. The swap happened during voluntary workouts and they never looked back -- in fact, Patricia made the decision before Wynn even practiced. I am surprised we didn't see attempts to switch Brown to the right side. Other than the 2 sacks Trent Brown allowed week 1, his first 5 weeks were solid. I guess that is why Patricia was trying to be patient, but it also lead to Hoyer's head injury (that was on Wynn's blown coverage -- he was benched by the second half). And, Marcus Cannon was only elevated to the roster at that point not because of coaching adapting to Wynn's performance, but because Cajuste was put on IR.

I mean, I have no idea how Trent Brown plays for weeks and weeks absolutely sick and looking like death. He supposedly lost 12lbs. His stats took a huge nose dive and that was a coaching problem -- he had absolutely no back up because the entire tackle position was built on bubblegum and shoe strings.
