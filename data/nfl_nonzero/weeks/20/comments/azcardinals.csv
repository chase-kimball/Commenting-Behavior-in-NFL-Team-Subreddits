Purdy is looking amazing for the 49ers and the 49ers are the division rival—why would they want to give us their QB that is doing well for them? Kind of seems dumb, right? 

Also, if Purdy was this “good” beforehand, why didn’t anyone draft him until the last pick? Shanahan is one of the best coaches in the league, and the 49ers are well stacked in their defense and offensive weapons and line. That is why coaching is so important in this game. Even so, Purdy was only a 3rd stringer until Jimmy G and Lance got injured.

I was not making an excuse for Kyler. I am just pointing out he has been to only one playoff game in his entire career while your comment reads like he was Dak Prescott or Kirk Cousins in the playoffs. In that game, you cannot put the only blame on Kyler either. The offense could not move at all, the Oline was non existent, and the defense could not stay off the field long enough to catch their breath or to stop the Rams’ killer offense. Our coaching staff never adjusted successfully, which was a consistent pattern through the Kingsbury Era. Everyone likes to circle jerk hate on Kyler, but this is a team sport and our coaching staff always seem underprepared against most teams in the NFL where we just fucking collapse terribly at points.

Also, I suggest you look at Kyler’s contract, there is no realistic way of moving off of his contract until 2025. Even then, the team still incurs dead cap. The team should just build the team up and have it ready for Kyler/or whoever to be the QB in the future.",6.0,azcardinals,t3_10j1eaz,False,0.0,:cardinals: Cardinals,2023-01-23T13:39:40Z,azcardinals,0.0189311745989671

See the link to the article below. Relevant part:

“An employee under contract to a member club (including a head coach, general manager, or other “high level” employee) who voluntarily resigns or retires prior to the expiration of his contract, is not free to discuss or accept employment with another NFL club without the consent of the prior-employer club,” the memo explains. “This is true for the full remaining term of the employee’s contract. If a club wishes to consent to discussions of a substitute employment arrangement, that club may condition its consent on receiving appropriate compensation from the member club wishing to discuss employment with and/or hire the employee who has ‘retired’ or ‘resigned.’ Once an employee’s contract has expired, the employee is free to seek other employment with another NFL club, assuming there has been compliance with the Anti-Tampering Policy.”
