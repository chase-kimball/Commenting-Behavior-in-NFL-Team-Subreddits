37,4300,4300,828r,">NBC: As a coach, McCardell helped Santana Moss to a 1,000-yard season in Washington as the receivers coach there. In 2011, former Patriots wideout Jabar Gaffney nearly put up similar numbers (947 yards on 68 catches) under McCardell. He spent both of those seasons with head coach Mike Shanahan, who just so happens to be A) incredibly well-respected by Belichick and B) the original architect of the scheme the Patriots tried to implement last offseason that heavily emphasizes zone runs.

>McCardell made a brief stop in the college ranks and coached Stefon Diggs at Maryland. Then he ended up coaching under another Belichick pal, Doug Marrone, in Jacksonville.",23.0,buccaneers,t3_10kk4na,False,0.0,:bucsoldflag: ,2023-01-24T18:02:02Z,buccaneers,-0.0092944

20608,136934,136934,acealeam,"Not sure this stuff warrants its own post, but I've been really messing around with the nfl stats stuff lately.

I figured out that the Bucs' falloff this year is the 27th greatest since 2000 from EPA/play, out of the 373 teams that regressed for one season since then. So 93rd percentile regression!

Since I found that I decided to make some figures.

I was curious if Bowles would get fired (couldn't do the same for OCs) so I made this:

https://imgur.com/jnAPNMn

As you can see, it doesnt seem like a regression from last season is actually a huge predictor of whether a HC is fired or not. This makes sense broadly, if your team is really good and stayed good, who cares? If you did improve a lot, congrats, your job is safe! It is not the same if you regress a lot, however. If you make a line to show all the teams that regressed about as much as the 22 Bucs, I believe it was 53% got fired.

Now I know it definitely looks like Bowles won't get fired, I basically made this right after the regular season ended but it took me awhile to make it look pretty haha.

And if you're curious, here's the change in offense & defense only for the '22 season for all teams.

It's funny cause..I do not remember ever writing or thinking that lol. I think I wanted Lovie to get one more season?

Thanks mods for sticking this, I chuckled at the stickies and I also enjoy looking at old threads, I want to see how we all commented (out of controversial(?) takes i had, I remember I was pro Mariotta during the draft) and how bad or well our old comments aged.

25096,153598,153598,dragonsky,"> Whats the best example of a quick rebuild for a team in our spot?

Luck.

Not Andrew. But.. luck.

Trade some of the more expensive players, and keep the key players. This means that we may have to get rid of guys like Shaq or Lavonta for example.

Keep the key players like Godwin/Evans/Jensen/Vea

And then get lucky with the draft.

The team should look like this:

1/3 = Key players playing very good, players that would be important in every team.

1/3 = Rookies and younger players.

1/3 = Veterans that can still go and want one last shot at proving their worth.

This can work only with good coaching.

You swap a couple of veterans in the next 2 years.

Then, by 2025, the rookies should enter their 3rd season, and at this point you should know which ones of them are good and  you'd know if they can keep the team moving forward. If they're good...you continue with a similar project.

This time, guys like Evans and Godwin will be the veterans. Guys like Vea, White, Otton and the others would  be the Key players for us. And at this time you'd  have new young players and rookies.

It's all about luck and finding the right pieces.
