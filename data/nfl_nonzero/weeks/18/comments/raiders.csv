2021: 374 points scored, 439 given up
2022: 395 points scored, 418 given up

I point this out to try to remind you, and anyone else reading this of the simple fact *THE RAIDERS GOT LUCKY LAST YEAR.* 6 wins on the last drive or overtime? That doesn't happen. In fact it's only happened once. Last year. 

So let's break down the situation. The good: we have an upgraded wide receiver room, running back room, and frankly, offensive line compared to last year. Maxx and Renfrow both got re-signed, and we got to finally see if Carr could put us over the top with a #1 wide receiver. Didn't happen

The bad: our team is still filled with JAGs other than a few positions (WR1, WR3, TE1, FB, LT, LG-puttong Parham here, DE). They didn't properly address the o line in free agency and it showed. 

The questionable: Questionable you say? YES!!! 
1. What can Ziegler do with a full slate of draft picks, a full year of college scouting, etc.
2. Now that the Carr question is answered (he's a good qb but it's time to move on), who will be the qb best year and beyond? 
3. Is the defense Grahams fault or is it just a bunch of JAGs and Maxx? 

Notice how I didn't really put a ton on Josh McDaniels? There's a reason for that, and it's the team. We've all seen NFL teams quit. Quit on coaches. Quit on each other. Quit on the season. You know what you haven't see this year? This fucking team Quit. We aren't the Denver Broncos who quit on their coach and got him fired. We aren't the Miami Dolphins who are rumored to want to fire their coach if they miss the playoffs. We aren't the Browns who dismissed Clowney because he's obviously quit on them. Instead, we have a team that seemed to want to keep playing hard even if they did suck. 

I DONT LIKE JOSH MCDANIELS. ILITERALLY CALL HIM MCDIPSHIT. But at the end of the day, the team performed the same as it did last year overall, the end of the game heroics just didn't pan out. Simple. So by that measure, I'll give him (mostly Zieg) next year's benefit of the doubt and roll with it.

He was set to make 35mil this next year and he objectively underperformed. He took a significate step back compared to the last couple years. you can blame the defense or play calling as much as you want but the play calling was worse under Gruden and he has more weapons around him now than in his entire career. Mix that with the #1 rusher, and about the same OLine as hes had last year, he should have performed better. He screwed himself over. This is a business decision, if they wanted to screw him over they would have benched him after the Saints game. No doubt he gave everything to the org the last few years but thats why you are payed.

The following year (2024) I don't have us picking high because I think we'll have built a stable OL/D by then and we'll have Adams/Harrison(hopefully) and Stidham in his 3rd year in Vegas, 6th year with McDaniels, and 1 year behind Brady. So we'll probably pick in the 20s in the 2025 draft.

23789,190281,190281,ViralOner,"What part of my above comment makes you think I'm describing the system as easy? It's more in depth by the nature of the options in the system. Carr's strengths are to execute the play on script to the designed receiver with great timing. The connection and ball placement to Renfrow in '21 is a good example, looks like they've done 1000 reps in practice. In McDaniels offense the defensive alignment and spacing dictates where the receiver will run(option) and the QB has to read, extend and improvise more. You see it on some of these wide open catches Adams gets, he's literally running himself open into space.

Carr isn't ""bad"" so much as his brain just isn't wired to play this style. And a less ""talented"" QB might be able to run the system much better because it fits his strengths. Accuracy and arm strength might not be as productive as someone who can extend, anticipate and deliver catchable balls to open guys who run themselves free.",3.0,raiders,t3_10984mk,False,0.0,:Logo_95-Present:,2023-01-11T17:54:34Z,raiders,0.0995518490998032
23790,190282,190282,ViralOner,"Gruden's system was filled with the same read options, route adjustments and late developing routes that McDaniels has. The difference is in JMD's system, you can run virtually any play out of any formation with any personnel group and also adjust individual routes. Essentially making the playbook endless and its contained in the language. Gruden's system was a collection of individual plays. Spider 2Y Bannana is always 2WR, 1 TE, RB, FB. McDaniels could call the same concept to scheme the FB or TE open out of a 3WR or 2TE or single back formation/grouping. In Gruden's system, defenses would identify our exact playcall based on our formation/grouping.

Carr always got the ball out quickly, sometimes too quick and was criticized for check downs. This year he held the ball a lot, obviously processing information. Carr can be very good with reps and muscle memory to make his handful of reads and throw with timing. This system requires you to ""play the game"" more than execute the play.

Personally, I agree that it was time to move on. I didn‚Äôt think Carr deserved all the hate, and I still appreciate the stability he has brought at QB position. However, he is slowly declining with age and we needed young blood to take the reign. Carr will be better off on a different system, and for better or worse, we‚Äôll also get a fresh start.

42121,290208,290208,sergibby,"$60 mil and roughly ten draft picks can do a lot.  Not to mention we can restructure contracts if needed to free space, and maybe get some capital from a Carr trade.  Free agent contracts are usually structured so that their cap hit is smaller in year one and increases through the length of the contract.  For instance, Chandler Jones has an average annual salary of $17 mil a year, but his cap hit this year was only about $7.8 mil.  

So with that being said, we could easily sign like 5 average to above average starters on defense/right guard, plus a bridge QB, and have a little room for bottom of the roster players, then draft BPA to hopefully get some higher end talent.  We won‚Äôt become immediate Super Bowl contenders in this offseason, but we can absolutely improve our defense with this cap.
