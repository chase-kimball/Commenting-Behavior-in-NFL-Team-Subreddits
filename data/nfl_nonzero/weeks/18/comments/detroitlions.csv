6376,38064,38064,ChefCurrySauce,"You’re asking the wrong place if you want a truly balanced answer; this sub probably wouldn’t trade Jared Goff for Patrick Mahomes. I wish I could say I’m more than half kidding.

The objective answer is that Goff had a fantastic season and has done more than enough to prove that he can and should be our starter going forward. He massively cut down on his turnovers, improved his pocket awareness, and commands the offense extremely impressively. He’s a good leader and is well-liked by the staff, the FO, and the locker room. I have full confidence that he can lead us to wins and to meaningful games.

That being said, he’s turning 29 soon - not old by any means but definitely isn’t young and is probably tapped out as far as upside goes. He has 0 mobility or play extension ability unless you count his general pocket awareness as “play extending” (I don’t, but some in this sub do). He struggles on the deep ball and underthrows guys a lot; some people here point to obscure advanced stats to try to argue that he’s prime Russ on the deep ball, but watching the actual games with your eyeballs will confirm his deficiencies in this area. His contract, while not outrageous, is pretty sizeable. Point being: Goff is good - really good even - but there’s no doubt that there’s room to improve.

He’s done enough to where QB is not a pressing concern, but I expect the team to upgrade if things line up for it. I don’t anticipate the Lions going out of their way to try to upgrade or force something, but how the FO views Stroud/Levis/Richardson will impact what they do.

Good organizations are proactive - not reactive. If we get a chance to acquire someone with a ton of upside who can sit and learn behind Goff for awhile (think Mahomes, Rodgers, Lance, Jackson, etc), I expect and want us to do it",5.0,detroitlions,t3_1097254,False,0.0,Spiciest Memelord,2023-01-11T09:20:26Z,detroitlions,0.0242846850425728
6377,38067,38067,ChefCurrySauce,"This is a great write up - quality work as always 

It’s tough to have a Jared Goff conversation around here because you get absolutely abused if you suggest that he’s anything less than prime Dan Marino, but I 100% agree with both your praise and your opinion on how to approach things moving forward.

There’s no doubt that Goff will be the starting next year and he’s absolutely earned it. Cutting down on the INTs was massive and his command of the offense has been extremely impressive. I have 100% faith that this guy can lead us to wins and, more importantly, can do so in big games.

That being said, I’m open to taking a QB (even early) provided that Brad and co think that such a QB can eventually be an upgrade over Goff. Despite all of his strengths (and there are many), I totally agree with you that he’s basically a proven commodity right now. I think that this year was his absolute ceiling and there are still concerns around the deep ball, play extension, mobility, and away/outdoor games. I also don’t think that Jared Goff will ever be that guy who will win you a game. I don’t think he’s an upper echelon QB, but I think he’s firmly in the conversation for that 10-12 range which is - in my opinion - really good.

That being said - I’m glad he’s here and I’ll support him 1000000% while he’s the QB. Super likeable and a good leader. I hope we can win some meaningful games with him under center. If we take a Stroud/Levis/Richardson to be his heir apparent, I think that this franchise will be in a really really really good place.

7480,42972,42972,CluelessFlunky,"College and nfl are technically completely separate. Theoretically I believe anyone can declare for the nfl draft if they are about 3 years out from high-school. 

But realistically only guys who played in college get drafted.

Normally they play 3 to 4 years in college then submit there name to the nfl draft pool. 

There are 7 rounds of picks. The earlier you get taken the more money you make. A top 5 pick makes almost 40 mil where a late round pick might only get 1 mil.

If some one declared for the draft but didn't get taken in the 7 rounds they can be signed as a undrafted fa to any team that offers them.

If a player is drafted they have to play for that team, or reject the contract re enter the draft the following year. Once declared for the draft they are unable to go back to college. So players will generally just play for what ever team takes them.

Contracts for rookies are 4 years. With first round picks having a team option for a 5th year where a team can keep the player signed for a extra year.

After 4 or 5 years they enter fa where they can sign with anyone. Teams can also cut a player before the end of that players contract. The player doesn't get paid the full value of the contract but they are free to sign with any team after being cut.",1.0,nfl,t3_104q3uc,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2023-01-06T04:58:48Z,detroitlions,0.0328265827477887

14835,77169,77169,EverythingIsByDesign,">Campbell and Caldwell aren’t remotely the same coach.

But they are. Both from a positional coaching background with little to no résumé as a co-ordinator. Both Caldwell and Campbell are character guys you motivate their players with empathy and have great rapport with their roster. Caldwell's players spoke out for him (even Megatron did when he retired in '16) and still do today. He wasn't an X's and O's coach but a people guy. Campbell is exactly the same; a leader of men, his players love playing for him and he loves his roster. 

Shelia was in the ownership group since 2014 and saw the effect it had on the state if the franchise when the Charlatan Quinn was allowed to fire Caldwell and install his guy; a young, highly regarded X's and O's co-ordinator with no breath of NFL experience and the people skill of a pubescent teenager. She'd have seen how players grew to loathe him, how Patricia had no respect for his players and how there was always a string of ""bad apples"" to be traded or cut. So when it came to replace Patricia it was logical that ownership would lean towards the inspirational leader like Campbell over the high flying co-ordinator candidates like Arthur Smith and Robert Saleh (remember how in on Saleh this sub was?) Leadership is what this franchise needs over intelligence.

Caldwell wasn't a great coach, but he was let down by his blind loyalty to his assistants. Campbell has shown similar loyalty but definitely isn't making that same mistake when it matters. But they're both a million miles away from Patricia. Campbell is an improvement on Caldwell, but they're both cut from the same stylistic coaching mold.",-1.0,detroitlions,t3_109c8hr,False,0.0,The Goff Father,2023-01-11T15:40:16Z,detroitlions,-0.0109046657498952

26790,152100,152100,Pinkaroundme,"Easy answer is draft a young guy early and also sign a guy with more experience. Which is what I expect to happen. 

Needs in no particular order - IDL, CB, LB, IOL, K, QB, S, RB

This list doesn’t mean we need starters at every position, mind you. But positions I think we can upgrade for day 1 of the season through the draft are CB and IOL. CB should be a day 1 or 2 or both. 

We know Holmes doesn’t like early round LBs but it’s still a possibility. 

QB is a good idea even if Goff is our guy for at least the next 2-3 years, which I think he is. Where, though? I don’t know. Maybe our last 2nd rounder, a 3rd rounder? Probably not 1st imo. It’s a good idea to bolster to room and maybe you find a guy who can develop and replace Goff in years to come, and to immediately upgrade the backup position. 

RB should be a spot to upgrade if you expect not to resign Jamaal if his price point is too much for us, and if you don’t expect to resign Swift after next year. 

S is a need if you don’t expect Elliot to stay around after next year and if you think you can upgrade Tracey. I think Kerby is going to be here a while, guys a ball hawk. I really like Elliot and Tracey, but it’s a point of focus for this defense and therefore should probably be focused on especially if you don’t expect Tracey back early next year after the Achilles. Day 2 or 3 probably. 

IDL should be a point to bolster run defense and get pressure through the middle, and upgrade Buggs. IOL on the other hand to replace the swinging door that was the RG position this year. I think this should be a day 1 or 2 pick. 

LB should be a point somewhere but idk where Holmes will do it. I like Anzalone and I think he played very well but it’s still a point to upgrade. Same with Rodrigo - he needs someone next to him. Day 2 or 3 probably. 

Kicker should be brought in to compete with Bagdley, not through the draft imo.",4.0,detroitlions,t3_109gd8l,False,0.0,Growley Cats,2023-01-11T15:43:31Z,detroitlions,1.2254903224280894e-06
26791,152101,152101,Pinkaroundme,"Lol, I believe I’m the one who said that, and the out-of-context stuff you love to post on this sub is sometimes mystifying. You are extremely critical of just about everything this organization does, and sometimes it feels like a load of bull. You LOVE to pick and choose when the wind is blowing one way or the other. Earlier this year, you wanted MCDC canned. 

Goff is without a doubt not the most loved active player ever by a significant margin. That goes to Megatron when he played, by far. There are plenty of people on this sub who were all out on him as a bridge QB early and early even through midway this season. I was someone who wanted to give him a chance and see what he could do. Now I think he can be here for the next few years and I’d be very happy with it if he continues to play at this level, as should most of the people on here. You, like many, were hypercritical of him, and I feel you’re someone who thinks, if you aren’t as good as Mahomes / Allen, you need to be upgraded. I think this season really goes against that sentiment. So does Brad Holmes’ comments on its easier to get worse at QB than it is to get better. Hell, last year majority of the sub saw him as a bridge QB until he started putting together good games. So I think now that he’s proven what he’s capable of, being supportive of Goff is perfectly reasonable, hell, even expected. 

As for the Goff to Jameson, there was nobody in his vicinity. Goff’s only job on that play is to not *overthrow* Jamo. And as players who havent developed chemistry with each other, Goff did not yet know just how fast Jamo is or where to expect him. So an “underthrow” when no one is near is his job - to make sure he doesn’t overthrow him or put it in a spot just out of reach. They haven’t practiced together for long. Goff has developed a LOT of chemistry with other guys since last year and in the offseason. That’s why he’s not under throwing guys like Kalif and Chark - two other speedy WRs. I stand by this explanation. I don’t think typing this as a paragraph is explaining something to the Supreme Court, but you love to make little digs at people like it actually means something. And the game was against the Vikings, not the Jets.

31372,181257,181257,Skraxx,"This is generally where I'm at with our coordinators:

BJ - If we make the playoffs, or even if we just beat the Packers, he's gonna get hired as a HC. Unless he particularly bombs interviews, just the fact the Dolphins hired McDaniel on 1 year of OC experience and many other teams don't really care about HC experience over all the years... He'll be a hot commodity. I'd love to be wrong, but I'm just preparing with the idea that someone like Engstrand will be our OC next year.

AG - It is kinda hard to properly evaluate Aaron Glenn. His first year was a mixed bag, but it was truly awful in terms of personnel. This year he's gone from terrible D to D that's saved our season, back to questionable D. I think it would take a particularly bad performance vs the Packers to be fired, but otherwise I think his job is safe for at least the beginning of next year. However, next year is where our D will need to show some consistency.

EDIT: Since the BJ part is riling people up, no, I didn't and will never say it's a guarantee. However, you have to realize it's a pretty high chance he gets hired with a winning season. Recent trends in the NFL have had teams scrambling for young offensive minds, no matter the experience. I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/1055x1h/aaron_glenns_performance_and_job_status/j39chbk/) later in the thread to talk about HC jobs and coordinator experience. While I will concede the couple cases of being an assistant HC, HC candidates with college as their experience are falling increasingly out of favour and would have not helped Ben Johnson's case had he been a previously successful college HC. The only reason why Jim Harbaugh is being considered, is because he had been a successful NFL HC in the past.

What Ben Johnson has done to the offence is incredibly noticeable. He's already well-known around the league with 10 years of coaching experience and has been successful in the one shot he's gotten. He's also 36 in a league pining for young offensive minds at HC. The only thing he *doesn't* have, is HC experience or much coordinator experience. This point, is somethings teams have disregarded in favour of the right coach.

TLDR: Ben Johnson has all the qualities that NFL teams have been looking for in a HC in recent years. His downsides are things that they have historically been very willing to overlook as well. If the Lions win on Sunday, it substantially helps his case that he helped take a 3-13-1 team and got it a winning record in one year. It's no guarantee that Ben Johnson will be hired, but he has an absolutely rock solid case. The sooner you accept that he's a genuine HC candidate, the easier the transition will be for you when he eventually does go. If he doesn't leave, that's fantastic. But if he does, be ready.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly. ^pls ^don’t ^take ^him ^from ^me

UC penalties stack, so that would've been 45 yards under normal circumstances and probably would've had the Lions on the one yard line since it was a half-the-distance scenario. At that point though it isn't about the yards but holding the offending players accountable.

36318,218019,218019,Wiggymaster,"Goff reminds me of Brady, to be honest. Brady doesn't really have a superstar personality. He keeps his head down and wins. He gets animated on the sideline but that came mostly later in his career, after winning was expected. If you look at how Goff plays - and what made me think he had some real potential coming out of college - he doesn't hang onto the ball too long. That's very Brady-like. Brady doesn't take sacks. He leads the league in throw-aways. Goff's up there on those, too. The biggest knock on Goff has been his propensity to fumble and his lack of savviness at calling audibles based on defensive reads. The audibles come with time and experience - he's already getting better at this and has made some huge strides this year. He's also had fewer fumbles this year - 5 of 7 he couldn't recover. In his 2018 season, he fumbled 12 times, recovering 3. Strip sacks happen, as do bad snaps; I don't know what the league average for lost QB fumbles are off the top of my head but I'd be willing to bet 5 is either at or below it. 

You have to remember that exposure comes with success. Goff hasn't had a lot of that. Most NFL fans experience with Goff was watching him struggle against the world beating 2018 Patriots defense. Casuals don't understand that this was a quarterback who took his team to a Super Bowl on his third year in the league. Quarterbacks at that point do not have the veteran experience to call audibles. The Lions were shut out by the Patriots this year, so Belichick seems to have Goff's number just yet. Even with all their injuries, a shutout is a shutout. He needs to get better at reading defenses and understanding disguises. Again, that will come with time. I said back then that Stafford was the better quarterback, and he was. He still is, when healthy. But Goff could match Stafford in production here, provided he develops the way Stafford developed. There was a time when Stafford didn't perform well under pressure and couldn't read defenses as well. He also tried to play hero ball, threw some ugly interceptions and ate a lot of sacks he shouldn't have. He still does this. Every QB has their strength and weakness. Stafford is more Mahomes like, where as Goff is more Brady like. Brady and Mahomes were both able to find the perfect balance and maximize their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. That's what seperates them. 

Goff will likely never be as good as Brady, but he could achieve his own version of Brady's success.",1.0,detroitlions,t3_108aa0b,False,0.0,90s logo,2023-01-10T14:22:35Z,detroitlions,0.0192481117253104
