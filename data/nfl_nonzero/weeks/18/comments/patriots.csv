15260,137036,137036,Pain_Monster,"Brady stuck with Bill because they were winning. There’s no doubt that he was happy with the SuperBowls, etc. But towards the end in 2018-2019 it was evident that Brady (who was doing shorter term contracts) was looking to move on to a team that already had more offensive weapons in place.

Defense is great and it can help you win titles but it doesn’t block for you on the O-Line or get open downfield when you have time in the pocket but no one to throw to. Brady started to fear that Bills defensive team was fading and he didn’t want to stick around through a rebuild.

My guess is that he probably saw what Peyton Manning did with Denver and figured he should leave and continue his legacy with a better team for the last bit of his career. He knew that time was ticking and TB already had a great O-line and top WR crew. Plus he knew he could convince Gronk to go with him, so it was a combination of factors.

Ultimately what it came down to was timing, slow decline of a patriots roster that could no longer be a super bowl contender, and Tom’s belief that he could still perform at a high level, but needed to be elsewhere in order to do that effectively.

So pathetic. Whether it was spygate, deflategate, or anything-gate, no one ever wanted to give them credit for being good. Hey, here’s a strange thought: maybe the success wasn’t due to cheating (like the [Falcons did by pumping in crowd noise](https://www.nfl.com/news/atlanta-falcons-lose-2016-pick-for-pumping-fake-noise-0ap3000000482500), or the [Browns did when they sent texts from the box to the coaches on the field in-game](https://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-browns/post/_/id/11811/former-gms-texting-to-team-breaks-nfl-code) ) but rather due to having the Greatest QB of all time.

TL;DR: More attention and ire was drawn from taping from a specific angle and the god damn pressure of a football than was for legitimately making it impossible for the opposing team from hearing a playcall in-game or from actively cheating via electronic communications in-game.

15271,137054,137054,Pain_Monster,"So I’ve been thinking about this since Brady left and I have come to the conclusion that he was gonna walk no matter what they did.

It’s no secret that Brady and Bill had some tension between them with the Alex G stuff and Brady was obviously not happy with the lack of weapons around him towards the end. (I mean, neither were we).

He probably looked at 2007 when they went out and bought two of the best WRs for him and he showed them what he could do with actual firepower. Set records and went undefeated. That’s all.

He was constantly taking pay cuts, restructuring his contract, taking “team-friendly” deals and he thought this would help make the team better and improve his chances to win. But 2019 was the final straw that broke the camels back.

He was fed up with Bill who was basically using Brady as the OC on the field so he could improve the defense by drafting and coaching those guys. Bill has always been a defense-first coach. Brady felt used and disrespected.

He knew he could win on other teams because all he needs are star WRs, which were there at TB. Brady decided that it was time to separate himself from Bill and prove to himself and to the world that he didn’t need Bill to succeed. He believes in himself that much.

When 2019 came to a close with that pick-six, I could see it in Brady’s eyes he was already checked out, already in Tampa Bay in his mind (or on whatever team he was fantasizing about at the time). He was moving on, and he likely made up his mind earlier in the year.

Nothing we could have done would have brought him back to NE for another year. No amount of money, or new weapons, he just wanted a clean break, and wanted to turn the page. I think that the Patriots org knew this and also was the reason they gave him a decent but by no means fantastic offer to stay. It was just superficial, not expecting anything from him.

It’s sad, because this was years of built-up frustration that came to a head. To prevent it, Bill would have had to have been much more flexible and cater to Brady for many years, but then we have to ask ourselves would have won the last three SuperBowls if he did?

We got Cooks for first and third but traded him after his 5th year option (1 season) to Houston for further compensation. He was cheap and good.

Hopkins is injury prone and expected to secure 19ish - 14ish million over the next 2 seasons.

Others are WR thirsty as well, and the free agency is littered with WR2s rather than a true WR1. 

My answer: It depends on the asking price in terms of draft capital. I'd say he is worth a second rounder. I'd suggest 1st but the injuries scare me, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone else gambles on that and coughs it over. On the other hand, he really wants to leave which somewhat limits Arizona's bargaining chips.

15665,139254,139254,Perswayable,"Oof, being late to rehab appointments is frustrating. I'm an occupational therapy practitioner.  If a patient is repeatedly late to appointments, it really does limit their rehab potential. My job is to increase that range of motion, joint and muscle integrity, etc. This requires a minimum of 30 minutes for both safety and healing. There is also a VERY strong correlation in my anecdotal experience that persons often not prioritizing their rehab appointments are less likely to follow in-home exercises/stretching/treatments. It's more than just ""arriving late."" The medical field, especially rehab, is much more holistic than it used to be, and a therapist normally will do everything in their power to meet your scheduling needs. 

In many cases, there is a difference between function and normal. Ex: A patient is 65 and fractures their humerus. The surgeon rules them as not suited for surgical intervention due to medical hx. Therefore, their arm range of motion may never be ""normal,"" but is it ""functional"" enough to reach overhead to put a shirt on? This gives us a lot of flexibility for outcomes. But in athletics, it's a completely different burden. We are looking for normal, and this requires an incredible amount of due diligence, and if this is neglected, especially in high impact sports, it is damaging and career-ending.

As we all know, he had one of the greatest playoff runs in NFL history in 2012 and his team needed every bit of it. He was much more than a game manager in those playoffs. During those 4 games he truly was “elite”

That playoff run almost overshadows how clutch he was in other years. He was up by 14 against the patriots TWICE in 2014. He played great in the game and they would have won (and likely gone to the Super Bowl) had Tom Brady and the patriots offense not had a historic day. I honestly don’t think that Flacco gets enough credit for his early-mid career success.

For a league where ~67% of the players are black, to not see anything remotely close to that diversity in the coaching landscape seems to be skewed a certain way. Could compare NBA as something similar, where 70% of the players are black, and something like 50-60% of coaches are Black as well.

This is the upcoming CB FA class, I don’t see many suitable replacements that would be upgrades. Feel like the draft is going to be a way better place to target a CB this year.

Marcus Peters is on the FA list at 6’0 so he could be a good target. He should have a couple of suitors though so no guarantees Bill would even get him.

Cause guess what? Every team now has a full year of tape on Mac at the pro level. They know all of his weaknesses. Sophomore year is very much a sink or swim year and the majority of QBs regress or stay right around the same.

The goal of these charts are to pick out the most 'efficient' performances - the fewest rushes needed to gain the most yards; the most completions out of the fewest attempts; and here, the most receiving yards on the fewest targets (green) vs. the fewest receiving yards on the most targets (purple).

No player lies above the green line here because it represents the Pareto front - the optimal/extreme combinations of receiving yards and targets. On the Pareto front, you can't get more of one without adding or sacrificing one of the other.
