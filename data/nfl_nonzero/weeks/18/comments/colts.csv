He was a player in the NFL from 2005-2014. Was primarily on special teams and made a name for himself there as a two time special teams captain with the Browns. 

Was on Patriots coaching staff from 2015-2017 and had the respect of Bill Belichick even when he played for them. He came with McDaniels in 2018 and stayed after he backed out and went back to the Patriots. Has been lighting it up with us ever since then.

My go to with this is the 2018 draft where the top QBs were ranked as following: Rosen > Darnold > Mayfield > Jackson > Allen 

Rosen was traded after his rookie season and is currently on his 7th team since 2018

Darnold flamed out with the Jets and isn't doing much better with the Panthers currently. Panthers are looking to move on by drafting a new QB. 

Mayfield did well enough with the Browns (first playoff appearance in 20 years) but was sent to the Panthers where he backed up Darnold until he was released. Then he turned it around on the Rams for a bit. He's currently a free agent though 

Lamar has been the best thing to come to the Ravens in a long time. One of the best QBs of this generation imo. The biggest issue is will the Ravens pay him what he wants or will he walk? 

Allen was largely considered a bust by everyone pre-draft and didn't really break out until 2020 but when he did, he became associated as one of the best QBs of this generation along with Jackson.",6.0,colts,t3_108t7dl,False,0.0,Andrew Luck,2023-01-11T04:08:14Z,colts,0.07752183719853

With OSU, everything comes from the sideline. They make his adjustments, tell him where to go with his reads, and so on. This is also the big knock on OSU QB's.

You didn't get this kind of speculation about Josh Allen when he was fucking *awful* for his rookie year.

It's a bad, bad habit of ""sports journalists"" to go down this road.

EDIT: To make it clear for people who don't understand... I'm talking about mobile QBs and how they are almost always derided as ""running backs"" and should the franchise move on from them by the media and others.  It's why I mentioned someone like Josh Allen who was more of a threat running than passing his first year, but we never heard the ""should be a running back"" moniker applied to him.  This is not saying he didn't face criticism for his play, he did.

15465,115075,115075,RelentlessRogue,"I'm more fed up with Irsay than Ballard. Sure, this past season has reflected poorly on Ballard, but Irsay is the man to blame for it all.

Starting with the ""get that sonofabitch out of here"" comments about Carson Wentz. I'm not saying Wentz was the long-term answer at quarterback, but trading your only QB with starting experience, with no plan to fill that position, at the whim of the owner, is a bad look, and double so after trading for that QB the previous offseason and only missing playoffs by 1 game.

[That, in turn, make our free agency period, quite frankly, non-existent. One of the few things Madden has gotten right in recent years is that most players are hesitant to sign with a team that doesn't have a franchise, or at least a starting, quarterback.](https://coltswire.usatoday.com/gallery/indianapolis-colts-free-agents-signed-offseason-2022/)  The only noteworthy player on this list is Gilmore, and he signed after we traded for Matt Ryan.

The same Matt Ryan that, while it seemed a stroke of good luck at the time, was really the only option the Colts had at QB while still trying to go ""ALL CHIPS IN"" on Irsay's 2 Championships in the 2020's claim. And while some people tried to convince us that we were getting an MVP caliber player for a 3rd round pick, Matt Ryan's been slowly declining for several seasons now. The writing was on the wall, but Irsay told us not to read it.

It was Irsay, not Ballard, who fired Frank Reich. It was Irsay, not Ballard, who hired an ESPN analyst with zero coaching experience, to be the interim HC. The same HC who was the first in history to lead their team to a worse record than they had under the person they replaced.

And now, we're picking 4th in the draft. Drafting, the thing that Ballard has done best in his tenure. The same Chris Ballard who's drafted:

* Rodney Thomas II
* Jelani Woods
* Alec Pierce
* Kwity Paye
* Dayo Odeyingbo
* Julian Blackmon
* Michael Pittman Jr
* Jonathan Taylor
* Bobby Okereke
* Paris Campbell
* Zaire Franklin
* Quenton Nelson
* Braden Smith
* Grover Stewart
* Shaquille Leonard
* Isaiah Rodgers Sr.

Among all of the other talented UDFA's he's found in recent years.

Your example of Buffalo really doesn't fit, top 5 pick top 7 pick, it doesn't matter they were high enough in the draft to take him. We haven't been that high since 2018 when we had Luck.

Five years ago, we had built a team for a QB we suddenly no longer had, and then over the course of 5 years, we tried to plug and play a QB every single year to try to make one fit this ""a QB away"" team.

There might be outliers, like the Rams who bought their Super Bowl last year, but I would argue they sold the bank to acquire a QB that fit their offense, and they weren't searching for bargain bin sales on QB's. And look where they are now.

You have to build your team around the QB. We have to have a QB to know his strengths before we can do that. You don't build a west coast offense for a spread offense QB and vice versa.

32523,237953,237953,xxxxxxxxxtra,"I mean… Yes and no. If bets are too one sided Vegas will try to even it out by adjusting the line. But Vegas always wins. Even when they “lose” they win. Vegas bases odds on what will make them the most money, not what is likely to happen. Sometimes those two things just happen to correlate and sometimes they don’t. A great example is the TCU vs Baylor last year. The line opened up at TCU just came off of a massive win against Texas, holding them to record lows. Baylor had just BARELY put up 3 points against Kansas state. Yet, TCU was only favored by -2.5, a ludicrously low number for a top 5 ranked team against an unranked team. They did that because they knew people would bet huge amounts on TCU -2.5 and they did. And if you recall, TCU didn’t cover that game so everyone who took TCU -2.5 lost big. Some people would use that as evidence that CFB is rigged, which is valid. My theory is not so much that it’s rigged, but that Vegas has insiders everywhere and can manipulate the people into losing big money. Practically, what was likely to happen was TCU would destroy Baylor. The fact they only won by 1 point is a miracle. All that to say, yes, it absolutely could be that odds were too one sided. But Vegas rarely makes that mistake.",15.0,colts,t3_107wdi5,False,0.0,Lemme get uhhhhh Large Number 7,2023-01-10T00:07:09Z,colts,0.0220640020414439
