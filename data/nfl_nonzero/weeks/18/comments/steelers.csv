And if you‚Äôre talking about it being better to lose today since they weren‚Äôt making playoffs, I don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôd be better for the team, but if losing today drops us down 5 spots to draft, that‚Äôs 5 more players we are able to choose from.

People forget they were willing to give Leveon Bell a record contract for a RB and then a few year later spent a 1st on Najee who is a more traditional type of running back prospect.

Without an effective pass rush the CBs take a lot of abuse in Kirby's system.

If he falls to the Steelers they have to take him but there is one other player that i could see falling who i have ranked higher for them... Peter Skoronski could fill in at LG and be a day one stud at the weakest position on our offense currently. Its possible he moves to LT as time goes on or if there is an injury to Dan Moore but OL youth/depth is always a great indicator of a team having a solid future. Top end talent turns teams around just like we've seen from the Browns a few years ago and now the Lions. It's almost never a bad pick.

There is so much depth in this CB class im almost hoping they double dip and decide to wait until the 3rd round and take Deonte Banks (Maryland) and Riley Moss with a late pick as a ST guy with slot/nickel potential. He could go as early as the 4th round given he is expected to test very well at the combine but i feel like he will fall to the 6th or so.

9298,54622,54622,Dang026,"8.1/10 (for Comparison Bens rookie season was a 9.7/10 while Mason Rudolph's was around a 4.3/10) I would have him and Joe Burrow ranked very similarly although Joe's score would have been higher if he had not been injured.

This is mostly based on the potential talent level he flashes. I wasnt a huge KP guy during the draft process, I  really liked the fit if he was a late 2nd-3rd rounder back early in the college football season before he separated himself as QB1 in the draft and a bonafide 1st round pick, many saying he would go top 10...

All of that said I severely underestimated his pure arm talent and ability to move around/outside the pocket. Many Steeler fans would say Matt Canada is holding him back in terms of his production and winning but I actually think they work together schematically in some ways. KPs ability to move to his right and throw while on the run is very unique and i think Matt Canada has done a good job working that into the playbook likely by Kennys recommendation.

Hes just vocal enough but has the leadership qualities you want to see. He reminds me a bit of Justin Herbert or a less boastful Aaron Rogers and his arm talent may actually be more similar to Rogers than I would have expected during the draft process. If he gets a LG and Dan Moore can continue to develop i think he has a much better sophomore season both statistically and in terms of wins.",1.0,steelers,t3_104kwan,False,0.0,:primantis:Primanti Bro's,2023-01-06T22:02:39Z,steelers,0.1026037071764469

I have provided for all of you a handy chart illustrating the records of every single team the Steelers, Titans, Chiefs, Commanders, Browns and Colts played during the 2020 NFL regular season, in order for those of you who think I'm lying and intend to downvote this comment can do the math for yourselves...

**Steelers:** 13-3, 11-5, 11-5, 11-5, 11-5, 11-5, 11-5, 7-9, 6-10, 6-10, 5-11, 4-11-1, 4-11-1, 4-11-1, 4-12, 1-15.

**Chiefs:** 13-3, 12-4, 11-5, 11-5, 10-6, 8-8, 8-8, 7-9, 7-9, 7-9, 5-11, 5-11, 5-11, 4-12, 4-12, 2-14.

**Commanders:** 12-4, 12-4, 11-5, 11-5, 10-6, 8-8, 6-10, 6-10, 6-10, 6-10, 6-10, 5-11, 5-11, 4-11-1, 4-11-1, 4-11-1.

16239,100549,100549,ItsYourBoyD,"All of our starters on offense are back in 2023, so the good thing is there is nothing that inherently needs ‚Äúreplacing‚Äù, any talent added through either FA or the draft is just a net positive. I think you go out and sign a guard in FA, and we still need a slot receiver. Could end up being something like:

+ Ainias Smith, WR, Texas A&M - 4th round selection 

+ Nate Davis, OG, Titans - FA signing for 2 years/$22M backloaded for 2024 when they have more space. 

You get a cheap rookie option and can figure out the long term answer at #3 between Sims, Smith and Austin III. I‚Äôm not opposed to carrying 6 WRs, Austin can punt return and be the #4 guy off the bat, Boykin as a ST contributor at WR6. You also get a young guard with starting pedigree on the left side (similar to Daniels at RG this year).

Defensively, a lot of work needs to be done. Need Edmunds back. Probably need Sutton back. Ogunjobi as well. I believe both Spillane and Kazee would be due paydays too. CB, IDL, ILB and EDGE (depth) are all needs. Could go something like:

+ Joey Porter Jr, CB, Penn State - 1st round selection 

+ Noah Sewell, ILB, Oregon - 2nd round selection 

+ Siaki Ika, DT, Baylor - 2nd round selection 

+ Jacoby Windmon, EDGE, Michigan State - 6th round selection 

In this scenario, you have Sutton who can play inside along with Maulet, Porter Jr and Wallace can play outside, we‚Äôll see what they do with WJ III, and both Witherspoon and Pierre become solid depth pieces down the depth chart. Safety would be set with Minkah/Edmunds/Norwood/Kazee, so a solidified secondary.

ILB you would roll with Jack/Sewell/Spillane/Robinson. Edge would probably still be weak here unfortunately in terms of depth. Watt/Highsmith/Jones/Windmon

IDL can be pushed 1 more year down the road to continue loading up talent for the eventual Heyward replacement, or more depth should Heywards replacement already be on the roster and just needing someone to take over for Ogunjobi down the line. 2023 you‚Äôd roll with Heyward/Ogunjobi/Leal/Ika/Adams/Loudermilk.

Have a set defensive line with more talent/meat in the middle (hopefully), an improved ILB group (again, hopefully lol), a better secondary, and similar depth to what we had this year in terms of edge, honestly probably a little bit worse but we don‚Äôt have a ton of cap space to sign anybody impact, nor can afford to spend a day 1/2 pick on a rotational piece, with other needs.

If we can somehow afford/effectively replace all of the depth/ST pieces like: Pierre, Hassenauer, Snell, Jamir Jones and Boykin, as well as guys who play more regularly/start like: Gentry, Kazee, Edmunds, Spillane, Sutton and Ogunjobi, then this is going to be a flat out better football team next season.",6.0,steelers,t3_105evun,False,0.0,:SOTN1::SOTN2::SOTN3::SOTN4: Shut Out The Noise,2023-01-07T06:53:06Z,steelers,0.0465781820474427

- George- just an absolute freak. Makes the hard looks too simple. We got a good one here 

- Levi/Kazee- big picks to help change the game from these 2. Momentum shifts and we saw it there. 

- TJ/Cam- whew these Guys are monsters. Just a nightmare for an opposing OL that wreck the whole game. 

Bad:

- Dionate- 3 drops, one almost a fumble. Not a great game for 18, just needs to settle down and focus. 

- Mark Robinson- missed sack. Missed tackle. Went out of assignment and rushed deshaun which resulted in a first. 

- Redzone woes- they continue. Turnover. Penalties. Failure to convert. Gotta get this cleaned up for next year. 

- Refs- on both sides. Just absolutely terrible. 

Definitely wasn‚Äôt ready for the season to end but man I can‚Äôt help but feel excited for this team going forward. We have a lot of staples and strong building blocks. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs our own damn fault for the boneheaded losses that should have never happened. Hate asking for help to sneak in and this is why. The guys busted their ass all year so to see it end like this just sucks. 

So happy for Mike t to keep that streak alive tho. If you would have told me we would even be in this position week 18 I would call you crazy- what a strong strong job he did with this group. Lots more thoughts to come but we have our quarterback which was the biggest question mark we all had. Consider the Claypool trade a massive, massive win but now we have to act on it and stack this team.

But, us winning is all I really care about. Getting to 9 wins after starting 2-8 is such a huge victory for this squad. Hoping Kenny can out-shine Watson and keep Cleveland in their place.

Najee, it aint just calling the same plays. The passing game is too inefficient to be sustainable. The first year of Ben's career (where he played over half the season) under 7 yards per attempt: 2020. When Matt Canada showed up.

2020 = 6.3 ypa

2021 = 6.2 ypa

2022 = Pickett 6.2 ypa

Anything under 7 is poor. 3 years, different QBs,same poor results. That is not down to player execution. They had execution issues, like every team, from 2004-2018 and yet sub-7 ypa never happened. It is down to the design of the offense, the sample size is too large to account for anything else. Our passing game is going backwards, like a human evolving into a fish.

""He throws with staggering precision and timing, but he recognizes his own arm-strength constraints and is forced to shrink the field accordingly. ""

Listed under weaknesses:

""Below-average arm strength and average release quickness""

[Pickett](https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenny-pickett/32005049-4377-7233-6101-772adaebe15c):

  ""Pickett works with average anticipation but drives the ball with good velocity, which should help him shine in pre-draft passing drills.""

Listed under strengths:

 ""Velocity to stay ahead of closing coverage.""

Both Profiles were written by Lance Zierlein. Did he only say that because Pickett was a Steeler? Before he was even drafted? Urban Meyer said Burrow ""throws like a girl"" while he was at Ohio State and Burrow agreed with him.

Edmunds made huge strides in coverage in 2022, a major weakness in his game through his first four seasons. He is a truly freakish athlete and will be 25 years old throughout his entire sixth NFL season in 2023 after being selected No. 16 overall in the 2019 NFL Draft as the second-youngest player in the overall class.

Edmunds‚Äô 86.9 coverage grade in 2022 was the third-best mark among off-ball linebackers, and he forced an incompletion on 10.3% of targets into his coverage while allowing just four explosive receptions the entire season (0.9% of targets into his coverage, ninth among linebackers). Edmunds also missed just 6.5% of potential tackles, the lowest rate of his career and another huge sign of continued growth from a football intelligence and play recognition standpoint.¬†",13.0,steelers,t3_108krnl,False,0.0,:sc::c9::c0::sc: TJ Watt,2023-01-10T15:09:54Z,steelers,0.1006652241941015
