I do recognize that it was a total teardown and that those do typically take longer, my main concern with ""lack of progress"" is the lack of continuity so it *feels* like they aren't progressing when they obviously are doing so. It's a giant project to get the team turned around and I feel that some HC candidates may get worried about how long it will take and if ownership will have patience.

Obviously the organization tried to lessen that by hiring a stopgap coach to oversee the deconstruction period but circumstances caused them to have two, which, whether right or wrong, gives the franchise a bad reputation, with HC candidates thinking in the back of their minds ""if my first year is slow will they get rid of me too?"" It will take a candidate who is completely self-confident in themselves and their plan to succeed on the job, and despite all HCs needing to have confidence to perform the job, we are human so some will be more confident than others. I hope I better explained myself.",3.0,nfl,t3_109049h,False,0.0,:Cardinals: Cardinals,2023-01-11T08:59:34Z,azcardinals,0.1383062564300411
2604,21148,21148,BtownBrelooms,"Obviously I have some bias but this is my best attempt of being objective:


1) **Carolina**: This is the prime situation for a first year coach to make the playoffs right away due to how wide open the NFC South will be next year with Tom Brady presumably moving elsewhere. They have a promising o-line and a great WR1 in DJ Moore as well as a solid, young defense. The only real downside is uncertainty at the QB position but the new coach will basically get to choose their preferred guy from day 1 so the success of the QB is entirely in your control. This feels like an excellent spot for an ascending coordinator to make a HC debut and potentially lead the team forward for the next decade. 


2) **Denver**: It's hard to know exactly HOW bad Russell Wilson and the offense is after a nightmare season under Nathaniel Hackett but determining if it can be fixed determines how desirable this job is to HC candidates. The defense is loaded but you need to make sure you continue coaching to their strength since the DC will probably change. A lot of people point at the ownership's Walmart money as a plus but the NFL isn't like the NBA with luxury tax or the MLB with no salary cap so there really are no immediately noticable advantages (other than being able to back up guaranteed contracts, which could be enticing for attracting free agents but at the risk of setting new precedents and getting resentment from the other owners) to having super rich owners due to every team already forced to spend a specific amount on the roster. Also you're in the same division as Mahomes and Herbert so the path to the playoffs will be challenging. 


3) **Arizona**: I put this job in the middle because the franchise is at a bit of a crossroads. They have the ability to either try to contend short-term or long-term and how a potential HC sees the situation will determine how attractive the job is for taking. For example, if you're Sean Payton then the job is more attractive if the Cards are trying to contend now but less so (but not entirely unattractive) if they want to retool and get younger. If you're a rising coordinator (just for an example let's say Kellen Moore), the long-term approach makes it more attractive because you can take your time implementing the type of team you want to run without the pressing need to ""win now"" while your trying to fix things. The NFC West is pretty tough but only the 49ers seem like long-term threats at the moment due to Sean McVay and Pete Carroll's potential retirement in the next few years. Also depends on your feelings and belief in Kyler Murray as regardless of what you think he is guaranteed to be the starting QB for the next few years at minimum. 


4) **Indianapolis**: The division definitely feels winnable at the moment but if Trevor Lawrence ultimately becomes what scouts expected him to be then your path becomes harder. Both the offense and defense have great pieces scattered among the roster but this isn't the same ""talented"" roster this used to be. There is also the fear of how much control a new HC would have in the forming of the team with GM Chris Ballard sticking around and Jim Irsay showing himself to be a very involved owner recently (I understand the potential hypocrisy I'm writing as Michael Bidwill seems to be just as involved but at least in Arizona you are coming in to build a new culture while with the Colts you will be forced to adapt to the pre-existing one). The QB position is also a complete mystery which could be a blessing or a curse depending on if they want to sign someone or draft someone to lead the team. 


5) **Houston**: On paper, this would actually be the most attractive job because it is completely moldable into whatever a HC candidate envisions for their team philosophy. Outside of Lawrence turning the Jaguars into the 2000s Colts, the division is fairly winnable. You'll have several picks from the Cleveland Browns as well as the second overall pick in a draft with two potential franchise QBs to choose from in Bryce Young and CJ Stroud. The elephant in the room though is the fact you'll be the third HC in three years. It's also concerning we are also entering year 3 of a franchise rebuild that has made very little progress (though Deshaun Watson holding them hostage last year definitely contributed to the stalled progress) and thus you can't help but feel nervous about your job security if this is the third straight year Houston is a bottom 5 team. That will be a tough task as while there are quite a few young and talented pieces in place, the number of holes that need to be fixed vastly outweighs the positives.",21.0,nfl,t3_109049h,False,0.0,:Cardinals: Cardinals,2023-01-11T06:36:44Z,azcardinals,0.0325251845089895

3928,41528,41528,DiddledByDad,"It’s more complicated than that, neither of them are bad players at all. Zaven’s playing time was all over the place last (his rookie) season and after suffering some injuries he was all but sidelined in the last chunk of the year. This year he’s been healthy and one of our most consistent pieces especially in coverage and that’s a huge compliment with how little consistency we’ve had in that position. I only expect him to get better. 

Isaiah has been the plug and play guy of our defense. True to his draft profile he’s played a ton of different positions. Safety, ILB, slot corner, rushing the passer a ton. He’s played 40% of his snaps this season at nickel corner and I suspect most of that is due to how spread thin we’ve been in our corner room. It’s hard to judge him because with how many injuries we’ve dealt with Vance hasn’t had a choice but to use him where we need him. Sometimes he’s a freak and makes monster athletic plays and other times he gets lost on the field. How much of that is due to Vance “misusing” him or him not getting consistent snaps in one position, I can’t say. 

He’s certainly lived up to the hype in explosiveness, you can count on him for a game winning play or two a season. But his football IQ needs a lot of work and it shows the rest of the time.",17.0,nfl,t3_105vyuq,False,0.0,:Cardinals: Cardinals,2023-01-07T17:46:41Z,azcardinals,0.0047281485780135

3930,41530,41530,DiddledByDad,"I’ve been extremely critical of VJ, more so than most in our sub, but to be fair, personnel has been a *gigantic* issue on the defensive side of the ball. 

On the edge you have the corpse of Markus Golden who’s been invisible all season, and a rotating mix of Dennis Gardeck and two mid round rookies. Our ends have been Watt and Allen both of which while really good have battled the injury bug. 

Middle of the field has been Zaven who’s been completely serviceable but this is only his first full season playing, Simmons who plays mostly slot CB and is super inconsistent, and a bunch of 2nd/3rd string type guys. 

Corners have been just as bad as well. Murphy is the best when he’s played but again, missed a lot of time. Marco Wilson has slowly but surely been improving and I think might lead the team in interceptions but he’s still pretty shaky and get beats a ton. Simmons plays a ton of slot CB as mentioned and does okay there. After those three, bunch of replaceable 3rd string type of guys. 

Safety is our best position currently with Budda and Jalen Thompson but it’s also easily the least important.

Zaven Collins is so fucking bad he got benched for a perennial special teamer in the playoffs last year and shared snaps again this year.

It’s honestly a miracle this team was even remotely mediocre for several seasons during his tenure. Imo it actually speaks well to Kliff and especially Bruce Arians. Even Kyler. Outside of Kyler, nearly the *entire team* is replacement-level players.

I think Kliff needed to go for several reasons, but it is hard to talk about his tenure without the huge asterisk tacked on to the roster.

This is not just anecdotal, either. PFF wrote an article analyzing teams’ drafting ability by looking at % of snaps played by players in their first 3 years in the league, iirc. Anyway, the Cardinals came up dead last in every single one of their draft analyses. Note that: this was analyzing players drafted from 2017-2019, which would be the three years right before Kliff coached his first season.

Feels bad about firing Kliff and wishes Steve the best. He says Kliff put in maximum effort and tried harder than any coach he'd seen. Regression was what caused him to make the change. He thinks he's a great person.

Would prefer to hire GM before coach, but will do the right thing. Already interviewed 2 internal and 1 external with more external this week. But later he said he was only confirming he had the 2 internal interviews.

He says he expects to interview and internal coach candidate(VJ). 

Talking to ""team leaders"" for input on what the team needs, along with people he respects in the league. 

Accelerator events in the past 2 years have allowed him to meet with up and coming GM candidates. 

Sounds like he doesn't think the past staff ""got the most"" out of players on the team and has heard input from ""team leaders"" that the culture needs fixed.

Thinks that the roster is good enough to be 1st in NFC West.
