I am not an expert in any field i just work with some. This is just to explain that I regularly read studies and often am lucky enough to have context on them and get to ask publishers or contributors to clarify points I come across.

The sentences I mention to be logical leaps are not necessarily wrong but not clearly backed by the data they've presented. They dont just go against a paper i prefer or find more convincing but would go against the current consensus opinions and overall body of work. They offer a reasonable premise for it and I would love to see data looking into it more (cte vs frontal lobe damage symptoms and the implication they dont overlap).

35996,234002,234002,mrmpls,"Stidham, drafted in 2019 and learning under Brady (for a year) and Belichick (for two), then bouncing around looking for a team before starting for the Raiders in his 4th year, throws for 365 yards against the 49ers (which *is* impressive), but with a supporting cast of Devante Adams, Darren Waller/Foster Moreau, Hunter Renfrow/Mack Hollins, and Josh Jacobs.

To compare him to the Raiders quarterbacks he beat for the record, let's throw out Daryle Lamonica, Ken Stabler, Tom Flores, Jim Plunkett, and Marc Wilson -- all of whom played before 1990. That leaves:

* Jeff Hostetler, '93-'96: similar situation, was on his second team, 8th year, he threw for 225 yards and 85% completion percentage in his first Raiders start, with receivers Greg Robinson, Steve Smith, Tyrone Montgomery, Ethan Horton, Tim Brown, Willie Gault, and Alexander Wright -- sorry, I don't follow football enough to know who these guys are. This was the 1st game of the season so there could be some rust.
* Rich Gannon, '99-'04: 13th year in the league, 4th team, 1st game of the season, Green Bay, 227 yards
* Derek Carr, '14-'22: 1st start, rookie,  151 yards, receivers were Darren McFadden and Maurice Jones-Drew, Rod Streader, James Jones, Myhal Rivera, Brian Leonhardt, Denarius Moore.
