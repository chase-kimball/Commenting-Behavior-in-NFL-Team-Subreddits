5130,31187,31187,CoopNine,"Agree.  Payton is Jimmy Johnson with fewer championships, and more baggage... ok... probably similar baggage, because Jimmy was also dirty as shit, but we forget about that, because it was just college... But, gotdamn, his college baggage is heavy, the only reason it wasn't damning was the NCAA was afraid to bring the hammer down on a major conference power.  

Does anyone actually think the Saints would be significantly better if Payton wouldn't have bolted?  Personally I think he saw what was in  front of him and cut bait so he could make sure he could get another payday before his stock was worthless.  Someone's going to hire him, and he might have some good luck finding a team with a shot, but I think this coaching trade will end up not having the quick payoff Gruden did, and definitely not the longevity of Belicheck.   

I do think he made Brees look better than he would have anywhere  else by playing towards his strengths, which is a good thing, but the idea he can fix any team is well... kinda like the idea that people had that the AFC West was going to have 4 teams that should be clearly be playing in the superbowl this year.  He ain't a magician, which I think it seems like it might take in AZ losing Watt and having Murray out probably most of the year, or in Denver to  salvage that trainwreck, while you have two established and young top-tier QBs in the division.    Honestly if you ask me, his best chance with a team with a current opening is probably Indy.  

To me this stinks of the fervor over guys like Johnson and Parcells, the latter of the two I actually think really highly of, but they both floundered after they left  the teams they built their reputation with and found  big hires  to fix teams, because they were getting beat up by the young kids, and weren't in as good of a situation as some of the old dogs.   Personally I think going with an experienced guy who was almost there, or a young guy with fresh ideas shot is the better option rather than giving a kings ransom for a guy who had some success in the past.   Granted, my team is probably the one that has most quickly and visibly been able to capitalize on the 'hot coach hire' but we also paid in 20 years of sucking afterwards (not all of which I will put on Gruden's shoulders, just a decade is all I blame him for).  

But... always keep in mind there have been coaches to take two different teams to the superbowl, no coach has ever won it with multiple teams yet.   So the idea of getting a coach who took (X) team to win the superbowl, will get us there, is unproven at this point.  I'm sure it will happen at some time, but it has failed when it was tried so far.  I think we have McCarthy and Pederson as potentially getting that first this year...

I agree we should go for it on 4th and less than 5 anywhere beyond midfield. But I get why coaches don‚Äôt. Media narrative will play a big role. If Bowles goes for it and fails and then the other team scores, he‚Äôll get more shit than if he punts and hopes for a stop. We‚Äôre still not to the point where media and writers just play the math. 

On top of all of that, we‚Äôre almost always in the scenario where our defense has played great.

The punts can be frustrating, but I will say that does fall into ‚Äúgame feel‚Äù and context. Yeah, you should probably go for it. And ‚Äútrust your defense‚Äù would suggest you go for it.

It uses proprietary nanotube technology to inject an entire lasagna directly into the athlete's ass. The method""s guide sells hundreds of copies on Amazon, but is banned in the NFL as the league classifies injectable lasagna as a PED.

Byron Leftwich is named head coach of the New Orleans Saints. In this role, he does more to help the Bucs beat the Saints than he ever did on our sideline. To replace him, Bowles hires an unknown diversity candidate named Juice Larians, who is a cartaur, half man, half golf cart. (Don't ask, they're distant relatives of those weird motorcycle centaurs in the commercials.) 

While Larians is cleaning out his office of Leftwich's stuff, he finds a strange painting of Tom Brady. He accidentally runs it over with his cart wheels, puncturing the canvas. 2000 miles away on the deck of their yacht, the ""Check This, Bill"", Tom Brady immediately dessicates into ashes in Gronk's arms.

Throughout the off-season, teams keep replacing backup quarterbacks, but everyone is talking about Kyle Trask taking over for the Bucs. Adam Schefter breaks the story in August that Trask has been eating mediocre quarterbacks to steal their power.

9726,64888,64888,JaedenStormes,"Bucs trade field goals with Dallas most of the game. Notably, Ryan Succop hits a career long 53 yarder when he kicks it low and the ball caroms off of Ryan Jensen's sweaty ass and ricochets into the uprights. 

Dak Prescott trips over the ghost of Lee Roy Selmon and tears his ACL in the second quarter. Both sides have one or two long drives for TDs with dink and dunk. Brady has a couple long balls to Evans. One catch.

3 minutes to go, we are down by 5. Brady drives the team down the field, aided by a DPI and a converted 4th down on a Brady sneak.

3rd and goal from the 22 after a Donovan Smith hold and a genius run up the middle for -2 yards on first down, Brady throws for Otton in the back of the end zone. Otton turns a split second too late to get his hands on it but the ball wedges in his face mask. Officials rule that he had control of his head, so the catch counts, touchdown, Bucs win. Dallas and Saints fans cry that Brady gets all the calls for the next 52 years.

Todd Bowles,.who ran out of quaaludes in the third quarter, starts breakdancing on the pirate ship. They fire the cannons. Julio Jones is startled, jumps back half a step, and tears both his hammies.

Jerry Jones, frustrated at his team's loss, makes a super racist comment at midfield to Bowles. Shannon Sharpe runs down out of the press box and pummels him with the corpse of Skip Bayless, who he strangled to death during the pregame after Tom Brady was late to the singing of the national anthem because Skip wouldn't let go of his dick long enough for him to get dressed.",11.0,buccaneers,t3_104e8bf,False,0.0,:buccobrucewhite: ,2023-01-06T00:48:06Z,buccaneers,-0.0576285141488479

Into Cowboys' minds?

Possible. Narratives fuck up the minds of most teams. Sometimes it motivates people, sometimes it has the opposite effect.

I have no doubt that Cowboys would start to get nervous if they go up by 2 scores, controling the game...and then we start creeping back up. For example.

For us? There's no narratives. The narrative is that we suck lol.

Eagles? They may also feel the pressure come the playoffs. Their fans are brutal. Vikings also have the narrative of ""chokers"" that they'll need  to get rid of in the playoffs. Potentially Aaron may need to exorcise the demons against 9ers too (in this case i think it might motivate him)

Idk, I made my prediction earlier this week in a thread.

I expect NOTHING to change. We'll start playing like shit, we'd be down by 2 scored and we'd need some last quarter mirracle to win.

I'd be very much surprised to see us play well for 4 quarters. I think we did that..like..what? Once? twice all season??

And in the playoffs...you can't just show up for a quarter or two and expect a W.

Cowboys are a legit good team.

Positive for us is that...they actually legit started playing like shit in the last month, so we are facing them at best possible time.

Last week they played just enough to beat the Titans backups (and even then they seemed kinda iffy)
