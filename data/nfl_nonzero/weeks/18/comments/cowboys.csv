It must be a bigger problem in other parts of the world. 

We run a small farm in west Texas and we don't really have a problem with corporatized farming, we do fine. California dairies moving in here buying up the ""cheap"" land is a bigger problem that corporate farms. 

Hell the largest farming customer in Oklahoma is just Braum's farms, more corporate farms basically nobody has a problem with at least where I'm from. 

Also 20 people investing in 100 acres is a pretty small investment from a farming perspective. I'd have figured they'd at least buy a quarter section (160) minimum but 104 acres is barely a field for a commodity crop like corn, these days a single individual can barely make a living on that. If they buy 4 more properties at 100 acres a pop these 20 investors still won't have even purchased a single section of land.
