5413,16898,16898,Bajin_Inui,"While fair, the problem is that you need to give him an environment that helps him to actually improve in areas that he is weak in.

We had a lot of cases where Oline held, Fields threw a good pass and it was dropped.

We had cases where the WRs mightve gotten open but Fields already had to dodge 2 people (and the issue often was also that it wasnt just one player giving up pressures but it was essentially random which one of the 5 would give up pressures)

And then obviously there are cases where he had a pocket and WRs were in place and he just missed throws.

I think a lot of the current general opinion on Fields, especially his throwing, is made by a lot of people looking at his stats as well as some of his earlier games in the year when he was in prime time.

Most Bears fans will tell you that there was a clear improvement in his processing. Multiple film breakdowns such as the QB School on Youtube or Trent Dilfer on Chicago sports radio had shown a lot of improvement especially after the minibye.

Look, Im not gonna pretend like Fields is a top5-10 QB already but we were scoring 30+ pts per game with the worst WR group in the league but quiet a bit and a decimated Oline that is below average at pass blocking at best even when healthy. Getting into a new rookie QB with what we had will more than likely just get us into the same situation where we have no help around a rookie QB and destroying his development",3.0,nfl,t3_108cdpe,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2023-01-10T14:46:23Z,chibears,-0.0875754773139953

I think a lot of of this disconnect comes from those stats. If the OL was average or above average in passing like those stats would suggest, most people would not be looking for 3+ changes to what we currently have.

Worst receiver corps BY FAR, probably the worst pass blocking o-line in the league, and a defense that allowed over 30+ PPG.

Popular and predominant opinions on this sub the last few years
- people saying we gave up way too much for fields and calling him bustin fields after just week 2 despite the lack of talent around, and then he still becomes him and puts the league on notice
- people being mad we didn’t give Jordan Howard an extension, and now he’s basically out of the league
- people being mad we didn’t extend Arob before the 2021 season started, and then his effort level fell off a cliff (and sucks ass this year)
- people wanting Robert Quinn cut after his first year, and then he gets the franchise sack record the next year without hicks or Mack for most of it
- people being pissed we didn’t convince Seattle to give up Wilson, which would have fucked our franchise for a long time. I saw people straight up say they were done being a bears fan for this one lol 
- “Claypool is a waste of a pick” 

Point is, What I’ve learned about this sub is that most of the time we don’t know shit and have zero actual insight into how a player has been developing lol how about we let the situation materialize a bit more, acknowledge the given circumstances that might have gotten in the way, and let the development happen just a little bit.

He never developed a QB, his offenses never figured it out, and his defenses never controlled games like the Tampa 2 did in the mid-late 2000s. He never adapted to the modern NFL

Goes to Illinois and basically has a victory lap. He is supposed to control the Chicago recruiting because he is a hero here… doesn’t.

Never controlled Chicago recruiting, which he was hired to do, and only got good players from 1 hs in st louis for hiring their coach as an assistant. Never felt like he put in the real effort to recruit, which is whatever. But yes - Illinois is Illinois lol

2012 sucked because it felt like Lovie was losing the culture he built in the 2000s and, agreed, the team needed to be blown up. Unfortunately (blame mccaskeys and ted) Emery was hired to win now, which is why he immediately reloaded w/ marty bennett + Brandon Marshall

Emery was looking for an excuse to get rid of him and get an offensive guy. Cutting him for missing the playoffs at 10-6 is a tough one to swallow.

But when it happened, it wasn't a huge shock. 2 disappointing seasons after the NFC champ game made it feel like the window was closing and something needed to change.

Worst part is that his defense was aging and not top tier anymore. The Tampa 2 - in lovies form - had been figured out.

13815,68038,68038,Falt_ssb,"OT and Guard free agency is awful.... O well 

DT - Payne, dremont jones, hargrave all good options. Probably preferred in that order. Maybe DeBuck is available too? I like Ionnadis as a rotational dude. 

Edge - I wonder what davenports market is. Theres ngakoue too. Regardless they'll need to draft an EDGE 1 if they want one, these dudes are all secondary edge rushers ideally. Gipson and Robinson should be able to stay as rotation pieces. I'd take bobby back too!


LB - I mean this has walker and/or okereke written all over it no? Edmunds I wouldn't mind either but won't be cheap. Germaine Pratt would be an awesome signing

S - Only putting this here if they think Eddie's medical is bad and they want to replace him with Bates. That's as good of a replacement as you can get.

CB - I'd like one of bradberry, Jones or the like. Just one good outside corner. Might be too big an ask tho 


WR - keep your eyes on Meyers, we have no good slot option. For X/Z to happen it'd be in the draft. Y could happen there too (jsn is perfect)

TE - tonyan is a good pickup as a TE2 who can play in line. All they really need, also obviously another packer

RB - don't rly care what they do here probably just bring David back anyways

Ok it gets ugly here

RT - lot of overrated dudes hitting the market here. Lots of guys I want to stay away from (mcgary still can't pass set, and I don't even want to get into Orlando brown). Wouldn't surprise me at all if they went njiman. That would still suck! But I am expecting it. He's playable at least

LG - I'd rather just rework Cody's deal. Dalton risner is a free agent pickup I could live with

Center - good options here actually. Bradbury is the headliner and would be awesome, he's improved a ton. Bozeman, quessenberry, pocic are all good options too.",14.0,chibears,t3_1094b63,False,0.0,White Sox,2023-01-11T07:57:29Z,chibears,0.0174485939433145

- 2012 - RG3 Offensive rookie of the year over Luck who was the best QB prospectin over a decade, career sadly derailed by injuries.

- 2016 Jared Goff made back to back pro bowls in his rookie deal taking his team to a Superbowl during that time.  Got signed to a massive extension, eventually traded and current team is very happy with him at QB.  Rams don't have a super bowl win without Goff in my opinion even though he was traded.  

- 2016 part 2, near MVP who also was a big part leading his team to a super bowl, got injured, signed big deal, was traded for another 1st and then 3rd.  Eagles don't have a Superbowl without Wentz.  

- 2017 I don't feel is anywhere close to the other trades.  

- 2021 injured so far.  Still could be a multi MVP player.  

So overall you have 2 teams who made a super bowl during those players rookie deals, another QB who outperformed the best QB prospect in a decade, the one and only NVP, and Lance who hasn't played yet really.  

The 3 most recent big trade ups were from front offices in the Rams who made 2 super bowls, eagles who won one, and are a favorite this year, and SF who went to another super bowl and is a favorite this year.  Same GMs made these moves because they understand the importance of the QB position .

A big part of the below is I think all 3 GMs are on the hotseat entering next year.  Lack of qb talent last year in the draft I think adds to the bidding as well.  It's also extremely rare the #1 pick becomes available with a good QB class.  There's no Lawrence, but from everything I've seen most have 3 top 10 QBs who are completely different prospects. Meaning they may hate 1 guy and only feel comfortable drafting the other, so they can't sit and wait.  

Here's the 3 teams I think get into a bidding war.

-Pick 2 Texans.  The only reason Texans shouldn't trade up is if they love 2 QB options.  If not, can you imagine them letting a division rival in the colts trade up and dominate them the next decade. Texans don't want to watch a #1 pick QB go to the colts again.  

-Pick 4 Colts.  Similar mindset of the Texans, but with aot less picks. The Colts have a lot of good players in a weak division.  They don't expect to be this bigh again and this Is Ballards last shot on QB.  I don't think he can sit and be patient at 4 and let whatever option come to him.  Colts need a homerun HC hire and QB drafted to revitalize probably the 2 most dissapointing years in recent franchise history.  

- Pick 9 Panthers.  They have a lot of extra picks from the CMC trade and a lot of solid young pieces on defense they weren't willing to move at the deadline.  They could take. QB at pick 1 and if he hits dominate a weak division that is the NFC south with Brady likely gone.

What are these good moves?

Drafting one of the worst corners in the league and passing on pickens twice? Every wr he acquired are terrible additions. 320 yards from st brown. 226 from pettis. 111 yards for #33 overall Claypool. Velus fumbles jr, another colossal wiff in his draft. At least nkeal Harry only cost a 7th for his 109 yards. 49 of which was on one catch

Was it drafting one of the worst pass blocking tackles in the league? Failing to sign a single lineman who improved from nagys ""no scheme"" when all off season scheme alone was going to fix all our problems magically?  Patrick, terrible. Leatherwood, terrible. Reiff, terrible. Schofield, terrible. Mustipher still employed. Meanwhile Daniel's had a very solid year  James daniels cap hit, 4.16.mil. Lucas Patrick, 5Pettis. James daniels 19 pressures on 650 snaps. Patrick 16 on 150. What an offensive lineman guru.

And that line would be even worse if Larry didn't fail his physical and free up cap. As we wasted time pursuing a 3 tech instead of doing anything to help fields at all.

But we're going to praise him because he traded mack early in the off season coming off injury at his lowest value? Held on to Quinn coming off the sack record until he showed he couldn't do anything to trade him at his lowest, and traded roquan after a public spat insured he couldn't be re-signed? The dumbest person on this sub could have ""done a good job"" if that's our standard. 

Terrible draft. Terrible free agents. Terrible trades. And this is who determines if the next 5 years are going to be more of the last 20 yeaes or actually turning into a team that can win in the playoffs without playing a 7-9 team or not.

We aren't competing for the #1 seed because of some master plan. We're competing for the #1 seed because the only positive move poles made from nagy and pace is Drafting a safety. That should be setting off red flags left and right, but you think losing 2 aging edge rushers and an off ball linebacker is a bigger loss then the gain of losing nagy and we couldn't possibly win games.

The offensive line is poles failures. The wrs are poles failures.

1. This is JF1s team. I’m not sure if the FO was sold on him before, but trading defensive talent and trading for offensive talent was a huge signal re: the future of the franchise. The build is around Fields. And this off-season will be about that. 

2. Poles is taking a long-term approach. Claypool is young and physically talented. More importantly, he was better and cheaper than any FA WR you’d get this off-season. Poles saw that the cupboard was bare, and took proactive steps. Did he overpay? Probably, but you overpay in draft capital or you overpay a lesser WR in free agency. Scarcity and all that—the demand for WR talent is way higher than the supply in the NFL right now, so you overpay.

49855,314024,314024,patrick_e,"I think you just want to argue which is fine, but I’m not really interested in that, so I’ll say this and then disengage: 

Johnson and Harris had great seasons because they play different roles on the team. And by great I mean volume great, not necessarily efficiency great. My kid is a Steelers fan (via his mom) and I watch a lot of Steelers football. Those were the short game dump off guys who got a ton of volume because Ben couldn’t throw the ball anymore. Ben didn’t have the arm to take advantage of Claypool’s greatest strength, which (I suspect) mixed with a contentious relationship (at least evidenced by Claypool’s pouting) and probably a sketchy understanding of the playbook essentially took Claypool out of the offense. One small caveat, Ben ran the offense in 2021 based on what he could do, not necessarily what Canada ideally would have dialed up, at least from my observation and what I’ve read. So I don’t know if Claypool is really to blame. Probably. But also Ben leaned on dumpoffs which aren’t scheme dependent, audibles and improvising. They weren’t really running an offense per se, so it’s really, really hard to assess the Steelers in 2021. 

 I’m not saying anything that hasn’t been said by a hundred experts, but at the end of the day I’m just some dude on the internet. 

Look, Tomlin is a great coach. One of the best, HOFer in my book. I agree that the fact that Claypool couldn’t out it together under him is concerning. Very. 

Maybe he only has one trait (although height, speed, and agility are different traits) but his physical profile is absolutely top 1%. It’s him, Calvin Johnson, and Kyle Pitts. That’s it. It takes brains and brawn though (or a very good coach who can put a player in position to win despite himself) and I think it’s at best a coin flip if Claypool will get to…not Megatron level, but at least WR1 level. 

I think at the end of the day the biggest truth is that we just don’t know. There’s so much we don’t know about what happened behind closed doors. We do know he has potential but right now not 32 overall value. We do know a division rival wanted him for a 2nd rounder and the Bears had to outbid them. And we know that football people always have and always will fall in love with ceiling, and those types of players usually come with very low floors. 

I don’t think Claypool was necessarily the right move, but he’s better than anyone the Bears will be able to get in free agency, and a draft pick is at best a coin flip too. He got some extra time with Fields in 2022, but most importantly, it signaled that the Bears FO believed they have their QB1 and were ready to start building around him. Whatever else happens, the trade basically said, “Hey this is JF1’s team and we’re all-in now to get him all the help we can” and that’s important for the future of the franchise, and part of why Bears fans are excited about the trade even if it doesn’t totally pan out.",2.0,nfl,t3_108a5vc,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2023-01-10T11:50:57Z,chibears,0.0273833328437449

Disappointingly raw for a 3rd year receiver, calling himself a Cadillac and top 3 WR in the league makes me think he’s leaning on talent (which got him here) and isn’t putting in the work necessary to really unlock his talent at this level. 

Easy to fall in love with his potential though. Rare, rare athleticism, and tough situation (rookie season he looked good, then Ben’s corpse played a season and couldn’t push the ball, and I think Canada may be one of the worst OCs in the league and Trubisky isn’t really going to push the ball downfield). He’s a very polarizing player and for good reason. 

If I had to bet it’s hard to think he’ll suddenly become a top player in the league year 4+, but (allegedly) Fields and Mooney have indomitable work ethics; if that rubs off and he’s working with them and they’re pushing each other, his limit really is sky high. He’s the type of player where I think based on his profile, it’s up to him if he’s willing to work for it.

Fields still takes sacks at too high of a rate, but my guess is if you remove those “sacks” it isn’t as bad as everyone says where the sack rate is astronomically high.
