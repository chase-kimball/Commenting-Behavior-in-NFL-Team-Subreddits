- He ran a faceless sports(90% NFL) news aggregation account called ""My Sports Update""(which is why it's still his Twitter handle).

- He successfully avoided the major pitfall of other amateur aggregators: resending bad and false information. The account was usually extremely reliable.

- The account became super popular for the same reason Reddit and other aggregation sites did: why follow 100 different accounts when you can follow one and get the same information? The average sports news reader does not give a flying fuck who the info is coming from, as long as it's accurate(well, mostly accurate).

- His success caused PFF to reach out to him. They rebranded his account with his face and name, which is why it seems like he came out of nowhere. They just put his real identity to his already large, but anonymous, account.

- PFF has been working hard to make him PFF/The 33rd Team's equivalent to The NFL Network's Ian Rappoport or the ESPN' Adam Schefter.

So he's PFF's go-to ""insider""now.  He just hasn't been going at it as long as Schefter/Rappoport, so he won't break nearly as much news(fewer sources and relationships in the industry), but he absolutely has gotten information out there first since PFF has given him their resources.

My reaction was that they should have been more cautious and kept him out. Like I said, it's reasonable to believe that Tua was misdiagnosed. Obviously ""officially"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in the post above.

That said, I'm not so delusional to take my personal opinion as gospel over the diagnoses of medical professionals. Given the choice between doctors making determinations solely from broadcast TV recordings and opining on the internet and sports media to drum up outrage and views and doctors who have the same recordings and also actual examinations of the patient over several days, I'll generally take the word of the latter.",2.0,nfl,t3_107md44,False,1.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-01-09T15:33:51Z,miamidolphins,-0.0514625564178191
6262,45954,45954,Cidolfus,"I don't find it any less smug than those drawing medical conclusions based off of obviously concerning but limited video footage and presenting it as definitive. I'm not saying that there's no way that Tua had a concussion against the Bills (or that it's unreasonable to conclude that he probably did, and I do think he probably did); I'm saying that he was not diagnosed with one immediately following the incident, while he returned to play afterwards, or during any of the evaluations which followed over the next several days. The people who made that determination did so with much more evidence at their disposal, and I think it's awfully smug to accuse them of medical malpractice and organizational malfeasance as so many (not you specifically) do.

> If you don't think he had a concussion the first time, you have to at least acknowledge that it is a pretty outlandish coincidence that he had such a severe head injury immediately following that game that wasn't along the lines of a normal concussion.

Coincidence? Sure. Outlandish? I didn't think anyone would need reminding given recent events that football is a violent sport where any single hit, no matter how benign it may look, can have catastrophic consequences. It is *entirely possible* for a person to sustain a concussion of severity like that which Tua suffered against the Bengals without having prior head trauma. The way Tua's body was whipped to the ground (""Down he goes! Slung down!"" as the announcer exclaimed in real time) where his head is slammed back into the turf was itself entirely capable of causing that reaction on its own. It's anecdotal, but of the four diagnosed concussions I've had, by far the most severe was the first. A head-to-head collision chasing a loose ball in soccer knocked me unconscious and caused blurred vision, disorientation, and headaches with light sensitivity which persisted for days. It was far worse than the second one I received only barely a week later when I slipped into a metal pole; I was not a graceful teen.

I think it's easier to stomach Tua's injury against the Bengals if you can rationalize that it only happened due to negligence and find someone to blame rather than acknowledging what we all have so recently been so starkly reminded: terrible shit can happen on any play, and even a completely healthy player in their athletic prime can suffer a catastrophic and horrific injury at any moment. It's important to remember that there's no such thing as a ""normal"" concussion and that what looks like mild contact could be far worse than a gnarly head-on collision.",-2.0,nfl,t3_107md44,False,1.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-01-09T15:22:17Z,miamidolphins,-0.0353571037629694

Despite what internet doctors will insist, he was never diagnosed with a concussion by any of the multiple doctors who examined him over several days.

Obviously the way his head snapped back and he got up wobbly is plenty of cause for concern regardless, and it's reasonable to believe that he was misdiagnosed, but anyone insisting that Tua was concussed against the Bills is doing so based on their assumptions from limited video footage without actually examining him.",20.0,nfl,t3_107md44,False,1.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-01-09T13:12:12Z,miamidolphins,-0.075448828125

And Tunsil was traded but they were offered an insane return for him. Tunsil himself said, ""I'd trade me for that"" when he walked into the GMs office and saw the offer on the white board.

So yes, he did get them to 5-11 but he was THE reason for losing Minkah.

- The Minkah situation
- Jim Caldwell's mystery illness upon getting to know Flores
- How he treated Kenny stills
- Cutting any veteran with a voice or opinion
- Inability to develop players who went on to have decent years with other teams (including 3 O lineman just last season alone)
- How he treated Tua and Fitz
- Benching Tua in games
- Not letting Tua start against Baltimore even though he was dressed
- Tua's trainer saying Flores was impossible to communicate with
- Tua telling people on the sidelines he could play but placed on IR
- The weird co-offensive coordinators last year which turned into 4 different people calling plays
- Complete inability to assemble a competent offensive staff at all
- Being outcoached by Urban Meyer
- The worst judgement and record of red flag challenges I've ever seen
- How fucking awful they were during the 7 game losing streak last year
- Hiring 4 OL coaches in 3 years and still having what PFF called the worst unit they've ever graded
- Telling a coach to move his family to Florida for a job only to fire him after four days on the job. No reason given to him other than a ""a gut feeling""
- Beat writers saying he was very difficult
- Fan reporters saying he was really nasty to players at open practices.
- His halftime meltdown with Tua last year
- 2021 Tua/passing/o line production vs 2002

Keep in mind these aren't the things the FO allegedly leaked about not talking to coaches or being difficult to work with or demanding more power. I don't know if those things were true.

The things I've listed (and I could probably keep listing things) are all easily verifiable things that we as fans had been discussing at various points well before he was fired. But made excuses for them all because he was our guy.

Now let's look at all of Flores' wins. He beat a lot of shitty QBs and teams:

Team | Quarterback | Record | Playoff team?
---|---|----|----
Jets | Darnold | 7-9 | 
Colts | Hoyer | 7-9 |
Eagles | Wentz | 9-7 | yes
Bengals | Dalton | 2-14 |
Patriots | Brady | 12-4 | yes
Jaguars | Minshew | 1-15 | 
49ers | Beathard | 6-10 | 
Jets | Flacco | 2-14 | 
Rams | Goff | 10-6 | yes
Cardinals | Murray | 8-8 | 
Chargers | Herbert (rookie) | 7-9 |
Jets | Darnold | 2-14 | 
Bengals | Allen | 4-11 | 
Patriots | Newton | 7-9 | 
Raiders | Carr | 8-8 |
Patriots | Jones (first start rookie) | 10-7 | yes
Texans | Taylor | 4-13 |
Ravens | Jackson | 8-9 |
Jets | Flacco | 4-13 | 
Panthers | Newton | 5-12 |

Giants | Glennon | 4-13 | 
Saints | Book (first start rookie) + Covid19 | 9-8 |
Patriots | Jones (rookie) | 10-7 | yes

Every decent QB he faced could pick apart his gimmick defense with ease.

The dude was not ready to be an NFL head coach and unless he fixes some glaring issues he has, he will continue to be a seemingly toxic person.

And while injuries do happen to every team, Grier has a history of taking guys known to be injury prone. Guys that will definitely miss time.

Let‚Äôs use another example of his incompetence. Where are our mid round draft picks this year? They BARELY played. With our weak ass LB corps Tindall couldn‚Äôt sniff the field. E is still riding pine behind guys like River Cracraft. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even debating with you because at the end of the day this team has won **nothing** despite having a ton of capital and cap opportunity and all your optimism and reasoning about whatever can‚Äôt refute that.

Bottom line: no division titles, as of now no playoff appearances, and even if we do sneak it this year I would bet my mortgage we ain‚Äôt winning shit.

Fans need to realize we are fucking stuck right now. We need to extend Wilkins **this offseason** so his price tag doesn't increase anymore. That's about the only big move that we should make. Maybe try and get Shell on a decent contract.

On top of that many of our acquisitions under Grier have been players who can't stay on the field. It's a trend at this point.

Tua - constantly injured, known injury history

Jones - Missed a whole season and has been sandbagging it

Chubb - Already missing games, known injury history

Armstead - Known injury risk who has lived up to that

Also add up all the mid level FAs that just don't fit the team/have been cut for dead cap. He's a waster of resources.

The Tunsil trade and the Hill trade have buoyed his career here. Unfortunately because he had this wealth of draft picks, he's had no discipline in using them. He's blown through that draft capital like a guy who won the lotto.

His inability to scout offensive lineman and not standing up to Flores and taking players like Igbinwhatever and Davis (another no show) trading capital for Josh fucking Rosen.
