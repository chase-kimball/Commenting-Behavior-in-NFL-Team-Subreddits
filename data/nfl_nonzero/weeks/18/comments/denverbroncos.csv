20781,117779,117779,Welcome2Broncoland,">According to The Athletic’s Mike Sando in his Pick 6 piece, he has heard from people close to Jim Harbaugh that he just simply wants back in the NFL. One source also told him that Harbaugh, who will interview virtually for the Broncos job sometime this week will “flat go to Denver” if he is offered the job.

>“He will flat go to Denver,” a former Harbaugh associate predicted, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “He is not thinking about any of that stuff. He will just go take it, in my opinion. He thought he was going to get the Vikings job last year and it didn’t happen.”

>Sando spoke with an assistant to Harbaugh who admires the Broncos coaching candidate and explained what makes him different from other coaches.

>“He is worried about capturing an edge with the way you travel, having players over to his house, throwing and catching with his quarterbacks, all those things,” the former Harbaugh assistant said. “He is as good as his staff is, and guess what? He believes in them. He is counting on you. He has empowered you. He is intense. He is going into battle with you. He is leading the way. That is why he goes after Vic Fangio to be his defensive coordinator.”

>As for a potential offensive coordinator under Harbaugh, coaches and executives in the league believe Harbaugh may reunite with his former offensive coordinator with the 49ers, Greg Roman. He has been the offensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens under his brother John Harbaugh, and people believe he will allow him to leave as the Ravens would like to potentially change things up.

>“Yeah, I think John (Harbaugh) would cooperate and Jim could get Greg Roman,” a former head coach said. “I think they are ready for Roman to leave. And then John will find out that he was pretty good. If you want to just run the ball, like I’m sure John wants to do, you can’t get a better guy.”",43.0,denverbroncos,t3_107oo5w,False,0.0,Rod Smith,2023-01-09T14:16:58Z,denverbroncos,0.0413870300227367

>Sources say the Broncos also have requested and received permission to interview Sean Payton, who remains under contract with the Saints and would need to be acquired in a trade. Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn is also expected to be among the top targets for the Broncos, who have said they intend to interview their DC, Ejiro Evero, as well.

>There are connections in Denver for Harbaugh. Condoleezza Rice, a member of the Broncos' ownership group and search committee, has deep ties to Stanford University, where Harbaugh coached before his first NFL stint. Greg Penner, the Broncos' co-owner and CEO, got his MBA from Stanford.

…

>Harbaugh also had a brief conversation with the Panthers that didn't amount to anything. It's possible he could also emerge as a candidate with the Colts, with whom he played four seasons (1994-97) and earned a spot in their Ring of Honor.

>While Harbaugh is listening to NFL teams, those close to him consistently speak of his love for Michigan and how much that job still means to him.

>One source described talks between the Broncos and Saints to Rapoport as an initial conversation, and the two sides are expected to continue that conversation. Rapoport noted that for the Saints to permit a team to interview Payton, they would need to know that club was prepared to meet their asking price in a trade.

>Pelissero and Rapoport reported on Jan. 1 that Payton was expected to be a top target of Denver's, along with Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh and Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn.

So if the Broncos wanted to wear new uniforms in 2023, they would've had to have informed the NFL of their intent to change uniforms by March 1st, 2022. They would then have had to gotten league approval by December 1st 2022.

The league does allow for extenuating circumstances as decided by  the commissioner. Washington dropping their nickname/logo and going with ""Football Team"" was excused, for example. I've always read (though I can't pinpoint where) that an exception would be made for new ownership as well.
