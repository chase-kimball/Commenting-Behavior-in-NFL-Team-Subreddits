5301,40230,40230,ChevalMalFet,"Because lots of y'all don't seem to know this:

The league/Goodell/Carl Cheffers does not make the schedule. The schedule is set by a publicly available algorithm every single year. That's why it's possible to know next year's schedule the day after the season ends.

Every team plays:

* Its three division opponents x2 (home and away)
* A rotating same-conference division once every three years (South -> East -> North for us)
* A rotating opposite-conference division once every four years (East-> West -> North -> South)
* The two same-place finishers from the two conference divisions you don't see (ie 1st place plays 1st place, etc)
* Added in 2021 the same-seeded team from the opposite conference. 

The result is every team gets 4 games against first place teams, 4 against second-place finishers, 4 against third, and 4 against fourth place finishers from the previous season...and then now a random extra game because the NFL fucked up *everything* with the 17th game. 

So, the Chiefs get:

* Raiders/Broncos/Chargers x2 for AFCW
* Bills/Jets/Pats/Dolphins for playing AFCE
* Bengals/Jags for same-place divisions
* Vikings/Packers/Lions/Bears for NFCN 
* Eagles for Game 17 (same seed)

Home and away is set on a rotating schedule, with teams taking turns (but not a yearly rotation, it's more complicated and I don't quite know it).

Some sanity is leaking in.

(To summarize: Once the game was called, the Chiefs had more wins than either the Bills or the Bengals. So what should the league have done?

* Declare a no-contest since the game was, in fact, not contested? That means the Chiefs have the highest winning percentage and are the one seed per the rules. 
* Declare a tie? See above.
* Bills forfeit, since their player was injured and they were unable to continue (or because Cincinnati was leading)? Chiefs one seed.
* Bengals forfeit? This would be the most grotesquely unfair of all - but this is the *only* outcome that led to Buffalo keeping the one seed.

5343,40278,40278,ChevalMalFet,"The only thing that irritates me about other fanbases in this debacle is acting like the rules change was some kind of handout to the Chiefs and we have no right to feel mistreated. 

Like, per the rules, the Chiefs had the one seed going into Monday night - because they won more games than the Bills or Bengals. The Bills *had to beat the Bengals* to get it and they didn't. Did Hamlin's injury suck? Of course! Should they have been expected to finish the game? Of course not! Buffalo got screwed hard by that series of events - but it was an *act of God*, not the NFL, that did it. The injury cost them the one seed, not any league decision.

Like, once the game was called - again, rightfully so - the Chiefs retained the one seed *per the rules.* Those rules were then *changed* specifically to benefit Buffalo and disadvantage the Chiefs (and screw the Bengals entirely). The one seed, which the Chiefs had rightfully earned by all the acknowledged rules of the NFL, was watered down because the Bills had suffered a gruesome injury. 

The trouble is, everyone is conflating two issues: the injury Monday night, and the rules change Friday. They act like the Friday ruling gave the Chiefs the one seed, when in actuality they had had it all week and Hamlin's injury stopped Buffalo from having the chance to take it. Which sucks, but is no one's fault. All the Friday rules change did was help Buffalo at the expense of the Bengals especially and the Chiefs a little bit.

5350,40287,40287,ChevalMalFet,"So, going into Monday night, the Chiefs had the one seed, but the Bills would take it with a win over the Bengals. Instead, as you are no doubt aware, there was a horrific injury early in the first quarter and the game was canceled. 

The league decided later this week to ignore its own seeding rules and force the AFCCG to be held at a ""neutral site"" if it's between any teams with an unequal number of games played that could plausibly have affected seeding. It also forces the Bengals, should they lose to the Ravens, to flip a coin for home field, as if they had lost to the Bills, and if they face the Bills in the playoffs, will be forced to travel to Buffalo. 

Bengals are upset because they get none of the benefits of winning their division, despite the rules saying they should have when the game was cancelled. Instead they get a harder schedule next year, no shot at the one seed, no shot at the *two* seed (had they beaten Buffalo Monday), and, of course, all of this done as part of a last minute change in the rules. 

The Bills are upset because the horrific injury cost them the chance to seize the one seed. 

Presumably, Ravens are upset because the horrific injury cost them the chance to win the division. 

And finally, Chiefs are upset because the NFL changed the rules at the last minute to take HFA away from them if they beat the Raiders, purely to help the Bills.

5378,40316,40316,ChevalMalFet,"So, after a night to think it over, here's where I'm at on the whole AFC debacle:

1)The Bills and Bengals organizations handled this about as well as they could have. To our knowledge, they didn't ask for special treatment from the NFL or anything like that, and most of their message has been focused on Hamlin's health. So they shouldn't be blamed for the mess.

2)That said, it IS unfair to change the rules of the playoffs at the last minute. ""The Bills had the 1 seed ripped away!"" No, they didn't - the *only* reason the Chiefs didn't already have the one seed, despite losing to the Bills, was that they played the Bengals, and lost, and the Bills did not. The Bills had to play the Bengals and *win* - performing where the Chiefs could not - to earn the one seed back. 

3)Injuries happen and affect the balance of games all the time. Note that I am *not* saying the teams should have sucked it up and played while Damar was being rushed to the hospital! Calling the game was the right, humane decision. What I *am* saying is that injuries that affect the outcomes of games are part of football, and outside this one instance no one has ever cried foul. When the Raiders lost Derek Carr in the closing weeks of 2016, and lost the division and had an early playoff exit because of it, was that unfair? It sucked for the Raiders, sure, but it *happens.* If Josh Allen had gone down with a concussion 8 minutes into the first quarter and the Bills lost because of it, would it have sucked? *Absolutely.* But the game still would have happened. So screwing with HFA over this is a bit unfair to the Chiefs.

4)But ultimately, whatever. We have to beat the Raiders anyway, which is no guarantee, and even IF we and the Bills win out and we meet in the AFCCG, we're better on the road in any case. I'm still counting it as Pat hosting 5 straight AFCCGs to start his career, if we are lucky enough to make it so far. So yeah, it's a little bit of favoritism to the Bills, the Bengals are *royally* screwed - losing the chance at the one seed that a Bills forfeit would have meant, losing the guarantee of a home playoff game that no contest should have resulted in, and instead getting a first place schedule next year without any of the benefits - but we're only mildly affected.

22110,150103,150103,Moose4KU,"He's completely right. The NFL has not ever changed rules during the season - we always hear it'll be addressed in the offseason. A rule exists for how to handle playoff seeding in the event that teams have varying number of games played. The rule states that winning percentage should be used.  There is no way to amend the rules mid-season without blatantly favoring one team over another,  so the best and cleanest solution is to follow the rules as agreed upon before the year.

The only argument to change the rules midyear is that you feel bad for the Bills or the Ravens.  In my opinion it's a bad precedent to set.

The NFL didn't change rules mid-season for the Fail Mary, the Holy Roller, Hurricane Katrina, the Tuck Rule, Javon Belchers murder suicide, etc. Yes what happened to Hamlin was likely traumatizing and I understand making the game a no contest.

All in all I'd say Townsend was far more efficient at putting his team in a better position and limiting opposing teams from have either good field position or a chance to have a return for good field position.

Just to add to this Stonehouse seems to be more of a line drive kicker that outkicks his coverage, had only a 4.31 hangtime (12th worse in the league)...  this is why his return yards are so high. Meanwhile, TT had the 2nd best punt hangtime of 4.7 seconds AND had the higher net yards per kick, which is why his return yards were so low.

1) After Joe Montana injures himself in 86, they trade for Steve Young in 87, who does reasonably well. Once Montana injures himself again in 91, Young takes over permanently and they eventually trade Joe Cool.

3) This year, with both Trey Lance and Jimmy G going down, you seem to find another quality starter in Brock Purdy.

Also, the rules already said they should go by winning%, which is why the owners had to vote to override the existing rules.

The ""go by winning%"" thing would have been far more agreeable had we gone into December knowing this is the situation. Because it's so close to the end of the season, it feels like the decision here is deciding the outcome of the regular season, wheras if there was a week-7 no contest, it wouldn't feel like a committee were the ones deciding things. But winning% really is letting the season play itself out, whether that no-contest happens in week-1 or week-18, it just FEELS different because of when it's happening.

I think if it happens early enough in the season you can make it up somehow, make it up. 

If you can't make it up, then it should either be No contest, or a tie, and then just go from there. 

All these discussions about who is getting screwed the most, or who benefits the most, would be irrelevant if we all just knew it was SOP that it goes NC/Tie and that's just how it goes. By making an ad-hoc plan on the fly, now you open up pandora's box for every future scenario, and now we're talking about why the league decided to screw the Bengals the most, or why they didn't modify the new plan with this new wrinkle or that wrinkle, why not 8 playoff teams, why not move the super bowl back a week, etc. 

And now we're dealing with this nonsense Bengals win division, but might not get a home playoff game...all part of some plan they made up on the fly...meanwhile the Bucs are going to be hosting a home playoff game against a team that's ~4 wins ahead of them, but that's fine?",9.0,nfl,t3_10546od,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2023-01-06T14:36:39Z,kansascitychiefs,0.1210879586762688

This second contract,  because all 32 teams can bid on them (they can choose where to go, they dont have to sign to the highest bidder), is usually much more lucrative than their first/rookie contract. When that second contract is up, they can do it again. 

Teams can also trade players (though players can negotiate a no-trade clause into their contract)

There are exceptions though. Each team gets one ""franchise tag"" they can use each year. It prevents one player whose contract ended from leaving, but they have to pay them a very high salary for that year (it's calculated based on other top contracts). Players don't like the tag because it prevents them from getting a multi-year, bigger contract. Sometimes they refuse to play or force a trade. 

But then there's the players who are not as good. They might be drafted but not make the team. Nfl teams are limited to 53 players. And with so many different positions to fill, there's  not room for a ton of backups. So players don't make the team, or ""get cut"". Plenty of guys who are drafted in the later rounds don't make the team. When cut/released they are available to other teams. And theres more complexity here, but they can go to the practice squad. Each team has a practice squad that's not part of the 53 man roster, and other teams can actually sign a player away and poach them from your practice squad. 

There's also players who are undrafted. They enter the draft, it goes through 7 rounds,  and some guys aren't picked. Once the draft ends, they become ""undrafted free agents"" and are free to sign with any team they want. Only a handful of such guys will make a final roster. Guys that are undrafted can choose a team close to home, or one where there is less competition at their position and a better chance at making the team.

But the bills don't have to play the game and just keep the 1? That's fair to you?

The h2h tiebreaker is part of the standings already. 

And both Bengals and bills get the benefit of rest from only playing a quarter of week 17, and then the bills would get the playoff bye too?

To me, the only solution is to either call it no contest or a tie and then handle it like normal from there. They need a standard operating procedure for this so if it happens again, we know what they would do. The SOP for future occurrences can't be an ad-hoc duct-taped together plan involving coin tosses and neutral sites and so on. It should be simple and applicable to future similar but not identical situations. 

And this is being made into a much more complicated cluster fuck because it's week 17 and feels like any decision is swinging the season. But imagine it's week 8 next year and something similar happens.
