6388,40068,40068,DarthLordDonkey,"There's a lot to dissect here, but I'll do my best. 

>He won't interview Harbaugh - the only proven winner out there

Look around the league at the successful HCs. How many of them were head coaches prior to where they are now? Just because someone has a history of winning doesn't mean they'll be successful and vice versa. I would support a Harbaugh hire, but the teams lack of interest could be for a variety of reasons. 

>Then they say it's a short list, and we have interviews out with half the Offensive Coordinators in the league. 

It wasn't Tepper who said this. Maybe Fitterer had his eye on a few guys and Tepper wanted to bring in more to hear different philosophies. I have a hard time getting too upset over this, even if it does kind of make Fitterer's quote look incorrect. 

>The practice facility he was building.....BANKRUPT/lawsuit.

Fair, not the best situation for Tepper. 

>The new turf field so he could host more events? ....In lawsuit with the NFLPA

Again not great, but he's not the only owner with a stadium with turf. 

>His first hire as NFL Coach?  Not only a disaster, but an embarrassing disaster

Embarrassing disaster is a bit of a stretch. Sure Rhule failed in the NFL, but he wasn't on the level of Urban Meyer, Nathaniel Hackett, etc. As Panthers fans, it's hard for us to truly look at Rhule from an outside perspective, but he wasn't an embarrassing disaster, more a coach that failed in the NFL and was deservedly fired. The only embarrassing part of his tenure to me was giving him a 3rd year when things clearly weren't working. 

>I looked back on it - and some of his biggest trades he made running the hedge fund came under scrutiny for insider trading......
 
I don't know much about his background, so I can't quantify this claims valdity, but any major successful investor or hedge fund manager is going to have claims of foul play against them. It comes with the territory and you have to take some of the accusations with a grain of salt.

>Besides him putting the logo at mid-field, what positive thing has he done for the franchise?  We have gotten progressively worse since he took over.  Our stadium is 70% away fans each week.

Well the owner of the team isn't going to immediately change the product on the field, which would explain the record and attendance. If there's one thing you can credit Tepper with, it's his desire to build a winner. That's usually one through HC and QB, which even though it hasn't happened yet, he's actively searched for the right fit.

Ultimately this read like someone who has an agenda against Tepper. Do I wish he would've done some things differently? No doubt. But he's still figuring out how to manage a football team, he's just largely swung and missed to this point. If it keeps occurring a decade from now, sure this frustration is warranted. Right now we've been a struggling team on the field, but if we manage to find the right pieces at HC and QB, the situation won't seem as gloomy, and a lot of the issues you have with Tepper won't seem as significant.

We've had 3 straight losing seasons and never had b2b winning seasons. I just want to be a consistent playoff team at this point. 

And imo, the simplest way to get stability at the QB spot is to draft a QB round 1; like 12 other teams have found their guy in the 1st since 2017.

The biggest reason QBs drafted top 8 flounder is bc, well, orgs drafting in the top 8 are usually hella dysfunctional and their rosters are severely lacking talent. But we aren't the typical top 10 picking team this year; We're legitimately a top 15 QB away from being playoff contenders rn with the roster we have. So just knock that off the list already.

I completely agree with your points, but this isn't a normal year. The Bears aren't going to have to hold anyone at gunpoint in order to facilitate trade talks.

The bottom line here is that like half the league is either in dire need of a QB upgrade or has someone at the helm either the fanbase, org, or both aren't sold on. Hell, you could reasonably argue that 5-6 teams in the top 10 alone could conceivably trade into the top 2 to secure their preferred QB prospect.

The fact that we didn't go for it tells me that, based on the mid-season analysis of the quarterback class and the trajectory of our team (we had just gone 1-2 with Wilks but the team was showing heart and the playoffs were in reach still), we weren't comfortable committing to one of the top 2 guys. Makes sense, given the team's newfound fire to win games (and lose draft stock), and on the heels of Alabama's loss to Tennessee this past year  the team wasn't sure if they wanted to go for it and lose Burns in the process.

So the decision seemed to be, even back then, not to trade up for a shot at the best QB in this draft. Maybe that means they like 4 or 5 guys. Or 0 guys.

26592,181987,181987,bigjaymizzle,Agreed. I’m high on Levis and Duggan. Richardson seems like a project. I’m not too opposed on keeping Darnold but more in a backup role. PJ sadly played his way off the team with his decision making. When PJ got rattled he was done. Darnold was more competent under a better OLine. Corral might get another prove it preseason look. I wouldn’t be too opposed on picking Levis if Stroud/Young are off the board or we don’t trade up to get them. Forethought would be to trade up to get Stroud/Young. But I also wouldn’t be opposed to getting Duggan/Bennett. The draft is deep with QBs this year cause the ones playing in the National Championship are projected to go later rounds.

Not that it's a risk that should not be taken, when under the proper consideration, but it would be a pretty big blow to miss on. We do suck now, and we do not have a quarterback now, but we do have draft picks that give us the ability to try to get a quarterback. But if we give up multiple top draft picks rather than just one, that takes away our best opportunities to add a quarterback later if we miss.

Kyler Murray being bad is a just a “what have you done for me lately”.

Compare to Sam Darnold now, 59% completion, 78.2 Passer rating. Kyler is much closer to being Joe Burrow than he is our starting QB. Therefore, “good”.
