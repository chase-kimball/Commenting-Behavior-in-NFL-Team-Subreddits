On offense I valued having MJD and Fred over having a TE, as there is no TE we've had that would take the value away from having both of them in the backfield. Robinson should be able to flip to RT.   


Defense was rough because the changes in schemes over the years. My picks are more for a 4-3, which is why I grabbed both Henderson and Stroud.

I have done stuff like this before and to avoid the first 4 people just saying, ""Me!"" I am making it a little more challenging. 

You will need to name 1 of 4 current or former Jaguars to qualify. Who gets what will be determined at random. A note on the towel: it was in the possession of a truly hideous and overweight Titans fan for almost the whole game. I think he thought he would head back to Nashville with the ultimate fan trophy, a ""not today"" fuck you to the Jags. I didn't notice he had left the towel until he was leaving and in anger and disgrace wiped his feet with it as he left. When I went to pick it up it was soaked. In beer, water or Titan tears, I do not know. I put it in my bag and as it was still wet when I got home transferred it to a plastic bag. It has a small stain on the back and you can feel the grit of the North End Zone on the towel still. Clean it or don't. It will still look great on your wall.

How to get one of these is simple. Correctly answer one of the following questions. Everyone gets one guess.

1. What CURRENT Jaguar did my wife meet when he came into her work last week? ANSWERED CORRECTLY: TRAVIS ETIENNE

2. When my daughter was 4, she met a former Jaguars 1st round draft pick at training camp. I took a picture of them together and it was my computer screen saver for 4 years. Name that former Jaguar. ANSWERED CORRECTLY: TYSON ALUALU

3. Who was my daughter's FIRST ""favorite player"" on the Jaguars? Hints: He played a total of ONE year in the NFL and was on the Jaguars between 2009 and 2016. ANSWERED CORRECTLY: ACE SANDERS -- edit: Ace Sanders played 2 seasons. My bad.
