10056,58831,58831,ElectricExperiment,"I gave higher values to locations that are equidistant (as opposed to just halfway)

Specifically, First, I calculated the distances between all stadiums and Highmark using the Vincenty distance algorithm. (This is a formula that determines distance between two points on the globe that accounts for the fact that the Earth is ever so slightly non-speherical.) Then I repeated distance calculations between everyone and GEHA.

Once I had the distances for each target, I took the smaller distance and divided it by the larger. This will yield a value of 1.0 if the site were exactly equidistant between Bflo and KC, and 0.0 for Bflo and KC themselves. So you can get a score of 1.0 being 450 miles away from both in Indiana, or 1000 miles away from both cities in Florida.

So for Indy, I took the distance to Buffalo (436 mi) and divided by the distance to KC (447 mi) to get 0.9748.

For Atlanta, which is closer to KC, I did it the other way around and divided the distance to KC over the distance to Buffalo to get 0.9668

I think we’d win this game. If the chargers get and stay healthy and get elite coaching they will be a powerhouse team in years to come, this year however I believe is not their year.

20875,141237,141237,RCDrift,"Zac Taylor and McDermott handled the situation flawlessly with grace, leadership, and every characteristic that you'd want people put into this situation would arise to.

The NFL world response was of support, and an understanding that something's are bigger than football. Bengals organization and fans have been more than awesome through the whole affair, and I'm deeply grateful for their handling of the situation.

Now the fans that absolutely convinced that they're the ones getting absolutely hosed by this need to step back and take a breather. Personally, I don't care if the Bills counted as a loss. We're in the playoffs, we've won our division and I firmly believe that my team can go toe to toe with anyone in the league. The minority of loud Bengals fans bitching up a storm are acting like everything was going to fall into place for them to be the 1st seed.

Let me put this in bold and caps for those that need to really focus on it.

**WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THAT GAME WOULD'VE ENDED, SO WE CAN NOT OPERATE ON ANY ASSUMPTIONS**

Do I think the Bengals are getting shafted? Of course, but not in some whole unfair disadvantage way.

Also, asking for a more ""Physical style"" of play akin to one of the dirtiest players for the last 20 years after we saw a player nearly die on the field is beyond tone deaf.

Pardon me, but you're playing to win this year. No one knows how good the teams next year will really be. KC could fall off a cliff, or the Texans could be the #1 team in the league. Next year isn't the issue I'd worry about as your team has the talent to go toe to toe with anyone in the league this year.

> At the end of the day, it's frustrating that the Bengals are getting the short end of the stick (notice, there isn't any ""what if"" scenario for the Bengals winning last week and this week, which with a KC loss would have made the Bengals the 1 seed)

Yes, because they're picking the best of the worst options. No one is happy that KC was gifted the 1 seed with an asterisk, Bills lost control of their destiny for the 1 seed, and the Bengals lost the chance to get there.

Bengals losing their chance at the 1 seed honestly was the least likely of all the events to happen. It could've happened, Cincy is certainly good enough to win out against both the Bills and the Ravens, but you'd also needed help this week from an eliminated Raiders team to beat KC. It was far from guaranteed out of all the outcomes.

A loss last week and this week makes the Bengals a WC, and the Ravens the AFCN champs.

The only reason it is favorable, is because the bills had a better record going into that game. It's not like both records were the same and the NFL said ""you guys are tied in the standings but we are giving the tiebreaker to the bills"". 

Both teams agreed to not continue, which was 100% the right move.

You either did the right thing on Monday (agreeing to stop the game) and it's a no contest, or you did the fucked up thing on Monday (tried to keep playing but the bills said no) and maybe it should be a bills forfeit.

Youre making a strawman argument because I’m not saying anything is wrong with a push in the back at all. It’s the use of the body to create additional force for the contact to the back of the head. He drives into him.

Hurst had an opportunity. This guy just hit him the last play. He didn’t get the call he wanted. He was pissed. The guy is now prone on the ground helpless and Hurst is falling. He makes the choice to use his legs to drive his body forward so instead of collapsing on Taron’s back, he’s able to make the same type of contact he was upset about from the previous play.

36319,260026,260026,gthirst,"It's a legitimate question since we don't know the status of Lamar, Mike White, or Tua.

If Bills rest starters, likely will be the 3 seed vs the 6 which will likely be Ravens. That could work nicely if they are missing Lamar.

If the Bills win, they take the 2 and can play a number of teams. This could end up being Jacksonville, Miami, Pittsburgh. I think there is a scenario where Pats can still make it even with a loss (and basically everyone else losing). The dumpster bowl of Jets v Dolphins will determine a lot tomorrow. 

Mike White with 5 broken ribs may hobble on to the field in the playoffs. I'd like that match up.

Tua playing after resting and being healthy with the playmakers of Miami can be dangerous, but they've been free falling and we don't know Tua's status. 

Lamar is injured or... not? That's a fiasco in itself.

Mac Jones and the Patriots are dog shit on offense even when healthy.

Honestly I think you're simply playing for home field against the Bengals in the divisional. Which probably should be a neutral field but it isn't. That's it.

For the wildcard round, I like the 2 or 3 seed. But divisional you definitely want homefield, thus the 2 is important.

Play starters. 

Would love to see Jags/Titans (4th seed) or Chargers (5th) somehow take out the Chiefs though. Then we would have a home AFC championship after what is likely a very tough divisional game.

[Updated pic due to Raiders being useless](https://i.imgur.com/XrK706S.jpg)

So in addition to wanting a home game in the divisional round, you also force a neutral site AFC Championship against the Chiefs by winning tomorrow. Fuck playing at arrowhead.

as for the hits, they would have had this, plus more rest, if they had kept the 1 seed and got the bye. taking any kind of bumps and bruises, or spending a week preparing for a game, it a lot more than they would be doing on a bye week. so they lost the bye, took some meaningless hits and practice, all for nothing since the game didnt count.

Did they gain extra time to prepare for their next game? nope, cause the team wasn't even practicing until thursday, where they had walk throughs, because everyone was so concerned over their teammate who suffered cardiac arrest in the middle of a football game.

How old is your son? I would say it’s worth checking out the stuff in front of the stadium if it’s his first time.

50809,360391,360391,xT1TANx,"It's easy to complain when we have this much talent and it's not being used correctly. Cook should be getting the ball more often. On designed runs or checkdowns. 

If we would take those 4-5 yard checks more often our offense would hum and it would force the defense to respect the underneath more, giving us more chances deep.

That might be on Allen, but IMO it should be on Dorsey to expose it in meetings and push Josh to improve.

Shakir should absolutely be playing more. Every time he catches a pass he does something good with it.

Why is Knox not used up the seam more?",5.0,buffalobills,t3_106ip1o,False,0.0,:BUF:,2023-01-08T19:11:54Z,buffalobills,0.007537138813734
