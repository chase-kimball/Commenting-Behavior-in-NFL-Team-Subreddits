I find both ideas presented here to be very strange. Geno Smith's Jets tenure wasn't him ""missing on poor timing"", it was the players he was surrounded by being terrible. Geno was good at throwing to Decker and Harvin, he was bad throwing at David Nelson and Jeff Cumberland. And at the same time, Justin Fields is bad at throwing to Velus Jones, Equanimous St. Brown, Dante Pettis, Byron Pringle etc. It's a highly assumptive blame to say the QB is out of time/place and not the WRs, because you are assuming the WR is actually in the right time and place when you do so but with a WR room full of cast offs and generally not good players, why?

IMO an ideal QB room for a team without a franchise starter should have a high upside guy, a ""skilled"" QB, and a deep development player. Like sell out to try to find a capable QB. Wilson/White/Streveler met those conditions. But if you have a starter that's like in the tier 2.5 zone or lower, then your room should probably look like Starter, upside guy, and practice squad low-upside, veteran guy. So that's Carr/Wilson/ and a Matt Moore type. But if you've got your true franchise guy, then you probably go Franchise, capable backup, talent but no skills practice squad guy. So that's Lamar/ Mike White type (with lamar you probably want a guy who is more similar to Lamar as a backup)/ someone like Streveler but with more arm talent.

Solid case: we get Jimmy G on I assume a big contract. I like Carr more than Jimmy personally, especially with how brittle Jimmy is. And I have a feeling Carr might even cost less.

17033,112862,112862,Phifty56,"Honestly, MiLF wasn't handed the greatest situation with the QBs and OL, but he also was still running the complex trap runs that required very good blocking, and I swear every other team could figure out how to get thier RBs easy touches on short passes but us.

Also, there is no way to confirm it, but it sure seemed like after Moore went into and then came out of the doghouse, he still was being ignored in the playcalling. An NFL OC can't find a way to get someone who is very fast and quick the ball? It's pretty frustrating to watch how effortlessly other teams manufacture touches for players, and the Jets were almost struggling to get the ball to anyone not named Garrett Wilson.

Over time, I've developed my own Jets mantra that I like to think and sometimes yell at my TV. ""Why the fuck do we make every single thing look complex, while everyone else makes it look simple"". I vividly remember yelling it when, against all hope, MiLF had a moment of clarity, and ran a simple quick out at the goalline with Ozumah, and ZWilson was asked to make a throw even he couldn't sail and it looked like so fucking easy. Why do we make things so difficult? Why weren't we feeding all the weapons we supposedly had with simple concepts? If the defense spot it, fine. But we never even got that far because the plays would break down before they even got going. It was frustrating to watch.

I honestly don't think MilF was seasoned enough to take on DCs who were familiar with the Shanahan system, and knew it's tricks and weaknesses. It might have played out different if the QB play was better, and injuries didn't ravage the run game. But MilF still wasn't able to adapt and it showed.

That being said, if he truly believes MilF deserves another chance with a stable QB, a non-injured OL, and Breece Hall back, the Jets have to trust his judgement. He's earned at least that much.

I personally would rather HC and GMs have a total control of their staff/picks, so they can never play the ""ownership meddled"" card. They either succeed or fail with who they chose to ride with. It's fairer that way, and easier to get rid of they aren't working out.
