As for the Vikings, it's tough. I think they'll be in the playoffs next year, but they HAVE to fix their secondary. It's horrible.

I'm also very low on the Ravens, so I'll include them too.

1986,20231,20231,Birdamus,"I don’t think this thread has covered just how *awful* the personnel moves were. So here’s a breakdown of why…

Chip Kelly Sucks in a Nutshell:

- Trades away an elite RB that is a fan favorite with several productive years left for a below-average LB who just tore his ACL.

- Trade “saves” Philly about 11 mill in cap space, which was a big priority for Chip as he released Trent Cole (10 mill) and Cary Williams (8 mill) on the same day as the trade.

Hey, looks like he’s clearing cap space, you might think. Kiko is on his rookie contract (1 mill per year), could be a good piece, and running backs are too replaceable to spend high dollars on. I mean, that’s a fairly reasonable line of thinking, but then…

- He signs DeMarco Murray to a massive contract. There are a couple of major issues with this. First, he was coming off of a 392 carry season. Go look and tell me how many guys have led the league with 350+ carries in a year and what their production was the following year (or years). They tend to fall off a cliff. Second, he’s an upright, downhill runner a la Eric Dickerson. He was a *terrible* fit for the RPO schemes Chip implemented, where a shotgun QB might hand it to a stationary RB idling next to him. DeMarco wants to work out of an I-formation type of structure where he can gain speed before the handoff and then make one cut and boom downfield. So many handoffs where he got the ball flat-footed, started running horizontally to gain speed and then never got the edge and it’s a TFL and he would look frustrated as hell because he *didn’t fit the system*. But you know what kind of shifty back with quick, darting feet and split-second reflexes could have worked in that beloved system? Right! The elite playmaker you traded away for a broken young LB who washed out of the league *before* Shady retired.

That’s why Chip Kelly fucking sucked. Not only did he horribly fumble the personnel moves, he did it in a way that made zero sense and didn’t work with his own fucking system. All while alienating the fans because these were cherished players. Fuck Chip.",6.0,eagles,t3_106cqjs,False,0.0,Fred Barnett,2023-01-08T06:44:20Z,eagles,-0.0247255954594056

That's why I'm treating the 'he should be ok by next season' stuff with extreme skepticism, because those expectations are based on 'normal' circumstances, not as a followup to the within-the-same-year-as-whatever hell Tua already went through a few short months ago. 

The list of football players I've seen go thru what Tua already has is very small - less than a handful in 20+ years of watching. Austin Collie, Jahvid Best and Tua are the ones that stand out most in memory as genuinely horrifying to see. And we're talking about Tua's health as if he just needs to heal up from an ACL tear, or something. Just far too casual about it, but that's football I suppose.

At the end of the day I'm mostly just concerned for his health (as many of us are), and I find it disconcerting and frankly hypocritical that people are so willing to take the 'let's just wait and see what happens, yeah it could end horrifically, but it might not' approach when 3 months ago we were all ""holy shit omfg Prayers up for Tua"" and 9 DAYS ago we were all ""holy shit omfg Prayers up for Damar"". Now it's ""eh, he'll probably be ok by next year and maybe he can learn not to get concussed again!""

It's his choice. But there does exist a possible near future where he is the face of the turning tide of public consciousness, where concussions and football are concerned.

DEFINITELY an extreme luxury pick, but how often does the 1 seed have 2 FRPs the year after having 2 FRPs? How would anyone stop this offense?
