I'm thankful of him turning the team around. I'm thankful for him helping us win a Super Bowl (even though he was awful in both Super Bowls he coached in). 

But I won't cry that he's gone. He's an excellent coach who has a gigantic ego, flighty and has shown zero skills in the face of adversity.

When everything goes his way, he's an amazing coach. When stuff goes sideways or he's figured out, he implodes. There's a reason why the 49ers have continually owned us aside from that one beautiful comeback where the stars aligned in the playoffs.

The first time he missed the playoffs at 9-7, he has admitted that he essentially Whiplashed Jared Goff's ass and destroyed his confidence. He blamed everything on Goff. He has admitted to literally taking his Pro Bowl QB who literally never had a single attitude problem and bullied him into becoming a shell of himself.

Media all backed McVay, Goff got shit on as a walking puppet with 0 skills, and then after Goff won a playoff game for the Rams with a broken thumb on his throwing hand, he got dumped to Detroit.

Did it work out? Yeah, we won a Super Bowl, but it's wild how we have a story of a coach openly admitting to destroying his QB's psyche and everyone shrugged. Goff thankfully has shown how capable he is with a coach that believes in him.

And with McVay, in his second season ever missing the playoffs and the first one with a losing record, is leaving. He owes me nothing but it's still just a show of his overall character as a leader.

Goff was a young QB who gave his all. He won a playoff game with a broken thumb on his throwing hand. He never made any issues. He tried his best. He made a Super Bowl.

THE ONE SEASON that we didn't make the season at 9-7, Sean McVay took 0% of the blame. He put it all on Goff. He KILLED Goff's character. Look at this sub and media in general. Everyone literally jumped on Jared Goff and beat his ass until there was nothing left.

McVay is a very good coach. He's smart. He has some great designed plays. But the motherfucker is paper. He gets thrown some adversity and he bends. It's the reason why Kyle continually owns his pompus ass in the SF-LA series.

33724,277533,277533,txyesboy,"I see where you're coming from, but I have to be honest with you - as an NFC West guy who doesn't follow college football that much and doesn't watch a lot of the AFC teams, i've been learning a lot since he came to the Rams about this narrative about him. 

I totally get it and I see what you mean because in retrospect I see what people are talking about. 

I may be a rare example of someone pointing out things that I saw just in the time that he was in Los Angeles and nothing else. I do understand why someone would see that is making excuses for him. But as somebody who watched John Wolford and Blaine Perkins under center for the team with fifth string office of lineman and 3rd to 4th string wide receivers, mayfield arrival was a night and day difference compared to them. 

Do I think he's a top five or top 10 quarterback in the league? Absolutely not - at least not at this moment. Buddy in my limited time of seeing his performances as quarterback with their team I was far more impressed then I was unimpressed. 

I won't take up too much of everyone's time to belabor the subject but there's one particular example that's a perfect microcosm why people should not be giving up on quarterbacks like him. 

In the Denver game, early on, an edge rusher off the right tackle is bearing down on him quickly - unblocked and with a direct line to Mayfield. The running back is offset left, and out of the corner of his eye, the running back does see the edge rusher and makes a beeline for him to try to protect the quarterback by getting a chip block. While this is going on, mayfield in his three step drop spies the edge rusher, then continues his progressions, and ever so subtly and quickly adjusts his footwork just a half step step back and to the left. This allows the running back the lane he needs to get the chip block on the edge rusher; and Mayfield is able to make a successful first down completion.

Of all the things he did right in that game to score 52 points against a very good defense - this is the thing that Troy Aikman continue to rave about during the broadcast - The fact that Mayfield had only been there for just under two weeks and yes he already had that kind of rapport after the snap with his offensive teammates. 

Now for every one of those plays, do you have snippets of him doing boneheaded things and making some bad throws, missed timing with his wide receivers, etc.

But things like the example above can be taught but you have to have intrinsic ability to be able to do that regularly to be successful in this league. Someone like Sam Darnold...doesn't have that innate skill.",1.0,nfl,t3_107ewp9,False,0.0,:Rams: Rams,2023-01-11T21:13:55Z,losangelesrams,0.0242798140739372

33726,277538,277538,txyesboy,"I read 50 comments down on this thread, and not one mentioned that Baker was working with on average at the OL the 3rd string OL at each position, with the 3rd, 5th, and 7th WRs on the depth chart. 

He led the team to 2 of their 5 wins this season in only 5 appearances, had them in the lead the entire game on the road vs Seattle against a team in a must-win situation. He was sacked 5 times and knocked down even more, and the officials were *very* home cooking in the 4th quarter and OT.

But yes, the duck he threw under duress on a 3rd progression read to the WR he still hasn't developed any rhythm with in practice - the same WR notorious for being a duck enthusiast over his career, rather than being a ball hawk himself, yes that's the expert dunk take needed on Mayfield. 

He nearly led a crap Rams team of primarily 3rd string backups to a record of 3-2 in his 5 games, and in one case put the 2nd biggest thumping on any team (margin of victory) all season long, and led a miracle 98 yard TD comeback with no timeouts - the longest of its kind with the amount of time left on the clock in NFL history - with approx 38 total hours since seeing the playbook.

Yeah he sucked in the GB and SD games, and was hit (1st half) and miss (2nd half) - just as many have stated about him - he's inconsistent. Now let's see what he can with an actual starting line and more than practice team WRs.
