Their offense is arguably a top 5ish one in football with Goff playing some of the best football of his career (I actually think he has been better than Kirk Cousins this season) along with Williams running it effectively. Their defense isn't good, but they have a semi-decent pass defense...I read they're like top three in pressuring the quarterback in the second half of the season.

I think Packers probably win because their rush defense is terrible and they're historically not good at Lambeau, but I am confident this game will be clearly more competitive than the Vikings game",1.0,greenbaypackers,t3_105g6nw,False,0.0,:GB:,2023-01-06T22:55:12Z,greenbaypackers,0.19233552

1) Sure you can pick 100,000 seat stadiums, but that doesn't mean more revenue.  Very few domes can hold 100,000 as you suggested following this.  You have to rely on fans traveling really well to these.  Can it happen?  Sure.  Is the juice worth the squeeze?  No.

2) ""Outdoor games in domes"" this has never really been an issue, even in Green Bay or Buffalo.  Yes, it has been cold, but still sold out.  Also negates any home field advantage and makes the regular season less meaningful.  Less meaningful regular season means less revenue.

3) Sold out is sold out.  The league sets the price for the game for the home teams and says ""Here, sell the tickets"" and it has never been an issue.  They can keep raising the prices until it becomes and issue, even then, 'more accessible' doesn't mean more accessible to the fans that would buy the tickets for the game.  Heavy hitters will still go for the Super Bowl over CCG.

4) I really don't think much more would pop up like the Super Bowl.

5) The absolute most important reason, players and fans would revolt.  Home field is a big deal for the team and the fans.  Most fans will really only be able to watch their team live in a CCG and on tv in the Super Bowl.

49670,363657,363657,xylltch,"> The NFL competition committee appears to have unanimous agreement that controversial catch rulings involving Dez Bryant and Calvin Johnson should have been ruled complete, according to Giants owner John Mara. **So the committee is working on changing the rule to relax the ""going to the ground"" requirement.**

> ""I think where we are unanimous [are] plays like the Dez Bryant play in Green Bay, going to the ground, the Calvin Johnson play from a couple of years ago,"" Mara said Tuesday. ""I think all of us agree that those should be completions. **So let's write the language to make them completions.**""

If there's a substantial number of genuine replies to a post such as this (which isn't a meme, isn't ill-disguised trash talk, isn't the 5th tweet rehashing the same interview), can a couple reports for being low-effort be enough to delete it?

I wasn't even a football fan until a decade later. Of course I knew who Brett Favre and the Packers were, being in Wisconsin, but I don't think I'd ever watched a game until then.
