Where's that hunger from ours? We always come out looking stoic, overthinking and second-guessing everything, playing *scared*. 

Bigger, though: still don't understand how *one* fumble or *one* drop early in the game causes our guys to completely lose full in a matter of minutes. If Jones doesn't fumble, I'm willing to bet you don't see the egregious mental mistakes from Rodgers, Quay, Doubs, Wyatt, etc. in the second half.

I'll admit to enjoying watching Call of Duty eSports from time to time.

Watching the Packers collapse again and again is really starting to remind me of that OpTic team and it's just so, so frustrating. 

Get rid of Barry, give Fangio a blank check, add (if not replacing Stenavich) an outside mind to the offensive coaching staff, and get at least one veteran weapon. Those, plus another offseason for Watson, Doubs, Toure & co. and I think we'll be back in the mix again whether it's Rodgers or Love again, but I still have my reservations about our playoff performances.",27.0,greenbaypackers,t3_1074h1k,False,0.0,:17:,2023-01-08T23:08:58Z,greenbaypackers,0.026916981832535

Lions play their asses off. Goff has 290 yards and 3 TDs, including 1 to Jamaal (who also gets a rushing TD), but also 2 picks. They sack Rodgers 3 times, 2 from Hutch, and nearly force a fumble early in the game.

2) ""Outdoor games in domes"" this has never really been an issue, even in Green Bay or Buffalo.  Yes, it has been cold, but still sold out.  Also negates any home field advantage and makes the regular season less meaningful.  Less meaningful regular season means less revenue.

3) Sold out is sold out.  The league sets the price for the game for the home teams and says ""Here, sell the tickets"" and it has never been an issue.  They can keep raising the prices until it becomes and issue, even then, 'more accessible' doesn't mean more accessible to the fans that would buy the tickets for the game.

49670,363657,363657,xylltch,"> The NFL competition committee appears to have unanimous agreement that controversial catch rulings involving Dez Bryant and Calvin Johnson should have been ruled complete, according to Giants owner John Mara. **So the committee is working on changing the rule to relax the ""going to the ground"" requirement.**

> ""I think where we are unanimous [are] plays like the Dez Bryant play in Green Bay, going to the ground, the Calvin Johnson play from a couple of years ago,"" Mara said Tuesday. ""I think all of us agree that those should be completions. **So let's write the language to make them completions.**""

If there's a substantial number of genuine replies to a post such as this (which isn't a meme, isn't ill-disguised trash talk, isn't the 5th tweet rehashing the same interview), can a couple reports for being low-effort be enough to delete it?
