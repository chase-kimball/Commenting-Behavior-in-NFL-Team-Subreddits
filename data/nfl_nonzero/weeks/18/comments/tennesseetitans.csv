1842,18484,18484,Bieber_hole_69,"The issue with DHop is that anyone trading for him is going to have to give him an extension. He's not going to want to play on a contract with only two years left on it, and with a cap hit over $30,000,000 next year and over $26,000,000 in 2024, you're going to have to extend him to get rid of that ballooning money. IIRC he's got a no-trade clause in his contract and has to approve of any potential trades, so any team that he would approve would likely already have an extension worked out with his agent before he would agree to be traded.

I don't necessarily think it's a great idea to get tied down long-term with a WR that's going to be 31 next season. You'll be stuck with a big cap hit in 2026/27 for a 34-year-old WR that has been popped once for PEDs and plays the game in a way that depends on extreme physicality. He's also missed games in 2021 and 2022 due to injury, it seems like he's on the decline and you'd be giving up assets and tying a bunch of money up for the tail-end of the guy's career.

We just went through a disastrous trade to get a 32-year-old Julio Jones on the decline and with a recent injury history. Doesn't this seem like a pretty similar situation if we traded for Nuk? And we were at least able to get out of the Julio experiment with only two years of cap penalties after cutting him, we're done with Julio's dead money after 2023. We'd then be stuck with the same thing for a few more years if the DHop situation went sideways.

I don't see the abundance of free cap in 2024 as something that should be earmarked for aging veterans to continue taking up. Henry and Tannehill's deals before the 2020 season were done with the intention of this iteration of the team being over after 2023 at the latest. We can let their deals expire and completely move on with just the dead money from void years remaining in 2024 and 2025. I think that cap money in 2024 would be better served to use for extensions on our younger guys like Simmons and brining in free agents getting their second deals rather than guys over 30 looking for one last mega deal.

1843,18486,18486,Bieber_hole_69,"Honestly, might work out for the Colts to let the Texans win there regardless of their own draft position.

Getting the Bears the 1st pick instead of the Texans allows them the opportunity to get QB1 that they wouldn't have had if the Texans were picking 1st. No way the Texans are trading out of 1.01, and even if they had an inkling to do it they would never do it with a division rival.

Now on the other hand with the Bears picking 1.01, suddenly the Colts can trade up to the first pick and jump the Texans for their first choice of QB. All they have to do is outbid the Texans for it, which they totally can. And even then, if they get into a bidding war and the Texans win, suddenly the Texans are paying a premium to move up one spot that they wouldn't have had to if the Colts had just won in Week 18. Maybe the Colts have a different QB1 than the Texans and don't even have to trade up for their guy, but force the Texans to do so in order to not miss out on their guy just in case.

It was in the Colts best interests to lose that game for not just their own draft pick, but to place themselves in a better spot compared to the other QB needy team in their own division.

1845,18489,18489,Bieber_hole_69,"Their roster is legitimately ancient. They had the second oldest roster in the league last year after final cuts. They went all-in on older free agents or trade candidates to finish some major pieces of what they thought would be a contender, and now instead they just have an old roster that's still far away from competing.

Some major starters next year will be: 31 year-old Nuk, 28 year-old James Conner, 30 year-old Robbie Anderson, and 32 year-old Zach Ertz.

Ertz, Conner, and Nuk all just got extensions recently.

Two major contributors in Rodney Hudson and JJ Watt are likely both retiring.

Former starters on the line in Billy Price, Max Garcia, and Kelvin Beachem are all at or near their 30's and will be free agents.

And even the younger talent like Kyler and Hollywood Brown will be expensive in upcoming years. Their defense has some young players on it that Joseph has gotten a lot out of, but their investments in the offense have mostly been older guys from free agency, and some of the picks on younger guys haven't worked.

By the time they can get the roster in decent shape, Hopkins will be what? 34? Will he be an elite WR by then? And how expensive will another extension be?

At this point it makes total sense to push the blow it up button and strip whatever assets you can get from the aging guys on offense. Kyler is likely to miss some time to start the year, and the new HC and GM are probably going to want time to build the roster the way they want to.

It's like a hail mary at the end of a game, you make it really easy on the defense to predict and cover your play when you can pretty much eliminate the entirety of the field from LoS to the sticks. I guess you can flood a zone and hope that works if you're throwing short of the sticks and maybe it can pull somebody in coverage far enough away that if the receiver can make someone miss he can get the 13 yards, but when the defense can plant their heels 15 yards back at the snap and just rally to anything in front of them, it's hard to convert barring a wild coverage bust or somebody making a spectacular play on offense.

Play action is a no-go. Something long developing further down the field that 15 yards is a no-go because of the pass protection and the fact you can't max protect. They're probably rushing 3 and dropping 8, you can't keep anybody in for max protect as you need 5 guys running a route to have a chance. 

The real crime is being in a 4th and 13 in the first place, and that's on Hooper for the false start and NPF for the sack on 2nd down more than anything. 4th and 7 or 3 is infinitely more manageable than 4th and 13. You could even run the ball on 3rd down if it's 3rd and 7.

That's as franchise altering an off-season as you could possibly have short of the team being sold or moving towns. Are we going to see something like the Bears in 2021 when essentially a lame-duck GM got to trade future picks to draft a QB that the next guy would inherit?

This will be the third HC Ballard has been in charge of hiring after McDaniels and Reich. How many other GMs get leashes that long with two playoff appearances over six years? This is the perfect opportunity to full-reset the franchise, so why not? If there is even a 25% chance Ballard could be fired after next year, they should just do it now so you're not tied down to the decisions made by a GM that won't be in the building for the 2024 season.

1854,18500,18500,Bieber_hole_69,"His third retirement lol

Edit: Don't know if this is known outside Titans fans, but rumors were he came out of retirement to be DC on Arthur Smith's staff in Atlanta mostly to get his son Matt a job.

Matt Pees was defensive QC for the Titans during both of Pees' seasons in Tennessee. Pees retired after the 2019 season to, ""spend more time with his family,"" and magically Matt Pees was no longer on staff with the Titans in 2020 even though the rest of the defensive staff stayed pretty unchanged. Pees lobbied pretty hard during the 2020 season to get his old job back while he was, ""retired,"" and stayed in Nashville that year iirc. He was talking to the press while the Titans defense sucked and pretty much begging to be brought back. Reports in the 2020-21 offseason were that Vrabel had interviewed Pees to be brought back as a consultant for 2021 but not as DC.

So then in 2021 Art Smith was magically able to bring Pees out of retirement and what do you know, Matt Pees is on staff as a defensive assistant.

Seems like there's a decent chance Dean wanted Matt to get a promotion and maybe start to rise up as a position coach, up from QC coach for 2020, or maybe guarantees that Matt would stay on staff. When Vrabel told him no, Pees just retired again. Then as Art Smith was assembling a staff in Atlanta, all it took was a promise to give Matt a job to get Dean in the building. I think Pees has been just as interested in getting his kid work than actually coaching for a few years now.

Hope he enjoys retirement, he deserves it after the health scares, but I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest to see him taking a DC or consultant job somewhere in 2023 or 2024 and Matt once again getting hired in that same place. Matt took a job as HC at a high school in his dad's retirement year, I wonder where he'll be in 2023 because I don't think it will be Atlanta lol.",121.0,nfl,t3_107iitq,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2023-01-09T10:23:29Z,tennesseetitans,0.033226729497913

Outside of one year playing in Miami and one year in Canada, he's never held a job in football outside of the Cardinals franchise. Almost 25 years in the same place.

There's a decent chance if Keim doesn't get a job somewhere else in the building, he won't get another job in the NFL. How many connections does he have outside of that one franchise? Once Kliff is fired none of the coaches he had under him as GM will be have HC jobs in the league.

I can only compare his situation to Mike Munchak's with the Titans/Oilers. Going from his time as a player to getting fired as HC, he was with that one franchise for over three decades. He was at least able to fall back on being a great and well respected OL coach though, and that netted him a job in Pittsburgh.

Dobbs may be limited as far as skills go, but he’s genuinely the smartest QB this side of Fitzpatrick and can understand literally any offense you put in front of him.

There’s a reason every great offensive mind loves Kirk Cousins, because they know they can win with him. He can make all the throws and he just gets an offenses. Maybe he can’t light it up off-schedule like Mahomes, but if you ask him to do it he can do it. He’s competent above all else.

Dobbs is absolutely of that caliber. And maybe it’s not out of the question a guy as smart as he is can be the avatar a good OC can run an offense through.

I don’t think he’s starting caliber in this league, but he seems like the absolute pinnacle ideal of a backup QB. Would love it if he sticks around here, and it’s not shocking to see why he could stick around the league this long without a start.

1861,18507,18507,Bieber_hole_69,"A player like Clowney is really useful to have and makes the rest of the defense better, even if counting stats don't show a tremendous impact.

Elite run defender and great at setting the edge. Can pressure the QB, but doesn't necessarily get home and convert pressures into sacks at the rate you would like to see.

The Titans had that in Clowney in 2020 before he was injured. 0 sacks, but you could tell the defense as a whole was much better when he was on the field.

The Titans then replaced Clowney with pretty much the same thing I described above in Bud Dupree, and are close to the point of moving on from Dupree as well.

My issue with both of them is that, while they're good players and difference makers, they come with a premium price-tag that you would normally associate with players that do wreck games on their own. You pay the big bucks for sacks at a premium position like pass rusher. For a guy getting top 10 edge rusher money, you want a guy that has a primary pass rush skillset, and Clowney has always just filled the role of complimentary player way better than when he's tasked with being *the* guy off the edge.

You can get that complimentary skillset from cheaper guys even if they aren't quite as good, but you can just fuck up your cap situation by paying 1B players like they're 1A guys.

Now Clowney is causing issues like he's a 19.5 sack per season guy, and it's absurd. His greatest value to a team is specifically being out on the field for early down snaps, that's what he's really good at. He's never been a pass rush specialist, and it's pure laziness that he's demanding that role now. He hasn't gotten that premium price-tag in a few years, but I'm sure he still feels that he deserves it.",20.0,nfl,t3_1051cbs,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2023-01-06T13:30:30Z,tennesseetitans,0.0312923131873766

Willis: D. To be fair to him he should have never started this year, but his performance was still quite bad when put in.

In 2016, Peters was named the Broncos director of college scouting after spending two seasons as the team's assistant director of college scouting (2014-15). Peters spent three years as a national scout (2011-13) after originally joining the Broncos as a regional scout in 2009.

As a member of Denver's personnel department, Peters helped the team acquire 27 players through the draft and college free agency that were vital members of the Super Bowl 50 championship roster.
Peters joined the Broncos after spending six years (2003-08) with the New England Patriots. In his first two seasons with the Patriots as a scouting assistant, he was a part of two Super Bowl championship teams (XXXVIII in 2003 and XXXIX in 2004). In 2005, Peters handled pro scouting duties for the team before serving as an area scout in his final three seasons (2006-08) with the Patriots.

Prior to the NFL, Peters spent one season (2002) as a football operations graduate assistant at UCLA after playing defensive end for the Bruins from 1999-2001.

Example, say we continue to demand every WR blocks for the run, okay fine, why not draft more TE's then even if they suck at blocking (for a TE) they are on average physically larger than WR's and so will make for better blockers than 6'0"" to 5'10"" WR. Now there is some overlap... you could still get a guy like Quentin Johnston, AJB, or Burks to be your big WR (preferably one that is a deep threat) that can also block every few drafts... but overall we should be leaning more into TE's especially those with great size matchups. 

I mean look at chig, when I see him on the field, i see him as a slightly larger slot WR, who's able to block (even if he isn't amazing at it for a TE), and could still get separation and favorable matchups last year when it was basically just him and  Burks to worry about. Get two more TE's at around that size/level and you probably won't need slot WR's at all and may not need a WR 2 on every play if you draft a guy like Michael Mayer or Darnell Washington.

Essentially if we want to go all out on the run we could, and we could win a lot of contested catches going TE heavy.

31238,168699,168699,WhiteXHysteria,"2 years ago the Jags were in the Texans position with less draft capital. Players forced their way out. Tons of pieces were written about how shit they were. 

Then over 2 offseasons they got the 2 most important pieces to  an organizations success. A HC(who is better than I originally gave him credit for) and a QB. They now enter the playoffs as one of the hottest teams in the league.

Indy has neither of the 2 most important positions on a team and have failed to get them for years and kept their GM!?!? They have mediocre cap space and no real plethora of draft capital. 

They need a lot of pieces to be competitive and no real path to getting it currently because their money is tied up in positions such as a mediocre QB, an off ball LB, and a C and G who fell off a cliff. They may get a shot at a QB and will obviously have a shot at a HC but they aren't adding a ton more talent.

The Texans may have their pick of QB and have so many assets to surround them with. That is the best spot to be in outside of being a contender even if it means you are a laughing stock. They still have to nail the pick and the hire though. If they mess up either they are fucked. 

The Jets show what 2 good picks can do to a team with a shit QB. If you have the extra assets to add a QB and get those picks(the Texans do) that can completely alter the direction of a franchise.

The Browns have done what the colts did and what the Jets may be doing. They built a solid roster but wasted it on a mediocre QB and coach. Then by the time they went and got a QB most of the solid roster was aging or gone. You can see similar in Denver. 

I 100% believe we have the HC. I still think tanny can be the QB but that time is quickly leaving.

That is a move you make to commit to the future 100%. You make that move to acquire any draft capital and cap space possible by ripping the bandaid off so you can focus on getting a top draft pick in 2024 and build around them with the saved money. 

Tannehill being cut saves at least a little over 17m on the cap(36m cap hit and 18.8m dead).

Henry would save 7.3m. 

That would be 24.5m saved to use on future building in either 2023 free agents and 2024 free agents. We would also make a lot of other moves if we were to go this route. We would probably free up ~100m to use however we want. Add in a rookie contract QB and you can build a hell of a team for a run in 2024 through 2027.

The texans are in a fantastic spot right now. It can go south like it did for Vegas when they were similar, but outside of legit good teams and like seattle, Houston is where you want to be. The only problem with houston is they fucked up and won Sunday.

They have the 8th most cap space and may look to trade cooks to gain even more. They will get some mid round pick for that.

They have all sort of draft capital from a shit browns team from the watson trade. They got the #13 overall last year which turned into 15 and 2 mid round picks. They got the #12 pick this year and a 4th. They got a 1st and 4th next year. 

They have the #2 overall pick this year. 

If they hit on the QB  with the #2 pick they immediately jump a lot of teams in the pecking order. If they hit on #2 and any of their other high end picks the next 2 years they could be a force in 2024+.

They took what they could to make strengths in the face of a massive weakness. 

They didn't say ""we don't have a good line and our best wr is  a wr2 so we shouldn't draft a QB"" 

They drafted burrow and Tee. Ignored the line basically. Then followed a bad rookie season,  which should be expected with any rookie QB regardless of injury, by doubling down and grabbing ANOTHER great talent at receiver even with a great lineman on board. 

They forced WR to be a strength. They didn't just have those receivers outside of Boyd. 

They didn't just take OL because they needed it and end up with some middling lineman. They made a concerted effort to take great players in a position the could have afforded not to in order to have a strength at QB and a strenth at WR. 

They only really addressed the line when there were great players available to them, like La'el Collins. 

Chase and Higgins have each missed multiple games the last 2 years and that offense still produces. Chase missed the first like 4 games of their current 8 game win streak.

Even with all that, that offense runs through burrow and it would be a waste if they had some average QB. They may still be good but they wouldn't be 3-0 against the chiefs in 2022 and playing in the super bowl good.

QB is the most important position. HC is the only one comparable(and arguably more important). 

LT is very important but if you have a good,  smart QB, they will make up for deficiencies elsewhere. Joe Burrow took a line like ours to the super bowl. 



Get a QB(if a legit good one is available). Then get the best players available to make strengths where you can. Cincy went all in on WRs and it worked extremely well. 

You can also build a team by having 5 great lineman like the Lions kinda have. That makes everyone else better too, but it takes 5 great players as opposed to 1. 

Once you have the QB, preferably on a rookie contract, the sky is the limit as far as trades/FA signings because you end up saving 30m+ per year over teams with vet QBs. You can buy a lot of strengths with that money. 

Of course, this only matters if a great QB is available(as I have mentioned 100 times, I have no clue on the QBs in this or any other class).

Townsend| 50.4|**45.6**|**76**|**41.5%**|**8**|**7.5%**|**41.5%**|**30.2%**|**15.1%**

That is basically every  tracked metric. Stonehouse wins on the average gross kick, but loses every other metric. 

Why is this? 

A couple of reasons. 

First, our offense is bad so he has more room to kick on average, though townsend clearly has plenty of room when he kicks too even though he is on KC. 

Second, and the main one, Stonehouse outkicks his coverage. The % of punts returned may be the worst in the entire league. While some people will blame our gunners, and maybe they aren't as good, that is irrelevant. The punter has worked with these guys all season. He knows how fast they can make it down the field. His job is to adjust to his coverage. When stonehouse kicks the  opposing team is attempting  a return 66% of the time. That is unreal. 

Couple that with the fact that when they attempt a return they get nearly 11 yards for free. The extra 2.7 yards on the kickover townsend turns into an extra 2.8 on  the return and a much higher rate of returned kicks. Just  not great for Stonehouse in a discussion of first team all pro. 

Third, when stoenhouse kicks  he ends inside the 20 8% less often than townsend and has touchbacks 2.5%  more. So punts where a player may fair catch the  ball at the 7 or 8 for townsend  ends up as a touchback for Stonehouse. He  gets an extra 7-8 yards on  the overall punt but the team loses 12-13 yards. Huge negative. 

The fair catch number alone is absurd. 18% higher chance that Townsend's 50.4 yard bomb gets a fair catch than Stonehouses 53.1 yard bomb. A massive sign  that one punter takes a few yards offthe kick for better hang time and the other just kicks the ball as far as they can with little thought otherwise. 

This is not stonehouse hate. He  was a rookie and has a great foundation that canbe molded into being one of those top punters, but this year he was overall pretty  average. I know that sounds harsh, but average is a great place to be as a rookie. Makes the opportunity to  take a leap in year 2 very real.",7.0,tennesseetitans,t3_106ents,False,0.0,300 to link?,2023-01-08T11:20:07Z,tennesseetitans,0.0143431315748764

That is a big difference from losing to the  Jags twice, the texans, the cowboys, and the chargers. 

It would be like being upset that we lost to the chiefs or eagles this  year. Those teams are on a different level than basically any other team. 

You have to  start by figuring out why you lost to all the  bad and  mediocre teams. 

If we play the texans healthy, we win. Doesn't matter about much else. Same with the jags last night. 

If we had Lewan, Ben Jones, and Nate Davis we are a different offense. Lewan over Daley alone is  such a game changing upgrade.  

Healthy  Tanny over Malik and Dobbs  is a big deal. Bud dupree and Landry to add more depth to our pass rush. David Long Jr. Molden. These guys may not be the best in the league but they  make our team work.

Those things killed us this year. We could have gotten away with  some shit if we had half of those guys.

31391,168869,168869,WhiteXHysteria,"TL;DR: Even andy reid makes boneheaded calls. Our roster wasn't loaded but was a topscoring offense until everyone got hurt or traded. And the raiders going from good to bad on offense was because their defense stopped getting turnovers and carr got back to his average self in turnovers eliminating many opportunites to score from the onset. Overall teh raiders offense was its *average* self under TD. 

TD is as ***average*** as they come. Should be gone in the next month for sure but hasn't been nearly as bad for the team as the s&c staff. 

-----
**An average OC wouldn't make boneheaded decisions**

I will start by saying Andy reid may be one of the best play callers ever and he still makes incredibly moronic decisions all the time. They lost the afccg last year purely because of a terrible play call he made that ended the half with 0 points instead of a guaranteed 3. [Seriously, check the situation and watch the play. Remember this game went to overtime.](https://youtu.be/nhtkNBDk31A?t=375).


--------
**Bad with a loaded roster**

Second, TD has never once had a loaded roster. His best roster was probably week 1 2021 and, well it is week 1 with everyone in a new system and your WR2 having missed all of camp because his hammy was made of chewed up beef jerky and an old cum sock. He still had us scoring the [6th most ppg](https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/points-per-game?date=2021-11-02) until AJ, Julio, and Henry all were on IR at the same time. This is a fact and cannot be debated. Our offense was GOOD when it came to the 1 thing that matters most. Putting points on the board. 

So even though the roster was far from ""loaded"" he was fine. Not exceptional but he didn't hold the team back. 

Then when everyone got hurt last year, or he was forced to rely on a terrible OL, rookie receiver(who looks good for a rookie) who missed most of camp and spent time on IR, and multiple backup QBs he of course did look bad. 

That is because he is **average**. When there is reasonable talent on the field he gets reasonable results. When there is bad talent he gets bad results. He isn't Kyle Shanahan or Andy reid so judging him with the expectation he would maintain a fringe top 5 offense with bottom 5 talent is just being ignorant to the situation.


----------
**The raiders tenure**

This is the long part, but you really have to go deepto get into the nitty gritty. 

People always scream ""but his raiders tenure."" His Raiders tenure is a PRIME example of how average he is. Let's learn what really happened with the raiders. 

We will start with why do people bhring this up. Well it is obvious on the surface, the raiders were the 7th best scoring offense in 2016 and then hired TD in 2017 and went to 23rd. Definitely bad on the surface, but was it bad or was it **average**? 

To start, we will go 3 years on either side of TDs year with the raiders. That goes back to when Carr became the QB and forward more than enough to have a pretty different roster. 

Their ppg rank over that time is 31, 17, 7, 23(TD), 28, 24. If you know anything about stats you quickly see 1 massive outlier. The 7. Their median ppg rank over this 6 year period is 23.5. TD, dead on that bitch. Their average ppg rank over that time is 21.7. Again spot on average even  when we leave the massive outlier in.

I usually attribute the 7 in the sample above to random luck. The raiders didn't have a great OC. They had Biull musgrave whose 2nd bestseason as OC brought the 14th highest scoring offense. So it wasn't like he was doing anything special. 

The main difference in the 7 and some of those other numbers were turnovers. The raiders were #1 that year in turnover differential when they were typically in the bottom 5-10, they seriousoly haven't had another year aboe 17 sinbce 2008 outside of the random year they were number 1!!! They got lucky. The ball bounced their way a lot and, as usually happens with those things, it regressed to the mean and the offense naturally went back to its average. The defense in the 7 year forced 30 turnovers and derek carr had his, still, career low in interceptions. The TD year the defense forced 14 turnovers. The year before the 7 they forced 24 turnovers. They had so many extra opportunities to score in the 2 years the offense was above 20 in ppg rank.",0.0,tennesseetitans,t3_104v6px,False,0.0,300 to link?,2023-01-06T18:36:47Z,tennesseetitans,0.0040894277290922

Very rarely are teams a QB away, get the QB and have it work out. The rams and kinda the bucs but the bucs also got other upgrades to come with their QB. 

That bucs team is kinda what most teams would hope for. You get an aaron rodgers and that makes other players come talk to our FO willing to take a little less money because we have the most important position handled for a year or two.

Anyone we bring in is going to be pretty similar or they will be gone in a year like MLF and have our players learning a whole new system. 

There has been no benefit to canning downing so far and a lot of downside to doing it because what top OC candidate is going to want to come to a team with massive injury issues that will fire the  OC for not being competent with 5 high school lineman(I love ben but he has been injured and I believe in NPF but he is a rookie) and rotating PS receivers every week with either our star RB or QB out in roughly half the games so far.

Firing an average OC in that situation mid-season just looks bad when you try to get top[ guys to come in later. Not many people want to uproot their family to go somewhere with no stability at all.

Most of the quarterbacks that you’re talking about forming the elite group of quarterbacks have been viewed as projects lmfao.

Pat Mahomes was viewed as a big project with wonky mechanics.

Justin Herbert was *hated* going into the draft, read any negative comment made about Levis, and I guarantee the same exact comment was made about Herbert.

Josh Allen is the biggest project of these but his case is kind of an outlier.

Lamar and Hurts both had big question marks as passers. 

Of all the recent QB hits, and of all the young top QBs, they all have great traits.

Personally, I think everyone here views Levis as a lot less polished than he actually is, and is a bit unfair to him as a prospect. I think we’d be more likely to find success with Levis than we would with Stroud.

My point with this is that RBs are the guys who do ho hum work, meant to grind out the tough yards and set up manageable downs.

Do they break off big plays from time to time? Yes, but their work load causes such wear and tear on the body that the ones who can consistently make big plays often are worn down by the time they’re needed the most at the end of the season.

On the other hand, top WRs put up chunk yardage plays on a more consistent basis and chunk yardage plays are what defines modern high scoring offenses. Therefore WRs are without a doubt more important, I mean just look at this list, Isaiah Pacheco is one of the most efficient playmakers in the NFL at the RB position and he’s more or less just a 3rd or 4th option on any given down because of the Chief’s passing attack.
