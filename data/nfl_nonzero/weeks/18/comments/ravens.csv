21458,125808,125808,Pheasantluvr69,"I didn't say anything about the valuation of the two picks, 
(though I think thats also kinda flawed, the outcome distribution of a second round pick is a reverse bell curve considering those scaling benefits you mention that you aren't just getting the rookie, you're getting to underpay him on a rookie deal have a counter weight: the opportunity cost of whiffing on that pick and selecting a bust, that 53 mill valuation has got be be extremely optimistic) What I was talking about is that simply adding their valuation of the picks to the value of the contract is implying that the act of trading those picks for him in the middle of the season makes no difference to the Ravens than if they were to simply give him that total value as a contract. 

For one that doesn't consider the nuances of free agency like I mentioned. Roquans value to us is very high, he took our defense from being a below average unit to the top 3, so not only is having him a tremendous value, losing him would be a tremendous cost. So securing the exclusive right to sign him to a long term deal is a competitive advantage that protects us from the contingency of him signing with another team leaving us with no Roquan. Which leads me to my second point that it discounts the scarcity of Roquan as an individual. First team all pro mlbs do not grow on trees. If we didn't trade for him, waited for free agency and didn't succeed to sign him, there wouldn't be an LB of comparable skill for us to acquire. Assuming that the sum of the value of his contract could be spent on other players and provide the same value to the team is foolish. If it was possible to keep 100 shit udfa MLBS on the roster, it still wouldn't provide as much value as Quan would at the same price. Obviously that hypothetical is a gross exaggeration, but the concept that I am trying to illustrate is that Roquans are not easy to find, the on field difference between him and the next best guy is big, not just the difference between him and the average LB, we aren't just going to be able to clone him and find a replacement to pay a cheaper contract. In that way the money and draft picks being spent on Roquans contract is providing more value than if it were savings, it is not going to be easy at all to transform the 2nd round pick, 5th round pick, and 100m cap into a player or players of equal marginal benefit.",0.0,nfl,t3_108q4yp,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2023-01-10T20:05:35Z,ravens,0.0753515811243395

That discounts the scarcity of Roquan as an individual and top 3 LB. If he took a deal from another team, we aren't just gonna be able to clone him and offer the clone a similar deal.

This is true, and while it's not on your typical box score, we can actually chart this thanks to a bit more advanced of a stat, yards after catch per reception. In terms of rankings and yards, Marquise's progression since rookie year has been 74/4.9, 76/4.7, 93/4.3, and 101/3.5. He has never been good at YAC, and he has gotten worse and worse, in spite of absolutely ludicrous speed.

(Fun fact: The top ranks of YAC per reception are dominated by RBs who catch dumpoff checkdowns and have a guaranteed 4-5 yards before a defender touches them because they're 4-5 yards behind the line, so typically sitting somewhere in the 30-60 range is good for a WR. Above that is excellent. Want to know where Deebo Samuel has sat in his four seasons? 14, 1, 4, and 6.

31402,177834,177834,ZombieFeedback,"It's not just about stats, it's about changing coverage.

Bateman and Duv both have lightning speed. Robinson and Proche and Wallace aren't slow, but they do not have the same kind of 4.30/4.40 speed those two do. That means defensive backs don't have to give as big of a cushion, because they don't have to respect the threat of getting toasted on longer routes, a threat that is ever-present given how Greg's offense uses outside receivers. That means less separation. By the same token, Rashod is over six feet tall and plays bigger. Robinson is our only WR who's over six feet unless you count Watkins and his three games as a Raven, and neither of them have nearly the same ability in any other aspects, especially in speed. (If DRob did, he wouldn't have been a permanent WR3 in KC. If Sammy did, we wouldn't have let him walk) Rashod can get more physical and aggressive with corners and win by doing so, and that translates to being able to beat tight coverage off the line, which, again, translates to separation.

All this means that even if he's not getting the ball thrown at him, Bateman shifts how defenses have to cover him. Safeties have to respect the speed, and that changes their positioning, which opens up completely different route combinations. Corners have to respect the size and physicality, which not only changes how you line up against him, but who you line up against him, because certain smaller corners are just going to get beat off the line by a guy with four inches and 30 lbs. on them, the same way we saw Hollywood get smothered by good physical corners because of how small he is if they could press him and keep him from jetting past them. This reduces the resources that can be focused on Andrews or Duvernay, because Bateman's physical toolset forces you to play differently than you would for Robinson or Proche, the two primary recipients of additional snaps after Rashod's injury.

Don't get me wrong, that doesn't excuse the mind-numbing state of the gameplanning and playcalling, or the front office setting the team up with such razor-thin depth in the first place. But Bateman's impact goes way beyond his yards and catches.",7.0,ravens,t3_106v47j,False,0.0, :19:,2023-01-08T22:38:28Z,ravens,0.0013469795746037
31403,177835,177835,ZombieFeedback,"Part of it is just plain bad luck with injuries. Pulling your hamstring will put you out at any position, especially with how soft tissue injuries can linger through the year, but that is a killer with a WR so dependent on speed. Bigger, stronger receivers could come back at 70-80% and play a shorter-distance role, but without his speed Marquise doesn't offer much. (Hence only passing five receptions or 50 yards twice and zero TDs in his five games after coming back from IR)

Part of it is that Lamar is just straight-up a better passer than Kyler. I don't think I need to explain that a guy so addicted to CoD that he has to have a study hall clause written into his contract and who has bragged in the past about not needing to study film isn't going to have the best field vision. (Tbf though Kyler *is* better than Colt McCoy and Dimes McSorley, who Hollywood was stuck with for the final stretch of the year)

Part of it is that Marquise just isn't a #1 WR in most schemes. As much as we complained about him, he was a perfect fit for Greg's offense at WR; its outside receivers are mainly used for chunk plays - the lowest we've ranked in air yards per pass attempt under Greg is 9th - and it relies heavily on TEs like Andrews here or Vernon Davis in San Fran for intermediate passes. In most other offenses, a WR1 is asked to break open with route running, which he's okay at but never been amazing, and to beat defenders with pure size or strength to win a contested ball, which we all know he just straight-up does not have the physical toolset to do. How much we asked him to do that was limited by-design, but in Arizona, he was asked to be a true #1, especially once Hopkins went down. Just look at how many of his routes are short or intermediate [out](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/charts/player/season/marquise-brown/BRO413218/2022/5/route) [in](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/charts/player/season/marquise-brown/BRO413218/2022/4/route) [Arizona](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/charts/player/season/marquise-brown/BRO413218/2022/3/route), [compared](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/charts/player/2021/marquise-brown/BRO413218/2021/2/route) [to](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/charts/player/2021/marquise-brown/BRO413218/2021/4/route) [Baltimore.](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/charts/player/2021/marquise-brown/BRO413218/2021/7/route) 

All in all it was a perfect storm of unfortunate circumstances for Marquise. He got hurt, his QB was a downgrade, but he was still better than a backup so he got *another* downgrade when that QB went down, and the injury to Hopkins forced him out of his niche and into things he is just not capable of doing. Meanwhile, his skillset was a perfect match for how Greg likes to use WRs, and I'm fairly certain that was a big part of why we drafted him over other highly-touted WR prospects in 2019 like Metcalf and AJ.

31407,177839,177839,ZombieFeedback,"So I got curious about this the other day and looked into it: The Ravens this year run the ball on first down about 70% of the time. If it's longer than five on second or third, it's almost always a pass. If it's less than five, it's almost always a run, and we've thrown it a grand total of 12 times all year when it's under three yards on either down. That's the full year, the stretch where Lamar and Duv and Bateman were all healthy is included.

If I could do this with Pro Football Reference and some boredom, you bet your ass every DC in the league can do it. You can look at the down and distance and make a pretty safe bet on what the Ravens are going to do, and they can probably get a much more certain picture with all the time and film they have to analyze their opponents that I don't because it's not my job. The scheme only works because the talent is that good. It is a frustratingly predictable symptom.

31412,177846,177846,ZombieFeedback,"There's no winning move here, but the NFL sure chose the dumbest one.

Forcing them to play is dumb because the Bills just watched their friend nearly die on the field, they're in no condition to go back out after five minutes, and neither are the Bengals because even if they're opponents, as we've seen this week, the NFL's a brotherhood.

Awarding either team a win is unfair because we didn't even finish a quarter and neither team should be penalized because of a freak accident.

Adding a 19th week and holding the game then punishes *both* of them, as well as arguably punishing the Chiefs because god knows all of us remember how rusty the Ravens were in 2019 coming off two weeks rest.

The coin flip is just stupid. It's not for the division title, that's Cincinnati's no matter what since even if they lose, 11-5 is a better winning percentage than 11-6. It's just for homefield, and just for that one game, so even if the coin flip goes in our favor, we're still the lower seed. If one of the tiny handful of scenarios play out where the Ravens and Bengals *don't* play next week, the Bengals will host in the divisional or conference round, regardless of the coin flip. It also means that if we play the winner of the AFC South at some point, it will be played in Jacksonville or Nashville, despite a reasonably realistic possibility that the Ravens finish 11-6 and the winner of that division finishes 8-9. The coin flip is literally just for the wildcard game.

It's stupid, and it literally just exists because the league wants to try and force us and the Bengals to go play for something this week instead of using it as a preseason game and resting our starters.
