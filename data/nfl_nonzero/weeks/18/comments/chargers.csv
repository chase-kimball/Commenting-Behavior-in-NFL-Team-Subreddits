446,966,966,-HawaiianSurfer,"I’m confused… we had nothing to gain with a win or a “*close loss*”. Staley wants to talk about momentum? Then he should have pulled the started after the 2 easy TDs we scored. If you wanted momentum, you got it. Instead (from what it looks like) we probably lost Mike for a week. The way he got off that cart and could hardly walk correctly could signify it’s a serious back injury. And for a guy who thrives off being a physical catcher, that’s absolutely deadly… Even if and when he does come back, he won’t be at full strength. Hoping to get info on him asap.

Staley was excellent the past 5 weeks, what he did with this defense and how it went from worst to first was nothing shy of incredible. The “*defensive wunderkind*” had arrived, but his weird, silly and foolish decision to keep the starters in is insanely difficult to understand and defend. It just feels like he killed all the good he did with this defense, with his decision to play all the starters nearly the entirety of the game. All I can think to myself is why? 

I don’t want to be a doomer, I really don’t. But this game killed a lot of the confidence, juice and cohesiveness we built the last 5 weeks. Players didn’t execute, players looked lost, players looked uninspired. I don’t like what this could mean for us next week. Jacksonville’s on fire. This team was too, until today.

If you wanna argue Staley is a better head coach than Lynn, fine. I agree with you. 

But saying that it is inarguable? That’s a much higher burden of proof to meet. The truth of the matter is that Staley’s first two seasons are similar in a lot of ways to McCoy and Lynn’s first two years: make the playoffs as a wild card one year, miss the playoffs while being just above .500 the other year. 

As far as context….. Yeah I get the Chargers had a ridiculous amount of injuries this year. The 2018 team that went 12-4 didn’t have Bosa most of the year either. It’s not like Lynn or McCoy didn’t have to deal with a shit ton of injuries. 

Lynn had to overcome taking over for a franchise that had just relocated and was playing in a 26,000 seat soccer stadium. 

If you wanna say Staley is a better coach thats fine, but I don’t think it’s inarguable. Staley hasn’t accomplished anything that McCoy or Lynn didn’t accomplish when they were here.

McCoy and Lynn both got playoff wins within their first two years here. Let’s see what Staley does in the playoffs this year.

I’m not fire Staley yet but if we don’t make a deep playoff run this year he should be coaching for his job next year in the last year of his contract. 10-7 is really not that impressive given the QB we have and all the other stars on the roster.

The point of running basic packages and not (completely) benching starters is that you need everyone healthy, including rotational (backup) guys.

History is full of examples of exactly the opposite! 

Slavery in the US had ""always been done this way"" for over 100 years! That still never made it the correct thing to do!

""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" was the law of the land for many years, until people realized it was a bad idea, even though, for many years, it had ""always been done this way"".

So whether something has been done ""the same way for over 5 years"" or over 50 years, has no bearing on whether it is the right thing to do or not.

The only logical answer is coaching. While he's probably getting another year just because we made the playoffs, Staley is in way over his head. Playing the starters today is the perfect example of this. You've made the show and your seed is locked, this game means absolutely nothing. If you want them to shake off rust or keep momentum, you play them for one or 2 drives. But NOPE, you played them 3 quarters and now 3 key starters are questionable going into the playoffs.

You guys took advantage of Bosa’s absence and we couldn’t move the ball effectively anymore. Trevor also played great and your run blocking was solid. Pederson utilized the short game well to counter the pass rush before Bosa went down. Towards the end, it became desperation ball, turning it over on downs multiple times.

My dad passed away suddenly in February of 2020 (not from COVID). He was the biggest Jags fan I've ever met. Had quite the collection of Jags caps that we set up on display at his funeral. He was so excited for the Jags to pick Trevor Lawrence #1 in the draft (I realize this is a year before that draft, he just somehow knew it would happen). He never got to see it. On one hand, he didn't have to see Urban Meyer. On the other hand he wasn't around for me to talk about it. 

While I chose my Chargers fandom young, when he passed I gained the Jags fandom I hadn't had prior. Sorry, but they sucked when I was a kid lol. I kind of feel like I have to root for them for him. My mom is the same way. She gained a passion for the team that was only an accompaniment prior.

Next week will be really emotional for both of us. I wish dad were around to see this game with us. The first NFL game I went to was Chargers @ Jags Thanksgiving weekend 2015 (you may remember Allen Hurns was hospitalized with a nasty concussion) that my parents took me to so we could see both our teams play. I'll be thinking of that. I'll be thinking of him. And how hopefully he's just as excited for this game as I am.

There’s more here as well, from 2018 to 2005. 

I’m pretty sure I could also look into teams who didn’t rest starters but had one bye week as a similar reference such as the Titans last year. I’ll see what I can find for one rest week.

Here is another one that goes back to 2005 but concludes in 2018. 

There’s still a very obvious pattern. 6-8 in the divisional round when the combined records were 244-60, whereas teams that didn’t rest starters went 25-8.


Now this is only for bye week 1 seed teams but that’s pretty substantial right there. 

You can also look at last years Titans and Packers as well. I think the Saints went 1 and done after the bye and the Chiefs almost did in 2019 after being down 24-0",0.0,nfl,t3_107pb8z,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2023-01-09T17:12:19Z,chargers,0.0110976851851851
49081,286066,286066,xThe-Legend-Killerx,"I believe so, but one could argue they are playing their starters in a meaningless game if they don’t rest them, which many don’t rest before the double bye.

So in cases like that many coaches choose to play their starters in scenarios where they wouldn’t need to. Only difference is one be two weeks off. 

I actually want to dig deeper and see what teams rested their starters without a bye and judge performance. 

Two weeks is obviously a big no no.

Probably sounds idiotic given the circumstances, but I’ve been in countless practices and games for that matter where you try to end on a good note. 

I don’t think the Williams injury was significant and I’m willing to bet Staley knew this on the sidelines. People are speculating because of the optics, but it wouldn’t surprise me if he got some kind of word that it wasn’t a significant injury.

You don’t want players getting hurt and I get that, but you also don’t want people coming into Jacksonville rusty.
