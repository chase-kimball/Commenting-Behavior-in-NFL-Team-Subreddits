Honestly I don't mean to trash you at all when I say this, but this is a very Californian take. I grew up in North Jersey where even small towns are dense and walkable, and to me SF's density makes it even more liveable. I use my car maybe once a week. Everything is within walking distance including my work. Why would I want to live in a place where it takes 40 min to get across town and I have to find parking? One of my favorite things about SF is that you get the perks of West Coast weather with East Coast density.

> People lack the understanding of where SF stops when they comment on it. It gets credit for stuff that's not in SF

But why does that matter in this conversation? You said a benefit of living in Nashville is close proximity to nature, I'd assume you don't mean within city limits? Even if you do, driving to hiking in Marin is still closer than driving to anywhere equally as beautiful within Nashville. You can't in one breath argue that ""a city is more than it's downtown"" and use examples of things within close proximity then in the next breath say ""people need to understand where the city limits stop"" and claim people can't bring up things in close proximity. You literally cited Alabama and the coast, two things that are multiple hours driving from the city of Nashville.

Having said this, I've been to Nashville multiple times for weeks on end and stayed with locals. I think it's a nice city and I liked the downtown area. I disagree that there's more to do in the city of Nashville or the greater metro area than there is in SF/the Bay.

8049,69059,69059,FuckTheStateofOhio,"> Also the “record when he has >X yards” is a very flawed stat, correlation =/= causation

Normally I'd agree with you, but the Giants have struggled to establish an early lead all season. It's not like we were jumping out to big leads and controlling the clock, we were in close games every week we won outside of the game vs Indy.

Also, the reason the Titans line ranks so low is pass blocking. They're actually ranked above the Giants by PFF in run blocking, albeit not by a huge margin.

Edit: because I was curious I looked up the splits for the other backs mentioned in games they were over/under 80 yards from scrimmage.

Derrick Henry: 6-6 over, 1-3 under

Nick Chubb: 7-7 over, 0-3 under

Josh Jacobs: 6-7 over, 0-4 under

McCaffrey: 7-4 over, 4-2 under

McCaffrey with SFO: 6-0 over, 4-1 under (only loss was in his first game to KC playing 3 days after he was acquired)

These teams definitely lose more when these backs have fewer yards from scrimmage but the dropoff isn't nearly as drastic as it is for Saquon. For McCaffrey there was almost no difference because the 49ers are a much better team overall that can easily absorb a bad performance by McCaffrey, while the Giants can't say the same.",1.0,nfl,t3_107dthb,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2023-01-09T18:26:30Z,nygiants,-0.0059328467366002

I'm gonna show my bias on this one, sure, but  Henry/McCaffrey/Chubb all have waaay better lines than Saquon did and I don't think the dropoff in offensive production would be as steep for any of those guys as it'd be for us losing Saquon. There's a real argument we might be a 3 win team without him popping off. He went through a bit of a slump around mid season (due to injury) and we were winless.

It's been one day. How do you expect people to react? It sounds a lot more high and mighty to say he deserves sympathy a day after he shoved a trainer in the back.

> I would say no we shouldn't call him a bitch for crying and showing emotion

This feels relatively mild? Besides, I would argue pushing a trainer in the back when he isn't even facing you to defend himself is absolutely a bitch move. It's also a bitch move to hurt your team with such a foolish and unnecessary emotional outburst.

> He didn't sucker punch him or some shit.

He pushed a trainer in the back who was not even facing him. Its extremely disrespectful. I'm not saying the guy deserves to die for it, but he absolutely deserves criticism and idk how anyone could watch what happened last night and less than 24 hours later try to defend what he did.

14497,126124,126124,Niccio36,"I was a child for both but I remember them very well. Not the same. I would say closer to 2011 tho because of the close games. 

I’m 2007, Eli Manning was a better QB compared to his peers IMO. They had a great pass-catching corps (Burress, Toomer, Steve Smith, Jeremy Shockey, and then Kevin Boss following Shockey’s injury). They also had the Earth, Wind and Fire RB group (Bradshaw, Jacobs, and Derrick Ward, and Rueben Droughns was the best RB4 in the league lol). The offensive line was a good veteran unit that was built together. 

Also the defense was excellent. The best front four in the league (Strahan, Tuck, Umenyiora, and either Alford or Barry Cofield). It just felt like a team of monsters. 

The biggest thing was that they could SCORE. They dropped 35 on the NFC 1-Seed Cowboys and the Undefeated Pats (yes they lost both those games but the defense also came up big when it mattered most). The defensive line could generate so much pressure just rushing four. The defense had a 12-sack game against the Eagles, with Osi getting six. 

Eli was the biggest x-factor and he had some truly great games but if he wasn’t on, the Giants were gonna lose. There was one game against the Vikings where he threw 3 pick sixes. He led the league in INTs, but also had several important game-winning drives that propelled the Giants to the playoffs. 


In 2011, the defense was actually the worst in the league by some metrics, but Eli put together his best season ever and was easily a Top 5 QB in the league. Also they had like 7 game-winning drives in the 4th quarter. 

I would say in terms of roster construction the team is closer to the ‘07 team (good defense, young QB with questions) but the games feel more like the ‘11 team (every win feels like a heart attack) but overall I would say those teams feel a lot different. It feels like we have to gimmick ourselves to every win which wasn’t the case. We can only score 24 points unless we’re playing the Colts. This is not those teams IMO.

Yes, the QB makes plays. Purdy made the pass, but he needs Kittle to get open. The success of plays doesn't just depend on the launch pad, the ball has to come down somewhere. And when you have some of the best players at their positions to target, it makes it more likely that the play will be a success.

And wasn't it Stidham's first NFL start? Defenses need tape on players to figure out how to counter them. It's hard for anyone to stop Waller, Davante and Renfrow, but add in an unknown at QB and it gets harder.
