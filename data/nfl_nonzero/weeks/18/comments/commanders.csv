- Percy Butler has been a solid contributor on special teams, but he‚Äôs currently in a backup role on D and it remains to be seen whether he‚Äôll find a starting role. About what you‚Äôd expect from a 4th rounder.

Dan Snyder survives the March owners meeting, more powerful than ever; releases a public statement wishing everyone a happy thanksgiving as he makes his standard semi-decade 1st round QB yacht pick. Trading 4 future 1sts in the process. 

The year ends with Rivera‚Äôs firing as he notches a disappointing 100th consecutive 7 win season, in which Chase Young literally loses a leg. 

A new head coach is defaulted into, to coach up a draft pick that he didn‚Äôt make.

The 1st round QB is benched a year and a half later and a veteran is brought in to steady the ship, as the team hovers around 7 wins for the next 3 years.

His faults can probably be improved in time and he could very well end up being a good OC somewhere.  It was clear though that his time in Washington needed to come to an end, especially after recent reports of him losing the locker room with several players laying blame at his feet for our offensive troubles.

From what I recall he had a reputation of being good with scheme but bad at play calling and tempo which was the same problem we had with Turner.

- I‚Äôd wager Turner is not fired due to timing of the sale. Dan would be signing off on paying some of his remaining contract AND paying a new coordinator at a time he has limited resources. 

- I agree a franchise tag is the most likely outcome for Payne, but he does appear to be Ron‚Äôs top priority going into the offseason. 

- A team can only designate 2 players to be post-June cuts, so we‚Äôd need to choose between Thomas, McCain and Roullier. I think only Thomas is a serious candidate. Most coaches/players seem to like what they have in McCain and Roullier (who is good but can‚Äôt seem to stay healthy). 

- I don‚Äôt foresee any restructures happening with this front office. Allen is maybe the only player who we definitely want to keep around long term who may save us money. Curtis is much more likely to be cut than restructured. I think after their stint together in Carolina and the past 2 years has proven that Turner cannot use Samuel effectively.

19815,166494,166494,TheFlameAlchemist54,"Rewatched these plays, and I came away even more impressed with Howell‚Äôs play. 

At least 50% of being good QB in the NFL is making smart quick decisions, and Howell did that almost every play last night. Look at some of the short throws to Jahan, Williams, and Thomas. They were quick, accurate throws which at least gave the guys a chance to get a first down. He also was quick to identify when he had a chance to run for a good gain. I only remember one play where he ended up getting tackled at or behind the line when he should‚Äôve thrown it away. 

His footwork looked good to me considering he‚Äôs from an open scheme which was run from shotgun mostly in college. His interception was not only a bad decision, but was one of the few throws where he had bad footwork due to pressure.

I‚Äôd like to see us bring on a QB consultant of sorts as well (not a vet QB unless he‚Äôll be 3rd string and just a locker room guy). 

I want a young QB1 (prefer Howell at the moment) and a young QB2 (drafted or traded for) taking game/practice reps all season long. Howell being QB3 for some of this season couldn‚Äôt have helped his development with the lack of reps. 

If next season doesn‚Äôt work out with QB, then we trade up for a top candidate in 2024.

That draft play is all dependent on what‚Äôs on the board at the time we (or someone wanting to trade with us) picks.

Quote: ‚ÄúIf a player is given a non-exclusive franchise tag, the team signing him must send two first-round picks to the team that tagged the player. However, there is no compensation for the original team with the transition tag if they refuse to match the offer sheet.‚Äù

And since you can only tag one player a season, it seems the Franchise tag is for highly desired players that will gain competing offers (like a Lamar Jackson), and the transition tag is for the mediocre players who might gain a single competing offer (kinda like what, unofficially, happened with JD McKissic and the Bills)?",3.0,commanders,t3_104zki5,False,0.0,Fuck Dan Snyder,2023-01-06T22:15:57Z,commanders,0.1108818911612034
