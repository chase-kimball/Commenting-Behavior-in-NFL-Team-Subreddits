Man, I have not been this excited since watching Heinicke in the playoffs against Brady. Unfortunately, TH doesn’t have the arm and escapability that Sam does. I’m happy this kid balled out and I really do think he’ll be our guy next year. Everyone wanted to write him off because:

*“Oh he was a 5th round pick”*

*“I’ll trust the 32 professional organizations that chose not to pick him early”*

*“Maye looks better than he did with the same supporting cast at UNC”*

I can’t wait to see what this kid looks like after a full offseason and a draft hopefully catered towards bolstering our o-line. I’ve been confident since April that we might have found our guy

- Dotson is a stud, but not so much so that pick 16 is a steal. 

- Phidarian Mathis tearing his ACL in the preseason was disappointing, but it’s unreasonable to call him a bust due to injury and he looked decent in the extremely limited time he was playing. 

- BRob is a great RB and gritty as hell for coming back week 4 after getting capped twice in the knee. He’s a steal in the sense that he’d probably should’ve went in the 60s instead of at 98, but I’m not sure if “got a middle of day 2 guy late day 2” really qualifies. 

- Percy Butler has been a solid contributor on special teams, but he’s currently in a backup role on D and it remains to be seen whether he’ll find a starting role. About what you’d expect from a 4th rounder. 

- Howell could very well be the biggest steal of the draft if he lives up to his 2020-21 hype and turns into a starter. That said, we’ve seen basically nothing from him yet, so he’s a nonentity right now (could change Sunday - who knows?)

- 3 other guys were picked (Cole Turner, Chris Paul, and Christian Holmes) who haven’t turned into anything yet, but for late day 3 guys expectations are already zero.

Dan Snyder survives the March owners meeting, more powerful than ever; releases a public statement wishing everyone a happy thanksgiving as he makes his standard semi-decade 1st round QB yacht pick. Trading 4 future 1sts in the process. 

The year ends with Rivera’s firing as he notches a disappointing 100th consecutive 7 win season, in which Chase Young literally loses a leg. 

A new head coach is defaulted into, to coach up a draft pick that he didn’t make.

The 1st round QB is benched a year and a half later and a veteran is brought in to steady the ship, as the team hovers around 7 wins for the next 3 years.

- I’d wager Turner is not fired due to timing of the sale. Dan would be signing off on paying some of his remaining contract AND paying a new coordinator at a time he has limited resources. 

- I agree a franchise tag is the most likely outcome for Payne, but he does appear to be Ron’s top priority going into the offseason. 

- A team can only designate 2 players to be post-June cuts, so we’d need to choose between Thomas, McCain and Roullier. I think only Thomas is a serious candidate. Most coaches/players seem to like what they have in McCain and Roullier (who is good but can’t seem to stay healthy). 

- I don’t foresee any restructures happening with this front office. Allen is maybe the only player who we definitely want to keep around long term who may save us money. Curtis is much more likely to be cut than restructured. I think after their stint together in Carolina and the past 2 years has proven that Turner cannot use Samuel effectively. 

- I like the idea of Dillard and Bush signings as young(ish) guys who profile as low risk high potential acquisitions.

19815,166494,166494,TheFlameAlchemist54,"Rewatched these plays, and I came away even more impressed with Howell’s play. 

At least 50% of being good QB in the NFL is making smart quick decisions, and Howell did that almost every play last night. Look at some of the short throws to Jahan, Williams, and Thomas. They were quick, accurate throws which at least gave the guys a chance to get a first down. He also was quick to identify when he had a chance to run for a good gain. I only remember one play where he ended up getting tackled at or behind the line when he should’ve thrown it away. 

His footwork looked good to me considering he’s from an open scheme which was run from shotgun mostly in college. His interception was not only a bad decision, but was one of the few throws where he had bad footwork due to pressure.

If we go that route at QB and tag Payne, it's going to be slim pickings elsewhere.  Even after cutting guys like Norwell, Logan Thomas, and Leno who are the top 3 cap casualties in my estimation.

I'd like Leno back if possible just due to his durability alone.  Payne, aside from being an elite player, is also super durable.

I’d like to see us bring on a QB consultant of sorts as well (not a vet QB unless he’ll be 3rd string and just a locker room guy). 

I want a young QB1 (prefer Howell at the moment) and a young QB2 (drafted or traded for) taking game/practice reps all season long. Howell being QB3 for some of this season couldn’t have helped his development with the lack of reps. 

If next season doesn’t work out with QB, then we trade up for a top candidate in 2024.

That draft play is all dependent on what’s on the board at the time we (or someone wanting to trade with us) picks. QB class is weak, so no point in trading up unless you can get Bryce Young or CJ Stroud, which wouldn’t make sense. I’d rather see us use our picks on BPA prioritizing Offensive Line > DB > QB

34267,273680,273680,ninjagruntz,"Based on that article (thanks for linking), it seems that one key difference is that transition tag considers top 10 salaries in the position whereas franchise tag considers top 5. This is why the transition tag is less money.

However another key difference is that the transition tag doesn’t include any picks, whereas a franchise tag does. If that’s true, I’m really interested in seeing an analysis of the difference in money compared to the difference in picks. In other words, wouldn’t we want to pay some money for two additional picks? Or am I looking at this wrong?

Quote: “If a player is given a non-exclusive franchise tag, the team signing him must send two first-round picks to the team that tagged the player. However, there is no compensation for the original team with the transition tag if they refuse to match the offer sheet.”

And since you can only tag one player a season, it seems the Franchise tag is for highly desired players that will gain competing offers (like a Lamar Jackson), and the transition tag is for the mediocre players who might gain a single competing offer (kinda like what, unofficially, happened with JD McKissic and the Bills)?",3.0,commanders,t3_104zki5,False,0.0,Fuck Dan Snyder,2023-01-06T22:15:57Z,commanders,0.1108818911612034
