Like if the Bengals win out and play the divisional in Buffalo, only to lose, that loss will be so messed up for the fans in my opinion. Cincinnati had the chance to control their way to the 2 seed atleast, only to lose a home-game for no fault of their own, and now must potentially play entirely away in the playoffs.

3186,27744,27744,CNJ339,"The Bengals were playing for three things on Monday:

1.	⁠⁠To clinch the AFC North outright over the Ravens. Giving them a division title and a guaranteed home game in the Wild Card going into week 18.
2.	⁠⁠A chance to control their way to the #2 seed, as they would have a tie-breaker over the Bills. This is a massive advantage in the divisional round.
3.	⁠⁠An opportunity at potentially grabbing the #1 seed if the Chiefs lost Saturday. Although its not likely, the Bengals would have controlled it if so.

With these scenarios none of that can happen. While the Bills do get fucked out of a first round bye, which is absolutely huge, they now have the advantage of playing basically only home/neutral site games until the Super Bowl. While for Cincinnati they now have to fight for the division on Sunday and potentially have to play all their games in the playoffs away.

I think most Bengals fans are upset about number 2. If they have to play that divisional game in Buffalo it would be an absolute shame. If Buffalo gets neutral site and home field games for what ""could have"" happened on Monday, then Cincinnati should too.

Sadly, this is not only NOT the first time this has happened, it's not even the first time it happened to the Bengals, or even the first time it has happened involving both the Bengals and the Bills.

In 1988, the Bengals had a super explosive offense, essentially based around no-huddle, which was revolutionary at the time. 2 hours before kickoff of the AFC Championship against the Bills, [the Bills changed the rules about being able to run no-huddle offense](https://www-cbssports-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-changed-rules-on-bengals-just-hours-before-their-last-afc-championship-game-appearance-in-january-1989/amp/?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=16730357556895&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbssports.com%2Fnfl%2Fnews%2Fnfl-changed-rules-on-bengals-just-hours-before-their-last-afc-championship-game-appearance-in-january-1989%2F).

Maybe it's unfair for me to be so bitter towards the Bills fanbase as a whole, but it's a hard pill to swallow to just keep pretending like we have a lot in common as like underdog teams when this kind of a situation happens. You compare a broken arm and a leg amputation, but that's not even close to being the same thing. The only thing y'all lose is the ability to control your own destiny with the 1 seed. You have a much better chance of getting the 1 seed than we have of getting the 2 seed, and from our perspective, we had a better chance of getting the 1 seed than the Bills, because we're very confident that our team was about to give the league a real statement game after being disrespected the past 2 seasons. 

We came out hot and everything was going perfectly. That sucks so fucking badly. If the situation was reversed and the Bengals were about to be down 14-3, I probably wouldn't be as upset, because our chances weren't looking great, but as such, everything was looking up, and then it all went to hell because our team made the right choice. I know you feel like you were slighted, but it's more like stubbing your toe vs having every bone in your foot shattered with a wrecking ball.  The league offered a few benefits to help you because you didn't get a fair shot at playing a full season, but Cincinnati got the opposite. Y'all don't know how deflating and defeated this makes us feel. We had everything going according to plan, and the NFL decided to screw this team so badly that the playoffs now look unmanageable. This team needs a rest  after all the injuries that have piled up, but they don't even get a chance to rest week 18 and sacrifice the 2 seed. This decision is so tailor made to take Cincinnati out of the playoffs.

 And even with all that adversity that this team has overcome and can potentially overcome, we still won't be acknowledged for that or respected. The Bills get the underdog story of overcoming adversity after getting the spotlight since the preseason and likely winning the 1 seed. If Cincinnati beats Buffalo, we'll be hated. We'll be the undeserving team that took down the favorites. I'm just so tired of this cycle, I'm tired of the team I love being consistently bent over and fucked at every opportunity.

Embrace the role of a run first QB, put weapons around that maximize the ability of a run first QB. A playmaking TE, physical blocking WRs (like a Lazard since he is the trendy blocking WR right now). Sure, get him a top 10 WR to pass to, but it can't just be any WR, it has to be a physical WR who can body a DB to make a catch (like an Anquan Boldin type).

If the NFL is going to consider the what-ifs of that game they better do it for ALL teams involved. The Bengals home field in the divisional round was completely dependent on the results of the cancelled game. I don't care if they are one game behind... If they beat BUF they are tied and have the tie breaker and get home field. Why do the Bengals not get their what-if scenarios considered? The NFL can't just change rules for some teams but not others. I wouldn't complain if they had just followed the rules for everyone or if they had made concessions for EVERYONE... Instead they favored the Bills for some odd reason. The bills could have lost to the Bengals just as likely as they could have won. And if BUF lost they are playing at KC...but the NFL ignored that what-if.

Long story short every team affected negatively by the cancelled game got something positive from the rules changes except for the Bengals. Makes no sense. I don't care about the semantics of why, nothing about this situation follows normal rules as soon as the NFL decides to change the normal rules.

And the fact the bills management said nothing and voted yes is absurd. They got their divisional home game revenue and a neutral site conference championship and basically said sounds good, who cares about the Bengals not getting the same considerations for the two seed that we got for the one seed.
