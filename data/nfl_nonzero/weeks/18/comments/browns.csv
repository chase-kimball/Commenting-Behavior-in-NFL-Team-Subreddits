It shouldn’t matter if you don’t wanna see that stuff, don’t participate in the discussion if that’s the case. Your job is to prevent the sub from being quarantined by Reddit, and I seriously doubt that talking about Baker is gonna get us quarantined.

Therefore that rule is just an archaic one designed by mods who want to limit certain content because it doesn’t fit their vision of the sub. But the sub isn’t just for you, it’s for all of us.

Just for reference, Davante Adams didnt eclipse 500 yards in a season until his 3rd year. Didnt eclipse 1000 yards until his 5th season and only had one 1k season in his first 6 seasons. Admittedly its a bit distorted since in his third year he was 3 yards shy of 1k, iirc, but you get the idea. 

The point is, especially with mid and late round guys, you have to at least give them an opportunity to develop otherwise you dont need to draft players at all.

Adding WRs for the sake of adding them is nonsensical.   

Going into the season Grant was planned to have a bigger role, he will get that opportunity this summer.

Meaning we have Cooper as the WR1, DP2 as WR2 and Bell/Grant as WR3. Grant can be effective as that speedy slot guy, Bell as WR4 and the big bodied backup to DPJ, Woods as the backup to Cooper and then Schwartz/Weston/Felton battling it out for WR6. Thats the status quo.

Wright/Winovich/Thomas will battle it out for DEs 3 - 5.

In shambles is exaggerated. We have a tremendous young core in the secondary - regardless of JJIII staying or leaving. With a new DC i can almost see JJIII staying for his experience and leadership. Plus maybe hell play more like his LA role again.

For the LBs JOK has been really good, durability is the concern here. Fields was pretty good too. Taki looked promising, he and Walker could get cheap 1 yr deals and be brought back for TC. Ragland was essentially BJ Goodson.

In an important year, the first season with their franchise QB, the FO will not go about re-shuffling the OL in that way. Especially not for a 2nd rounder.

Which brings me to a very bug logical fallacy in there: the assumption that a 2nd round pick is a guarantee to at least be at the same level.

Let me give you an example: Alex Leatherwood was a 1st round pick, a top 20 player and absolutely blows and is not on Wills level.

In other words you would get rid of a guy who you know is at the very least average, for the chance of playing the lottery with a 2nd round pick. So now you are left with a hole at LT and have one unproven guy in Hudson, who showed just as many highs as he had lows, and a complete unknown commodity in said rookie LT. 

Its literally the entire Desmond Harrison / Greg Robinson fiasco from 2018 all over again.

>I honestly would much rather someone use PFF grades then their own opinion, I don't really trust anyone on here to be better at judging a player than anyone at PFF.

It's a simple choice for me. 

Their process gives them a false sense of authority. Yes, PFF undoubtedly knows more than the average TV watching Joe from the Pub.

However, just because they are more knowledgeable doesnt mean they are right. They have their biases in their analysis, which become apparent if you listen to some of the PFF guys, and the start of the season where Mahomes wasnt even a top 5 QB showed the shortcomings of their methodology.

My point is.not to dismiss their findings, but use them in a supportive function and go from there. Eg with Baker id always used to first watch the tape without any data, stats or PFF input.

6m for a starting level LT is less than peanuts.

Regarding Hudson, ill preface this by admitting that i might be biased towards him since dating back to pre draft he was one of my favorite mid round tgts for us so i have a soft spot for him, admittedly.

That being said, Hudson is not proven and moving on from a good LT for the hopes of a lottery ticket, which Hudson is at this point, being better is bad practice. Anytime you have to hope that a replacement can even just replicate the current standard is already dangerous, especially when it comes to such an important position.

At worst hes average, which is not worst position to be in. And a player's development is never linear nor is it the same for any two players. Just look at Rashawn Slater and Garret Bolles - Slater has been elite from the get go, Bolles has been underwhelming for the first 4 years until randomly deciding to become elite in his 5th year.

Regarding Teller, i strongly recommend watching the tape. He put up some genuinely shocking tape this year, and that was both with Pocic and Hjalte at C. 

Generally speaking, Teller falls off a cliff in the 2nd half of a season pretty much every years since hes been here, but this year has been particularly worrisome.

Chubb's ""bad knee"" from his college injury magically never was an issue in his 5 years in the NFL tho. Funny how that works.

>is approaching the age that many running backs fall off a cliff. 

Also that study is from fantasy football where for a long time the thinking was that RBs at age 27 would fall off a cliff. 
But not only has this age moved closer to 30 since then but it was also based on volume, of which Chubb received comparatively little over the past 2 years, just saying.

Could he be washed next year? Sure. Could Mahomes have an Alex Smith type of injury? Sure. Creating these type of hypotheticals to derive a projection about a teams future is.. something.

>The payout was supposed to be a great quarterback on a long-term contract to go with a team that was built to win now

Okay first off, the Browns roster very much is not built to win now. I really dont know where this narrative even came from. Its such a weird thing to say too.

Now, what you do get right is that Watson is a long term play. The Browns had pretty much two options:

A) play another year with a QB they know isnt the guy in Baker

B) trade for a guy that has already proven he can be at the very elite level.

You have to keep in mind, that had the Browns played the year with Baker, we would now talk about how many draft picks they would give up to trade up and get a lottery ticket with a rookie QB.

Instead they used a similar trade volume and traded for a guy that has already proven to be at that level. So Watson was actually the more risk averse choice, which is something many seem to gloss over.

I get it, everything Browns related is evil, and every other team is high and mighty. Fine, whatever. But at least keep the sports aspect in perspective.",-8.0,nfl,t3_106wnws,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2023-01-09T02:35:52Z,browns,0.0001579624523245

For starters, personally, i would refrain from comparing ""normal jobs"" to these ""entertainment jobs"" (hollywood, pro athlete, singer etc) to begin with.

The payment of these stars is not founded in practical reality when you assume that financial compensation reflects status and value to society (which i dont fully agree with, but thats a very common sentiment in the US). However, following that hypothesis, doctors, first responders and scientists do have a perceived greater value to society itself. When there is a crisis it is those people we turn to for solutions, not athletes, singers or actors.

Now, that being said, there is a reason why throughout history rulers have placed an emphasis on entertainment of the masses - because an entertained populace is a distracted populace, it is a content populace and it is a populace thats easier to govern and rule. 
Bread and games for the masses, gigantic feasts and celebrations to please the populace and keep them in check.

Therefore you could make an argument that entertainers are ""allowed"" to be paid as much because they (unwillingly) play an important part for the true elites. Just look at the very common sentiment of ""shut up and play"" and to keep ""politics out of sport"" - sport or entertainment by extension is for many an escape to the realities of life but its also a distraction.

Because make no mistake, if there was serious puplic pressure the pay structures through all sectors would look entirely differently. No, that doesnt mean that everybody would be millionaires - that isnt entirely possible in a capitalist society which is built on people growing wealthier by exploiting others (and making them poorer in the process). But just look at the USs labor laws for example, especially in an international context when you compare them to other western industrialized countries. 

Americans are getting the short end of the stick and are, in return, being sold some idealistic vision, which the elite assures them really exists in the US, yet very very few have actually experienced.

We need someone who shows as much, if not more passion for the team, as some fans do. There were Browns fans (myself included) who went to watch this team in record breaking cold temperatures, and this team plays like they are there just to collect paychecks.

We have one of the most passionate fanbases in the NFL, but we get rewarded with Wills giving up halfway through a play; we get rewarded with Ward watching as DJ dashed by him for a near TD.

Out of all the awards, this has got to be the most subjective. 

Looking at Alex Smith's stats for 2020, they're worse than they were for like the previous 10 seasons. He had a hell of a recovery though. If that occured the same season as this, with Geno Smith doing so well, who would win the award? Geno Smith for drastically improving this year, or Alex Smith for defying the odds and even being able to play again?

I don't really propose that they turn it into 2 awards though, things will just get too crazy. If they change that then they might as well change it to MVP and QB MVP, along with 10 other award changes.",2.0,nfl,t3_10752mu,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2023-01-09T05:50:23Z,browns,0.0785300562939509

>

Maybe I'm wrong though. He did seem to step back a bit from being a control freak with Lovie so maybe he's learning.

23735,176202,176202,deviden,"I think the impact of GMs gets overrated in some areas and underrated in others. 

Generally, over time, they all bat around .500 in the draft (538 has done excellent analysis proving that in the long run nobody consistently outperforms the ""consensus big boards"" in the draft) and the worst things they can do are giving up too many assets in trades or too big/long contracts to free agents. 

Most of the players a GM brings in will be to fit the scheme of the coaches. The longer you have your coaches around the easier this job gets for the GM... but what if the coaches aren't good enough? Well then your draft picks and FAs underperform and you end up with a bunch of duds and hangovers who don't fit when you change coach. What if you've got a HoF track coach on one side of the ball? Well your drafting and FAs will sure looks a hell of a lot better.

What defines whether a GM gets fired or retained, over the long run, is whether or not they find a QB when they have the chance. It all flows from that - wins, coaches sticking around, making your draft picks work out over time. 

I like Berry, I think he has found certain efficiences in trades and contract structure, and there's a clear philosophy at work in the draft which over time should work more than it fails (acquire more mid round picks, spend them on young and freaky developmental athletes). At worst he's not a bad GM, given time maybe he could become very good? 

There's only a handful of GMs in the truly elite category, imo, and what they've all got in common is that they've been kept around in the job even when they've made mistakes (sometimes BIG mistakes). Howie Roseman (Eagles), Les Sneed (LA), and Brandon Beane (Bills), maybe Jason Licht in Tampa too; reserving my judgement on Micky Loomis until we see how he recovers from having no picks and no cap and no Sean Payton; Ozzie Newsome and the Steelers guy who just retired fit this until they left the league.

23740,176207,176207,deviden,"Gonna repost what I've said elsewhere about what defines good owners vs bad owners because those two decades in mostly in the basement falls into the ""bad owner"" category: 

Good owners:

1. Spend money on resources the team needs and retaining star players.

2. Provide a stable and enjoyable environment/culture, so players and coaches like working there.

3. Provide job security for coaches, so that the best coaches are willing to uproot their families and move to [city].

4. Hire and retain the right head coach, GM and QB trio - that's how you get to...

5. Have a team that's winning lots of games, year after year.

6. Are generally not often caught up in scandals that bring shame to the franchise, team, coaches, players and fanbase.

Bad owners are missing most of the above. Most owners don't have all of those going for them at any given time but good owners do have most of those boxes ticked.

The thing is... to get box 5 ticked (which is the one that most people pay most attention to) you've usually got to have box 4 ticked, and to get box 4 ticked you've got to get at least two of 1, 2 and 3 ticked, and for a HC and GM to have the sustained success that keeps them employed they've usually got to get a franchise QB in the building.

When you have the QB, HC and GM you will win more than you lose and as an owner all you need to do is keep those guys employed and not get in a scandal, then you become ""a good owner"". 

What I will say for the Haslams is that they're trying to become good owners, even if they're not yet. They spend money, they have made a (morally and ethically dubious) push to get the QB, they are trying not to fire everyone every couple of years any more, and the team is hovering just above .500 and has a playoff win since the Freddie/Dorsey disaster year.

If Watson works out, if Berry is kept around, if Stefanski is given enough tenure that the job looks inviting to a better option (or works out great with Watson and stays), and the Haslams stay out of the news... they'll start to look like good owners.

Watson (or any QB) can only participate in team-organized workouts of any kind during the CBA-approved times of year, which means that for QBs most offseason work is with their private coaches.

Teams can give a QB the playbook, they can highlight areas they would like the QB to work on, they can define the team's priorities for the QB but outside of the CBA's windows for team activities they cannot control what any player does. The norm is for QBs to work out with private QB coaches the rest of the year. Non-QBs won't do any work outside team acitivities aside from working out at the gym or a few private drills.

I hate being put in a position where I have to defend Watson for anything but the fact that he has private QB coaches at least puts him ahead of Baker's ""I don't need someone to teach me a three step drop"" offseason work ethic (since joining the Browns, Baker only started private QB coaching after he was dropped at the end of the '21 season).

Can we guarantee that Watson's private coaching will work out?

2. How he played in 2020 that he should return to form; and 

3. The extenuating circumstance (the suspension) that dominated this season won’t be a factor next year.

If it's 5-6 years from now, it's because he's underperformed. And in that case, you'd have to consider what the other options were at the time.

36147,254686,254686,themitey1,"I always find judging ST play to be difficult.  Because usually ST is made up of the bottom of the roster guys, barely holding onto their spot on the team.  So in the past, I always thought ST is a reflection of the overall depth of the team, moreso than coaching.

That being said, I would be happy to see a new coach in ST, as Priefer's unit hasn't been good, especially early on in the seasons.  But, I also thought there's a chance he comes back because him and Stef get along so much that Stef let him sub in as the HC during the Covid playoff game.  That displayed the trust/respect they have between each other.

But as far as I’m aware, he is accused of misleading women online by using his profile to contact them, “hiring” then providing a neutral site at a hotel room provided by the Texans under a false name, signing NDAs preprinted by the Texans, “consent” to “massage”, then escalating coercion or non violent pressure for - and sometimes receiving sexual acts. 

Money exchanged, NDAs signed, time passes, the Texans bury any rumblings and play deshaun at safety in practice violating the NFLPA, BoBs incinerating the Texans from the inside- bye dhop bye jj. Deshaun requests trade, browns purchase rights at ransom fee from the Texans.
