Only here, it’s that instead of Cincy and Buffalo being in the same division, they’re in a weird state of playing fewer games than everyone else — so Cincy would need to leapfrog Buffalo first (which requires a Bills loss) before they can win the tiebreaker against KC?

Like I guess for resolving the Bills vs Bengals seeding, they don’t consider any hypothetical outcome for the Week 17 game and just resolve the seeds normally (which Buffalo wins if they win Week 18 just by superior record). But then if Buffalo loses and Cincy is the 2 seed (I believe via SOV tiebreaker), then they consider the possible outcomes of the MNF game and determine that Cincy could have then been the 1 seed.

I know the real answer is that the Bills and Bengals played the same number of games so the NFL feels fine applying typical seeding procedure. But at the end of the day, that MNF game (1) likely would have decided who was the higher seed between the two of them and (2) was widely considered to be a 50/50 coin flip kind of game.

I get that the coin flip for deciding the entire outcome of the game is a little silly because of how it would randomly impact the outcome of other races, but in just the context of Bills vs Bengals that would seem so much fairer to me.

>We've tested both Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes using cognitive science measures that capture the split-second decision skills needed to play. These guys are wired differently than most humans, and they are elite in the NFL. And despite both scoring in the upper 90th percentile range on The S2 Eval, they bring slightly different cognitive skills to their games. Just one example - Burrow is off the charts in how fast he can notice subtle tendencies and cues of the defense and in his ability to track how and where players are moving across the field, while Mahomes is off the charts in his ability to quickly scan and locate targets amid visual chaos and in the speed with which he makes and executes improvised reactions.

16939,122545,122545,Nickppapagiorgio,"California has a high pressure system that parks itself off the coast for about 6 to 8 months out of the year, and directs almost all incoming storms north to the PNW and British Columbia, or south to southern Mexico and Central America. This period coincides with the summer in particular, but also later spring, and early fall. Typically there is zero rain during this time period, barring a freak storm coming around this from the south which happens less than once every 10 years.

In the winter months, that high pressure system breaks down somewhat, and storms coming off the Pacific can reach the state where they typically make a beeline for the Sierra Nevada mountain range, because its high elevation ranging from 12,000 to 14,000+ feet pulls in storm systems, and results in a ton of snow being dumped up there. The Donnor Party got stuck up there and resulted to cannabilism for a reason. The snow pack is big, and storms are frequent.

For much of NFL history, rainy weather was something that had to be dealt with in the 2nd half of the season for California teams. Increasingly in the last 20 years, that high pressure system is holding for longer than it used to, and forming more regularly in the winter months which is resulting in less rain, and more drought.

The 49ers won the NFC West this year, so these 2 games in 2023 will be against the winners of the NFC South and NFC North. Home and Away is also rotational for these games. The rotation varies by division. For the NFC North, the NFC West has an Away, Away, Home, Home rotation. For example, the NFC West had a single home game against the NFC North in both 2019 and 2020. They played the entire NFC North in 2021. In 2022 and 2023, the NFC West plays single road games against the NFC North. For the NFC East and NFC South, the rotation is Home, Away, Away, Home, or the reverse of that.

- With the expansion to 17 games, the NFL added an extra game against an AFC opponent. This opponent is against the division you played two years ago. For example, the NFC West played the entire AFC South in 2021 and will again in 2025. Therefore, they play a single game against them in 2023. That opponent became the Jaguars when they won the AFC South tonight. Home and Away is determined by conference, and rotates. In the first year of a 17 game schedule, the AFC got the 9th home game, and all these games were played at the home of the AFC team. In 2022, the NFC team got the 9th home game, and they were all played at the home of the NFC team. In 2023, the 9th game is back to the AFC which is why the 49ers must now travel to Jacksonville in 2023.",31.0,49ers,t3_1069epr,False,0.0,:mertonhanks: Merton Hanks,2023-01-08T01:49:11Z,49ers,-0.0008372101046426

The 49ers played like shit and narrowly held on for a win. Finding a way to win on the off days is what's important.

Focusing on the 49ers game last week, first focus on the positives. The 49ers offense put up 34 points in regulation and 37 total. That's always a good day. They scored on 6 out of 10 possessions, with a missed field goal. Turned the ball over once, and ultimately only had to punt twice all day. There's things to clean up but it was a solid performance, one the 49ers don't normally need, but on that day they did.

Yes the defense was a fucking mightmare. They let the Raiders inside the SF 2 yard line on the first 5 possessions. That's bad even if you're the worst defense in the NFL facing the best offense. They tightened up though. The final 6 drives resulted in 4 possessions with no points, and only 10 points total. Adjustments were made. Yes the continous big plays given up need to be addressed, buy I'd be more concerned about a repeated failure to even get an opposing offense to 3rd down, and just getting pushed around all game, than a few big plays given up, as well as a few untimely 3rd and longs converted.",4.0,49ers,t3_104tlz4,False,0.0,:mertonhanks: Merton Hanks,2023-01-06T17:14:28Z,49ers,0.0200155958371697

Qb’s have worked our asses in all sorts of instances. Especially short little 5-7 yd outs. McCoy, Dalton, Stidham all had a few diff stretches where they looked fantastic. Where we’d get no pressure. 1st half of the Charger game same thing. We bent and only broke a little in those games (last week not so much). Had D injuries so maybe in playoffs everyone’s back, pressure becomes more frequent and the D looks more like their rankings say. But there’s plenty of reasons to worry about how bad the Raiders look this week compared to last week, and it ain’t just “they’ve had a week to scout Stidham” Packers have the no one believes in us vibe going, they could be as dangerous as people are making them sound.

That was the arrogance I was talking about. It's not like he didn't do the work like what happened with Kyler Murray. He was being a dick to the media and unjustifiably arrogant.

Those throws against Arizona? That was all Geep Chryst designing high school level passing plays. Greg Roman and Harbaugh would never do that stuff. Even Harbaugh a couple of weeks later (he was in his first year at Michigan) mentioned our poor pre-snap coaching (it was obvious the 49ers were the team he was talking about). He said ""I wathced this NFL game and we never coached like that"". No QB is blameless with INTs but let's slow the roll on blaming that disaster of a game plan and play design on Kap. We all have legit beef with GRo for not running Gore at the 5 yard line vs BAL but he was a hall of fame coach compared to that weak ass offense Tomsula and Chryst designed. 

Harbaugh had every right to get into Jed's face because good owners don't butt into meetings. You never hear of Bob Kraft doing this with Belichick or Kronke getting into McVay's space. Even Mark Davis let Gruden and now McDaniels work without butting in. Jed made the dumb decision to fire the wrong guy. Instead of letting that comment go and firing Baalke who destroyed our roster, he fired the best coach we had since Walsh & Seifert. Jim was right, Jed was a man child with a fragile ego and Jim didn't owe him anything. He had already made his bones as a coach at Stanford before he turned down more money from Miami to coach us.

I still remember that multiple pick six game vs Arizona and everyone screaming as if it was all on Kap. He never had these games under Harbaugh because a good coach knows to plan around his players weaknesses (like Kyle Shanahan and Jimmy G the last few years). 

Once again I'll reiterate: Kap was not without flaws. He had an arrogance about him that was premature and needed a coach like Harbaugh to guide him and maximize his positives.

Kap’s career arc has more complexities than fans care to consider. There was no proof (only rumors and media attacks) that Colin didn’t want to improve his QB skills. Not a hint from his teammates or his coaches even years after the events that ended his career. Kap was another version of Michael Vick but he needed time and stability in his coaching staff. He was a lot like Jalen Hurts in that way, a QB who relied a lot on his athleticism but with time and coaching stability Hurts developed into an MVP candidate this year. The 49ers had the best offensive line in the NFL in the Super Bowl year vs the Ravens: Staley, Iupati, Anthony Davis etc. Alex Smith was suddenly a great passer and playing the best football of his career before the concussion. The reason he improved so quickly was Harbaugh's coaching and because the GM before Baalke built the Oline and gave him time to throw. Kap benefited from the same thing. Neither Kap or Alex had the lightening fast scan and throw superpower that hall of fame QBs have. They need things around them to work well for them to perform. Even elite guys will crumble without a good Oline (look at Mahomes in the Super Bowl vs Tampa). 

Kap had a very weakened Oline after the SB year and after Harbaugh was fired it got worse.  The new “talent” was draft busts and terrible journeymen (Brandon Thomas, Marcus Martin, JMart, Zane Beadles, and on and on). Tomsula didn’t have the cred to bring quality coaches like Harbaugh, and Chip Kelly didn’t help either with his predictable offense. The dip Kap’s performance took after Harbaugh was fired was shocking and way past humbling. And that’s before he took a knee which he had every right to but because he wasn’t good at PR the media lied about his motives and fueled the abuse and threats against his life.

Kap made mistakes no doubt but he was never uncooperative or a hateful dude. He didn’t deserve what happened to him. So many QBs and other players with far more serious screwups and crimes kept on playing in the NFL.",16.0,49ers,t3_108izm7,False,0.0,:jerseyaway07: Colin Kaepernick,2023-01-11T03:40:23Z,49ers,-0.0116496157205857

The entire o is predicated on the run which our OL is healthy and CMC and Mitchell are both healthy.  Similarly Purdy doesn’t do much crazy stuff like forcing it on O.  He’ll settle for check downs and to our YAC bros that’s awesome.

The reason the niners have won a lot though with and without Brock is our def and that shouldn’t really change for the playoffs.

We haven’t faced a team with two healthy elite wrs and a good running game like the eagles yet so the eagles will be a test.

41024,290953,290953,psykodeth,"While I understand why folks don't like the idea of Purdy being RoTY, I still think he should get it. If any top seed playoff team had to rely on their 3rd string to make the playoffs, I doubt it would happen. 

Now, I recognize that he hasn't played many games, the games he has played he has been awesome to watch. The fact that the last pick of the draft is able to come in and arguably improve the offense is unheard of. He is 1st in damn near every QB stat through the last 6 games. 

The other rookie candidates are pretty awesome to watch as well. For a guy to get 1k yards rushing or receiving in their first season is impressive but they had an entire season to do it. Not to mention they were drafted pretty high so the expectation was there. 

Brock Purdy wasn't supposed to be drafted. Other GM's wanted to sign him undrafted. Qb's like that rarely ever go beyond the practice squad. Let alone take their team to the playoffs.

If you want to make the argument that the 49ers roster is stacked and it's the system, or it's Shanahan calling the plays, it would be hard to argue with that. You are right.

But I ask, would Josh Rosen do what Purdy has done? What about Josh Johnson?

If Purdy doesn't win the award, I won't be upset. There have been several rookies this season that deserve it. Hate me all you want, downvote me into karma hell. I don't care. Ima stick with my guy Purdy!",5.0,nfl,t3_109f8en,False,1.0,:49ers: 49ers,2023-01-11T15:25:11Z,49ers,-0.000969550704651
