Theyve seen him running the scout team and that means they've seen him play in a lot of different ways. He will certainly lack chemistry with the starters early but to suggest they don't have a good assessment of his strengths and weaknesses is not something I'd agree with.

He's thus far did everything he needs to in order to get the start in week 1 barring any crazy trades or trade ups in the draft.
