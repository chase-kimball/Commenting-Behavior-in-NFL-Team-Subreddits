1834,14184,14184,B9Canine,"Your statement is fair based on *rumors*. We still don't know if Caserio really wanted McCown or if he was Easterby's guy (that's another F'd situation he inherited). 

As far as draft picks, you're right. Caserio is on record as drafting players as much for character as skill. While I'm not sure that's a luxury a GM can have in the modern NFL.. I also don't fault him for it.

Flores sued because he thought his interview was a sham, which may or may not be true. The rumor is Caserio was interested in Flores. And even if it was a sham interview, that's part of the Rooney rule. Which takes us on an entirely different tangent. While the Rooney rule means well (placing minorities in front of FO personnel and practicing interviews) it comes with inherent problems (forcing teams to interview minorities even when they know who their guy is... eg Daboll). And I believe the current rule is TWO minority candidates. So, even if you want to hire the first minority candidate, you still have to interview a second and waste their time. Minorities can accept their time may be wasted for the ""greater good"" or we should do away with the rule (at least pare it back to a single minority candidate).",8.0,nfl,t3_106u8px,False,0.0,:Texans: Texans,2023-01-08T20:14:37Z,texans,0.0400031611448907

Then Watson demands out, then we find out he's a serial rapist. Caserio deftly navigates the situation and gets 3 firsts plus for said rapist. He finally had a full card of picks in '22 but still no cap space for FA. 

Culley was hired in '21 to be a tank commander and was fired to be replaced with Nick's choice, only for Flores to fuck things up with his lawsuit. This forced Caserio to hire Lovie, who was never in Nick's plan. 

Caserio inherited a shit sandwich and has had a lot of tough breaks beyond his control. Blaming our failures on Nick is BS. I think he's done a nice job considering the circumstances.

The Texans have sat at the bottom of the 'desirable list' and that affects who you can even get to take the job that's offered. 

Furthermore, we had issues last year with Gannon and Flores. It's possible that Gannon wasn't hired because of the Rooney Rule drama that was afloat. Flores couldn't be hired cause he had just sued the NFL. Lovie was a plan D. 

I think Nick has something lined up, and/or he knows it took too long last time and he's trying to move quicker this time. Either way, he better nail this hire. 



We still suck, but at least we have a story to tell, something to sell a potential head coach hire.

Mills has been inconsistent, but some of that is on the team around him and a lot of it is the play designs being absolutely terrible. We don't ever really attack the middle of the field or give Mills good checkdown options to deal with the pressure that opposing teams were bringing. It also doesn't help that he was rarely allowed to get into a rhythm.

14925,116467,116467,Pugageddon,"I still think that Mills could have put it together on a different team. When the line held for more than a half second and we didn't throw a screen pass against a team who was scheming guys close to the line because they could, Mills was at least an average quarterback. The situation here was godawful for a QB this year. No interior line, our center was on his ass multiple times this year and our left guard was lost. Play calling that seemed to deliberately limit the QB and keep him iced when he was doing well and that didn't really scheme guys open and put the ball in the hands of Rex Burkhead in too many critical situations despite it having line a 15% success rate. Receivers who weren't getting open before Mills needed to throw (some of this goes back to play calling, some of it is the invisible o-line), lots of easy catches landing in the dirt on early downs, and on what felt like every successful bomb, a holding call from the line. It felt even worse to watch him because all of the above meant that he was damn near constantly being put into 3rd and long situations and getting blitzed because the other team knew that 3 guys up the middle could flush him out so we either had him throwing to the sideline under pressure (but never bothered to improve his mechanics so he could be accurate on those throws) or threw the screen and expected the WR to run for 20 yards when every team in the league knew it was coming.   


TLDR: Mills may still be mid+ but our entire offense was a shitshow elevated for most of the season by elite play from Tunsil and Pierce

&#x200B;

Now, do I want Mills to be our QB1 again next year? Not unless he earns it. If we don't draft Bryce, then we need a Jimmy G or Derek Carr type to come in and push him and if he wins the camp battle (MF'r better work on his mechanics this offseason) then to mentor him. Even if we don't take Bryce, we need to grab SOMEbody in the draft who can challenge for starter whether that is a guy like Richardson/Hooker/Levis that we'd have to take early or we go for a later round guy like Ward/McKee/Rattler/Tualia I don't know, and we don't have the right information to guess yet.",6.0,texans,t3_105fc1b,False,0.0,:doodle16:,2023-01-07T02:59:09Z,texans,0.064039176283067

20946,160919,160919,Wiseguy888,"Agree. I know the argument is that they weren‚Äôt really given the tools to succeed, but what organization would have given any of these coaches the keys to the long term future of their team? 

I loved RAC and respected both Lovie and Culley, all three are widely respected, but it‚Äôs unrealistic for anyone to expect them to be the long term solution based on age alone (RAC is 75, Culley is 67 and Lovie is 64). 

It‚Äôs unfortunate that giving them a chance and/or honoring their careers in the NFL is viewed as a complete negative. 

I also think whether they were black/white/Asian/Hispanic/Mexican or any other race/ethnicity that this should be a meritocracy. 

The NFL has implied with certain rules that it wants to make (or appear to make) minority hiring a priority. I don‚Äôt think anyone expected this to change overnight. It is a work in progress, as is everything in society right now. 

I think there are some very strong minority head coaching candidates this year that I would hope get the chance they deserve. Hopefully one of them chooses here as I‚Äôd love for that to happen. I doubt they will with the negative rhetoric, but maybe they understand the business side more than we do. 

In the reverse scenario, what if we had hired some old shitty white head coaches instead and fired them immediately instead? People would instead criticize the Texans for not hiring a minority candidate so it‚Äôs a lose-lose battle, unfortunately. I think anyone who accepted the role knew it was a long shot but wanted the shot. Lovie was a respectable coach but he also hasn‚Äôt been a good coach in a long time.

Despite all of the above, which I‚Äôm sure some may take in a negative light, I think this head coaching position is much more appealing than it has been in recent years. 

The new head coach will have the opportunity to draft a new QB (or Carter/Anderson) of their choosing (within reason due to our last minute reason). They also could go defense and wait until 2024 and tank one more year. They will have ample cap space and considerable amount of picks with a blank canvas and low expectations.

West Coast I think you need better fundamentals and mechanics to drop back and get the ball out quickly but Mills didn't have much of that this year. Also if you OC is going to scheme up for specific players to get open then they have to win that matchup reliably, which also didn't happen. I'm not a coach or scheme guy so take what I say with a grain of salt. It's pretty much my opinion based on the eye test and the very little I know about these schemes.

Yeah I think Mills can be a legit starter but it takes two years to evaluate a QB in a new system and we don't have two years.

If we fire the coaching staff and get a new one if theres any question marks at the end of next season we would 100% take QB, and if we stick with Mills in a new system there is GOING to be question marks.

Now, we have the capital from the Watson trade, freed up a lot of cap and got rid of bad contracts, got rid of easterby, and Caserio has hit on some really promising young pieces in Stingley, Pitre, Pierce and have ample cap room to upgrade the roster swiftly.
