So far trading picks has gotten the Rams Stafford, Ramsey, Von Miller, etc. I'll spend a little more to GAURANTEE I get a guy like that (Brian burns) as opposed to the overwhelming percentage of players from the first round that bust.

And I guess I slightly disagree with your last statement too. Winning in 2026 is just as important as winning in 2022. But you don't know what roster you're going to have in 2026. You know this roster is ready to compete right now. So add to it and keep competing. Sitting on a box of maybes when you have a guarantee contending roster core right now just doesn't make sense in my opinion. Once the current score starts to diminish then you start using your draft picks to replace them.

2, McVay turned down a giga contract to be a commentator and he could pick practically any team in the league to coach for. He's not sticking around for a post AD99 rebuild. He'll bounce like Sean Payton.   So there's a good chance we see some regression at the coaching level too.

I believe actual protest can create change, words without action are worthless. 

With respect to debunking my claim that disengaging with the NFL would cause change, it's just common sense. The NFL is a profit making entity. If a large subset of people stopped tuning into the NFL in protest of their lack of action against perpetrators of rape and domestic violence, the NFL would take action to regain that viewership. To argue the contrary is to say that if a large subset of people stopped watching the NFL for a specific reason, the NFL just wouldn't care that their viewership and subsequently their profits dropped and would do nothing about it. Certainly you don't believe that. 

With respect to the protest and it's affect on ratings, [a poll was conducted during the 2016 season](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/social_issues/are_americans_tuning_out_the_nfl_over_protests), and a third of viewers said they were less likely to watch a game because of the protests. Once again, there's no direct proof that this sentiment actually translated into the ratings drop for the two seasons that the protests were allowed to go on, but there's also no proof to the contrary. 

Your ""evidence"" is just a Vox article with broken links and a thesis that we know isn't true, that ratings were down on account of cord cutting, considering ratings bounced back in 2018 which happens to be the first season that the NFL banned players kneeling on the field. 

Money is all that matters to the NFL. They don't care if you don't like them. They don't care what jersey you wear or what team you watch as long as you're wearing one and watching one. You can continue to speak out on reddit, but doing so is priceless engagement to the NFL and just further lines their pockets and the pockets of their players including ""pieces of shit like Hunt and Watson"".

He's 5th all time in passing yards per game, 11th all time in total yards, 12th in passing touchdowns, 11th in passes completed, 5th in 4Q comebacks, and a lot of other various stats like that. He was wasting away in Detroit and he should have made the pro bowl more times, but when you're a Lion and never on primetime, making the pro bowl (a popularity contest) is hard. Remember the season he 5000 yards and 41 td's and didn't make it? That is a ridiculous outcome, and although he didn't always have seasons like that, he had other great seasons that aren't recognized because his teams were all-time garbage. As the voters of the HOF become younger, I expect them to switch to a more analytics based model like we expect to see with the baseball HOF, which massively benefits him. However, winning a super bowl remains huge towards his case (even if he didn't win MVP). When you look at similar players according to pro football reference they cite Bradshaw, Namath, McNair, Jim Kelly, Alex Smith, Tony Romo. Three of those are Hall of Famers, and Stafford is only 34 years old which is still a relatively good age for a pocket passer.
