Did we have close wins? Yeah, how many years did we have close losses? Have things gone how we wanted?

Not even close, and why is that? Because we drank so much koolaid we thought it would be 45-0 every week.

It’s the NFL, things never go your way, take the punches and roll with them.

We have so many injuries , with the most important ones being Herb with broken ribs, our center only playing 2 full games, and our LT is out, along with wr 1-5 being hurt or not fully healthy.

The defense is rough, but this staff has made changes both this year and last year, touch changes, benching JC, Nas, last year our run D before the bye week was pretty much dead last, and after the bye, middle of the pack.

Y’all want Lombardi gone? For who? Who on the roster can take his spot? How about we replace him with Sean Peyton, the guy who runs the exact same offense.

I’m not yelling we’re going undefeated from now to the SB but everyone crying how we should burn everything down at this instant is wild .

Take a breather, get off social media, and support this team.

If we don’t make anything of this team by the END of the year then we can have conversations.

The sheeps last year sent 12-5 during the season and the bucs went 11-5 , the patriots 2019 went 11-5.
