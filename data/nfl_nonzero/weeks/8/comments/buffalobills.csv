13450,79887,79887,ItsYaBoiSoup,"Bills do nothing today. Chiefs waive Patrick Mahomes to draft his clearly better evil twin Matrick Mahomes. He looks suspiciously like his brother just wearing a fake curly mustache. Chiefs go on an absurd run of blowing out opponents since DCs are now confused since they do not have years of tape on Matrick Mahomes. People begin to laud them as the best offense of all time, they start covering the spread while being favored by 21 in the last 4 games of the season; running roughshot all the way to the AFC Championship game in Buffalo.

&#x200B;

Bills beat the Chiefs by 70 points in the AFC Championship game and Matrick Mahomes reveals himself to indeed be Patrick Mahomes wearing a curly mustache and retires on the spot. Chiefs go into ruin for the next decade. Bills win the next 7 Super Bowls. Patriots go winless next year. The folding table industry goes parabolic, stocks on Coleman go through the roof while r/WSB gets rich off the resulting fallout.
