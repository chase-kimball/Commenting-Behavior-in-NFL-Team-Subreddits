As for the timely investments, during Josh Allen's freshman and sophomore seasons, the Bills were as frugal as possible around the skill positions so that when the time came, they would be able to go out and sign marquee players like Diggs, Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer.

Now, with nearly half of the season in the rearview mirror, it is difficult to deny that the team has not improved, but it is still an inadequate NFL roster. To compound this, the only thing Trevor has done with any consistency is turn the ball over at the goal line and on the final drive of the game.

So, a half year later, the team has significantly less cash to throw around, an underperforming roster and the generational prospect we drafted has yet to even resemble the part unless we're playing the Colts. Just more of the same garbage under Shad Khan. The few bright spots have been Etienne and coaching, but even they have committed some absolutely back-breaking errors. I am willing to digest this season as a learning experience, but I need to start seeing dividends soon.

Everything more or less falls on Trevor at this point, if he takes a magnificent leap next offseason I will gladly eat crow as the team will no doubt run roughshod over a weak AFC South. But, as he has yet to show me anything other than he is going to elicit another rebuild once we're done throwing resources at him hoping he'll eventually become the player he was touted to be in the draft, I would not be surprised if nothing substantiates from him and we once again got all of our hopes up for nothing.",10.0,jaguars,t3_yic3b2,False,0.0,:WH1::WH2::WH3:,2022-10-31T09:10:43Z,jaguars,0.0794175818864099

Ridley had 1374 yards in 15 games during 2020 and 866 yards in 13 games during 2019. Had he played just 15 games in 2019 he likely would have been right on the cusp of 1000 yards (not like 1000 yards is some magic threshold though). Plus Ridley put up 821 yards his rookie year in 2018 while only being listed as a starter in 5 games. An additional point, Diggs averaged 66.0 yards per game during his time in Minnesota and Ridley averaged 68.2 yards per game in Atlanta.

Past stats don't indicate future success, but it's crazy to act like Ridley's production and trajectory isn't at least comparable to Diggs.

Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, and Kyler Murray before those two. Hell even Geno Smith is playing elite when he gets to throw to DK Metcalfe and Lockett. 

We gotta draft a number one because I don't think there's going to be any you can trade for in the offseason, but the early rounds in the draft have been producing receivers left and right lately and this upcoming year appears to be no different.

But it‚Äôs a few things he‚Äôs not improving at yet:

- hero ball mentality. He‚Äôs not taking what the defense gives him and he‚Äôs taking chances he shouldn‚Äôt take, hence more interceptions. He has thrown two costly red zone interceptions where the play was dead and he should‚Äôve thrown it away. 

- rushing his mechanics are causing accuracy issues. This happens 3-4 times a game and typically early and late where he doesn‚Äôt square his shoulders or set his feet or both and the ball lacks touch. Again trusting his arm and the velocity he can throw it (he has a legit cannon) but is learning the timing of the league and how to put touch on his throws. 

The situation he was in last year was awful. Throwing to Laquon Treadwell or Tavon Austin leaves no margin for error as neither of those guys could separate. Marvin Jones Jr in year 10 of his career was the WR1 after Chark was lost to the season due to injury.

This year the weapons are improved somewhat but not enough. No receiver can win 1 on 1 unless schemed open. Christian Kirk can sort of separate but as he‚Äôs primarily a slot receiver he‚Äôs in between corners, LBs, and safeties so again the windows are tight unless the routes are shallow.

He‚Äôs played great in 3 games. Colts (twice) and Chargers. He played well enough to win against the giants.
