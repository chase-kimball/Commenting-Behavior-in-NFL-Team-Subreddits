Agreed, this isn't the NBA. If your rebuild is taking longer than 18 months in the NFL, it's either already a failure or one waiting to happen.

With the insane level of roster turnover in the NFL, that's plenty of time to bring in enough talent to regain competitiveness in all but the most extreme cases.
