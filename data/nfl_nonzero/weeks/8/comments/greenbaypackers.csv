Barry was the DC last year, every single defensive starter outside of Z was retained, (and Z doesn't count because he played 1 game for us last year so that's really just a technicality), the scheme is the same as last year, and we drafted two first rounders on defense.

People are blaming Barry and I think they're correct in the sense that he shows zero ability to make adjustments in game.

Like besides a WR or two, the rest of this team “should” be set because honestly I don’t know who you get that’s “better.” That’s why this fanbase is frustrated.

HB - Jones (any other team that would use him would have him probably in the top 5 rbs for yards and TD)

TE - Tonyan, Deguara, Lewis (I could see this being a possible place to upgrad, but I think Tonyan is TE1 on a lot of other teams)

OL - Struggling, but I think we may have solved our woes, especially if Bakh is out there.

CB - this was supposed to be our strength, Stokes is having second year slump, but this is where Douglas and Jaire should be starting. Stokes and Douglas are good for CB 2 and 3

S - Savage has struggled, but imo far from a liability and Amos is always solid

OLB - Gary is a beast and Preston is savage

DT/DE - Not much here besides Kenny, but Lowry and the rest have always been enough with Kenny

Who have we drafted since 2015 that is a solid contributor? Not even a WR1 or 2, just a solid NFL pro. Answer: really no one except for Marques Valdes Scantling, who was a late round pick.

To say it in a different context: our best wide receiver drafted since 2015 has been **Marques Valdes Scantling**.

That is a HUGE indictment on the current FO, a former strength has just fizzled into being objectively terrible at drafting WRs. Here are all the wide outs we've picked since we took Davante in 2014:

* 2015: Ty Montgomery
* 2016: Trevor Davis, Geronimo Allison (UDFA)
* 2017: DeAngelo Yancey, Malachi Dupre
* 2018: J'Mon Moore, MVS, Eq. St. Brown
* 2019: No one
* 2020: No one
* 2021: Amari Rodgers
* 2022: Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Samori Toure

And yeah you can add Lazard to that list when we snagged him, but even still: he's more of a depth guy, he does NOT fill the hole at WR1 and 2. And yeah, verdict is still out on the guys we just drafted (too little too late anyways). 

Then also pair that with situations in the past where they SHOULD have picked the obvious WR choice looking to the looming problem at that position, and it just gets more indefensible. Could have snagged Terry McLaurin in the 3rd, instead drafted a project TE Jace Sternberger who isn't in the league anymore. Could have drafted Pittman, Claypool in the late 1st round, instead traded up and drafted a project backup QB in Jordan Love. Could have drafted Deebo Samuel or AJ Brown in late first round, took Darnell Savage who is playing himself out of the league.

Packers have always prided themselves on finding those day 2 gems, guys like Davante, Randall Cobb, Jordy Nelson, James Jones, greg Jennings, all guys that we grabbed and developed into stars.

We get a shit ton of top 100 picks for the next 3 seasons, and have the opportunity to throw Love out there this season to see what he's got over a full season, we could then make the next decision: if Love looked legit, rest of the team was holding up, we can go with a soft reboot with those picks, give Love a non-giant extension, and then the championship window is open again in 2 - 3 years. Or, if Love is actually terrible, they can make the decision to move on, use those draft picks to do a more intensive rebuild.

Yes, to trade a player means the other team was willing to give them up. That doesn’t mean the player is bad.

Yes, trading means giving up what probably feels like too much. That’s because, instead of a draft pick, you know much more about what you’re getting in a veteran player. It’s also because there’s a market of buying teams eager to improve mid-season.

Sure, maybe it was the right move to not trade for Claypool - it sounds like it wasn’t the offer as much as the forecasted position of draft picks anyway. But I don’t really find these to be decent arguments against it. Doing nothing to improve a team that’s in free fall right now is risky.

The team is unlikely to make the playoffs this year. As a result, our 2023 picks are likely to be valuable. 

The problems on offense are systemic and widespread enough that even the best player we could trade for (DJ Moore probably) would only mildly improve things in the short term.

Rodgers is unlikely to return next year. Even if he does, signs suggest he’s regressed somewhat, so we would need an elite team and coaching staff around him to be contenders. We are not one good WR away from that. 

So… all of this adds up to me believing next year is the beginning of a painful rebuild, and trading away high draft picks we will sorely need in the hopes one player can turn things around for us immediately… is not a good idea.
