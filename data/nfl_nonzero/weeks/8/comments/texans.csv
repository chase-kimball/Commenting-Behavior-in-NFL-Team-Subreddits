-  Hes got the speed to stretch the field or cut his routes off underneath to attack the middle, and gash with YAC if you hit him in stride.

- he's got experience working with Dual threat QBs. 

- He excels at identifying when his QB is in trouble mid-route, and will adjust that route to make sure not only he can get free, but his QB can see him within a throwing lane. Hes very good as an off-script WR when his QB has to improvise.
