If EDC makes another move, it means we're sinking more draft capital into this season, when we have glaring holes in our team already. It puts us in ""Win Now"" mode, which is unfamiliar territory for the Ravens.

Houston, Campbell, and Peters are all getting old. PQ isn't the Mike we thought he could be, but he's not bad.

We need a good CB, DT, ILB, and WR. If Ojabo isn't what we hoped he'd be, we also need Edge. If we address WR with a trade, we're sinking probably more than one pick into that when we're already down a 2 and a 5. So now we have a 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and it's likely we let Roquan walk after this year for the 3rd round comp pick. 

Moving for a WR that is the caliber we need likely requires a pair of 3rd+ picks. Let's say we send a 3 and 6 for someone. Next year we're looking at 1 pick inside of the first 2 days of the draft.

I think the problem here is understanding. Without doing research you know it’s bad to kill people because of their race or religion so it’s easy to stand for George Floyd or to stand against Kanye’s comments. 

As for Kyrie, I personally have only read headlines and it sounds like a he shared a Amazon link for a book or movie about African history. Due to there being outrage I’m assuming the movie must have hate language or ideals in it. However, I honestly don’t know what the hate language/ ideals are. 

I think most of society is lazy like me, so when something doesn’t apply to us, we don’t do the work of seeing the big deal is. I think if there was more explanation of how bad what Kyrie is supporting is, then the NBA would be on the hot seat to do something. I typically assume Kyrie is on the wrong side due to him trying to be overly woke but during his press conference I didn’t hear anything bad.

27334,160573,160573,SuperSaiyanSandwich,"I get it. I've wanted a true blue #1 WR since we shipped Q off for table scraps a decade ago. I started up the DJ Moore speculation over a month ago. Wanted us in on the Diggs and Hopkins trades in the past few seasons.

I don't think we should be complacent with what we have but I trust this FO a lot more than most and they haven't seen a deal they like. I think the disconnect between fans like myself and those who are pissed at the lack of moves is three-fold:

1. Lamar *is special*, there's no denying that and we all agree upon it, but it allows us to take an unconventional approach to building an offense in 2022. No one was complaining about our receiving corps in 2019 and we have just as adequate if not a better group this year. Andrews is an absolute weapon, Duv has shown promise in bursts and Likely finally looks to be following up on his training camp promise. Bateman's constant injuries are the main thing derailing this group. I really think if Bateman gets healthy and people properly assess Andrews receiving talent this can be considered an above average staple of pass catchers.

2. Roman is Roman and for better or worse he's not getting fired mid-season. He's clearly shown his system is RB and TE heavy. Why spend even more resources on a position that you're going to get less than great returns on given the system? Paying Christian Kirk 20 mill, Allen Robinson 15 mill or sinking a fuck ton of cap and draft picks into Davante Adams isn't gonna net an amazing return(not that any of those 3 guys have been great values outside of Baltimore either). Why not wait until you can Roman(if things don't work this year) and try to get a WR1 that matches your new OCs system?

3. Lamar's contract is a massive unknown hanging over Decosta's head and our future roster construction. This is the biggest point of all and hasn't been discussed enough. I'm not mad at Lamar for wanting the best deal possible but the team (reportedly) offered him top of the league money with more than average guarantees. Lamar not having an agent and the deal not getting done is absolutely hindering our offensive personnel decisions. Will that end up pissing Lamar off and making him want out even more after this year? Fuck if I know but I sure hope not. He's gotta be smart and realize the position the team's putting him in and the position he's putting the team in are both mutual.",7.0,ravens,t3_yjj2rf,False,0.0, :ELITE:,2022-11-01T15:48:27Z,ravens,0.0171341380812886

Anderson for table scraps is likely the best move we could have made but he's been another malcontent and his ~55% catch ratio is extremely pedestrian(nearly 10% lower than Hollywood and Bateman who have both been maligned by Ravens fans for their drops).

27344,160585,160585,SuperSaiyanSandwich,"No offense taken at all and sorry for the lengthy replies. Just trying to share my perspective.

For me personally? Yes. We won at home a lot, I had emotional ties to a ton of players(Jimmy, Suggs, Flacco, Smitty Sr), guys never quit, and I watched meaningful football the entire season. 

For the average NFL fan that thinks you have to look like a SB contender year round or your team's dogshit? Yeah, those years were miserable. People knew we had cap issues, knew we had injury issues but we refused to tank and get a top 5 draft pick. They hated the offense and Flacco's checkdowns even though it was the best gameplan given our roster construction.

I became really disillusioned with our fanbase as a whole at the end of the 2017 season. We had a win and in week 17 game against a division opponent and half the stadium was empty. It was a freezing cold, nasty, New Year's Eve game but it was essentially a playoff game. For half our fanbase to quit on the team before the season was even over isn't Baltimore football. In 04 and 05 we were dogshit all year with Kyle Boller at the helm and the stadium was still packed and rocking to the very end of the year. You see the same thing with the Lamar contingency now.

We had our Elite QB's entire leg explode tearing every ligament there is after signing a big deal. We had years Justin Forsett was our #1 RB. Years where Marlon Brown and Kamar Aiken were our top wide receivers. 

Yet somehow throughout all of that Harbs still kept us a collective 40-40 from 2013-2017 while being in a division with the Killer B Steelers and a consistently competitive and underrated Bengals team.

31536,178045,178045,ZombieFeedback,"I'm reminded of years ago when Calvin Johnson retired. Six straight 1,000+ seasons, three of which were 1,400+ seasons, and his ability to win contested balls - man could literally beat triple teams with ease - *and* run away from people with 4.35 speed was pure unfair. He was inarguably the best WR in football, and everyone was justifiably sure that Matt Stafford would suffer for losing him.

Instead, Stafford got better. Without his absolute favorite target, Matt went through his progressions more cleanly, ignored covered receivers more instead of forcing it because 3v1 was a 50/50 ball, losing one of the best WRs in the history of the game made him *better,* because it forced him to use his entire offense, rather than only going to them if Calvin was quadruple covered.

To be clear, I think the offense is better with a 100% Mandrews, and I think there's plenty of evidence from Diggs-Allen to Kelce-Mahomes and on and on that QBs can use their entire field even with a clear-cut #1 stud to throw to. That said, I think not having Mark on every play will do Lamar well. He's always kind of forced balls to guys he really likes - Hello Hollywood! - and you could absolutely see that happening with Mark these last couple years. A game or two without him can be a nice reminder that other guys on the team can make plays, and the offense can function even when Mark isn't covered.

Remember the 12-game winning streak and ending the 2019 season 14-2, only to be shocked and unprepared during the playoffs against the Titans?

There were very valuable lessons from the three regular season losses as follows:

1) Miami - we lacked a ground running game -- this greatly affected the Time of Possession factor, and our inability to run out the clock on our last possessions while ahead in the fourth quarter.  Issues have mostly be resolved with the return of Dobbins and Edwards, and the ability to use the ground game.

2) Kyle Hamilton is learning from his rookie mistakes -- played well against the Bucs last night -- blocked deflected endzone pass; deserves credit for improvement and will continue to improve throughout the season and beyond.

3) Lamar's scrambling interception against the Giants -- Lamar has clearly learned from his mistake(s).  Last night, I was pleased to see Lamar throw the ball out of bounds (even an intentional grounding is better than an interception) and now he'll work more on getting the throw at least to the line of scrimmage.

4) Greg Roman is getting a lot of trial-and-error strategy with a developing and changing offense.

5) I was very happy to see our Special Teams dive on the ball on the punt fumble, rather than trying to pick it up and go for the endzone.
