And Ryan just snaps it like it’s normal, the line doesn’t do anything to contain (cause they’re outnumbered) and the receivers don’t recognize and adjust their routes so they run ten yards downfield. And Ryan just snaps it and falls down in 1.5 seconds cause that’s all he could do. Just massive lack of communication and presnap adjustment. And that exact scenario had happened like 5 times.

Positive morale is important to success in any field. 

A programmer who got an amazing salary at a FAANG company is going to still hit points where they feel frustrated or cornered or hung out to dry - and doing something that inherently puts them further into a negative emotional state would not help. Because they already feel bad enough themselves. 

One of my favorite episodes of Scrubs is when Dr. Cox had a group of transplant patients all die because they misdiagnosed the death of the source patient in that equation. What gets Dr. Cox out of it isn’t someone reminding him of the failure, or calling him a bad doctor, it’s someone telling him that they admire him for still taking death hard in this profession after as many years as he had been in the profession.

But that doesn’t make booing any less inherently demeaning and disrespectful to the players. It really serves only to make players feel bad, which lowers morale and is completely unproductive from your end goal of wanting the team to play better. (Obviously this is different from when that booing is at refs for a penalty. This is common enough that I assume players recognize that if the ref is announcing something, rthe ensuing boos can be ignored.) 

Most of the time 10/11 players are doing great and the 11th may not have totally misplayed but got beat. Gilmore vs MacLaurin at the end or Curtis Samuel making an insanely good cut on Kenny Moore who was step for step with the route that the play started as (and even made more sense for the down and distance).

Everything you said is all hindsight and meaningless honestly. 

The pass rush was nonexistent last year and Ballard traded for a good pass rusher who is performing exactly as predicted. According to you, that was a failure. What should he have done instead?

Agree on Fayscon. Bad move. Should have never happened. 

No one saw the line regressing this bad. In hindsight, they should have at minimum kept Reed. But what else?

Nelson has been bad yes, but what was their option? Let him walk?

The Wentz trade was an attempt find the QB of the future and his familiarity with Reich was a bonus and should have expedited the learning curve and therefore his success. It didn’t work. But what should they have done instead? Just rolled with Ehlinger?

Ryan again didn’t work out as expected, and again I ask, what should they have done instead?

Regarding Hines, yes the colts “failed him” but that also applies to the entire offense and by extension the team. So what’s your point?

Obviously the colts haven’t performed as desired and the front office and coaching staff is certainly to blame. But so do the players. Like I’ve said before, it’s trendy to want Strausser fired, but he’s a good coach and I highly doubt he’s coaching the line to be matadors so what’s he supposed to do? You can’t coach bad players to elite status. 

My point is, the struggles are more nuanced than BALLARD REICH BAD FIRE THEM! The defense as a whole is pretty damn good even without a Rock. Bringing in Gilmore has been a godsend and I think Bradley’s scheme is great. Offensively, there are a lot of positives as well but there’s a lot of work to be done.
