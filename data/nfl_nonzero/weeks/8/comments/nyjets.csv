His rural West Virginia elementary school had all of the classes take a photo choosing who they believed would win between the Colts and Jets. All of the other kids in his class sat behind the Colts helmet on the gym floor. He was the only one behind the Jets helmet, and proudly stood. 

Our relationship has been less than stellar throughout my childhood-mid 20's, but the love of the Jets brought us back together around the glorious 2010 season. 

I took him to his first NFL game at Metlife Stadium where we watched the mighty Jets, led by Fitzmagic, squash the hell out of the Jaguars. I cried when i saw his face light up like that 6 year old in the photo when he saw the field for the first time coming through the concourse, and again when the boys scored the first TD that game. Now we are stronger than ever, both as a family, and a team. 

We still proudly stand behind that Jets helmet.

14275,99878,99878,NannigarCire,"Appreciate this post, as it is very good in explaining the phenomenon of the ""bad logic"" zach defenders. It's very hard to make a case for Zach Wilson at this moment, the majority of it would come from a sort of ""what ifs"" that can not be objectively pointed to. But If i have to try and make an objective case, i could at least point to a few things that either counteract some of the criticisms against him or explain them in a way that offers an opportunity for improvement.

For one, the most obvious is his clean pocket performance. His 9.5 YPA in a clean pocket is second best in the NFL, and the thing is that most plays for most quarterbacks are within a clean pocket. It's where the majority of QB play occurs, and being good at it is pretty stable on a year to year basis according to most people who have modeled statistical regressions against it. Which at least suggests that there is a stat that he is very good at, and is able to potentially perform consistently with year to year.

He also currently holds a 7.4 YPA for the season, which is quite high- in General 7.5 or higher is what a long-term NFL starter (and franchise QB) usually has. And i focus on YPA for both of these because they are the basic statistic that has the best correlation to Wins/Losses when you run linear regressions where X = YPA and Y = Wins.

On a non-objective matter, the thing about the bad games is the context of them. I'm reminded of Geno Smith's 2014 because he had a lot of ""bad games"" in that year that people would place onto him but completely misunderstood what the reasons for these bad games were. Zach doesn't have even close to the same amount of incompetence surrounding him, but i can see two main problems with the offense that may be the reasons for his struggle that could still improve.

For one, MLF is absolutely terrible right now at calling plays. I think anyone, regardless of their opinion about Moore at this point, clearly understands that telegraphing one of your WRs as a pure decoy is a horrible move. The big advantage the offense has is that they get to set the terms, and if the defense has already figured out that one of the five players is a dead route, it's stupid. It's just a bad offense. This is a horrible way for the offense to function. If Breece Hall wasn't superhuman, i think the run game would be just as bad.

Then you have my personal pet peeve, which is the setup of the offense made Corey Davis the only true beneficiary. With Moore double covered on decoy routes, and Garrett drawing the top coverage corner, that means Corey Davis was the receiver getting the + matchup on most routes. This is a clearly bad move. Davis is the least dynamic of the three, has the least to offer. I think it's very unsurprising that in the same game that Corey Davis was out, the Jets offense put up 300+ passing yards and Zach Wilson threw for 8.66 YPA. Not that Davis is a leech on the offense, but when he's around the Jets coaches make the awfully lazy decision of not doing enough with the other receivers. IMO, this is because of how much he's paid, but i can't prove that.

In any case, i'm disappointed in Zach's season and can't say that even with all of these i would jump onto defending him. But i think there's enough out there on him right now to let him play out the season regardless, and see where it takes him. I also do think it's not unrealistic that MLF is a terrible OC, even if Zach is also a bad QB.",2.0,nyjets,t3_yiot4b,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-11-01T10:04:01Z,nyjets,-0.0267351458963796

This is an awful video. I can't see what Mike White is actually reading and have no idea if his jerking head moving quickly from side to side is indicative of good reads or of bad play. I can not imagine buying into Mike White due to this video.


Going through Progressions is something fans seem to get off about without understanding what going through progressions actually means. Going through Progressions means your first read was covered. What does it mean if your first read is covered? it means you made a pre-snap read on a player that was covered. That means the QB- using the pre-snap information they had, either straight up chose the WRONG PLAYER to look at first, or the defense did a great job of covering the first player.

And without even being able to see what the play was in this video, i have no idea what the reasons are for him moving his reads around. Was he just dropping reads too quickly? chose the wrong player? great D play? there is no reason to fetishize going through reads. The elite QBs around the NFL do not go through their reads on every play. Probably not even on half the plays. They're mostly correct on the pre-snap read first and foremost. When you saw prime Brady, Rodgers, Manning, any other ""cerebral"" QB doing that thing where they look one way for a long time and then come back to another player, they didn't go through their reads. They knew on the pre-snap what would happen, and they held on long enough to make it happen, if they didn't just make the quick throw off the first read to begin with. But they can also just go through their reads if they were wrong.",5.0,nyjets,t3_yi2w1h,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-10-31T12:11:07Z,nyjets,-0.0315499167650752

OC's matter a little bit. DC's sort of matter. HC's probably don't. but none of them matter as much as the talent on the field. you could swap Bowles and Saleh and each team would maybe have one game change. maybe. you could do the same for most coaches and have a minimal difference. Very few coaches make an impactful positive or negative difference on a team imo. Just recall how Bowles started with that 10-6 season out of the gate and then had a horrible tenure. Was it his coaching or was it just the jets talent? Same thing for his tenure with the Bucs. was it his coaching or just the Bucs talent? If you try to squeeze out the most analysis you can out of any teams situation, you can usually find a compelling reason besides the coach for why a team is doing well or poorly.

But what the fuck were some of those plays? A bunch of free runners going straight at your young QB is how you get the killed, physically and mentally.

The injuries have really piled up, but they HAVE to be better than that. There aren't many QBs who can work around such a shitshow. Maybe one of the elite running QBs (Allen, Jackson, Murray) but there was no way anyone was going to be throwing effectively under that kind of breakdown and pressure.

Wilson sucks fine. What is the solution? They offer none. The shortsighted thinking and childish bitching adds nothing, and the people who defend Wilson usually come from a place of ""well what other realistic choice is there right now?""

Moving on from Wilson is a discussion for end of the season, not the middle. It's what the Doomers never can understand. The other options are unrealistic and create more problems than they are worth.

Flacco? Blitzed to Death. White? Short passes taken away and he crumbles, also would get blitzed to death. Streveler? NFL 1st string DLines and stacked boxes would force your 4th best arm to throw. A magical right before the deadline fantasy QB trade that is both good and not overpriced or temp fix?  If you wanted to draft a new QB you would give up a lot of captial to get one for that move.

So Doomers. It's not that most people aren't unhappy with Wilson's play, it's that most people aren't emotional short-sighted complainers who think about things for more than a few seconds. Wilson is the QB for now because the other options are worse.

17171,113046,113046,Phifty56,"I agree, it was clear after the 2nd Int that Wilson was flustered and instead of making it easier for him, the play calling didn't seem to be giving him any breathers. A few gadget plays could have gotten the ball in Wilson, Berrios, Moore and Carter's hands, without much effort .

Also, if Wilson was going to be running around after the snap anyway, why weren't they designing some bootlegs or trick plays around Wilson's mobility? It could have punished NE's defense for their aggressiveness.

Wilson deserves criticism, the OL looked on half the plays, and MiLF wasn't helping them out at all. Another low key problem was that Special Teams wasn't stellar like they have been most of the season. 

All the poor performances made the job of the others look even worse and they all dragged each other down.
