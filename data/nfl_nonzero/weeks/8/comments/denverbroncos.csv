- Hired Nathaniel Hackett: some might say that it's only his first season and everyone liked Hackett's signing because he's young and offensive minded, but looking back to it, hiring such an inexperienced play caller to pair with a roster under construction and a brand new franchise QB (yes I know he was hired before Wilson trade, but I'm pretty sure Paton was already going after a veteran QB behind the scenes) might've been a little too reckless.  
- Gave Wilson that massive extension before the season: I know, I know, hindsight is 20/20, you can't really blame him for make a move that EVERYONE agreed was great, but still this one might hurt. Gotta work hard to make sure Wilson plays well enough so that this deal doesn't hurt us.

>Other teams believe Chubb is the most likely to be traded of this group, with a potential return equivalent to a first-round pick and more. Denver has fielded and listened to offers for the Pro Bowl defender, who has 5.5 sacks this season. But sources say the Broncos aren't inclined to move Chubb -- or Jeudy and Hamler for that matter -- unless they get the perfect offer. A Chubb trade would also be complicated because a new team giving up that type of draft capital would surely want (and need) to work out a contract extension as well (Chubb currently is on the final year of his rookie contract). The Broncos, who lost starting receiver Tim Patrick in training camp to a torn ACL, are relying on Jeudy and Hamler as they try to get struggling quarterback Russell Wilson going. The talented and athletic Okwuegbunam, on the other hand, has been subject of trade calls since this past spring and has been inactive the past two weeks.

20786,117791,117791,Welcome2Broncoland,">Of all the teams that are considering trades, the one that seems the most likely to make one before Tuesday's trade deadline is the Denver Broncos.

>The Broncos have heard from multiple teams interested in trading for star outside linebacker Bradley Chubb, sources told ESPN.

>One team even has been willing to trade its first-round draft pick, along with other compensation, in exchange for Chubb, according to sources.

>Although they are fielding trade inquiries on Chubb, the Broncos do not plan to trade Jerry Jeudy or KJ Hamler despite getting calls on the third-year wide receivers, according to sources familiar with the team's thinking.

>The Broncos, who play Sunday in London against the Jacksonville Jaguars, instead want to use Jeudy and Hamler to get their struggling offense back to life, the sources told ESPN. Denver still could ultimately trade one of the receivers by Tuesday, but it only would be for what the team believed to be a strong offer, according to sources.

…

>If the Broncos don't trade Chubb by Tuesday, they also will work on signing him to keeping him in Denver long-term, according to sources. So Chubb is expected to get a lucrative deal whether he's with Denver or elsewhere, and sources told ESPN his new contract is expected to be worth more than $20 million annually.

>One year ago, the Broncos traded Von Miller to the Los Angeles Rams just before the deadline for second- and third-round picks, and Chubb is likely to fetch even more in compensation should Denver decide to deal him.",18.0,denverbroncos,t3_yhcs93,False,0.0,Rod Smith,2022-10-30T07:13:28Z,denverbroncos,0.0028905968145634
20787,117792,117792,Welcome2Broncoland,">Stewing over how these Broncos have blown three victories by a total of seven points, Paton blew a gasket and opened a vein of despair, which bled orange and blue. In a one-on-one interview with The Denver Post, his words were coarse and his frustration real.

>“We’ve got to win. (Bleep), these games are there for the taking. We’ve got to make a (blankety-bleep) play,” Paton told me, as we stood on a knoll above a lush, green field where the Broncos practiced for a game in Wembley Stadium against Jacksonville.

>Through gritted teeth set in a stern jaw hangry for victory, Paton set a very different tone than the all-is-well message he delivered in front of microphones and television cameras only minutes earlier, when he gave a vote of confidence to Hackett.

…

>“We’re scoring 15 points per game. That’s not good enough. Really not good enough. But the defense is playing really well. I believe in Nathaniel. I believe in Russ. We’ve all got to do better, myself included. I need to do better,” Paton said.
