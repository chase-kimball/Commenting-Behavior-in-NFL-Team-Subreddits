I still cant believe on the goal line they think its a good idea to pull guards with someone head up. That and a zone blocking scheme on the goaline is just not going to do it in most cases, most people go man up on goal line even if theyre a zone running team.

We need to sure up the running defense if we want any prayer of having a competitive defense.

We really miss JPP and Suh in run defense. The replacements are a huge drop off there. Couple that with White giving half ass effort in the last four games and we're getting gouged regularly.

I just don’t think there are really that many options out there, so it becomes do we go with this guy who is amazing when healthy vs a healthy nobody. We did the latter last year and no one from Tyler Johnson to Miller to Darden to Perriman to Cyril Grayson stepped up and stayed healthy. 

That being said, Ledyard and Atwal have made a few interesting points on their Bucs episodes - 

1) Gage is not being used in a way that maximizes his skillset, 

2) Godwin and Evans complement each others strengths and weaknesses extremely well, 

3) Lefty is not creative or running useful counters to the Bucs passing game staples 

4) Lenny was great last year and this year he’s given up in terms of pass protection. And he looks like he’s been injured. Imo if some of your re-signings are going to regress, you’d prefer it  at RB and not DB or WR!

People tend to focus on the big new names instead of a) the big names that didn’t leave and b) the important signings. Caring about the icing more than the cake.
