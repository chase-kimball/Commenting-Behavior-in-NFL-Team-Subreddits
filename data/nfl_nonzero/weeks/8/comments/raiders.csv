1952,7792,7792,ATX_rider,"""Just win, Baby"" has morphed into ""Finding new ways to lose each year"".

Been cheering for the silver and black since '74 and I'm just about over them. Anymore I record the games, look at the score and only if they win do I watch. A single point loss is just as unwatchable to me as a 24-0 shellacking. I can't handle viewing another loss. 

It's no way to be a fan.

The Lions are in the consideration for my new team because I grew up in Michigan. I know, I know, they're the Lions, but at least I won't expect anything from them. The other team that's in consideration are the Giants since they have come to the Raiders aid multiple times vanquishing teams that screwed up the silver and black (Broncos in '86 SB, Bills in '90 SB, Pats twice in SB).",1.0,nfl,t3_yii3g6,False,0.0,:Raiders: Raiders,2022-11-01T10:20:57Z,raiders,-0.0548796978809244

Without watching film at all, just the games, I assume the problem is read progression. End of last season, Raiders didnt really have a deep threat thanks to Ruggs being an idiot. Zay was sort of the deep threat but not really. So a lot of the passes went to quick intermediate routes with Waller and Renfrow (and Zay) taking advantage of linebackers and small corners, and they excel at that. Obviously I don't know how the read progressions were drawn up on those plays, but I assume Waller and Renfrow were high priority. Plus, traditionally, Gruden's style of west coast offense priortizes quick intermediate routes.

Well now the team has real outside threats with Adams and Hollins. Again, I dont know how the progressions are drawn up but I assume the outside guys are getting higher priority in the read progression in this offense. So when teams double Adams and play single high safety that leans toward the deep route, that might be taking away the first two reads.

26014,200771,200771,Zimmonda,"So while nepotism exists everywhere it's concentrated in the NFL for a few reasons.

&#x200B;

1)The NFL is a niche industry, while it's an extremely valuable industry it's essentially made up of 32 family businesses. This extremely depresses the pool of ""truly organic"" employment candidates and it creates a feedback loop where the only way to ""gain experience"" is to work at one of the 31 other franchises. Sure there's HS/CFB but those still aren't true 1:1 comparisons and CFB candidates tend to flame out at more or less the same rate as ""NFL only"" candidates. However CFB candidates tend to do so more seemingly spectacularly (Saban, Meyer, Rhule). True or not there's the perception that ""you fucked up"" when you whiff on a CFB candidate similarly to why coaches would prefer to punt than go for it on 4th down.

&#x200B;

2)There's not really a good objective way to evaluate a coach on ""merit"". There have been good coaches held back by bad rosters, and bad coaches propped up by good rosters there are also good coaches for a specific meta who are overcome by the evolving game only to come back into favor when the meta shifts to their strengths. When there's a lack of objective measures to parse candidates subjective measures like familiarity or ""culture fit"" take over.

&#x200B;

3)This will probably be the hottest take here but I don't think being an NFL coach is ""that hard"". Now let me clarify I don't think I or most people on this forum could do it right now, but I do think if we grew up in an environment or had training to do so that we could all be more or less the same caliber as most assistants. It's not rocket science, it doesn't require an advanced degree, at the end of the day after all it is a ***game***. It doesn't really matter if you win or lose because teams aren't paid based on their success (to a point) like they are in a ""real job"". In a ""real job"" if you miss a deliverable, or say fail to provide a client with a service you don't get paid. The company makes no money, it folds, everyone loses their job. In the NFL you get paid win or lose.

&#x200B;

4)The NFL makes a fuckton of money, and coaches make a decent wage for their job responsibilities. Being an NFL coach is a lot more exciting and fun than working on a factory floor or whatever. This makes the job extremely attractive and worth getting into.

These 4 factors combine to make nepotism extremely prevalent, the entire league is essentially one big extremely lucrative family business where everyone gets paid just for showing up because the NFL is an entertainment product. There is no fungible product being created other than the games themselves and every game is going to end up with one team losing. This means parents want to get their kids/loved ones ""in the door"" and on the gravy train.

It's very frustrating to watch McDaniels throw away the tape from the last several years.

It's like he's intentionally ignoring what made Carr to Waller and Carr to Renfrow soooo productive and hard to defend.

That thread about Siriani vs McD summed it up perfectly.

26682,203975,203975,_taugrim_,"Exactly!

McDaniels has no idea how to leverage existing talent.

Examples on offense:

1.Carr has been far more productive with lesser OL talent and lesser receiving talent in recent years.

Under McD, I see an offense that doesn't run enough deep in's, crossing routes, option routes, etc. Where the route runner either gets open in zone coverage or can make a decision where to go. Carr was great at this stuff with Waller and Renfrow.

McDaniels offense feels SOOO freaking controlled.

2. McD has made 2 highly-productive players (Waller, Renfrow) non-factors in games where they are healthy. Yes, Waller dropped some passes.

It's a combination of reduced snaps and IMO not leveraging them for the things they were so great at with Carr. If it ain't broke, why ""fix"" it?

3. McD pretty much ditched the young OG talent that we had (Simpson, Leatherwood) for an unproven guy coming back from major college knee injury

I can understand giving up on Leatherwood at RT, but he was a serviceable RG last season. Did flat-out waiving him make the team better?

4. Over-utilizing a FB to the point where we have diminished flexibility. Johnson is a great FB, don't get me wrong. Most modern offenses run a lot of 11 personnel. We do not under McD.

Why did we bother to pay a TE and a slot WR so much money if we were going to run a lot of 21 personnel?",13.0,raiders,t3_yifhsg,False,0.0,:28:,2022-10-31T18:29:24Z,raiders,-0.0201124524243047

My reasoning is, I believe this team has a lot more talent than any team in the near past.  They are just not preforming as well as they should.  They all seem to be confused as if they are struggling with the complicated scheme McDaniels is using.  

We finally got DC a true WR1.  Why this isn’t paying off for us I believe is the play calling we have at the time.  Adams would have thrived in last years offense.  We have a top RB in the league, pay him.  Some how (hopeful a new coach) motivate our pro bowl WR2 (Renfrow) and TE (Waller), both have been almost non existent.  

On the defensive side, need to get Hobbs healthy, trade for Crosby’s counter part (Jones not doing it).  Our run defense has improved since last year.  I like Abrams playing a pressure blitzing roll and think he has played his best ball this season (exception of this game).

Hate saying just fire someone with out offering up something better.  Obvious choice would be Sean Payton but I for one liked watching the team play under Biasachi’s time last year.  It was exciting ball.  Maybe we trade to get him back.
