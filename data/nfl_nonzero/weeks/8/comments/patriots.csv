329,6726,6726,AcidThunder,"Love these in-depth information posts. I think that the 2021 draft class gets a somewhat bad rap because none of the QBs has ""broken"" out yet like years prior. I think that if Mac had continued on last years success, maybe that mindset would be different but it really does seem like there is no true QB1, QB2, QB3, etc... yet for that class. None of first five has shown that they are above or below the pack.

If none of the quarterbacks breakout and start producing at a high level, I could confidently say that this draft is one of the biggest busts of all time, especially when considering the hype coming into the draft and then the regular season that year.",18.0,nfl,t3_yjxdqe,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-11-02T01:31:42Z,patriots,0.098272128

He came to Boston all excited to be a leader. Played great. Then he got hurt at the end of his first season there but the team overperformed and somehow made the ECF without him. 

The next season the team had really high expectations. On the eve of that season, in front of fans at the TD Garden, he said he intended to sign a contract extension with the team at the end of the year (had to wait to be eligible for more money) and wanted to eventually have his number retired/raised to the rafters. 


Then the team underperformed the whole season. He made a lot of passive-aggressive comments and blamed teammates in front of the media. Bad leader stuff. He also did generally weird shit like burning incense in the locker room, and responded to a greeting from his coach by asking ""What does the word government mean to you?""


By the playoffs he had become completely disengaged from the team, frequently went off assignment (tried to guard Giannis 1v1 which was definitely not his assignment), played hero-ball and performed horribly. Everyone knew he was leaving by that point. He quit on the team. In the offseason he promptly signed with Brooklyn and took a few cryptic shots at the Celtics/Boston.


On his first game back in Boston he implied that any booing the fans directed at him would be race related (not related to him letting the team down and going back on his word).
