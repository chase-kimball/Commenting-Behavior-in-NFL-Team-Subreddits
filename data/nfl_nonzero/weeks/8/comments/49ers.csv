Very much not ideal, especially since the Center is such a critical portion of an offense, especially so in the Shanahan offense. I don't think a lot of people know that Centers have a significant amount of pre-snap responsibility aside from snapping the ball. 

I'd really, really like to see us invest in developing a long term solution at Center if we can. We have Williams, Banks and Burford that will likely be our starting solutions for a while, but Brendel is on his 5th team in 6 years and I would be blown away if we don't replace McGlinchey after this year(or he throws in the towel).

9313,72945,72945,GoatShapedDestroyer,"People undervalued how fast our RBs were in 2019 relative to what we have now. Brieda and Mostert's speed was unmatched in 2019 and was a huge factor in why our outside runs were so effective. We hardly ever run outside like we did then because our personnel just doesn't excel there. Maybe that will change with CMC? Even then, Wilson isn't that type of runner and while Deebo is fantastic and a natural runner, he's never been widely known for his speed.

Mitchell missing is an underrated factor as well. Before CMC he was easily our best back and seems to really excel in the Shanahan scheme.

Let's also not forget that while he wasn't a world beater, we had a much, much better Center in 2019 with Richburg. Our run game efficiency with and without Richburg is night and day, and not only that but his absence in the Super Bowl likely played a significant role in our loss.

EDIT: I did want to also follow up here and add a few things that I often don't see brought up and if they are then they're quickly brushed aside because it's not sexy. This entire team and coaching staff prepared the entire offseason for an offense around Trey Lance and the options his running ability would open up. People here don't want to hear it but our run game efficiency with and without him has dropped considerably and it's because defenses don't need to account for the QB run option anymore. That's months and months of physical and mental work that was drilled not only into veterans but also the only version that our rookies know - now we've had to have a huge shift in offensive mentality which usually leads to a preponderance of holding penalties and just generally sloppy play. Add to that we've had our star LT out a few weeks, our RT is injured and playing like straight up pants and we have what are essentially two rookies at Guard.

I bring that up because it was all but a certainty that Jimmy wouldn't be back. He took no reps in Training Camp, never practiced with the team, never went into meetings etc. When Trey went down for the season it's not as simple as just plugging Jimmy back in. Yes he's played with a lot of these guys for years, but there is a shitload of offseason work that coaches do to prepare an offense and it isn't always as easy as just slotting someone else into that, especially when their skillsets are so wildly different.",7.0,49ers,t3_yhlmdn,False,0.0,:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy,2022-10-30T13:21:48Z,49ers,-0.0261248915368746
