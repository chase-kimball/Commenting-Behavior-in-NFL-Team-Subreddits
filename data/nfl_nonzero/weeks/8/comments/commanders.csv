13618,108889,108889,MildSpooks,"DC said they do not want to pay for a new stadium at the old RFK site (maybe because Dan owned the team). The new owner would most likely have to repair ties with the city and potentially pony up a good chunk of change for a new stadium at that site. For the current site - FedEx field - all bets are off for who would be paying for a new stadium there. Relocating to a new city comes down to who wants us: London? Germany? Mexico City? Fuck it, would Boise ID pay? A big part of all of this is team performance too. We hate Dan because he's a fucking scum bag AND because he ran the team into the ground.

We obviously got rinsed for Trent Williams, but I think we all knew his level. Dunbar doesn't have a team right now and I remember people being upset at losing him. Hopkins isn't doing any better than Slye. RIP Haskins but Mike Tomlin wasn't able to have him course correct in his time there. Kirk has been exactly who we thought he was with us with the Vikes - a 1pm bully but a prime time no show. Landon Collins is on the Giants practice squad. Scherff is Scherff but the Jags aren't doing anything either. 

We're mediocre drafters (some of the hits have been great - McLaurin/Curl, but equally we've been poor in the early rounds - take your pick of Cravens, Love, Guice, Doctson) and flat out bad at free agency save for managing to turn around Ereck Flowers & use McKissic well.
