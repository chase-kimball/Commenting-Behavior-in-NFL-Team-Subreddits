I believe the reason for his rating is that either they were playing zone coverage when those catches were made and he may have been recieving or passing off one of the WRs  or covering 2 players in his zone, or that they went for not very much yardage as (if I'm reading this right) he only allowed 36 yards on 7 catches. There was some YAC, but that's tackling, not coverage. It's going to be difficult to prevent a catch if they're catching the ball so close to the line of scrimmage.

The odds-on favorite to win the coach of the year is Nick Sirianni, who has the Philadelphia Eagles sitting pretty at 7-0. But he hasn't even been the most impressive coach in his division. Instead, that honor belongs to first-year head coach Brian Daboll, who has made the New York Giants relevant again. 

The Giants hadn't won more than six games since 2016, yet they've already reached that number through eight weeks this season. Their two losses this season came against the Dallas Cowboys and the Seattle Seahawks — games in which the Giants were competitive.

Daboll has his players performing well above expectations, and they are doing so despite several injuries on both sides of the ball. With a relatively easy schedule ahead of them, New York should be a near-lock to make the playoffs this year.

- Giants better trade for a WR in the next 36 hours

- Our offense looked bad yesterday, didn’t look as creative as past weeks. It baffled me that our game plan was to not run Saquon right from the start. We know they’re gonna stack the box because we don’t have a viable WR to cover.

- Defensively I was happy with the pressure we were getting on Geno. 3 sacks and plenty of almost-sacks. It feels good knowing we can get to the QB

- special teams fucked us, but not the sole reason we lost the game. Our offense has to find ways to put up points other than an easy score because we got a turnover at the 2 yard line

- at 6-2 going into the bye, we’re in a great spot, overperforming to expectations of a rebuilding team void of talent in several areas and shouldn’t have anything to complain about other than…
