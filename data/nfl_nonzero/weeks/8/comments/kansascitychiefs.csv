811,2514,2514,AU_wde_2,"Was at last nights game a few points I took away:
- food options are a joke, they have 4 total restaurants, and 3 of them are branded differently but sell the exact same thing hot dogs, ballpark nachos, burgers and then either a veggie wrap or like a double patty burger. Then the 4th restaurant is a cheesesteak place which is fine but even that we walked a majority of the stadium and the cheesesteak place was only on the ground level and there was only 1 that was the full restaurant which offered other things than cheesesteak the rest of them were only cheesesteak 
- Along with that food, I guess the gas station Pilot has a sponsorship with them so they have pilot little convenience shops throughout which maybe wouldn‚Äôt be a problem but they look hideous, it seriously made me feel like I was walking through a NY subway
- The game presentation and entertainment value was next level, it always helps when the home team is winning and I will say this was Halloween and a prime time game but I‚Äôve been to plenty of Chiefs prime time games and we‚Äôre fairly cookie cutter with the presentation. The Browns shut off the lights and had light up wristbands that flashed to the music playing, they had a thriller performance at midfield during halftime, a 12 y/o guitar player and a violinist that were hyping up the crowd, just a lot of different things going on that all worked well together 
- The barking got old really quick, at the beginning I was like okay this is kinda funny but then they just kept doing it all game at the most random times. Also the fans don‚Äôt really know when to cheer vs be quiet, I swear they were louder on pivotal offensive downs than they were on defensive 3rd downs which was odd to see. And when they did get ‚Äòloud‚Äô on 3rd downs they were also barking which actually made it quieter

58559,398907,398907,typac69,"Fair point. But now signing Suh at about halfway through the season makes his deal cheaper and really we only need him to play his best football in January. If we signed him now and just let him work his way into shape between now and the start of the playoffs, I think we could have a pretty good playoff pass rush. Which to me, not having a formidable rush was the #1 reason the Bills game came down to the wire and why we lost to Cincy last year.

Doesn‚Äôt have to be Suh either. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of talented vet DLs available that might fit better. Or maybe we‚Äôre active on waivers to try and claim another T Suggs. I‚Äôm mainly just advocating using the additional money freed by Fenton to try and build a better pass rush, rather than WR which I think we‚Äôre fine at for the year.",4.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_yk247u,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2022-11-02T07:59:37Z,kansascitychiefs,0.1018071688532829

Feel like if you put Suh and Jones on a line next to each other they have a chance to really blow up opposing offenses.

What are they gonna do when Chase demands a bigger deal than Tyreek? How are they going to build an OL that can hold their blocks long enough that Burrow can get the ball out?
