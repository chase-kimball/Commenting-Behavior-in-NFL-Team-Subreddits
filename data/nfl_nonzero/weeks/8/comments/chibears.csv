While both situations would reflect a gain of five yards in a traditional box score, the first would result in a first down and continue the drive, while the other would likely force the team to punt on fourth down. Expected Points attempts to quantify this difference in value by relating each play to how much it increases (or decreases) a team‚Äôs chances of scoring.

Expected Points Added, commonly referred to as EPA, is a measure of how well a team performs relative to expectation. For example, if a team starts a drive on the 50-yard line, its expected points to start the drive would be about 2.5.

28554,150352,150352,PwnzillaGorilla,"in no particular order:

\-Peter Skoronski, OT, Northwestern

It's a super lazy comparison but he reminds me of Rashawn Slater (whom he replaced at NW). Never gonna be an earth-mover or someone consistently honored as a top 5 tackle but this dude can flat out BLOCK. High floor-type player that wins with technique and leverage. Some say he projects best on the interior but in the right scheme I think he could push Braxton Jones to compete for his starting spot. Fun fact about him: he's the grandson of highly decorated Green Bay Packer Bob Skoronski from the '50s and '60s (5x NFL champion, 2x SB champion, Packers HoF)

\-Bryan Bresee, DT, Clemson

A former no. 1 recruit in the country, this man has it in his mind to eat the opposing QB alive every single play and then gets pissed when he sees the QB get up again. He plays \*A N G R Y\* every play like he wants nothing more than to see his target ground into paste. He gets off the line with absurd speed (some would call it Aaron Donald-like) and is in the backfield before the offensive line makes their first move. Can diagnose run plays in an instant and is athletic enough to sift through blocks to make the tackle, most likely for a loss. A Flus guy through and through, he would absolutely buy into the HITS principle the first day and become a focal point for our dline.

\-Quentin Johnston, WR, TCU

A huge prototypical X-type receiver, Johnston has been a problem for Big XII defenses the last few years. This man is a YAC machine with long-striding top end speed that can make surprisingly good start/stop movements. Funny enough, if Johnston had any comparison to an NFL player, it would be Chase Claypool (if he weighed 15 lbs less). Idk how redundant it would be to have two of the same type of player in the WR rooom but the possibilities Fields could have throwing the rock deep with two of the same types of players is tantalizing to say the least.

IMO, my preferences between these three are Bresee, Skoronski, Johnston but I'd be ecstatic if we got any one of them.",5.0,chibears,t3_yjjr56,False,0.0,33,2022-11-01T16:23:37Z,chibears,0.044261938781938

Ultimately, coaches are going to preach, TOs TOs TOs as the #1 thing for defenses. They want their goal to be 3 turnovers a game. But, at the expense of yardage allowed. Its tough to wrap your head around. I guess the important part is TDs allowed. I dont know that about him at all. You see the bend but dont break defense coming back around now, to limit these big throws down the field. Diggs could just be hte early guy in the return to this kind of defense. 

Obviously Parsens is incredible, but the DAL D is more than those 2. Their LBs are damn good as well as the rest of the line. Their one small weakness this year, so far, has been the secondary.

For Allen, it was a mix of him working really hard on his mechanics, getting comfortable within the system, and the Bills slowly getting pieces around him, to help with pass blocking, get some WRs that could separate and give Allen more margin for error and draft some guys who turned out to be pretty good. If people followed closely, he was playing alot better than his rookie year, but the stats dont always follow that, so its hard for the average person to see that kind of stuff. Kinda like how now Fields is starting to get love. 

This wasnt talked about on the pod, and just my memory of the moves they made, since my friend is a big Bills fan. Alot of people want to point to the year they got Diggs, but dont often remember the year before that, where they signed John Brown and Cole Beasley, who got open much better than Zay Jones And Kelvin. They drafted Singletary and Knox. They had a really good LT in DAwkins and added Spain, Morse, an average Feliciano and they whiffed on Ford draft pick. 

Their defense was also getting a make over. Its not talked about alot, but a good defense helps a young QB develop too.

A few weeks ago, he was having some issues pulling the trigger some times, and then running, but hes looking where he needs to look. The last few games hes been doing a much better job of pulling the trigger and working in the pocket, instead of rolling out and playing hero ball. Not surprising that the LG replacement (after Whitehiar got injured) and the C are pass blocking a lot better than before. Im sure it was a mix of Fields just getting comfortable with the offense and receivers not running right routes/not getting open.

The only time hes running right away, when its not a designed run, is if hes reading man coverage or a D player gets through the line right away. Hes been taught that If hes seeing the backs of D players and reads man coverage and doesnt find the open man, to tuck the ball and run.

My guess was Bears wanted him to show that 18.5 sack upside this year and get his value up. One of the rumors I read was that he was worth a 4th in the offseason and they wanted to see if that could go up. He didn't really show the 18.5 upside and they took what they thought was fair.

With Roquan, I think since he's so young and obviously is talented, they wanted to see how he would fit in his role on the D. He wasn't living up to what they wanted and the contract he wanted, so they dealt him. Still got really good value for him. Ravens were desperate for a LB, so this is probably one of the best returns they could get.

With Mack, 3 things come to mind:

1. Did the Bears have to trade him by a certain timeline so that his money would be off the books next year? Remember, Quinn and Roquans salaries weren't going to be on 2023 cap, with Quinns void years. Bears saved like $28m next year for trading Mack. As opposed to $18m or so by waiting.

2. They got a return they thought was fair. He's been hurt for the last few years and maybe didn't want to tank value by waiting and him getting hurt again. See Hicks right now. 

3. They traded him to a team who had the cap space to take him.

All in all I think they didn't want to trade all the vets away, so that they could still set up the team with a first year coaching staff. Poles said that after the Quinn trade.",3.0,chibears,t3_yisy7h,False,0.0,Italian Beef,2022-10-31T19:17:25Z,chibears,-0.0001181877145846
