Taking your hemet off to celebrate after a play is a penalty every single time.

In fact, during gameplay, taking it off to do anything but immediately readjust it and put it back on is a penalty.

Edit to add: In fact, even Stephan Diggs.  Sideline. TOUCHDOWN. Is a penalty.  But the game is over and the penatly means nothing effective to the game.",6.0,falcons,t3_yismg8,False,0.0,to tha house,2022-10-31T20:58:41Z,falcons,-0.0716333247244358
19574,216216,216216,ueeediot,"For me its the overly conservative play calling when up by 3 at the end of regulation.  That FG doesnt get you a TD lead, it leaves you to get beat by 1.  Archer had it right on radio....will Arthur show some stones and go play action on 2nd or 3rd down knowing the Carolina D is full sell out to stop the run?  Nope 

Does Peas bring pressure under 30s with only a 6 pt lead?  Nope.  3 man rush allowing receivers time to get down the field.  Again Archer had it right.  That's forcing your secondary to cover for a long time.  Their obvious target is DJ Moore and he is covered by a S and a LB running 60 yds down the field.

Arthur Blank has proven to me, repeatedly, since he fired Dan Reeves that he doesnt know shit about coaches or football in general.",1.0,falcons,t3_yhhtzw,False,0.0,to tha house,2022-10-30T21:38:59Z,falcons,-0.01719002905
