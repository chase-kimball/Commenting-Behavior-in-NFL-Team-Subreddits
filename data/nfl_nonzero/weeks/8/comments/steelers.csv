9352,54691,54691,Dang026,"Jacoby is no scrub. The slander is unwarranted considering this sub was drooling over Trubisky all offseason even before he was signed.

I stand by my offseason stance. The Steelers should have picked up Brissett rather than Trubisky for a number of reasons. He was used to being a backup and seeing the field from multiple angles an he had a solid season for the Colts prior to the team moving on from him to a majority of Colts fans disapproval. Lastly, he literally played QB under Matt Canada for 3 years at NC state along with RB coach Eddie Faulkner for multiple seasons. 

Brissett seemed like a better long term move at QB considering hes a cheaper option with less expectations to hold the starting job. This should have been a mini-rebuild season but thats not how Art Rooney II operates. Obviously the team wasnt sure they would be able to draft Kenny but it would have been a much more ideal situation looking back. Trubisky has clearly had more difficulty working within the offense than a rookie Kenny Pickett which should answer any and all questions. 

It sucks they have to rush KP onto the field because Mitch cant read the field. At least Jacoby can see if a receiver is wide open... dont make me show the picture of Trey Burton waving his arms in the end zone directly in front of Mitch with no defenders within 10 yards of either of them lol.",7.0,steelers,t3_yiw1oj,False,0.0,:primantis:Primanti Bro's,2022-10-31T23:34:29Z,steelers,0.028822443369122

Also, since you want to include Ben, of the 18 Super Bowl winning teams since he was drafted in 2004, teams that drafted their QB in the top 5 who went on to win make up 3/18 Super Bowl champions. 4 if you include Wentz, who the eagles traded up to grab. 

Eli Manning, 1st overall pick with 2 rings.

Peyton Manning with 2 rings (1 as a colt, he won two but the colts sucking to get him 1st overall has nothing to do with him signing in Denver).

That’s the list.

Brady with 7 rings - 199 overall 6th round pick, 1 of those Tampa just signed him too, they didn’t have to suck. 

Brees with 1 ring - 32nd overall 2nd round pick

Rodgers with 1 ring -  24th overall 1st round pick 

Flacco with 1 ring - 18th overall 1st round pick

Foles/Wentz with 1 ring - outlier, but the Eagles traded up for Wentz, and Foles was a 3rd round pick.

Mahomes with 1 ring - 10th overall 1st round pick, who the Chiefs traded up to get. 

Stafford with 1 ring - FA signing for LA.

New England was competitive/the best every single year. Brady leaves and they’re right back in the playoffs. But we’re just talking about Super Bowl years.

Denver went 8-8 or better for 4 years prior to winning the Super Bowl, they just actually made a splash in FA. That also includes a playoff win from Tebow.

The eagles went 7-9 or better for 4 years up to winning the Super Bowl. They just made moves to make themselves competitive. This is still true now. The sentiment that 6-9 win non playoffs years is garbage makes no sense. You play to win. 

Chiefs went 10-6 or better for the 4 years prior to winning, and that was even pre Mahomes. 

Bucs went the Broncos route making a splash at QB in signing Brady, but they’re shit now and have been shit, they just squished 2 winning seasons in between a decade of garbage. That’s not what we want.

Rams bought themselves a Super Bowl, but also finished no worse than 9-7 in 4 years prior to the Super Bowl.

No team that’s won recently has had to suck to win. Mahomes was drafted at 10 in a pick they traded up for. We trade up to 10 to take a guy like Bush. For the Pats, Brady was a 6th round pick but is an outlier, Gronk was a 2nd round pick, Edelman was a 7th rounder… they found absolute diamonds in the rough. We can’t seem to do that outside of AB who we never won with. Eagles had a run with Wentz playing at an MVP level, he goes down but everyone bought in. They also traded up to get Wentz, they weren’t bad enough to naturally be in a position to take him. Also signed a plethora of talent heading into the year, and had been building from the trenches out. Denver signed Manning. That’s all you need to know. His corpse won them a Super Bowl, they just loaded up on defensive talent (highest paid defense in the league?) Rams go and get guys like Odell, Von, Stafford, sell out to win. Even when they drafted a guy like Donald, it wasn’t top 5, it was 13 - middle of the pack. Even us with Watt, that wasn’t some tank for watt year. He was a late first round selection. 

Most teams that win actually aren’t shit to begin with. We haven’t drafted well. There’s no depth. Somehow there’s barely any cap space. We haven’t gotten lucky and found any diamonds.

This is the laziest take. First off, they had a winning season, 9 wins and a tie, so there’s 10 of 17 games where there’s no throwing in “garbage time”

Then look at the losses, week 2 he has 9 catches for 105 yards. Week 3 I don’t even think he played. Week 4 he catches a 45 yard TD on the opening drive, goes 9 for 92. 

Not going to go game by game, but just say “I hate Diontae” rather than framing it wrong.

Claypool is fine. He’s just inconsistent, and, in fact, he’s a #3 receiver, so there’s that. One of the better ones in the league too.

Pickens is a rookie who will grow into a prevalent outside role. 

Muth is a top 16 TE. Having a guy in the top half of his position in his second year is more than good enough.

The skill positions are more than fine, and they’ve shown they can be more than fine.

We lead the league in 3 and outs on offense. We’re dead last in scoring. We’ve failed to score 20 points offensively this season, and have only done so 5 times in the past 26 games (all last season).

When you look at this team, it’s by NO MEANS whatsoever a talent issue. Diontae was a 100 catch 1000 yard guy last year. Claypool is inconstant but it’s not like he’s some absolute completely useless bust, he’s making every roster in the league. Pickens has showed flashes, yet is starving for targets. Najee is a first round back who played well, behind a worse line last year. He just looks like he’s uncomfortable with no holes and is trying to make too much happen. Warren looks good for a backup. 2nd round TE who has played well. 1st round QB. They’ve dumped draft capital all over the offense, and with the exception of Pickett and Pickens, everyone has shown talent to some level both last year and in this clusterfuck this year. (Rookies just a limited sample, in the worst offense in football).

The run blocking has been PUTRID for THREE FUCKING YEARS… not today… not a couple weeks, THREE YEARS. How has this been addressed? Take a first round running back ✅, draft an undersized raw guard on day 2 who moves to center and doesn’t even warrant a hat now on game days in KG ❌, sign Daniels to play guard ✅, sign a mediocre (at best) veteran center who can’t move bodies in Cole ❌. Chuks is just fine. Daniels you can use moving forward. I’m not even opposed to keeping Moore long term. Fix the C and LG spots. You need body movers to become a smash mouth team, incorporate play action and not hang your fucking rookie/second year guy out to dry every single week, having him sling it 35+ times week in and week out.

Defensively… I mean Watt is like a third of our cap allocation on defense and the best defensive player in football. Losing him hurts. IDL simply isn’t good enough, and we’re slated to lose Wormley, Alualu (who is awful this year), AND Ogunjobi, so next year it will only likely be worse. LB has been fine. Safety’s have been incredibly inconsistent.. see: 98 yard TD against the Bills, huge strike down the middle to the backup TE by Brady, AJ Browns 1st TD today. Need to be better, but the talent is there.

CB is weak as fuck. Sutton looks like the only competent CB on the entire roster, and he’s due to get paid this year. Levi Wallace looks OK. Maulet is awful in coverage, Pierre isn’t very good, and Witherspoon has shown he can’t cover 1s. Got shit on today, got beat for what should’ve been the game winning touchdown week 1. Mossed week 2 by Agholor. AND HE’S MISSED 4 WEEKS. So he’s not readily available, and when he is, he isn’t reliable. This is usually masked by a great pass rush, which we don’t have because of Watt. That in itself is a red flag, if you lose one guy, the whole operation shouldn’t fall apart.

They need better depth, and more talent infused into this defense, with limited amount of cap to spend and draft capital that still needs to go towards the offense, I don’t even know how you make that happen. The offense needs veterans at TE (2), WR, Oline. They need experience and a fucking identity. of our entire offense, THREE FUCKING STARTERS aren’t on rookie deals. Our C, RG and RT. Pickett is. Najee is. Muth is. LT/LG are. Pickens/Claypool are. (I believe?) Diontae is until next year. Even if he isn’t, not including Watt who plays like 10 snaps a year and makes way too much money just for ST and the limited role on offense, that’s 4/11+ guys. They need experience and cohesion there, or great leadership. We have none of it.

That’s all offseason bullshit though, we’ll deal with that when it comes. The problem is, this isn’t a one offseason patch up type job. This is multiple years of signing impactful FA’s, drafting well, and good development. Cracks didn’t just start to show this year, the flood gates broke open.

The one thing that I am certain NEEDS to fucking happen, is get rid of this zone run scheme bullshit and fire Canada off planet fucking earth. The scheme, inherently, isn’t shit. It just does not suit this team WHATSOEVER. His play calling is that of a 90 year old man who watched football around the merger, run the ball all game or just check down. Nothing deep, limited stuff over the middle, no clear out stuff, all gimmick shit to “confuse” defenses… no defense has been fucking confused in 2 years. 

It’s tiring. I would’ve fired Matt Canada last offseason. I doubt any changes happen, so unless this defense picks it up tenfold looking like they did week 1 against inferior competition, there won’t be more than 4 wins to be found on this schedule. Even with good draft capital, we have a new regime and we have no idea how well we’ll draft, and don’t have the resources to patch up all our issues anyways. You get a 4th place schedule next year, and I honestly doubt we’ll look a whole lot better. It’s going to be years before this team is even remotely in “contention” and that’s after Heyward is gone, minkah is older, watt is older and Pickett is potentially off his rookie deal. We’re the third worst fucking team in the league. We’re the second worst in the AFC. It’s pathetic right now, and this “patience, no changes will be made” approach makes it even more fucking infuriating. Defensively it’s acceptable because we’ve seen what this D can do at full health. Offensively? Changes needed to be made 2 years ago. Last year we were awful. This year we are THE WORST. Helen Keller can look at this fucking team and see shit needs to be changed. Come the fuck on.

Him being out of the league at this point I think points more to the fact that he's an asshole than it does his abilities as a coach.

As far as the linebackers go, it's a difficult position to play in the NFL today, everything offenses do, they do in an attempt to make you wrong. The Eagles offense is a perfect example of that.

I disagree with Bush being healthier than last year. He was fully recovered last year, but he was mentally broken and gunshy. If you don't want to credit Flores for helping him turn it around this year. That's fine, but his athleticism wasn't the issue last year, it was essentially everything else. While he's still not a great player, the fact he even looks serviceable is incredible to me given how broken he looked at this time a year ago.

I do share your concerns about the hiring of any future coordinators. Everyone hyper focuses on the lack of a coaching tree, but I think it's a valid criticism. He generally hires assistants like hes worried they're gonna be the prime candidate to take his job. It's completely bonkers that he operates this way because he has arguably the most job security of any coach in the league.

 Literally everything 

- Offensive penalties. Just a poorly disciplined display here. Mindless, dumb penalties. This team has zero margin for error and they cannot stop the flags. Putting the offense in god awful position. It’s bad. Real, real bad. Same mistakes week over week. 

- Khello. Well I guess he got benched and going against AJB is a handful but whew he got toasted today. In all phases. Very forgettable game for him. 

- OL. Goes to the first point. Just terrible. Absolutely terrible. Six sacks on your QB. Six. Oh they weren’t just bad there either…

- Run game. Again. What are we doing here? OL can’t move anybody off the line. Najee can’t hit a hole. You’re asking your rookie QB to throw 40+ a game and it’s not going to work. Help him with a run game. This is something we’ve spent 3 years trying to fix and it’s somehow getting worse. 

- Coaching. I mean this is a summary of all the above but the Failed challenge, undisciplined team, sloppy designs. Tomlin, Austin, Canada. All three held accountable here. This team is bad and there’s too much taken to be THIS bad. 

Good-
Had to dig into my bag of tricks here. 

- Sutton. He did good. Smart plays, dropped pick, but he saved a few. About all we can ask for I guess. 

- Malik reed. First half in particular but he showed at least some pass rush. Pressured hurts and got to his arm. Little things help here. 

- Claypool. Not a world beater of a game but outside of the nice TD pass he had some aggressive catches and YAC, powering through the defense. 

Just a terrible game. I try to find things to build off after games but what even is there here? Pickett is going through growing pains, as expected, but everything is just outright bad. This roster has a ton of holes and poor coaching across the board, which is a disaster of a recipe.

We gotta add high draft pick talent to this teams depth or it will be very hard to be at the top.

Trade back for multiple picks. Trade Claypool for a 2nd or 3rd in the off-season (OR next year's trade deadline) because he's going to be a free agent in 2024 anyways. Trade Mason or Mitch for a 4th - 6th or hopefully get a comp pick for Mason since he's a free agent after this year. And see whatever else we can do.

At this point with Calvin Austin III out for the rest of the year it seems we need to keep him this year. But I absolutely would shop for a 2nd or 3rd after this season.

* Steelers offense is super bad, running and passing

* The Steelers have a competent WR Corps that needs to grow on its own but theres a confidence in the group moving forward, adding another rookie would just add to an already green room

* Freiermuth is a TE1 and is a productive downfield option

* Steelers just spent a first on Kenny Pickett who is on pace for the most pace attempts of a rookie QB, in part due to

* Najee Harris is Trent Richardson 2.0

But when it comes to the draft:

* Steelers may win too many games with TJ Watt to net the high end defensive linemen

* There are no blue chip CBs or ILBs this draft, which the Steelers would need. 

* There isnt a blue chip offensive lineman in this draft

* There is only one blue chip offensive weapon in the draft

Did you see how excited he was when Claypool threw the TD to D Watt?  Where is that passion and drive all of the time?  Granted, sitting in the box doesn't afford us the luxury of seeing his reaction 99% of the time.  We get the post pressers to gauge that.  I think it's a mixed bag of his lack of confidence, the players lack of confidence and execution, and the stale ""the Standard is the Standard"" mentality.  I would like to see what sort of mid-season spark a coaching mix-up at OC could do, but, unless they value progression forward as a way to see what this Offense could be, it won't happen until the off-season, if then.

All that said, we've not been in this position (last or bottom of the barrel in all phases of the ball), so this is uncomfortable as fans.  String that together with the decade + of poor playoff play, and it's a recipe for being, rightfully, pissed.

I don't think the problem sits all in the shoulders of one identifiable group or individual, but the Steelers have seen this coming for over 2 - 3 years, but chose to ignore it.  I believe it is a Top-Down issue, with varying degrees of primary responsibility at each level for various inconsistencies, and unfortunately, the product that's on the shelves is unbearable.

At this point, though it could be worse, but why?  I say figure it out, get up to speed with the decade of the lack of moving forward with the new era, and win some games with passion, guts, and GD GLORY.
