Last I checked, they alternate series and only tag out to stay fresh - which is the entire point of not pushing Pollard into the RB1 role. Not sure how Zeke can get over 60% of the snaps if he is coming out every two plays. Regardless, the Lions were tackling low all day, its not fair to hold Zeke at fault for a cheap shot.

Non-contact injuries are so much worse, statistically, for players and their recoveries. Not sure that point has the effect you wanted.

That PCL was torn in week 4 and had no risk of getting worse. It was a matter of pain management and considering that he played all year - I'd say he did an admirable job.

If you have a bull ramming you in the face and then a faster bull takes a few licks, you aren't going to be ready for the change in run style. You might hesitate for a fraction of a second, you might flinch to brace for the impact, or you could even over-pursue and find yourself unable to make a play.

Looks like it ... I hope so.

> Rodgers' most productive reciver is 26 of 41 for a meager 340 yards. His lack of playmakers around him is the Packers problem.

He looks to me like he's playing impatient and trying to force things too much, but I'm certainly no expert eye, so you could well be right.

WR production and QB performance are so inextricably linked, it's hard for me to know which is the chicken and which is the egg sometimes.

> I have no idea what's up with Wilson.

The eye test says Wilson is just playing badly, but again ... I could be way wrong. The problems with Denver could easily be all about the head coach -- Hackett's sure made some puzzlingly-bad in-game decisions that any kid who plays Madden never would have, and that's not the sort of thing you really see quality head coaches do.

I'm wildly biased to see all three be finished, though. It's become pretty old hearing all pundits and announcers endlessly praise them.
