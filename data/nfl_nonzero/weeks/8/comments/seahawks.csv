4118,35224,35224,Caulibflower,"Dunno man. I know there have been articles on Fieldgulls from at least like 5 years ago talking about his inability/unwillingness to take the short/intermediate throws (e.g., 'we all love Russ but let's talk about some areas he can improve his game'). It's just a known flaw to his game that didn't matter as much when he was willing to run more and also had a stronger run game to lean on/play off of. At the end of the day neither of us can be certain, but when you know that the things he's struggling with now are things he's already struggled with for years (albeit not to the same degree), trying to blame his whole decline on one injury seems a bit too speculative for me. I think he's just a good player whose game isn't aging particularly gracefully, and I'm not sure why that should surprise anyone. He's a 33 year-old who made his name as one of the league's premier dual-threats and isn't necessarily going to morph into someone who can beat people from the pocket the same as Brady, Rodgers or Brees.",6.0,nfl,t3_yhemzu,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-10-30T11:31:30Z,seahawks,-0.0034977880658436
4119,35225,35225,Caulibflower,"I keep seeing this take and I just don't agree. Russ has been criticised for ignoring/failing to see open receivers for many years - well before that AZ game (where he made some really stupid throws before that hit everyone talks about). I know there's some appeal in the simplicity of 'he hasn't been the same since a hit to the head,' but that's truly overrating his past ability to diagnose. It was never elite; he's always passed up on open receivers, telegraphed screens, and so on. 

What *did* change around the same time as the AZ game was that teams realised he couldn't beat Cover-2. As we started to give Russ more attempts/game while our ground attack floundered, teams realised that Russ was so insistent on attacking the deep third that if they closed those lanes he would struggle. And Russ still hasn't adapted to that. Without a strong ground game, without the ability to efficiently attack the short and middle areas, you're left with a QB who wants a lot of control and a lot of opportunities, but basically just wants to throw it deep against defenses which have schemed to take away the deep passes. 

I really don't think it was the hit he took against AZ; I think it was just around that time when defenses truly figured him out. Without a strong running attack forces defenses to commit to the LOS - which is again the case in Denver - Russ is so eager to make the big throw that it makes the big throw less effective. He's a QB who's got some elite traits that can be extremely dangerous within the scope of certain offensive gameplans, but if you're just putting him under center and letting him do his own thing, he's so predictable that defenses can just sit back and take away the (relatively few) things that Russ wants to do.",89.0,nfl,t3_yhemzu,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-10-30T09:55:19Z,seahawks,-0.0002794015345635

If Seattle fans say that Russell Wilson was always bad and Pete carried THAT MUCH, they really aren't huge fans. But, in saying that don't take away for what Pete did for Russell Wilson in later years at Seattle. He schemed well.

Regardless, that was a MAJOR part of his game. He scrambled to cause people in coverage to free up, and he would then throw a moon ball and beat them deep. Now he doesn't have that, and he never really prepared for a future that he wouldn't have that. He didn't work on mid to short level passes, and he hasn't worked into stepping up in the pocket to make a pass. STILL TO THIS DAY if he gets pressured he doesn't throw it away much, and he starts to do his nervous jitter of starting to scramble when he can't anymore.

When you can't scramble how are you going to beat a defense in cover 2? Running the ball or throwing it in the middle of the field.

Those can change, but my guy has to let go of his former self, and just be goddamn humble for once and admit he does need to improve. He can be a decent QB, but really it all comes down to himself.",8.0,nfl,t3_ygmxfw,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-10-29T15:45:35Z,seahawks,0.0013422962952151

Player|Field Goals Attempted|Field Goals Made|Field Goal %|EXP's Attempted|EXP's Made|EXP%|Longest Field Goal
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Adam Vinatieri|349|288|82.5%|**412**|**405**|98.3%|57 Yard Field Goal (11/10/02)
Justin Tucker|**376**|**342**|**91.0%**|409|404|**98.8**|**66 Yard Field Goal (9/26/21)**

So over each of their first eleven seasons, all Vinatieri has over Tucker in terms of statistical output is extra points made and attempted and Tucker will probably surpass both of those totals in his next game  And that's WITH Tucker still having 9 games left to go.

Adam Vinatieri does have the playoff success and legendary moments but that's the benefit of playing for the greatest dynasty in NFL history.   Perennial playoff appearance lead to plenty of kicking action

In terms of official accolades, Tucker has

- 5x Pro Bowls vs. Vinatieri's 3

- 5x First Team All-Pro's vs. Vinatieri's 3

- 2x Second-Team All-Pro's vs Vinatieri's 0

- An All-Decade Team Appearance (2010s) to match Vinatieri's (2000's)

All Tucker lacks basically is postseason stats and longevity, aside from those, he's been statistically better and better in an accolade-sense.   And he's done so in under half the length of Vinatieri's career.  

My goal here is not to take away from Vinatieri, dude was a legendary kicker for a LONG time and was the author behind some of the most legendary moments in NFL history.

3. More Parkinson on routes. We haven't seen him break for a TD yet, but this dude is fast and STRONG.

4. Also more Goodwin. He's way too fast and is good at finding space.
