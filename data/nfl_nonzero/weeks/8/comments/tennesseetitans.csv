2033,18726,18726,Bieber_hole_69,"Yeah, it does make the whole situation seem understandable on both ends as far as AJB goes.

Once taxes and his agent’s share are taken into account, dude had probably only made $2.5M or so in his career. Obviously athletes of his caliber will have no issue getting a line of credit way bigger than any of us could ever dream of, but getting $40M guaranteed on a single day is just way too good to pass up if you know somebody is willing to give it to you.

AJB also didn’t seem to have too many endorsements while he was with us, or at least not that many I can remember. Going to a market like Philly also made him infinitely more attractive to brands immediately. The trade put money in his pocket and instantly increased his earning potential exponentially.

I think the Titans were probably willing to match the AAV the Eagles gave him, bit they may not have been willing to ever get him the guarantees he was after. Or at least weren’t willing to do the guarantees yet and wanted to see another season to gauge if his injury issues were a long-term concern. It’s also been brought up elsewhere, but Amy Adams-Strunk is one of the most cash poor owners in the league. She simply may not have had the money on hand to give AJB what he wanted as a signing bonus or what is requires by the league to hold in escrow. Jeff Laurie on the other hand has plenty of money to throw around at any time.",19.0,tennesseetitans,t3_ykfq2v,False,0.0,11,2022-11-02T19:27:01Z,tennesseetitans,0.0507400710819905
2034,18727,18727,Bieber_hole_69,"I think another point not being discussed regarding comparisons between the AJB and Simmons contract situations is how much money Simmons is in line to earn next year if a deal cannot be struck and he just plays on his 5th year option.

Simmons is slated to make $10,753,000 guaranteed in 2023 if a new extension is not done in the off-season compared to the $1.26M that AJB was slated to make this year on the last year of his rookie deal.

There was a real threat and clear motivation for AJB to hold-out longterm if a deal could not be made over the Summer of 2022. That likely played a decent factor into AJB getting traded when he did, along with the Titans wanting to get a return in draft picks that could play this season rather than waiting until the 2023 draft.

I don't expect Simmons to hold-out into the season. The off-season? That will likely happen if a deal can't be hammered out by that time, but there is still plenty of time left to get it done. I don't expect the situation to cause Simmons to miss any regular season time in 2023 though, regardless if we sign him before the season or not.

AJB got $40M guaranteed the moment he signed his contract with the Eagles compared to the $1.26M he would have earned playing out the last year of his rookie deal. There was major, major incentive for AJB to make the situation as difficult on the Titans as possible to either give him the contract he wanted or trade him.

I don't think the same level of incentive exists for Simmons on his fully guaranteed 5th year option salary next year and even a possible franchise tag in 2024 if the worst came to pass. He'd have made $30,000,000 in guaranteed salary by the end of the 2024 season in just '23 and '24 alone if he played on the 5th year and a franchise tag.

There's no reason for the Titans or Simmons to rush into his extension or find someone willing to pay him in the way there was for AJB. They still have a *long* time left to get this deal done, and I don't expect Simmons to threaten an indefinite hold-out in the same way AJB likely would have.",86.0,tennesseetitans,t3_ykfq2v,False,0.0,11,2022-11-02T15:27:43Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0291916025150293

Would you prefer if we just sat pat and didn't trade for Julio? Or if we didn't sign Dupree and Autry?

The Rams don't have first round picks for the next few years because they went all-in. The Eagles sucked ass in 2020 and got bounced in the wild card round to reload for this year and next. The Bills hit on a franchise QB in the draft and are still in the window when he's cheap as hell. We've contended and made the playoffs more years in a row than any of those teams, this is just what happens when you do that and don't have a generational QB on a rookie deal.

We are actually in a really good place with the cap for next season. It's pretty easy to make almost $40M in cap space for next off-season without hurting the team all that much. We still have all our own day one and two draft picks indefinitely.

2022 is our reset year to get right with the cap and not mortgage the future further. We made all our all-in moves for 2020 and 2021 and it didn't work.

I do not know the mechanics on how this trade would work cap-wise though. [The Broncos cannot take on any of Chubb's money if the trade is made today. The deadline for that was yesterday.](https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1587445087788830723?s=20&t=ma5j-WM1EBhro4j6F_GMtQ)

Chubb is owed $7M for the rest of the season and we have under $2M in cap space currently. Would we have to extend him as part of the trade to reduce his cap hit for 2022? Doesn't seem like good business to extend him before he hits the locker room, unless they already know for sure they're cutting Dupree and/or Autry in the offseason. They're probably moving on from at least one, but may need to move on from both if Chubb is a factor. I also just don't think that many moving parts could fall into place before the deadline. It's just too much to do.

DVOA still had the Jags at a top 10 team last week, even at 2-5. That probably puts us way higher in their strength of schedule since we still play them twice.

By DVOA the Chiefs, Jags, Cowboys, and Eagles were all top 10 teams last week, that's 5 games on the schedule.

Okay, just checked the updated DVOA rankings from yesterday:

Jags are no longer top 10, they are 15th. But some teams have gone up that I didn't expect. Broncos are 12th and Packers are 13th. Bengals are 7th, although I would expect them to go down after last night. KC, Philly, and Dallas are all top 5.

I agree that our schedule gets much harder in the second half of the season, but do we really think the Packers, Bengals (maybe without Chase,) Broncos, and Jags are all top half of the league teams? I think we're better than all those teams and should beat them.

KC, Dallas, and Philly are all definitely better than us, but going 0-3 in those games doesn't really make a difference in our season if we can take care of business otherwise.

Kwesi Adofo-Mensah came in as GM of the Vikings this year and promptly made trades in his first draft with two teams in the NFC North. Seems to have worked out fine for him.

Just like we would have been fucked if he got hurt in 2021. Or fucked if he got hurt in 2020. Or fucked if he got hurt in 2019.

That's just how the NFL is. There are not 32 starting-caliber QBs in the league at any time, so there are most definitely not 64. Any team with a top-16 QB is going to be fucked if they go down for any significant amount of time. The one exception in the last decade being when Nick Foles went on one of the best hot streaks a QB has ever had in the 2017 playoffs.

Do you think the Bills would be contenders if Allen went down and Case Keenum was suddenly running that offense? Or would the Chiefs be contenders if Mahomes went down and Chad Henne was trotting out as their starter?

For any backup QB making a spot-start, you have to tailor the gameplan to make it as easy as possible on them, especially a rookie making his first start after playing in the most QB friendly system in all of college football. It's way, way more likely that a backup is going to lose you the game than win you the game, you just have to limit the chances he has to fuck up.

This was a game that really mattered for us to win, any win against the division on the road is a game you really need to have if you want to host a playoff game. The gameplan for Willis had to be something that would take the game out of his hands and put it into Henry's. They did exactly that, and we won.

The only reason Willis will need to be ready at any point this season is if Tannehill is put on IR and out for 4+ games, and if that happens the season is probably over. We would be moving into the, ""Let's see if Willis shows enough to keep us from drafting a QB in the first next year,"" mode of evaluation.

The only time I can remember Vrabel doing anything similar was when Vrabel put Mariota in as an injury replacement for Gabbert during the first Jags game in 2018, but that was only because there wasn't a third QB on the roster, and at that point Woodside had been on the PS for like two weeks. In the event Gabbert got hurt it was either keep Mariota active as a reserve QB that couldn't grip the football, or run wildcat.

That was a different situation than the one we have currently though, Mariota *could* play, but was injured in such a way that the staff thought a healthy veteran Gabbert gave us the best chance to win over the injured Mariota.

>According to ESPN's Dianna Russini, Brown requested a change of scenery, and was asking the Titans for guaranteed money close to $80 million. This figure was also reported by ESPN's Turron Davenport, and SI's John Glennon. Brown's new four-year, $100 million deal with Philly came with $57 million guaranteed.

>While Brown claimed the Titans' offer was $16 million per year that could reach $20 million per year with incentives, Russini reports that the Titans' offer was more than that, but that her source wouldn't share the actual numbers. Brown said he would have re-signed with the Titans for $22 million per year, but Glennon reports that Brown was asking for even more than the $25 million average he received from the Eagles.

AJ on the other hand is not in decline and thus of course you give him more touches (probably the touches we haven't been giving to Henry this year... see the eagles game with AJ getting 3 TD's and stunting on the steelers a team we normally have trouble with).

AJ is a star player who could have been huge for us for the next ten, fifteen years, and a key piece as the staff work towards a functional post-Henry offence. The trade was disappointing less for itself in isolation, as what it probably means for the whole team going forward.

21189,133850,133850,SomewhatMarigold,"That game would have been torture if I wasn't a fan of the Titans, but it was fantastic fun to watch our defence pretty much completely shut down the Texans' offence and Henry absolutely dominate their defence. I get why people are worried that he's been overly-used, but man, he was just running at will for about 90% of the game, and when it's just *that easy* to move the ball on the ground, it would have been a bad move to change things up. Besides, it was amazing to see him get his fourth-straight 200+ yard game against the Texans.

Willis was... rough. I wasn't expecting much, but he was really not great: slow to process, inaccurate, and making poor decisions. He seemed distinctly reluctant to take off running--I wonder if all of the insistence that he stays in the pocket and gets experience trying to throw it in the preseason has rubbed off on him maybe just a bit too much. I also wonder if he may have suffered a bit from the coaching staff expecting Tannehill to play all week: they may have  thrown in more designed runs and other plays to suit him if they'd had a full week knowing he was going to be the starter. He may have warmed up a bit and got a bit more confident if the gameplan had relied on him throwing more, but why take the risk when the running game is working so well? In any case, he did what he needed to do to win. Hopefully the experience was good for him on some level and he can continue to develop on the practice-field--and hopefully Tannehill doesn't miss any more games.

Simmons is absolutely incredible. His stats are good, but even then they don't fully reflect everything he does for this team. Our secondary seemed really solid--Fulton was obviously a highlight, and Mitchel must have been doing decently well not to be targeted. Obviously you don't want to make too much of the defence as a whole given who they were playing against (and who they've played against for weeks now), but hopefully some of this quality will transfer into playing a much, much more powerful offence in the Chiefs next week, and the other high-scoring teams we have coming up over the rest of the season. I have no doubt that they'll continue to play well and at least slow all these teams down--it'll just be up to our offence to get some drives going and get points on the board to keep us in these games.",11.0,tennesseetitans,t3_yiae4f,False,0.0,:Titans:,2022-10-31T07:53:34Z,tennesseetitans,0.0390934631108849

The Texans have a terrible team. But this Titans team I don't think is as good as its record. Toss in a huge variable like Willis instead of Tanne, and this game could easily come apart at the seams.

53850,310756,310756,xiamhunterx,"I’d love if he turned out to be even just be a reliable starter because that means it’s one less position we need to fix in a few years, but there’s a reason he was a 3rd round pick. even the titans passed on him multiple times. I’d say if you don’t have a first round grade on a QB, you don’t really trust that he can become a starter for you down the line 

It’s unfair to Willis that he was propped up pre-draft as much as he was. in any other year, he’s not close to being talked about as a first round talent. this was just a bad QB class and the media needs QBs to talk about during the draft process, so now we have a bunch of people thinking we got some insane steal

it’s of course not impossible that he can fix his glaring issues and become, at the very least, a serviceable spot starter but he’s a ways away from being able to carry an offense *and* the titans have a very poorly optimized roster for him right now",0.0,tennesseetitans,t3_yht0zv,False,0.0,:Titans2:,2022-10-31T07:34:36Z,tennesseetitans,-0.044867424
