Our roster is young and talented, but inexperienced too, not to mention the positions that still need improvement (OL, LBs, QB and passing game, possibly TEs). I believe the plan is to stick to Lovie for at least three years: 2022 and 2023 will be years of rebuilding the roster through draft picks, free agencies and trades (where possible); 2024 will be the season where the team will hopefully be enough complete to be competitive.
I don‚Äôt know for sure whether Caserio was involved in hiring Culley or not, and personally I believe he wasn‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs why Culley was fired that early. I see Caserio having long-term plans and being already evaluating the next HC, but a change now would definitely be premature. I think Lovie was promoted with the aim of rebuilding the roster‚Äôs mentality, he‚Äôll stay until the job is done.",3.0,texans,t3_y0ltp1,False,0.0,:HOU:,2022-10-10T15:25:04Z,texans,0.0847311021090534
