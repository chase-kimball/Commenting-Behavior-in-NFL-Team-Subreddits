6524,38293,38293,ChefCurrySauce,"Because most people here have no idea that the organization is selling them a product.

The fact of the matter is that the NFL is literally built to have parity - teams go from worst to first ALL the time due to the structure of the draft/FA and football in and of itself is a sport where scheme often trumps talent. Hire good coaches, draft and sign good players, and you can win. You’re on an upward trajectory. Then your best guys get paid by other teams, your best coaches get poached, and you’re on a downward trajectory.

99% of NFL teams achieve the “upward trajectory”  part of that cycle just as a natural byproduct of being a part of the system in the first place. The lions are a bumbling joke of an organization that, somehow, defy basic probability. Fans, especially younger ones, have yet to fully grasp that positive results should manifest QUICKLY … the rules of the system essentially guarantee this.

Because of that, they buy whatever an incoming regime is selling them and they buy it HARD. They gobble up whatever the current braintrust tells them. With Caldwell it was “professionalism and accountability”, with Patricia it was “multiple scheme/do your job/patriots north”, with Campbell it’s the Ted Lasso shtick. Younger, less jaded members of this fanbase don’t understand that the org/GM/coaches are selling them a product and that, by not holding anyone accountable and trying to silence fans who demand fast results, they play right into the hands of the org.",37.0,detroitlions,t3_y0rbni,False,0.0,Spiciest Memelord,2022-10-10T17:07:43Z,detroitlions,-0.0087189253253607

Before the inevitable “this is a rebuild” crowd comes out of the woodwork, including all of the mods of this sub (of which I’m gladly no longer one), I’d like to point a few things out:

- Dan Campbell is 4-17-1 as Lions head coach. MANY of these games were absolutely winnable and yet the dude has a .235 win percentage. His coaching decisions are mind boggling week after week in addition to the team coming out completely unprepared. I LIKE Dan, I really really do. He seems like he cares a fuck ton about the team, the city, etc …. but how far does that really get you?
- The defense under Aaron Glenn is, statistically, worse than Matt Patricia’s.
- I’m actually unable to comment on the quality of our special teams because we hardly see them on the field in any capacity.
- The injuries, while surely mostly bad luck, are an issue that EVERY team deals with. Do they make things harder? Absolutely. Are they an excuse for why we almost invariable get absolutely shellacked on one or both sides of the ball every single week? NO.

It’s time to face the facts and accept things for what they are. How many “rebuilding” teams do you see getting absolutely dusted on a weekly basis? We’re ROUTINELY obliterated under the leadership of this coaching staff and, regardless of what any of the slappies have to say about it, it is NOT NORMAL and NOT STANDARD in the NFL.

The sooner we realize Campbell and co are NOT IT, the sooner we can move ahead and take yet another swing at someone to turn us around after the previous 50 years of swings. I wanted Campbell to be the guy - I really did - and I wish him the utmost success both personally and professionally wherever he goes because he seems like a fucking awesome dude, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that this particular position at this particular time is not one that he can handle.

I like Holmes - I think his defensive drafting has mostly been bad but REALLY like everything else he’s done. Let Holmes who, unlike the coaches, has proven and tangible results during his tenure actually choose a head coach like a GM is supposed to. 

Don’t buy what these coaches are selling you. Don’t forget what the last 3 weeks have been. Hold the org accountable and hope for better days.

28665,164358,164358,RedWingWay,"I've reread some of these posts and Im sticking by my initial reaction to what you are going through. Weight loss isn't what you should be focusing on. Being healthy is the number one thing. If you feel healthy and stop looking at the scale you'd be amazed at your weight loss after a few months. Most of this is mental. 

Weight loss is one of the by products of a healthy lifestyle. Walk!! Go out for a 30 minute walk. Not to lose weight but to get some fresh air and move around a little bit. 

Eat healthier foods because it taste good. Don't kill yourself counting calories. Have fun making yourself a good meal with some veggies and some meat and have a glass of wine with it! You might end up really enjoying cooking. 

This doesn't have to be an overnight weight loss driven slog. You're trying to battle years of bad habits. Start some new ones. The weight loss will come but its only a residual effect of changing how you think about yourself. 

Like I mentioned join a bowling league and get out of the house around other people. Bowling isn't going to cut weight but you're doing something different and it takes your mind off of things and stops you from just focusing on food. You can volunteer somewhere. Just start changing your daily routine and stop looking at the scale and you'll be amazed after a few months of where you are.",1.0,nfl,t3_xxzwp8,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2022-10-07T19:46:39Z,detroitlions,0.0118940237816032

You are still overly focused on food and intake. It becomes a hobby all by itself. Which in turn still makes your brain focused solely on food. 

You want to get out of the habit of making food the center of your universe. Eat healthy. Cheat days are just perpetuating bad habits IMHO.

He had a trick he figured out. He couldn't escape food BUT he found if he put a $$$ to it he would start mentally optioning things out. 

""I could go to Wendy's BUT its going to cost me $20. I could put that $20 towards saving for a big screen TV. So thats what he did. He had a jar he would stuff money into every time he felt the urge to go get fast food. 

He felt better and better as the money piled up and it was a reward that he was working to. The more money in the jar the better he felt about himself. 

A big bag of potato chips costs about $4.00. He would just not even look at them when he was out shopping. Thats a lot of money for some instant gratification.

Holmes is the right GM. He probably has earned the right to pick his own coach in a few years.

Goff is adequate when the pocket is clean and he has enough talent around him. At $30.6M and $31.6 for 2023-24 his cap hit is middle of the pack. Worth keeping around while we develop his replacement.

Dan Campbell is not an NFL caliber head coach. Great motivator and a good coach for a rebuild. The over aggressiveness on both sides hurts the team. It’s a results oriented league, and he’s a bit of a fraud.

No that's not ok! He needs discipline to make those tackles. An almost sack isn't good enough if the QB escapes the pocket and gains yards by either finding an open guy or running it himself, an almost sack is only good enough if he forces them to throw away the ball, which he hasn't done!",7.0,detroitlions,t3_y0h8ul,False,0.0,Cheese Grater,2022-10-10T10:23:52Z,detroitlions,0.1458578125
