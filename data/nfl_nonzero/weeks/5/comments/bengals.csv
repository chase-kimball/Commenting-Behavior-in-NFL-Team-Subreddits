Then you'll get 1 on 1 matchups in the short passing game and a man advantage in the run game. You can call RPOs that allow Higgins/Chase to beat their man on slants, digs, outs. Mixon will have an extra blocker and should be able to get 3-4 yards on most carries. 

Inevitably they start to cheat the safeties down. You can play action to a 1 on 1 deep shot or audible to 4 wide, motioning Mixon wide left and Hurst off of the inline to the slot. Or, Mixon can stay in the backfield where he can run a Texas route right where the linebacker is bailing out to stop an intermediate throw to Hurst in the seam. Now the defense has to choose instead of dictate.

Instead, Taylor is sitting in 11 and hoping the defense makes a mistake or one of our guys makes a spectacular play. I feel like I can count on 1 hand the number of easy completions we get per game while other teams get a dozen or more.

I love Joe as much as the next fan but he was a rookie for a chunk of this and the year he wasn't a rookie we went to the Super Bowl, winning 5 straight one score games to get there. That alone lights your entire argument on fire. But because I've got time today:

I have lots of issues with your methodology. Mostly because it's arbitrary. Think of it this way: if a game is 31-17 and we score a last-minute TD to make it 31-24 with 10 seconds left, that requires an onside kick to even have a chance to tie, is that REALLY a ""close game""

Just looking at one score final scores would say yes, watching the game would say no. I would wager that this scenario happens a LOT for Mahomes who has enjoyed playing with leads for most of his career on Super Bowl caliber teams. I don't care enough to dig this deep, but it makes as much sense as your arbitrary crackpot ""research""

Burrow was a **rookie** in 2020 when we went 1-4-1 in such games prior to his injury. Lo and behold, the one win was a 2 score game until Jacksonville kicked a FG with 8 seconds left. Does that mean it was a close game? No, when you need a literal miracle to happen that, by and large, isn't a close game where you can put the W/L on the coach. One of the losses? We scored a TD while down 12 with 43 seconds left, is that a close game? 

Not only do I think this is the dumbest fucking way to evaluate a coach (like he gets ZERO credit for beating a team by 20, but let's shit on him for losing a game by 3), but the majority of your sample size is also from teams that were unquestionably bad football teams. There is a reason we got Joe and the #1 overall pick in the first place, we were a bad fucking roster in 2019, 2020. The year that we had a solid roster in 2021, we were 8-6 in one-score games. One-score games are ALWAYS going to happen a lot in a season.

42781,323872,323872,moochee22,"I think you are right. 

Collins is turning out to be one of the worst signings in recent years. 

I've seen Collins helping out on a double team (when another rusher blows right threw his other side), several times this year. Something isn't right. I don't think an injury makes you do that. It's either coaching, he just doesn't give a fuck, or is not smart enough to adjust.",15.0,bengals,t3_y1uana,False,0.0, ,2022-10-12T09:30:42Z,bengals,0.034364699074074

46074,349478,349478,slytherinprolly,"The key is not slowing the game down. Close NBA and college basketball games become borderline unwatchable in the final minute with how many stoppages and reviews take place. 

Think about how that would translate to a hurry up offense in the final minute of a game if the refs are constantly having to start and stop the game to either review plays or confirm the ""precise"" spot. 

That being said there needs to be a happy balance somewhere. There should be automatic review of certain things.",26.0,nfl,t3_y1igre,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2022-10-11T15:00:27Z,bengals,0.0751479999999999

But using my own judgement and my eyes I would say there is approx a 95% chance the player has a concussion. And it is well known that players can and do cheat concussion tests. And I personally think protecting the player in that situation is more important than letting them play for what is simply a game.
