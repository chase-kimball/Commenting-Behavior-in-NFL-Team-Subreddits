2123,18827,18827,Bieber_hole_69,"There were some message board rumors that still persist saying Bud Adams offered Peyton an ownership stake in the team to come here.

Could you imagine that? Peyton coming back to Tennessee for a few years at QB and then retiring to work in the FO? What a crazy timeline that would have been. Having to play the Colts twice a year probably sank our actual chances at landing him. Weren't the final 3 teams the Texans, Broncos, and Titans? The Texans were probably a better landing spot than the Broncos, they would have at least gotten to a Super Bowl with Manning instead of Schaub during that time. It doesn't seem like a coincidence that he ended up picking the team that wasn't in the same division as Indy.

I don't know what would have happened if he came here in 2012 on the field though. 2011 and 2012 were pretty middling teams, and all things considered Hasselbeck played pretty well for us in 2011, (that second Colts game aside,) and we still were a tie-breaker out of the wild card and a clear cut below Houston in the division.

Meanwhile, that Broncos team was genuinely a QB away from a contender. They won a playoff game with goddamn Tebow lol. They had a worse regular season record than we did, but that team was still stacked with talent that we just didn't have.

Edit: Another thing that I just thought of, it's pretty funny that the 2011 Texans coaching staff had Kubiak as HC and Wade Phillips as DC, the same guys that would end up on the 2015 Broncos staff that won the Super Bowl with Manning.",3.0,tennesseetitans,t3_y2bb8s,False,0.0,11,2022-10-12T13:47:00Z,tennesseetitans,0.068532127385349

I don't know what is baked into the FPI formula that is this down about the Titans. I'm not saying they're a top 10 team or a contender or anything, I don't think that, but they gave the Commanders like a 70% chance of winning last week.

When the team ranked 7 spots higher in your power rankings has almost 20% less of a chance to win the same division, maybe it's time to reevaluate your FPI formula, or how you do power rankings. If the power rankings were consistent and had the teams by how FPI has them ranked, I wouldn't have an issue with it. The Jaguars are even given a 56.5% chance of beating the Titans in Nashville based on FPI right now, FPI clearly thinks the Jags are a better team. Their strength of schedule is not that different remaining either, the major difference being the Titans play the Packers instead of the Lions since the Bills game is out of the way already, Bengals/Ravens is pretty much a wash.

The Titans are one spot below the Bengals in these power rankings, but FPI gives the Bengals a 62.7% chance of winning on the road against the Titans in November.

I was pointing out that turnovers are an aspect to the game and that you guys also were not hot on defense or offense either if you had 3 turnovers. 

That’s not the only reason you lost. Another is because you couldn’t stop the run game or again we scored 24 points on offense and y’all scored 17 points. 

The total yards argument isn’t relevant because our first touchdown came when we got the ball on the 32 yard line because we forced a fumble with a sack.

To you probably not cause your hung up on 2 stats turnovers and passing yards. Your understanding of total yards this game is just wrong. No score by the colts was less than 60yard drive. So, is that a defense problem or an offense problem or a turnover problem. Yes, it’s the entire teams problem because all contributed.

3268,23871,23871,Bruin2024,"This is the dumbest take I’ve ever seen. To argue that the colts were in every way better than the titans except score and turnovers is just hysterical. Bruh what are you smoking. First off SCORE (are you dumb seriously) the most important thing in a game can not be put under anything else statistically. 

What about sacks that game? The colts had sacks on crucial drives and more yards lost on sacks. Penalties what about that? Colts had one more and 10 more yards. What about rushing yards? Yep your “#1 running back in the league” wasn’t on his knees begging Big ole Jeff to stop tackling him and your defense was definitely on their knees because of the King! What about redzone finishes? Titans 3-3 Colts 2-3. Does any of these stats matter? Or where the interception was thrown? Yep that matters cause it involves context and the overall objective in the magical game we call football good sir is THE SCORE. 

To argue the one point you gave that the Colts did better than the Titans did in the air. Well let’s put your argument in context. Your down 24-3 with 7ish minutes left to go in the 2nd quarter. Hmmmm how do you save time in a football game and maximize your opportunity to get back in the game. Pass the ball (what a concept right)! Now, let’s look on the other side. How do you keep a lead and waste the other teams time? You run the ball! 

If you do not win, you did not beat the dogshit out of the other team. If you did, you would have won because the overall objective of this game and the only thing that matters at the end of the game is the Score and who won. Not how you got there.

My dad passed away last Sunday after the colts game. He was already in the hospital on life support and we took him off because that's what he wanted. Or at least that's what he'd expressed in his living will and everything. I've been watching Titans football with my dad since I can remember.

We would either be texting during the game or do a phone call after the game to chat or both. My dad and I didn't always agree on things. We didn't always necessarily have the best of relationships, but Titans football is definitely the one thing that we always shared. He had my Derek Henry Jersey on his hospital bed when we beat the colts last week and I got the opportunity to watch one more game with him. This past week has been hell between losing my dad and then having to start going through all of his stuff really quickly because I don't live in the same city that he lives anymore. But the Titans were able to give me 3 hours where I wasn't thinking about that. I was able to focus on football and remember all the good times that I had with my dad talking about football.

Cut Tannehill, Lewan and Cunningham and magically went from -16mil to having +25mil in cap space. Thats without cutting Dupree and Woods. Dupree and Woods jumps that up to +48mil. I personally would like to keep Dupree with Landry coming back and Weaver developing. Idk I just dont want there to be a chance for fresh rotation of the DL bodies. Dupree can be structured and save another 11mil so could be +36mil. Restructure Woods for another 9mil in savings. So with both of them restructure Titans would be at +45mil.
