I think the panic earlier in the season/off season about packaging a bunch of picks to get a top overall pick to make sure we could get one of the most highly touted prospects was a bit overblown. There are a ton of good QBs that have been drafted in the 5-15 range recently.

Unfortunately, he doesn’t have the mobility he used to have, so he can’t run for yardage when the opportunity presents itself and he can’t extend plays until he sees an open receiver as well as he used to. His accuracy is the thing that everyone thought he’d always have, but it seems off too - maybe that’s the shoulder injury.

He just seems like a guy who can’t do the things he used to, and needs to humble himself and improve his flaws in order to continue to be a viable quarterback. Unfortunately, he’s spent years building up this narrative that he was this untouchable, elite quarterback that was being let down by the system around him. Now he’s put himself in a position where he got everything he wanted, and has control of his own offense, and has enormous expectations to go out and be the second coming of Brady and… he’s completely exposed. 

I don’t really know where he goes from here. He’ll have a few years in Denver to figure it out, but he’s backed himself into such a corner that I don’t really know where you go psychologically.
