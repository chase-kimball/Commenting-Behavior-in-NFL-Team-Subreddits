Our coaching hasnt been great. Play calling feels weak, but add in the injuries and it doesn’t feel like we are scoring as easily. In the redzone its getting atrocious. Im hopeful it gets better, but i also fee like Leftwich is going to be holding us back with his lack of creativity.

First half A, had they kept it up, same. But they allowed 2 longer drives and nearly let them back in the game, I blame the offense not keeping the D off the field but you gotta step up when you gotta step up, and they nearly handed the falcons back the game.

Lets assume that's a bad call and shouldn't have happen. Great, then does that mean all other bad calls/ no calls should have also been correct? Because if it was, then RTP wouldn't even happen the first place. So really, they cancelled out. I much rather all calls are correct but here we are.
