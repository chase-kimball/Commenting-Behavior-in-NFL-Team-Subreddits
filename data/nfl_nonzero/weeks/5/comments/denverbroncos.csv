6754,29405,29405,ChickenParm18,"I’ve been pretty spoiled being a fan of this team in my almost 30 years of existence. There have definitely been some sore thumb moments that stick out, but for the most part we’ve had it better then almost any other fan base.

With that being said, last night was probably the worst game I have ever watched as a fan of the team. When you combine our expectations this season, how absolute ass and injured the Colts were, our 3rd primetime game in 5 weeks, and this is what we get.

I worked 12 hours yesterday so by the time I got home I honestly wasn’t excited about the game. I just told myself well let’s see not how we win but how we just don’t lose. And then drive after drive of nothing, Matt Ryan literally BEGGING us to stay in the game with his terrible INTs. They lost their backup RB on the first drive, which is apparently our kryptonite because whenever we play a team with a 3rd string RB we lose.

It’s only 5 games, but it’s officially fair to ask these questions. Is Russ…bamboozling us? Is he actually any good anymore? Every game has had underthrown bombs, overthrown fades, short passes with way too much heat on it, and top it off with his INTs and miss on the final play. How does he miss Hamler? HOW? Is Hackett even remotely ready to be a head coach? He looks lost and confused, and the team doesn’t feel bought in. When we were in shotgun on 4th and 1 then a timeout was called I thought surely, now he’ll go under center and we’ll easily run this for a first or TD, as the running game had gotten better throughout. Then we go back out in shotgun again, time out. Surely this time we’ll figure it out! Nope, shotgun again.

I could keep going, but any excitement I had for this season is over. The only hope I have is seemingly the entire league except maybe 3-5 teams look like .500 at best right now. But the worst part is as we keep shitting the bed all we’re doing is helping Seattles draft stock. Every game I’ve told myself this is the one things start clicking. The 2-3 start with Chargers on MNF is an ironic parallel, but it’s not the same. This team is not going on an 11 game win streak.

8351,49051,49051,GearsofTed14,"In this scenario (where there is no “all 3” option), I think Hackett is the easiest the answer to be fired. While Russ has definitely played bad for good chunks thus far, Hackett has more of the cloud hanging over his head (fairly or not) which makes it easier to make him the fall guy, and while the one and done coaches are certainly a bad look, they can just chalk him up as the next Freddie Kitchens or Steve Wilks or Chip Kelly—all of whom were replaced by much better coaches. It’s a lot harder to one-and-done your $250M QB while he’s still young enough to be effective, coming off his first year in an entirely different situation where there were more problems than just him; and frankly, his name value far exceeds Hackett’s, and that’s gonna keep Russ here at *least* another two years I’d say, bare minimum. They’ll make sure he’s bad with *two* head coaches before tossing him overboard. Paton is safe for next year I think—despite the redditor freak outs saying otherwise, he’s not some primary source to blame for a lot of this, and is still considered one of the top talent evaluators in the league, and has built a very good roster in the limited time he’s been here—yes, there are OL issues, but no GM is perfect. To fire *him* after this season would be extremely hotheaded and not only *not* solving a problem, but creating a new one.

In fact, it seems like we are regressing as if this was possible. Saying that the Broncos' offense will improve is an exercise in faith, not a sports analysis. For an ""offensive guru"", Hackett hasn't shown ANYTHING that makes me think ""well, at least that's an improvement"".  

But we can't put all the fault in Hackett for this game. I don't recognize Russell Wilson. Missing wide open guys, trying too hard to make throws that weren't there, throwing 2 mind-boggling interceptions. Guys, 2 INTs in FG range and one blocked FG. Just a single point in one of these 3 plays and this would be a win.  

I don't want to be that pessimistic and I know I'm probably overreacting after watching probably one of the Top 5 worst games of my entire life, but things don't seem like they'll get much better. To add insult to injury, the injury bug is running rampant again and we're losing one starter after another.

23199,126969,126969,baha24,"> But I can say, unequivocally, that as a fan base, we’re are part of the problem too.

This fan base is extremely spoiled. Fans of at least half the other teams in the league would kill to have the success we've had in our franchise's history, including, it's worth remembering, within *just the last decade.* You will get no crocodile tears from Browns, Jets, Lions, Jaguars, Texans, Panthers, etc. fans for us. I'm with you, u/TheDebateMatters -- I'm not suggesting we have to be green-eyed about the poor play we've seen so far, especially from a QB for whom we backed up the Brinks truck. Totally fine to critique this team. But man, so many fans have insane levels of entitlement. I mean, the boo birds were out during our first home game!? GTFO.

Expectations were *way* too high coming into this season. In Peyton Frikkin' Manning's first season, we were so close to starting 2–4 (and people were even calling for the return of Tebow, lmao), but because PFM was a generational talent, we found a way to get right sooner than later. I love Russell as both a player and person and think he has had an elite career, but he's not PFM. And the whole offense is operating in a new system with a first-time HC. Do people not remember what happened in during Zac Taylor's first two seasons in Cincy? They went 2–14! Then they went 4–12, including 2–7–1 before Burrow got injured. Again, *have some perspective.*

Yes, Russ is a vet. Yes, he is playing worse than he has for most of his career. You can acknowledge these things while also 1) assuming that at some point they will get things on the right track, even if it takes longer than we'd like (Russ's mistakes seem to be more mental than physical, and Hackett has nowhere to go but up as he gains more experience) and 2) not melting down because we didn't become a Super Bowl contender from Week 1.

I've been a Broncos fan since 1997, so I obviously want to see this team succeed every season. But I feel like several years of mediocrity and irrelevance (and I'm not talking about the 6 post-PFM seasons) might humble this fan base a bit. Truly disappointing to see this.
