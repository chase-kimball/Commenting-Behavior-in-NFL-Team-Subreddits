Murray plays COD not with his own teammates but with a whole set of another people. That‚Äôs something to consider too. So it‚Äôs not that COD is bad but most of the time he plays with another professional league!

21168,187377,187377,gwwwhhhaaattt,"2006 new stadium opened. That brings a ton of fans from a history of lack of loyalty. 2008-2009 made us Super Bowl contenders and division competitors. Then we didn‚Äôt really compete until Bruce Arians came in.

Remember the Arizona franchise is young. Like 1988 young.  I remember growing up in Phoenix and I knew one kid that was an Arizona Cardinals fan. Most people were cowboys fans because that was the cool thing to do (they were the team in the early 90‚Äôs). 

I think with the success of the Stadium opening, building of the Super Bowl team, then continuation of a winning culture for Bruce Arians continued that momentum. 

People also forget though that most fans were fed up with Bruce Arians at the end of his term because he was stubborn and too loyal to his attitude and coaches.  We weren‚Äôt happy with mediocre. It‚Äôs similar to the Kliff Kingsbury fans and haters now. 

So that‚Ä¶hiring of Steve Wilks and Rosen killed momentum. Everyone knew that. BA was a character and brought a culture. It was the no fly zone and no risk it no biscuit.  Wilks and Rosen was like watching a little kids band concert. No one wanted to be there. The music wasn‚Äôt good and the that concert was expensive. 

Kliff came and Murray came with some fan fare but some fans did not like that we moved on from Wilks so fast. However the biggest thing was Covid.  Kliff and Murray came with reallly really high expectations. It was balls to the wall of risk that needed to have lots of reward. Remember Kliff was compared to the new McVay. 

So you asked about last year‚Ä¶again we earned the Cardiac Cards nickname for a reason. People have been used to losing and watching from home for so long. So for the Cardinals to win so well still doesn‚Äôt change culture.  

That‚Äôs why I say just 1.5 seasons of dominating wins.  Or Super Bowl winning and playoff contender the next year‚Ä¶then the bandwagon fans will come back. Those fans will then become loyal again. 

So‚Ä¶lack of football culture can be won by winning lots of games. You can‚Äôt be excited about losing or mediocre teams.

I‚Äôll also say as a season ticket holder for the past 6-7 years. I caught the end of the Palmer years‚Ä¶Rosen really lost us a lot of fans.  Murray is great but the games won have always mostly been cardiac style.  Covid also lost a lot of local season ticket fans as well. I believe it was last game where they advertised the Cardinals 5k run where they are giving away 1000 tickets for the first 1000 registered. There was another promotion I saw where the Cardinals were handing away hundreds of tickets for a promotion as well. 

The stadium isn‚Äôt sold out anymore and hasn‚Äôt been the last two/three seasons.

With that there‚Äôs a ton of opposing fans in (not just name brand teams either). The rhythm of play this past few years at home also doesn‚Äôt help. Even the Vikings game that kicked off last year‚Ä¶Cardinals we‚Äôre losing bad and it came down to the last field goal miss from the Vikings. 

I heard someone say to another local Cardinals fan at last home game, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry this was your first NFL game‚Äù.  Meaning the product just isn‚Äôt entertaining for people to fork over hundreds to attend.

So local fans just don‚Äôt want to go to the games. Regular season ticket holders like me are burnt out from being burned from the product that‚Äôs been on the field.  With Covid, Rosen, and the lack of K1/K2 touchdowns‚Ä¶I can see why there isn‚Äôt a home field advantage. 

Wait and see how many Eagles fans there will be in a few days‚Ä¶it‚Äôs going to be embarrassing.  ‚ÄúProtect the nest‚Äù is a bait and switch marketing term because the Cardinals aren‚Äôt doing it themselves and the locals can‚Äôt be the ‚Äú12th man‚Äù if the 11 don‚Äôt show up together consistently.

I remember talking to Cortez and that crew at a game who have been there since the ASU game and they were saying that people pay hundreds to watch a music act but how the NFL is more than worth it for the entertainment/cost ratio. I‚Äôm starting to think that‚Äôs not the case in recent years for the Cardinals.  For the opposing fans it‚Äôs been great we make every team look like SB contenders.  

I‚Äôm glad we won that Raiders game but it‚Äôs the defense and Mayfield‚Äôs lack of accuracy that won that game.  We need to claim back our reputation (or at least build a better one from our Cardinals mostly lackluster history).",8.0,azcardinals,t3_xxqqrd,False,0.0,:cardinals: Cardinals,2022-10-07T03:32:18Z,azcardinals,0.0217471237382621
