Makes sense since he broke one of the biggest rules of being in the field. If players are entering/exiting the tunnel, you do not cross that path let alone run in front of a player with equipment. That‚Äôs the first thing you learn on the job. The NFL takes that shit super serious because it‚Äôs a safety risk for all involved especially their ‚Äúassets‚Äù. That‚Äôs the easiest way to lose field access or better yet get fired. Whomever he was freelancing for is probably SOL when they try to get another NFL contract in the future.

Half of the comments are people saying he was minding his own business or trying to do his job. He broke a **huge** rule that would result in revoked access or termination. The shove was entirely avoidable and Adams shouldn‚Äôt have done that, but the collision in the first place is on the cameraman. His equipment makes contact with Adams.

Is he identifying the Mike properly, checking the RB into a pass block when he should? If he's not great with pre-snap duties and not great at avoiding pressure and not great at getting the ball out quickly its gonna make the O-line look like crap. 

Throw me a bone and let's assume some of the above is true.  If teams know that there are communication issues with protection, the QB has zero escapability, and he holds the ball too long they're just gonna pin their ears back and get after him.  On top of that apparently the coaching staff isn't letting him audible (trust issues?) so we could be in bad plays half the time.

News flash, there are a lot of teams with crap O-lines. If you can't get out of the pocket and make a play you better know your offense like the back of your hand and get the ball out fast.  

No one is afraid of Wentz's legs or escspability, you know what that does? It let's defenses play Wentz differently than other QBs, it looks like he's moving around in quick sand back there.  Though he's not a complete statue teams know when they get pressure on him he's gonna get absorbed into it.

I'm out ~$100 and about 6hrs of the day for that shit that happened on Sunday.
