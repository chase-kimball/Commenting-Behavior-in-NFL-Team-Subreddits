Makes sense since he broke one of the biggest rules of being in the field. If players are entering/exiting the tunnel, you do not cross that path let alone run in front of a player with equipment. That’s the first thing you learn on the job. The NFL takes that shit super serious because it’s a safety risk for all involved especially their “assets”. That’s the easiest way to lose field access or better yet get fired. Whomever he was freelancing for is probably SOL when they try to get another NFL contract in the future. Adams absolutely acted like a child and shouldn’t have shoved the kid, but the kid is a moron and it being your first day is no excuse to commit the biggest no-no just like being upset over the loss is no excuse to shove the shit out of someone",6.0,nfl,t3_y2kzjk,False,1.0,:Commanders: Commanders,2022-10-12T21:18:38Z,commanders,0.0415067343174552

Half of the comments are people saying he was minding his own business or trying to do his job. He broke a **huge** rule that would result in revoked access or termination. The shove was entirely avoidable and Adams shouldn’t have done that, but the collision in the first place is on the cameraman. His equipment makes contact with Adams. And the point of the light analogy is that at no point should ANYONE get in front of the players at the tunnel. I don’t know why I need to keep repeating this to you. It is a safety risk, hence why it’s their biggest rule for field access. It wasn’t just a red light it was a train stop flashing light situation. Adams had a poor lapse of judgement and made a boneheaded move by shoving the guy, but the cameraman was either working his first game or he’s just a fool that thinks he’s above the rules",3.0,nfl,t3_y0yn25,False,0.0,:Commanders: Commanders,2022-10-11T09:52:09Z,commanders,-0.0822598532882446

With the shove now he’ll get some freebies from Adams and the team. This is like running a red light and having the other guys insurance being forced to claim fault and pay out. Adams 100% should not have shoved but the cameraman 1,000% should not have been running in front of literally one of the only people you aren’t supposed to get in front in a space they warn you especially not to cross while players are moving in and out. Doesn’t help he was doing so with his equipment being open (look at the stand leg hit Adams)

**Edit:** a lot of people are really mad about something a few don’t seem to understand. Player safety is #1 priority. Why would a cameraman be deemed “minding his own business” recklessly running in front of a team’s asset worth millions, especially with equipment?

You can see the leg of his stand hit Adams. Should Adams have just stopped in his tracks? In a perfect world yes, but neither were looking at where they were going it seems and the player always has the green light. The cameraman essentially ran a red light and got t-boned.

Is he identifying the Mike properly, checking the RB into a pass block when he should? If he's not great with pre-snap duties and not great at avoiding pressure and not great at getting the ball out quickly its gonna make the O-line look like crap. 

Throw me a bone and let's assume some of the above is true.  If teams know that there are communication issues with protection, the QB has zero escapability, and he holds the ball too long they're just gonna pin their ears back and get after him.  On top of that apparently the coaching staff isn't letting him audible (trust issues?) so we could be in bad plays half the time.

News flash, there are a lot of teams with crap O-lines. If you can't get out of the pocket and make a play you better know your offense like the back of your hand and get the ball out fast.  

No one is afraid of Wentz's legs or escspability, you know what that does? It let's defenses play Wentz differently than other QBs, it looks like he's moving around in quick sand back there.  Though he's not a complete statue teams know when they get pressure on him he's gonna get absorbed into it.

38492,301409,301409,thekingoftherodeo,"Same, was heavily considering going to the Titans game at the weekend given it was such a nice day. But it'd have meant spending ~1hr each way to/from, $60 on a ticket (which I'll admit is cheap for NFL), and like 2/3 beers at $15 each plus a $10 dog... I'm out ~$100 and about 6hrs of the day for that shit that happened on Sunday. I chose couch + a $15 12 pack and it was absolutely the right choice.",8.0,commanders,t3_y2e0oa,False,0.0,:21:,2022-10-12T21:35:48Z,commanders,-0.022797265625
