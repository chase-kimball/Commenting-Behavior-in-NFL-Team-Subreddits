851,2577,2577,AU_wde_2,"There are definitely some alarming things on our squad to me that I’d like to see get worked out - our TD allowed to int forced is the worst in the league, dunno if it’s personnel or scheme or lack of consistent pressure but we just aren’t generating turnovers - our Dline is generating some pressure but for whatever reason it seems to be easily avoidable, the few times we truly collapsed the pocket Carr was just able to step up and scramble without too much resistance. Some sort of switch is going to have to flip for George and Dunlap because it’s just not very consistent around the edge, they’re run d is stout but just have to make the QB’s more uncomfortable 

I’ve said this in different posts but our deep passing defense is currently ranked worst in the league, and a lot of that falls on coaching, putting Fenton and/or Watson one on one with Adams is just asking for trouble and Spags needs to know the limitations of his own players - (he did the same thing against Evans). And that includes putting two rookies on Adams because he can still make a play. On that last play it certainly worked out in our favor because Josh Williams did an excellent job at getting his hands on Adams at the LOS but damn what an objectively wild thing to do from a coaching perspective - I like Williams a lot, he’s a big physical corner that I think can make a name for himself being a sticky guy but when the game is on the line and he’s played very sparingly throughout the entire season and you put him one on one with the literal best WR in the NFL? That’s just crazy

I really am not trying to be a pessimist but we are going to have to overcome some major mental hurdles if we’re going to win next Sunday against the Bills. We always flip a switch emotionally then we start playing good ball, while fun, that isn’t a *good* thing, they need to come out the gates emotionally and mentally engaged against their opponent like they did against the Bucs. But even if they do come out engaged, the 2 major issues on defense are two things the Bills excel at exploiting. If we let Allen leave the pocket and pick up yards with his legs, at will, we will lose; if we let Allen sit back in the pocket without generating pressure with the front four we will lose; if we don’t protect the deep ball against one of the better deep ball receivers in the league in Davis (Diggs is certainly no slouch in that category either) we will lose. Will the return of McDuffie help? I definitely hope so, he looked good week 1 but as we’ve now seen that Cards passing attack isn’t exactly something to be feared and you’re asking him to come back in and pick it right back up but in reality he’s a rookie who has a little over half a game of real action 

I do think we *can* do it but I think for this week in particular we’re running an uphill battle - the Bills are basically coming off a bye where they ran a scrimmage against the Steelers, and we’re coming off a short week in an emotional claw it out game against a divisional rival. Just gonna be really tough",15.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_y20u7x,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2022-10-12T07:44:31Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0245699220376754
852,2578,2578,AU_wde_2,"Our deep ball defense has been atrocious, a good chunk of that comes from the coaching - just this game Sneed is our only man on man guy and still shouldn’t be left on an island but sparingly against a guy like Adams

Fenton? Watson? One on one in man with Adams? You are just asking for disaster. That’s just bad coaching, you’ve gotta be realistic about your own players talents 

The other deep ball was just a bite by Cook, again I think it’s irresponsible to put even 2 rookies on Adams, he’s just that good. Juan and Sneed should’ve been on him from the get go and they switched to it in the second and had some success

Then our run stuffing abilities have been pretty good up until this week where we were shorted Wharton and are now going to be without for the rest of the year and still no Gay.

There is very little context to make that play call justifiable - Mecole Hardman has had brick hands for a good chunk of his playtime, on top of that has not shown the ability to consistently track the ball down the field. Couple that with the fact that the Raiders had consistently called blitzes in similar situations all game and had had pretty decent success doing so, so to call a play where the go to is a long developing route is even more head scratching

I don’t know if the analytics teams in the NFL actually DO that, but to throw out that “analytics can’t know its raining” or “analytics can’t take into account x” is just not true.

At r/KansasCityChiefs we like to do some light-hearted trash talk exchanges with the teams we're playing each week, largely in the form of high quality gifs.

Every sub seems to have a different response so far. Some roll with it and appreciate a high-effort post, others go as far to send their own HQGs back, while others delete posts, or in the case of r/raiders, ban people (or, at least me) who post them.

I'd rather not be banned from here, because I respect you all as a fan base, so rather than just post my gif here and see what happens, I figure I'd ask.

Do you all want/welcome that? Or no?

I also realize that the nature of the gif is relevant. Like ""you all are horrible people and you should feel bad about yourselves"" would obviously be a less welcome theme than ""silly meta gif that barely talks about football,"" and it's probably up to the mods to determine whether it's against the spirit of the sub.
