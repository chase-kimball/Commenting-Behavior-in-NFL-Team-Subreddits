- Daniel Jones deserves more respect than he’s generally given. The man has fewer weapons to work with than probably 28-30 other NFL teams and he’s managing games pretty damn well with what he has around him.

- Saquon is bae.

- I love how we’re utilizing Daniel Bellinger. I’m not going to say he’s one of the leagues future top TEs but he’s proving himself to be pretty versatile, and he’s getting open.

- Wink and Kafka are putting together great game plans. we haven’t seen that on both sides of the ball from the Giants in far too long.

- It’s clear we miss Leonard Williams on the field but Dexter Lawrence has been tearing it up even without him! Can’t wait until Leo and Azeez are back on the field

- We need to start tallying up some interceptions out there
