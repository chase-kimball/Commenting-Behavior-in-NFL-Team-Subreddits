I think he lets the stronger personalities in his immediate vicinity dictate his decision making because he doesn’t want to “rock the boat.” That’s why Pettine and Mo Drayton stuck around so long, why we don’t adjust away from playing this deep zone defensive coverage, why we don’t fully commit to a Shanahan style offense, and I would bet that we’re not running the ball nearly as much as we should because Rodgers sees a defensive look that would be adventitious to pass against and swaps out of the play (this can be good sometimes, but our best offensive weapons are our RB’s, so even if the look isn’t fantastic for a run, I would like to see us at least try to run it more and let Jones or Dillon make a play)

12813,80499,80499,Goodbye_Hercules,"I think it's a chemistry issue. Guys are getting open, but it seems like he's trying to lead them away from defenders more and expecting them to make mid-route adjustments (stacking CBs on go routes, pushing the depth of certain routes by a yard or two depending on down/distance, bending routes slightly inside/outside depending on leverage, knowing when to turn for a back-shoulder fade, etc.) to get in position to make a catch

Veteran WRs like Davante, Cobb, Watkins, and even Lazard, are for the most part are adept at making those adjustments, whereas Doubs or Watson aren't. Rodgers looks more on-target when he throws to the former, but the latter is where we've seen the inaccurate throws. This usually leads to him losing trust in them, but he's had to throw to them anyways this year because they're all we've got

Rodgers 100% needs to play better though. He shouldn't be expecting his guys to be perfectionist Davante clones; he should try to meet them more where they're at right now, and trust them to make plays without necessarily knowing how to make said adjustments yet. If it indeed is him checking out of run plays and not LaFleur calling all the passes, then he needs to trust the run a little more as well—throwing three straight deep shots after a *long* opponent drive, and throwing it twice on short yardage to end the game just isn't winning football

For reference, [here's a Brett Kollman video from 2018 going over our offense's struggles at the time](https://youtu.be/bax9C8damOU?t=9m50s). It's mainly about McCarthy's scheme, but here he pointed out our inexperience at the WR position at the time—looks like we're seeing a lot of that same stuff four years later

16183,102553,102553,Journeyman12,"In Rodgers's case, it's not especially surprising, because of who he's playing with. 

From 2008 through 2014, Rodgers had arguably the best wide receiving corps in the NFL. It's a meme that Rodgers has only ever thrown a touchdown to a single former first-round pick, Marcedes Lewis, but it's an idiotic point to make because the Packers got Greg Jennings (2006), Jordy Nelson (2008), Randall Cobb (2011) and Davante Adams (2014) in the second round, not to mention James Jones (2007) and Jermichael Finley (2008) in the third. Ted Thompson seemingly couldn't miss. Rodgers didn't have a very good offensive line until around 2013, and the running backs were ordinary throughout that period except for Eddie Lacy's two great years, but throughout the period of Rodgers's greatest dominance, he was also throwing to outstanding receivers and tight ends. 

That ended in 2015, when Jordy Nelson tore his ACL, Adams was dealing with an ankle injury, and the offense generally stunk for a variety of reasons. Over the next few years, Nelson gradually declined and was cut, Cobb gradually declined and left, and Adams metamorphosed into a genuine star. Outside of Adams, though, we really didn't have anybody. Under late Ted Thompson and then Brian Gutekunst, we have yet to really hit on a wide receiver or tight end. Ty Montgomery (3rd round, 2015), Trevor Davis (5th, 2016), DeAngelo Yancey (5th, 2017), Malachi Dupre (7th, 2017), J'Mon Moore (4th, 2018), Equanimeous St. Brown (6th, 2018), Jace Sternberger (3rd, 2019), Josiah Deguara (3rd, 2020) and Amari Rodgers (3rd, 2021) have all failed to make an impression. Only Marquez Valdes-Scantling (5th, 2018) turned out to be a decent player, and he left for Kansas City this offseason. Adams covered up a lot of the deficiencies elsewhere, as did our consistently excellent running backs from 2017 on (Aaron Jones, Jamaal Williams, A.J. Dillon), but when Adams left for Las Vegas, we had nobody to replace him. It wasn't like the late 2000s when we were consistently stockpiling good players: we just had nobody. 

Now, the Packers have found some players on the scrap heap. Robert Tonyan was a borderline Pro Bowl TE in 2020 after going undrafted, and Allen Lazard is a great No. 3 receiver, a big possession guy who blocks well. But Rodgers is throwing to Lazard, post-ACL-tear Tonyan, two rookies, currently-on-IR Sammy Watkins, and a 32-year-old Randall Cobb. It's by far the worst receiving corps he's had in his entire career as a starter. Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson may yet turn out to be great players, but right now they're rookies, and they're going to be inconsistent... and the rest of the cast lacks speed, as well as the ability to consistently win one-on-one. Rodgers's best receiver is a running back, Aaron Jones. This is not a recipe for passing success. The best version of our current offense is relying on Jones and Dillon, with lots of short and medium-range passes. It calls for Rodgers to manage the game instead of trying to dominate the opponent himself. 

A big problem so far is that Rodgers and Matt LaFleur aren't always playing/coaching as if they recognize that. Against the Patriots, outside of one bomb to Lazard and the woulda-been touchdown to Dobbs, most of Rodgers's deep passes fell incomplete. Against the Giants, we got the ball back tied at 20 needing a long TD drive to give the defense some rest, and Rodgers promptly flung three more deep incompletions, none of which were particularly close, leading to a punt. It's hard to tell from the outside whether that's LaFleur's play-calling or Rodgers trying to play hero ball, but he just doesn't have the tools around him to be a hero right now. I wouldn't say he's playing appreciably worse than the past couple of years, but he doesn't have an All-Pro wide receiver who can consistently get open against just about anybody, and it shows! 

At this point, the Packers' prospects for in-season improvement - in my opinion - are based on 1) Doubs and Watson continuing to gain experience, and health in Watson's case, and 2) LaFleur/Rodgers calling more games like the Patriots game, where we ran all over them, and fewer games like the very pass-heavy attack we showed against New York. It's bizarre to say that we should ask a four-time MVP to do *less*, but, well, Davante's not coming back, and Rodgers can't throw to himself. Either we play to our strengths, or we lose by our weaknesses.",4.0,nfl,t3_y0esev,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers,2022-10-10T10:43:47Z,greenbaypackers,-0.000635164207062
