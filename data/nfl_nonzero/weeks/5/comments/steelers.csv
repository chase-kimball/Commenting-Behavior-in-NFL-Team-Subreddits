Details of the dress code

Stern's dress code stated that all players must dress in business or conservative attire while arriving and departing during a scheduled game, on the bench while injured, and when conducting official NBA business (press interviews, charity events, etc.). The first dress code banned fashions most often associated with hip-hop culture, specifically: jerseys, jeans, hats, do-rags, T-shirts, large jewelry, sneakers and timber boots (specifically, Timberland-type boots).[3]

This particular clothing was not allowed to be worn by players to interviews, games (on and off the bench), charity events, or any other occasion affiliated with the NBA and its developmental league. Violators of the dress code were to be fined or suspended upon repeat offenses.[4] The dress code was developed with the intention of combating image problems that had plagued the NBA in recent history.

Under current NBA dress regulations, if a player does not dress to participate in a game, he must dress in a manner suitable for a coach. **In the NBA, a suit or a sport coat used to be required for coaches,[3] as well as a necktie. Since the 2020 NBA Bubble, coaches have been allowed to wear casual attire, with most opting for polo shirts and quarter-zips.[5]**

#1st Quarter:

3rd play…. 98 yard bomb. This defense really has NOT played well. Norwood with a terrible angle, gets blown by. 7-0 Buffalo.

So you sit Gunner as the return man for a DB, Who also can’t catch… that’s a head scratcher. Sims should be back there (eye injury mentioned on the broadcast?). At least no points came from it. Heyward blocks the field goal. 

We’re officially into the Kenny Pickett era. Great drive, throws a little high on 3rd down & Johnson can’t get both feet in. 7-3 Buffalo.

Good stop. 10-3 Bills.

Diontae has the ball go right between his hands on third down. GREAT Punt downed on the 2.

#2nd Quarter:

Buffalo moving the ball easily, but a phenomenal play by Wallace for the pick, then we proceed to go 3 and out. Not ideal. A not so great punt followed.

62 yard strike. Good coverage but a perfect throw and catch by Gabe Davis again. Allen up to nearly 300 yards halfway through the second quarter. 17-3 Bills. Need the offense to put up points now if we want a shot. 

Run game completely ineffective so far. Constantly 3rd and long after 2 straight run plays. 3 and out, TERRIBLE punt. 

Huge run left gashes us. Jack gets a stupid unnecessary roughness penalty. Strike to Diggs. 24-3 Bills. Allen has 3 touchdowns and 280 ON NINE COMPLETIONS. 

Pickett to Pickens, huge 30 yard play. Drive stalls. Boswell misses. Nothing going right today. 

There is 0 pass rush. Allen just strolling down the field every single drive. Another strike. 31-3 Bills. 

Pickett picked by Elam. That brings us to halftime. 

#3rd quarter:

Good drive to open the half that stalls on the Bills 20. Johnson drops the 4th down ball. He’s not playing well, big regression from last year. 

Sutton and Ogunjobi out for the game. Wallace hurt now too. The hospital ward defense worsens. 

Another casual stroll downfield for Allen. No-name tight end fumbles on the 1 yard line, good forced turnover after a long seamless drive. 

Pickett to Pickens connection continues. Miller jumps early but it’s not called, he beats Dan Moore for the sack. Friermuth goes down. Pickett stands in and makes throws on 3rd down, he legitimately looks good. 

Dirty hit by #3 on Pickett. Protect the QB. Doesn’t get him high, but you can’t hit the QB when he’s sliding. CRAZY that’s not flagged. Asinine. Excusable penalty for Daniels, protect your guy. If the refs won’t, take it into your own hands. I like that. Should’ve hit him harder.

False start on Dan Moore on 4th down. Boswell misses again. He needs to be better. To be fair, pretty much everyone needs to be better. On to the 4th.

#4th quarter: 

37 yard throw to Diggs. I don’t know why Allen is still playing, and why they’re still throwing, but they are. Cook with a 28 yard TD run, his first career score. First rushing score by a Bills back this season. 38-3 Bills. 

Drive stalls on 4th down again. 

Case Keenum into the game for Buffalo. Up 5 scores with 10 minutes to play, they’re now in game management mode. Allen sets a career high in passing yardage. He was hit only one time today. 

First punt forced today. Fans booing that they aren’t going for it. Should’ve been pinned at the 1, but we get it at the 20. 3 and out, shit 33 yard punt back to Buffalo. Claypool with a great release, lazy route on 3rd down. 

Buffalo 3 and out. 

Heyward makes his first career catch. Another false start, this time on Claypool. Great effort after the catch by Warren, follows it up with a strong run. Makes him our leading rusher on the day. Follows THAT up with an amazing catch on a bad ball. That puts Pickett over 300 on his debut. Most by a Steeler in his first start. Granted, over 50 attempts, but not bad by any means. Sims makes his first catch of the season. 

2 minute warning. 

3rd and 7, he holds the ball for way too long. 3rd sack today for Buffalo. 4th and 15, drive stalls. 

Questionable hit by Lawson… last play of the game. Stand up for Kenny man. Let’s get out of here. On to Tampa.

Jealous of their passing game. We’ve had a 300 yard passing game once in the last 2 seasons? Allen has 300 with time still left in the 2nd quarter. Unreal man. 

There is 0 pass rush. Allen just strolling down the field every single drive. Another strike. 31-3 Bills.

16544,100917,100917,ItsYourBoyD,"I mean look at it this way. 

We’re 1-3. Realistically, we needed to be like 3-1 or 4-0 at this point because pulling out 2+ wins over the next 4 weeks isn’t too likely, but anything can happen. The offense has looked dogshit (hopefully that changes with an actual NFL QB) and the defense hasn’t lived up to expectations, also losing the best defensive player in the league. 

Best realistic scenario is we DO go 2-2 in the next 4, and we’re sat at 3-5 going into the bye. We can only afford to really lose 2 maybe 3 games the entire back half of the schedule, 4 of those coming against divisional opponents. Anything less than 10-7 likely doesn’t get you a playoff berth.

The more likely scenario is we go 0-4, so we’re sat at 1-7 at the bye (especially now without Watt. We’re still yet to get a win without him, and he’s probably gone until the bye). We literally can’t afford to lose a single game, unless every other team in the north has a bad season, so we win the division (See: 2020 NFC East)

So yeah, barring a legit 180 turnaround, this is a growth year/rebuilding year with no playoff berth, and then next year there’s no excuse. You have a 4th place schedule, all your pieces in place, and a high draft position to help gain/replenish talent depleted over the offseason.",10.0,steelers,t3_xz8ns3,False,0.0,:SOTN1::SOTN2::SOTN3::SOTN4: Shut Out The Noise,2022-10-08T20:48:42Z,steelers,0.0564589809844937

Good:

- Leal. Really good stuff from the rookie. Batted passes down and offered a lot in the run game. Definitely getting more comfortable and adjusting but stock is going up on this guy for sure. 

- Pickens. Another good rookie who performed today. Kenny likes this guy and for good reason. Makes tough catches look easy and finds a way to get open. Bullies defenders off the LOS. 

- James Daniels. If anything, him sticking up for that hit on Kenny said enough for me. Emotions are high after getting our ass kicked but I do like the spark and will take that penalty. 

- Kenny. All eyes on him and while the score and stats didn’t show it, I thought his first start was solid. He’s tough, poised, athletic, and on target. We might have something here and while he was far from perfect, he showed some good flashes today. 

Bad:

Basically, most everything was bad. Our secondary looked like a preseason squad and injuries are killing us more than we can handle. Even big Muth getting banged around. Shit sucks and does us no favors, but here are a few that stood out:

- Pierre. Muffed return to really set the tone for the day. If only we knew what else would come! Anyways. Shit like that where our margin for error is absolutely zero is inexcusable. 

- Matt Canada / Tomlin. Topics of the day right here. Canada is just a total loser. Running the offense through Najee when not a damn thing is happening is amazing. Run run pass. Repeat. There is absolutely no way in hell this guy can return and kill Kenny’s career. And for Tomlin, chicken shit football. Just absolutely surrendering with these field goal attempts. 

- Harvin. Inconsistency is his name. Again we have no margin for error and his shitty punts really hurt us. 

Just a terrible, terrible day. Top to bottom. This team is not good which is a really weird thing to say. They’re not even mediocre or average. Just flat out bad.
