The pocket breaks down, Ryan Tannehill is running, looking for something, anything. He sees Burks, completely unable to get separation, slowed down from his turf toe and his skipped breakfast of albuterol. He sees Woods running the wrong route, not looking his direction, his ACL has fallen off. Austin Hooper is dead. He looks deep down the field and sees double coverage, but a glimmer of hope. One last spark of hope for humanity. He throws deep. Its going to the back corner, but the coverage is too tight, there is too much traffic, the ball is too high, there is no way he is going to connect, no mere mortal could bring this ball in... Suddenly we see the majestic hands of our lord and savior JOSH GORDON slowly rise up. The light blazing around his body is so bright it causes everyone in the stadium to shield their eyes. He is in the air for what seems like minutes, slowly rising, rising, rising. He makes the perfect one handed catch, He keeps rising. He is 20 feet above the goalposts now. The clouds open up and a single beam of sunlight falls to the field as JOSH GORDON does a forward flip and comes slamming down to the ground in a marvel-like superhero landing. The shock-wave from his landing causes the entire opposing team to fall to the ground with CTE. Miraculously, everyone on the Titans is unharmed, Ryan Tannehill is young again, Burks no longer needs an inhaler, and Hooper is still dead on the field. The crowd goes wild. The Titans win.

8.45 * 17 = 143.65, so for simplicity's sake since fractional points don't exist we'll assume 144 per season.

At 144 points per season, it will take Justin Tucker approximately 8.82 years to score the 1,272 points he needs to surpass Vinatieri as the all-time leading scorer.

Vinatieri played until he was 48.

42217,246420,246420,ovi_left_faceoff,"Well said. The more I think about it, the more parallels it has to academia vs the real world. Elite D1 Coaches truly are the tenured professors of the football world, sitting comfortably in their ivory towers, churning out publications every few years...yes, I know they aren't literally tenured but with the long term contracts some of these guys get and how expensive it would be for the schools to buy them out, that's effectively what it is - it's not like they'll ever have to work again either way. They have a massive talent pool begging to play for them, which massively tilts the playing field in their favor against all but the other dozen or so schools that are in contention across the NCAA on any given year. They just need to put a semi-competent game plan in place and the talent alone is probably enough to make a new years six game even if they don't make the CFP. 

NFL coaches are private sector upper management, just below the c-suite. It's all about on-field results - you can't fall back on your recruiting prowess, because that's not your job in the first place, it's the GMs. All of your players are, literally, already pro-caliber players so there's no ""oh lets wait a few years for him to implement the system and make some changes to personnel"" - your job is to make the existing pieces work as well as possible together from day 1. Hell, I don't even think x's and o's are that important on day 1 - the most important thing is to get your players to buy in regardless of the scheme. If they don't, you could be the most brilliant schemer in history and get fired before the season is over.",2.0,nfl,t3_y0h5zf,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-10-10T12:24:38Z,ravens,0.0085000677653199

At the college level, you are dealing with players that for the most part have not fully matured, mentally or physically. It requires you to draw a fine line between being a merciless drill sergeant to prepare them, while also knowing when to lay off the gas so you don't kill their confidence. It's completely different at the NFL level. You aren't dealing with a bunch of college kids who know that you will be a major determinant in how likely they are to make it to the pros. The roles are switched in a sense when you're a brand new coach in the NFL, coming straight from a D1 program - you now have to earn the respect of the vets and leaders on the team, which I imagine was a challenge for guys like Urban Meyer or Nick Saban, who I'm sure were used to enjoying a fair bit of deference basically by default when they were college coaches.",6.0,nfl,t3_y0h5zf,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-10-10T10:35:38Z,ravens,0.1356331945022907

If Tuck felt good from 60 that day.. 43 IS a chipshot.. if he only feels good from 45 than yeah they are probably using those timeouts and trying to pick up a few more yards.

The other thing is you can't score a TD there and leave time on the clock. So if you break open a play your guy has to go down at the 1, run the clock down, and still go for the field goal.
