However, during the Gase era their was no RB to fear, no WR who can burn you 1v1, no TE who was a mismatch nightmare and no QB who could scramble for a big run. 

In short, there was no threat, and defenses didn't need to be aggressive.

There were lots of times where close plays whereDB/WR were both playing the ball would get called DPI the moment the pass was incomplete, and Brady would start jumping up and down. As if it was out of realm of possibility that he was a bit off or the coverage was good. There too many of those that gave him the benefit of the doubt.

That one game against the Panthers where Gronk was interfered with but they picked up the flag was due in part because Brady underthrew/forced it and made it potentially uncatchable and might have been picked off anyway. It could have easily been called DPI, but the way he chased down the ref after the game was sad. It was nice to see him feel what it's like getting a blown call against you in clutch moment.

People act like we are saying that they are inventing calls for him. That obviously isn't true. But I've always said that Brady and his teams always got every possible ""letter of the law"" call they could find. The tuck rule and that Austin Seferian-Jenkins ""Fumble into the endzone for a micro second"" touchback are the best examples.

The problem with NFL refs is that it was always obvious that they did not want to be the guy who ""cost Brady the game"" and they were hyper vigilant in making sure they don't miss calls, a courtesy they don't extend to the teams. You can't have multiple sets of rules and just decide to be more strict with one team and lax with another.
