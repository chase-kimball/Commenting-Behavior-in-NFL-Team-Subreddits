- Now, we've got him throwing maybe 15-16 times per game and most of those passes aren't designed to go much further than the line of scrimmage.

- Couple that with our talent level on offense and you're bound for some awful results. Our offensive line is great in run blocking but guys like Sam Mustipher have been some of the worst pass blockers I've ever seen.

It’s outrageous that our biggest move to address our biggest area of need was trading for Nkeal Harry, especially when Amari Cooper and Marquis Brown we’re both moved at extremely reasonable value.

The 22 off season also had probably the deepest WR draft class ever. The bears passed on Alec Pierce and George Pickens with both of their second round picks. They then drafted a return specialist in the third.

People love to say this is a rebuilding year. We were never going to compete until next year at the earliest. We would be in much better position to compete if they’d actually worked on building the offense, though. 

The best WR FA next off season? Jakobi Myers. The best CB FA? Marcus Peters.

40136,238832,238832,dafoo21,"Going to be long winded, but its just responding fully what you have brought up, because you brought up alot of complaints with little understanding of what happened over the offseason.

The reason why cowboys only got a 5th round pick, was because of Coopers salary. He was earning $20m this year and huge cap hits for the 2 seasons after this. Browns restructured it to $18m, but still owe, like $50+ for the 2 seasons after that. It wasnt as simple as, ""ooh only a 5th rounder? Why didnt we do that?!"" Its bc the Browns had a ton of free cap space that most of the NFL didnt have. Im sure most of the NFL would love to have a WR1 for a 5th round pick, but the money is the issue. Cooper is also injury prone. Yes, he doesnt miss  alot of games, but it affects him during the season from not being able to be the WR1  that he shows early in the season. Hes been in the NFL a LONG time with a lot of tread, even tho he is still young. Thats a big gamble for a lot of money.

Pickens has a massive ego/diva issue that is well known from his HS and college coaches comments. Hes also coming off of injuries. Those are 2 big red flags. In his time with KC, Poles has learned to not go after choir boys, but drafting a guy like that in the first year of a rebuild and new coaching staff is a recipe for disaster. Tomlin has a set culture and is well known for working with players. Poles will sign/draft these type of players in the future, but now isnt the right time. 

I agree on Pierce, but Im also not opposed to drafting BPA when the entire roster needs talent. A good defense stopping other offenses is also good for the bears offense. It lets Fields stay within the system and progress in it, instead of having to play hero ball like Dak did a few years ago. I wont lie, I did want Pierce and was disappointed, but I understand the BPA scenario. We also dont know what we have in Velus, yet. Fields wanted Velus, so Poles and him agreed on Velus. Lets see how that goes. 

Poles did get a stop gap lineman, Patrick. He hasnt been in the center position yet, to help call protections. Hes great at that and would be a massive upgrade over Mustipher, which isnt saying much. Not saying he will be amazing or anything, but avg blocking with good protection calls will help. Im not sure what other oline people you are talking about you are labeling them stop gap. Poles tried to get Bates, but Bills matched. He was in on Allen and Armstead but they took more than your ""stop gap"" contract label, while, you know, not being stop gap players.

Its waaaaaay too early to have any judgement on the coaches. First time head coaches are going to have some growing pains, but Flus has been coaching for 30 years, he knows what hes doing in regards to players and getting the best out of them. Hes, literally, shown it over and over at each level he has been. This is a really young team, theres going to be the pains we are currently going through. With Getsy, Im not sure how you can compare him to any of the Shanny/Lafleur trees. Getsy isnt installing a cookie cutter offense, hes trying to build one around the team, not force the team into a scheme. Just because huge stats arent flying off the board in first 4 games, doesnt mean progress hasnt happened. For an offense to work, the QB, line and receivers all have to be on the same page and on the same timing. Thats just not going to happen out of thin air, this shit takes time. Fields took a big step up against the giants. We saw what hes capable of when he gets protection. Lets give the offense more than 4 games, huh?

Fans need to calm down. Poles has been very upfront about what the process was going to be from the very beginning. Hes building a football team, not only an offense. The team is 2-2 despite all of this lol. Everyone knew the bears would win, at most, 6-7 games and now everyone's faces look like the pikachu shocked face.  

Maybe you didnt follow the offseason and all the press conferences, but none of this should be shocking to you as it was all brought up the entire offseason. 

Im not saying im sold on the FO and coaching staff, at all. I just know its going to take more than 4 games (probably into next season) to start giving these guys a chance to be judged. 

Look at the eagles. NOONE wanted to give Sirianni and the staff a chance. They played REALLY rough the first quarter of the season last year. They then made changes to the offensive scheme, made it much more run heavy, to allow Hurts to lean on that while learning the scheme. The defense was playing similar to what the bears are doing this season; Bend, dont break, keep the ball in front of you and dont give up the big plays. It meant giving up a ton of passing yards, but it kept the offense in the game. They faced the easiest schedule last year and put up 9 wins.

This offseason, they signed/traded for Brown, have a good young WR2, solid TE similar to Kmet, and filled the holes on their defense. Hurts is playing really well and passing a shit ton better after being in the offense for a year. Hurts looked terrible throwing the ball last year but is night and day this year.

Its going to take time for this offense. And bears have a shit ton of ammo to completely change the team next year.",2.0,chibears,t3_xxop8l,False,0.0,Italian Beef,2022-10-07T09:59:36Z,chibears,-0.0087861913112972

A LOT of football people downplay the reality of halftime adjustments. You spend a whole week planing for a team, you’re not going to throw that out the window. And it’s not like you can suddenly install new plays at the half. You can make adjustments, but they’re not like wholesale wildly dramatic adjustments that would account for the different level of play. 

Goff talked about this a little in the latest Full Go Pod, which got me thinking…what if he’s right, and halftime adjustments are at best minimally effective? Then it has to be something else. 

Eberflus is still a new commodity, but we do know that he values hard work and vowed to make the team work harder in training camp than they ever have before. 

What if the Bears are just in better endurance shape than their opponents? What if they stay sharper into the second half because they worked harder in the off-and preseason? I’m not totally discounting halftime adjustments, but it’s been so dramatic that it feels like there must be something more to it. 

So that’s my current theory. These boys worked their asses off. Some got hurt, and that’s the reality when you push your body to the extremes. But those who made it through, and the team as a net product of an Eberflus camp, might just have more finish in them than other teams.",10.0,chibears,t3_y27mbd,False,0.0,69,2022-10-12T13:08:50Z,chibears,-0.0026863064639373
