He has a similar question as Stroud due to coming out of Bama, how much of his success is due to having top prospects at WR and along his OL? His WRs are more open and his pockets cleaner than just about any other QB in the draft, that has to be considered.

Take last year for example, he was sacked 39 times on with around 547 pass attempts, despite having one of the top 2 tackles in last years class and one of the top guards in this class protecting him. That to me says “QB who can manage to create his own pressure”. Add in his size to that issue and I don’t see him being successful in the NFL.

2300,12843,12843,Baelzabub,"I think Shenault fits better as a WR3/4. He’s not really an every down guy, but he’s great for routes that scheme him some space in front of him to work, which you’ll find more of in 3 WR sets.

The way I view what I’d like to see in WRs is this: WR1 is your every route and every alignment guy that gets open but also catches those contested balls and is a YAC threat. WR2 is your explosive play threat, not as consistent as your WR1, but when they draw the CB1 this guy can work over a lesser defender. Your WR3/4 are guys that fit niches in your offense, your possession receivers, your “take the top off” receiver, and your gadget guys.

Shenault fits more into the possession receiver role IMO. He knows the space on the field, finds where he needs to be, and gets there. Think a Jericho Cotchery type guy.

We are likely going to have a top 3 pick and have a very strong core of young talent at key positions. 

We have the top tier DE, an up and coming DT, a shut down corner, a safety who looks like one of the most versatile defensive players in years, a franchise LT *AND* RT, and a WR1. Those are the positions you want to fill to support a blue chip rookie QB and try to make a run.

We’re attractive because the vast majority of a rebuild most new coaches would need to do *is already done*. We need a QB, could use a better DE complement to Burns, a better LB alongside Luvu, and probably an upgrade at WR2 and we’d be contenders for a title.

On the other hand, some of those trades had a poor end result (or the players were not utilized at all). The Darnold trade was especially costly. Additionally, some contracts we’ve given our vets are outright stupid and overpriced. 

The answer to this question will certainly depend on how much Fitterer has to do with the bad decisions that were often assumed to be Rhule’s doing.

Draft a Center in the late 2nd-3rd

Year 2

Draft or spend some extra money on a guard in FA.
