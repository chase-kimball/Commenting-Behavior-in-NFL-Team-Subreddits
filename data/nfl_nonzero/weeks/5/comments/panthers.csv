The way I view what I‚Äôd like to see in WRs is this: WR1 is your every route and every alignment guy that gets open but also catches those contested balls and is a YAC threat. WR2 is your explosive play threat, not as consistent as your WR1, but when they draw the CB1 this guy can work over a lesser defender. Your WR3/4 are guys that fit niches in your offense, your possession receivers, your ‚Äútake the top off‚Äù receiver, and your gadget guys.

Shenault fits more into the possession receiver role IMO. He knows the space on the field, finds where he needs to be, and gets there. Think a Jericho Cotchery type guy.

We have the top tier DE, an up and coming DT, a shut down corner, a safety who looks like one of the most versatile defensive players in years, a franchise LT *AND* RT, and a WR1. Those are the positions you want to fill to support a blue chip rookie QB and try to make a run.

We‚Äôre attractive because the vast majority of a rebuild most new coaches would need to do *is already done*.

Draft a Center in the late 2nd-3rd

Draft or spend some extra money on a guard in FA.
