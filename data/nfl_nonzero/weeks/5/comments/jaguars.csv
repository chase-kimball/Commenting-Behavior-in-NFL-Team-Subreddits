We are on pace for somewhere between 6-8 wins and the only game we lost by over 7 points is to a team that‚Äôs still undefeated (not to mention we were up 14-0 which no one predicted).

9695,78410,78410,HolographicHeart,"While Trevor almost certainly is guaranteed another year on the team it's tough not to be concerned and irritated by his recent performances. I've only been watching the foosball for about 15 seasons but inaccuracy is nearly always the kiss of the death for a QB's chances in the NFL; nearly everything else can be coached but if you can't hit the open receiver unless they're wide the hell open you're a career backup at best. The jury is still out on him but I can fully understand the fan's frustration, the QB position has been the heel of this franchise for entirely too long.

The most immediate concern has to be the red zone offense. It feels like we live at the opponent's 20 yard line and can never punch it in. Not sure if it's the scheme not working, Trevor not seeing the field well down here or players failing to execute but they need to figure it out quickly.

I think this fan base has had the patience of a saint with an incompetent owner who put us through Gus AND Urban. What the fuck kind of reaction do you expect when we finally look like a team that can do something and we eat shit against the only winless team in the league in a game where it seemed like we were fucking sleepwalking?

Even though we have Walker Little, Jawaan won the starting role and it playing fairly well this year. This covers us until Little's contract is up and allows us to keep the competition going if need be.

James Robinson - 3 years, $8m per year  
We pay him more than James Conner got but less than guys like Joe Mixon and Nick Chubb. Robinson is an excellent player and a fan favorite so this lets us keep our offense together.

OLB Josh Allen - 4 years, $18m per year  
His production isn't on par with the likes of Nick Bosa or Maxx Crosby, but he is our best pass-rusher and a strong leader on defense. This keeps him with us for the long-haul as one of the faces of the franchise as he paces to hit another 10+ sack season",3.0,jaguars,t3_y1g8s3,False,1.0,Jamal Agnew,2022-10-11T13:33:23Z,jaguars,0.0298486775548696

Urban Meyer is so far removed from this team he should not even be mentioned. Our entire offensive staff minus the RB coach is new. The core receiving group is new. 3/5 of the OL is new. The *problem* is all this new-ness was built around maximizing Trevor Lawrence and he is currently falling flat. If the game is not ""won"" by the half, Trevor starts to choke. In game-winning situations where the ball is on our hands in the final minutes, we have a 100% turnover rate. That's not coaching, that's not personnel, that's quarterbacking!!! Obviously not ""giving up"" on TLaw but dude needs to fundamentally change his approach to gameplay because what we're seeing is not it.

All our wins have been team wins this year and all of our losses have been QB-losses!!!

Last point I'll make: if Andre Cisco didn't get a Pick-6 against Philly, we would have lost in a far worse fashion and we'd be even more doom and gloom.",6.0,jaguars,t3_y0gp93,False,0.0,Jamal Agnew,2022-10-10T11:42:13Z,jaguars,-0.0702179763763769
