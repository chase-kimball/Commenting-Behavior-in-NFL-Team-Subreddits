I take a turn into a McDonald's parking lot, they follow me, fly into the exit lane to my left to cut me off at the drive thru, slam on their breaks successfully preventing me from driving through the parking lot going the correct way. I roll down my window. They roll their's down slightly and yell something incoherent. I just sit there staring at them. Eventually they move into a parking spot.

I drive out of the parking lot, again heading home, they get back on the road, immediately back right behind me as before, start flickering their lights over and over, I slow down. They get next to me to my left, drive the exact speed limit as me for about a minute. I roll down my window, they take off, pull a u-turn, and vanish.

The thing that stood out to me is we use a 3-3 bear front nickel package, which is most of we play since the NFL is mostly a 3 wr offense of course.

However when Belichick or Patrick Graham are in Nickel they run an even front 4-2-5 type. They just put 4 guys on the line and let them loose and not play games with which edge rusher is dropping into coverage. I think Boyer need to do this a lot more on base downs. Idk if he doesn’t trust our LBers to stuff the run in nickel and that’s why he plays with the bear front so much but I still think if you had Ogbah/Ingram, Seiler, Wilkins, Phillips on the line with Baker and Riley/Roberts off the ball you could get a better pass rush and shouldn’t be that bad against the run.
