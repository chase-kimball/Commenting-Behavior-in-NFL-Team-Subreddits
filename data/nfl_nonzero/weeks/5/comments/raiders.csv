17847,146439,146439,Sapper187,"Some Carr related bye week trivia, it was possible for us to have drafted both Carr and Adams if we had taken Adams instead of Mack. Mack was really good when he was on the raiders, but the defense would have been garbage with or without him. The next season was when we drafted Cooper. His best season by far was 2016 with Crabtree. He was a decent to good wr, but nowhere near Adams level. Cooper turned things around after getting traded because he said he didn't think he would get traded and it was a wakeup call, so maybe if he had a wr line Adams to compete with and to push him he might not have had his slump that lead to him getting traded.

To go further, the draft we got Jacobs we had 3 first round picks from the Mack and Cooper trades. Even without those extra picks it's possible we still could have gotten him, in the first and second round there was only 1 other rb taken and that was in the second. So we could have had 7 seasons of a good wr 1 and 2 and maybe could have had more 2016 like seasons.
