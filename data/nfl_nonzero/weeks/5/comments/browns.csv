The difference is the drugs now are nearly impossible to detect with the mlb's drug tests and the ones who are caught do so because they fucked up their regimen.

In the Dominican Republic, doping is PART OF THEIR TRAINING. They are given steroids as early as 11 and most of these young players have no idea what they are doing, they just take whatever they are given along with promises of millions of dollars.

The most home runs hit at the height of the steroid era was 5693 in 2000. In 2017 they blew up that number with 6104. 2022 was 5377 but sticky fingers of pitchers was much more allowed this year.

Aaron Judge hit 23 more home runs than the next closest guy in the AL and nobody is at least a bit skeptical? 

Even Dee Gordon was juicing. If you asked me who i thought for sure wasnt on steroids it would have been Dee Gordon.

Tatis got hit for steroids and he was probably telling the truth about the ring worm because he has enough money to buy undectable steroids. It makes no sense for a player to buy old roids unless they are poor and desperate.

The offense, overall, is humming and performing at a top 5ish level statistically with JACOBY BRISSETT!! Our defense is 90% of the problem for these losses.

Is Stefanski perfect? No. Does he call stupid plays and make questionable decisions that turn out horribly sometimes? Absolutely. Just like every other coach. 

A mind numbing redzone INT, 2 missed field goals, and pylon defense for the first 3 quarters were bigger issues than a questionable 4th and 1 play and whatever other playcalls you want to nit pick.

If, at the start of the season, someone from the future showed you our offensive points for each game so far, you'd think we'd be 5-0 or 4-1.

Well, instead we have a bottom 5 defense that is completely dysfunctional

I'll buy into Stefanski being a problem if our offense can't reach it's full potential when Deshaun is playing

On the one hand, aggression is good, but we're undisciplined and you would imagine that, given the Deshaun decision, the Browns would have accepted this and just played their game. But they aren't. They're playing like they don't care and there's no cohesion and that's where the frustration lies. Like they know they aren't making the playoffs, they know they're not going much above .500 without a better QB, so they don't care.

The other problem is that it isn't really an issue of Stefanski to an extent: Jimmy Haslam has a *massive* hard on for firing coaches and appearing to be the smart guy who was betrayed by an incompetent staff. If, and when, this team does not make the playoffs, I will put cash money that Stefanski takes the fall and is out the door. And probably Berry too. That's just how this goes.

It's like how Jalen Hurts was treated in his first starts as a QB for the Eagles, except Jones is a multi-year starter who doesn't have inexperience as a passer as an excuse. Daboll is absolutely not trusting him to carry the team through pure dropback passing game, where he would have to scan the whole field and go through a series of progressions. I strongly doubt that Jones would have anywhere near this level of success with a playcaller that isn't happy to risk Jones's body on the run game, like... it seems to me the star of the offense is Barkley and Jones's function as a zone-read and bootleg runner is to threaten/affect the numbers game for the defense and thereby open up space for Barkley.

Maybe I'll be proven wildly wrong by the end of this year... and I'll gladly eat my words if that's the case. 

The proof will be in whether he's signed to an extension by the Giants, and what he's offered by other teams across the league.

Gonna bring up the Mike Sando QB Tiers system, let's see where people think Daniel Jones fits the description on this: 

> A Tier 1 quarterback can carry his team each week. The team wins because of him. He expertly handles pure passing situations. He has no real holes in his game.

> A Tier 2 quarterback can carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.

> A Tier 3 quarterback is a legitimate starter but needs a heavier running game and/or defensive component to win. A lower-volume dropback passing offense suits him best.

> A Tier 4 quarterback could be an unproven player (not enough information for voters to classify) or a veteran who ideally would not start all 17 games.

> A Tier 5 quarterback is best suited as a backup.

Guys in Tier 1 and Tier 2 are franchise QBs, the kind you look for and the kind you don't seek to replace. 

For me, Tier 3 is the highest you could place Daniel Jones off those descriptions.

They need to rethink that offense, like... immediately. They need to dial back the dropback passing, stop letting Russ sit back there in shotgun all game like he's Peyton fucking Manning no matter how bad he wants to be *that guy*, run the fucking ball, and get back to basics with playaction, designed rollouts and strictly defined half-field/high-low reads.

With that contract, they're stuck with Russ until like... 2025, at minimum, so at this point they need to prioritize protecting the asset above all else.

That's not physical ability at play; that is mental acuity. SITUATIONAL FOOTBALL from a QB that's historically doesn't make those kind of mistakes.

You seem to think I'm tossing Jacoby under the bus; while there is no excuse for a front office that prides itself on smart players, playing panicked football when the game is in your control is not a good look, for the coach who call plays or QB2 who should be AWARE.

>I'm guessing not. If you expected anything that would resemble any more of the offense than what you're seeing with Jacoby as the QB, then you don't know football. He (the offense) scored 28 points. 28 points in most scenarios should comfortably win you a game in the NFL. Should Jacoby not have thrown that INT at the goal line? Duh. Should Jacoby have gotten more than a negative yard before Yorks field goal? Duh.

The defense gave the ball back inside of 2 minutes thanks to LA's own ineptitude and delivered a stop. Judging by my ""I don't know football"" eyes and my apparently untrained eye, QB2 didn't move the ball and Cade York missed (for the fourth time in three weeks) a go ahead or tying score.

The defense can't stop the music let alone signal correctly and anticipate. There's a LOT of bad situational football going on there BUT in the end, the game was in the hands of the offense to win, TWICE back to back and they fell short.

 I'll reiterate: It doesn't matter what happened 13-22-27-46-54 minutes before those last two possessions as they had a change to win and did not execute.

You want to excoriate the defense? Sure. I'm on that bandwagon. Having a DE you can move inside doesn't cover for a run stopping DT. Lightweight non communicative signal calling LBs are a problem as well, particularly in this division. There is no true SS. It's not good. 

But the D did their job when it mattered. 

If you control the ball and the clock with 5 minutes to go and get inside the 20 at less than 4 minutes with an opportunity to get a first down, the ball should not come back out of that area with more than 1:30 on the clock. That's not an assumption, it's a certainty.  So you do you.

But this narrative that people don't understand football ""Anyone who thinks this must be X"" gets real old... older than me. Who doesn't know anything about football.  Particularly the moron bit.

What's more tiring is that in the same scenario you were in during the home opener, the QB this time throws an interception in the red zone when he could have potentially scrambled to a first down or 3rd and short, and not had to give the ball back until LATE.

With all the magnifying glasses on this team, the situational errors are just.. incredibly fatal.

 That's not a matter of just getting it ""fixed"". Either it's not being made clear to the offense, the offense is pressing or something's being disregarded.
