It’s not a voidable contract (see Curtis Samuel’s spotrac page), it’s a typical non-guaranteed base salary for 23/24/25 at about 12m/ year ~ 8th in the league for a cap hit. Unless there’s a trade kicker that’s not listed.

The Bills could keep him at that value. Or they could trade him, or release him for a $0 cap hit ($1 million cap hit if injured).",3.0,buffalobills,t3_y0s9xr,False,0.0,bills :bills-logo:,2022-10-11T07:48:31Z,buffalobills,-0.0575388888888888
