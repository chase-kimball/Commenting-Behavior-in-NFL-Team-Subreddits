>I think it’s interesting that you see that as “including” the only guy who actually has a 17 game average right now. 

Yeah, I do view my post as including all the people who would qualify in this hypothetical.  



Lawrence isn’t excluded, as you can tell from his presence. He’s not disqualified, he’s just not in the same exact boat as Herbert is. They have done different things, so I described them differently. 

Lawrence has been the only QB to play his whole career in the 17 game era without missing a game, and for that he received his credit. 

Herbert started in the 16 game era like every other active QB that has completed multiple seasons, and would be the first of the QBs from the 16 game era (in this hypothetical scenario where all current starters start every game), who who would reach a >16 game average by the end of this current season, but (and this was most of the reason I made the post) the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc QBs would join the club in the seasons I listed. 

Your whole point seems to be “average starts per season” isn’t the same stat as “most QB starts  since 2019” or “most consecutive starts” or “most starts by a QB drafted since 2020”. Astute observation buddy, they are in fact not the same stat.",1.0,nfl,t3_y1jqol,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-10-11T17:22:44Z,chargers,0.0010210181898768

2. Justin Herbert - 16.33

Trevor Lawrence playing 17 games and not missing one this year is something I specifically brought up, but “Trevor Lawrence hasn’t missed a game yet 22 games into his career” isn’t really noteworthy. This whole post is only very mildly noteworthy, and that is somehow even less so.

And if not him, there were a ton of great picks available in the 3rd who could’ve started right away or been instant amazing depth pieces.
