Essentially, they‚Äôre not even picking up the expected yards that a play is blocked for, which goes back to what McVay said.

> Part of the problem is Akers and Henderson aren‚Äôt forcing missed tackles. Akers ranks 36th among all running backs with just seven missed tackles forced, per PFF. There are eight running backs ahead of him who have forced more missed tackles on fewer attempts.

> Henderson has only forced two missed tackles on his 78 rush attempts, a terrible rate for a running back. For comparison, Texans rookie Dameon Pierce forced 17 missed tackles in Week 5 alone ‚Äì eight more than Akers and Henderson combined this year.

9701,105112,105112,PrettyassDolphin,"Something a lot of us dont want to hear is that we are very clearly a below average team now. Injuries aside, we DO have an actual lack of talent that will prevent us from succeeding in 2 critical areas. The ENTIRE offensive line is below average at best, we have no passrush outside of AD, and we lack athleticism in the secondary and at offensive skill positions. Akers is terrible, Henderson is the definition of average, Higbee as well. Kupp is Kupp and no one else is an impact player.

 This is similar to the mid-2000's Rams where SJax was the only thing that made the Rams offense even slightly decent.

Stafford IS a top half QB but he CANNOT function with this offensive line, at all. 

Blame goes around but this also is the result of our approach to winning the SB. McVay and Snead threw EVERYTHING at winning last season, and it worked. But this is the aftereffect. We have bad depth and lack impact players outside of a few guys who take up all of the money.

ARob would be the only guy in the offense who could ""go up and get it"" at 10+ yards off the LOS. The problem is the line collapses so fast that I don't even think Stafford can get to ARob in his progression, especially not further down the field. Right now we need to just get the ball out as soon as possible and make something work. If you ask ARob to operate closer to the LOS it's just not suited for him. I really think the hope right now is to stay above .500 until we at least get Brian Allen and some other guys on the line back, and hopefully we can maintain some level of health after the bye week.
