We used to hit people in the chest when doing cpr in attempt to reset the electrical activity heart. Its called the precordial thump. 

  Essentially, there is a point during the cycle of a heart beat where the cells cannot depolarize again called the refractory period. A sudden thump in the heart will cause them to depolarize. And the timing of this is crucial. if all the cells in the heart are in this refractory phase, it's no big deal and nothing happens. If none of the cells are in this phase then they will all depolarize in an organized way and continue beating. The problem is when some of them are in the refractory period and others aren't. Then some depolarize and some don't and all the cells in the heart become out of sync and there is no more organized electrical activity in the heart (v-fib). We refer to it as the ""R on T phenomenon"". The ""R"" wave on an ekg is the ventricles depolarizing, the ""T""wave  is those same cells repolarizing. You don't want an R wave on top of a T wave.

The NFL Community, abhor players:

1. Who are overly aggressive and put themselves in bad situations
2. Who break laws such as DUI, Illegal weapon and drug possession
3. Who assault others and particularly women
4. Who sexually assault others

Yet, all these kids (as I get older these guys are just kids), are finding the things they enjoy off the field that do not put themselves in bad situations.

A large part of the NFL Community think 21 year old kids should be golfing, hiking, dating, having kids, raising kids, driving fancy cars, building/buying fancy houses, partying, drinking, whoring as all are good activities because those things don't distract from football apparently (lots of sarcasm).

This part of the NFL Community doesn't think video games are an approved recreational activity. They put a stigma to it and they attack him off the field for it. It's horse shit.

[If he's not watching enough film it's because he's a young dude and he's not being coached to do it. He's not seeing the on-field rewards from doing it because we suck.](https://youtu.be/cnAhUUi2k3s?t=277)
