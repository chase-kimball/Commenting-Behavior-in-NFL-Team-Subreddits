I lurk other teams’ subs often, and after last night Ravens fans saying how KP is horrendous and Mac Jones/Zach Wilson level, our defense is overrated and can only stop them because they’re fielding Huntley, the only reason they ever lose is their OC, claiming their defense is shit (lmfao… that’s an elite fucking defense), the Cam play was actually a penalty etc…

That was just a good game, and exactly what you’d expect from Steelers/Ravens. The Ravens have a backup QB in so they’re going to run the ball and play safe, playing not to lose exactly how they should. They were relying on their defense, which only gave up 16 points at home. 

Pittsburgh adjusted from the first matchup and ran a ton of 6-2, stopping the run and forcing them to throw. At times it worked throwing to Andrews, and times it didn’t.

16269,100584,100584,ItsYourBoyD,"This great work, almost scary accurate to how I’d evaluate lol. Here’s my thoughts:

## Offense

+ QB - spot on.

+ RB - spot on. Maybe make McFarland yellow.

+ FB - spot on.

+ WR group - spot on, although I’d make Sims yellow. 

+ TE - spot on. Maybe make Heyward “too soon to tell” because he might not even be a TE moving forward, he might be the D. Watt replacement for cheaper. But don’t mind how you have it. 

+ OT - I don’t think Chuks and Moore are on the same level, one is clearly better than the other, which is the only issue here and why there should probably be 1 more category as others have stated, but other than that, spot on. 

Edit: Thinking about it more, maybe make Moore purple. Like he’s a 6th round project who’s young and already has 2 years starting experience under his belt. He’s not great by any stretch, but he COULD be a long term answer there. Idk, he’s a tough one. 

+ IOL - perfect. If there was the extra lower tier, Dotson gets moved, and KG goes to whatever tier is lower than that. He’s brutal. 

## Defense 

+ IDL - I’d make Leal purple, but it’s solid.

+ Edge - Malik Reed should join Dotson and Moore in the purgatory tier. Moore at least has promise because he’s young as was drafted as a project tackle, unlike the other 2. Dotson is just kind of a liability, and Reed is a fringe roster guy, which is why Denver let him go in the first place. 

+ LB - spot on, unfortunately. Jack disappointed me this year, and Bush wont be back. 

+ CB - I’d make Wallace green. He’s basically having a career year, and looks like a very good #2 option. If Sutton stays and can cover slot guys, and we can get a real #1, that’s a good corner group. 

+ Safeties - perfect 

## Special teams

+ K - this season alone, Boswell would be purgatory tier, otherwise I agree he’s blue if you’re looking at this from a “moving forward” standpoint. 

+ P - Harvin is just way too inconsistent, but I’d probably make it orange just as you did. 

+ LS - I don’t remember any botched special teams snaps, so probably green.

+ STS - Gunner goes straight to KG’s “hell” tier.. first job as a punt returner is to catch the fucking ball. Your return skills are useless if you fumble. I’d rather someone who just fair catches it knowing he’d make the catch but wouldn’t positively contribute in returns, at least it wouldn’t be a hinderance.

The Bills should fondle New England next week. (3/6)

While unlikely, the Jets COULD beat Miami. When they played them earlier this year (I believe Tua and Teddy were both out though) they blew them out. This one is tough, Miami is the better team and at home (4/6)

I don’t have the numbers but I’d love to see the sample size. Teams like Buffalo, KC, Cincinnati and Philly seem to throw bombs once or twice every game. We don’t seem to throw downfield much at all. 

>red zone efficiency

I wholeheartedly believe it’s a scheme thing, but we’ll see. Ben couldn’t execute, Mason couldn’t execute, Mitch couldn’t execute and now Kenny can’t execute. Odds are, it’s a scheme thing.

But - I fully agree with your take. Some good, like the clutch gene last week leading a game winning comeback drive with the season on the line and a ton of pressure. Good moxxy and leadership, good athleticism. Some bad, like consistency and pre snap stuff (“hot” reads, picking up the blitz, recognizing coverages in exotic looks, etc…) but that’s hopefully cleaned up with just more experience. 

>cautiously optimistic about Kenny going into year 2

I expect a big jump to be honest. He’s probably going to finish with a single digit in passing scores, despite playing in double digit games.

- Run game: Najee, jaylen, the OL. Just a whole ass kicking from this unit. Line was getting movement and Najee and Jaylen were running HARD.

- Presley harvin: our boy had a great game. Good kicks and pinned them deep. Solid kicking tonight 

- Kenny: ANOTHER game winning drive. Wow wow wow he was flawless on that one for the win. Just a really great game for him 

Bad-

- penalties: boy were these killer, especially the redzone ones we can’t get away from. Just brutal for a team with no margin for error to keep stacking these up

31522,219354,219354,Zane_Flynt_boyo,"around midnight last night, when i was following Damar Hamlins injury, i got a knock on my bedroom door. 

My stepdad goes “We need to talk” mom goes “Cashmere (our cat) is ——“ i couldnt hear her, i filled in the blank. My 15 year old cat is dead. This cat helped my through the abuse as a child and was there for much of my life. Shes old now and if she died overnight, id half expect it. 

I opened the door to face this reality, my stepdad was telling me about the mess they cleaned up, bloody urine and some puke. She has kidney issues so Im thinking kidney failure. He ends by saying “so well take her into the vet and see how she does in the morning”. I said I thought you said she was dead. No she was sick. I misheard my mom. I basically fell to the ground half out of relief and half to pet our dog who was picking up on the anxious vibes we had.

I go to bed with this still lingering worry that my cat still has failed kidneys and we are going to have to put her down in the morning. Although saddened, I have dealt with the passing away of animal before and I came to terms with it as soon as I could. My sleep was restless, and between the Hamlin news and worrying about my cat, I couldnt help but feel grief. 

In one way this was an improvement for me. A year ago, my anxiety towards death would have induced an attack and crippled me mentally. But I faced these scary realities resolutely. 

Daylight broke and I spent the whole morning in my room. I played some difficult video games to focus my attention at something else. I check my imessages and receive positive news. Stepdad is saying Cashmere seems fine and like normal. He took her to the vet and said it will take some time for the vet to see her because shes got no open appointments. 

After some time we get news, not kidney failure, just a bad UTI. she gets Medication and we can pick her up in 30 mins.

At the vet, we finally get to her, she howling and hissing to the vet staff and everyone near her. And then I sit her in the backseat next to me. And she stops. I stick my finger in the grate and she rubs up against it. Shes quiet for most of the ride home, and Im grateful I can still keep this cat.",20.0,nfl,t3_102a9j5,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers :Panthers: Panthers,2023-01-03T22:54:48Z,steelers,0.0152876629533114
