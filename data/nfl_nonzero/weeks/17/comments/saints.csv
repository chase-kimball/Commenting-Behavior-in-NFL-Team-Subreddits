- I still don't know why the Eagles stopped running.

- We need our OL to get healthy if we want a fighting chance. It's a shame it took until Week 17 for our defense get healthy.

- The flea flicker out of the Kamara direct snap formation was a good call just not with the OL personnel. First half playcalling was great. But Carmichael's offenses have stalled consistently in the second half lately.

- Wild card hopes are still alive. *vomits* Skol Vikings

27847,257618,257618,physedka,"He's one of those great ""What Ifs?"". Most HoF QBs have at least 3 of the following boxes checked:

* A ring or at least a couple of conference titles
* Pro Bowl - should have several of these on the resume
* MVP / All Pro or at least a clear top 3 QB for a few seasons
* Big career stats / records - often comes with consistent, long careers

So let's look at how Luck was doing as far as the above criteria:

* Rings / Championships:  He brought the Colts to the AFC title game just once. So let's go with ""no"" on this one.
* Pro Bowl type accolades:  He was a 4x pro bowler in his 6-7 seasons, depending if you count the fully injured one. So I think it's certainly plausible that he would have continued to rack up such accolades.
* MVP or top 3 QB:  He was a borderline #3 one year but otherwise was #5-8 range for his few full seasons that we got to see. So I'm going to go with ""no"" on this one.
* Career stats/records:  He was certainly putting up some big yardage in the few full seasons that we got to see, so I would call it plausible that, if he had managed to hang in there for 20 years, he would have been up there in career numbers. But, then again, wouldn't a lot of QBs have huge numbers if they hang around that long?

So I guess my opinion is that we only saw him working toward 2 of the 4 check boxes. If he continued on that path for a long career, he probably would have ended up in the Hall of Very Good with guys like Philip Rivers. He really needed a ring or at least a dominant MVP caliber year to get over the hump, and it just didn't happen. Could he have done it? Sure.
