Conclusion:

Miami STILL has significantly more DB injury problems than your best-next-example case Buffalo Bills.

You STILL can't name who the CB3 or CB4 for Miami supposedly are. Weird that you'd want to argue that with me when Needham has been our Nickel starter for 3 years and Trill Willaims was number 2 in preseason games.

At best, they have had equal injury problems and they've both been hit hard in the secondary.

Your argument for why Flores was better was because the defense sucks this year. I told you it's because the entire Flores defensive scheme is based on tight man coverage and excellent DB play. Miami is playing 3rd and 4th stringers all year at cornerback so it's obvious the defense would regress.

If anything, this proves how awful the Flores defense IS! Miami has a really good front 7 but they're ham-stringed by this one-dimensional and gimmicky Flores scheme.

They're also playing much better quarterbacks this year.

They are also playing a much harder schedule this year.

u/mstrgrieves has yet to reply.

In addition to all that, I reminded him/her that this is still the same defensive scheme Flores ran because Boyer is a holdover from Flores and NOT McDaniel's choice of DC. (I can't wait for it to go away; it's a gimmick Flores scheme that has been exposed over and over and over again by any decent QB)

He/she hasn't replied directly to any stats or data or context I provide, they just continue to move goal posts or ignore what I tell them and instead post ad hominem attacks about me being a biased fan.

I have provided countless data points for not liking Flores and when they try to dispute those, I provide more data points that go ignored.

I have not said at any point that Tua is a great QB. If you look at my post history I have been very honest about his bad throws and inability to see open receivers that McDaniel has schemed open. Tua has played great and Tua has played poorly; I certainly have not crowned him. My only conclusion is that he is inconsistent and injury prone but this season has played pretty well.

I'm not sure how the narratives of the Bills, Chargers, and Ravens secondaries being injured became stories but the Dolphins hasn't but, based on my initial research, Miami has had by far the most devastating DB injuries this year.

Are you trying to say the 49ers, Cowboys, Eagles, Chargers, Ravens, or Titans defensive backfield injuries can come close?

Maybe pick which of those you thinks comes closest and I'll do a breakdown of that team too.

Well, let's look at the actual facts:

**Bills Secondary by depth chart order and games played**

**FS**

Micah Hyde 0 **IR**

Damar Hamlin 15

**SS**

Jordan Poyer 11

Jaquan Johson 14

Cam Lewis 12

**LCB**

Tre‚ÄôDavious White 5

Christian Benford 9 **IR**

Siran Neal 15

Taron Johnson 15



**RCB**

Dane Jackson 14

Kaiir Elam 12

Xavier Rhodes 2

To simplify, we can call that: **80 games played** for their 1st and 2nd string DBs


**Dolphins Secondary by depth chart order and games played**

**FS**

Jevon Holland 16

Verone McKinley 9

Elijah Campbell 15

**SS**

Brandon Jones 7 **IR**

Eric Rowe 13

Justin Bethel 16

Clayton Fejedelem 12

**LCB**

Xavien Howard 14

Trill Williams 0 **IR**

Kader Kohou 14

Keoin Crossen 15

**RCB**

Byron Jones 0 **Never activated**

Nik Needham 6 **IR**

Noah Igbinoghene 16 

Justin Bethel 16

**65 games played** between their 1st and 2nd string DBs

I don't know who you think Miami's CB3 is but Trill Williams was CB3 coming out of camp and he went on IR. Nik Needham was CB4 and he's also been on IR for months.

And let's not forget thet Xavien Howard has been playing on two injured groins all season and a shell of his former self when Flores had him.

It's honestly not even close. The Bills have had better players available for far more games.

But your argument was that this defense would be much worse without Flores.

Let's look at the strength of schedule between McDaniel/Boyer and Flores:

**2022:** .547

**2021:** .464

**2020:** .467

**2019:** .484

If you look at the quarterbacks Flores won against between 2019 and 2021 (that I've already provided you in other threads today), it's easy to see how he was able to be so effective against bad and backup quarterbacks.",2.0,nfl,t3_101dqr2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-01-02T16:35:57Z,miamidolphins,0.0886608224894373

Shanahan and McDaniel have both said that the outside zone scheme takes about 2 years for linemen and receivers to fully learn the system. And McDaniel said two weeks ago that he was finally able to *start* adding some of the more complex layers to it for the Dolphins offense this year.

If I recall correctly, these are the some of the same concepts Belichick has tried to employ this year and we've seen how that's gone.

Lest we forget:

- The Minkah situation
- Jim Caldwell's mystery illness upon getting to know Flores
- How he treated Kenny stills
- Cutting any veteran with a voice or opinion
- Inability to develop players who went on to have decent years with other teams (including 3 O lineman just last season alone)
- How he treated Tua and Fitz
- Benching Tua in games
- Not letting Tua start against Baltimore even though he was dressed
- Tua's trainer saying Flores was impossible to communicate with
- Tua telling people on the sidelines he could play but placed on IR
- The weird co-offensive coordinators last year which turned into 4 different people calling plays
- Being outcoached by Urban Meyer
- The worst judgement and record of red flag challenges I've ever seen
- How fucking awful they were during the 7 game losing streak last year
- Hiring 4 OL coaches in 3 years and still having what PFF called the worst unit they've ever graded
- Telling a coach to move his family to Florida for a job only to fire him after four days on the job. No reason given to him other than a ""a gut feeling""
- Beat writers saying he was very difficult
- Fan reporters saying he was really nasty to players at open practices.
- His halftime meltdown with Tua last year

Keep in mind these aren't the things the FO allegedly leaked about not talking to coaches or being difficult to work with or demanding more power. I don't know if those things were true.

The things I've listed (and I could probably keep listing things) are all easily verifiable things that we as fans had been discussing at various points well before he was fired. But made excuses for them all because he was our guy.

* We know McDaniel isn't trying to force Tua to play or hide concussions because he's the one who sent him to the doc.
