- 2017 Brady: favored to beat Eagles, super close game
- 2013 Manning: favored to beat Seahawks but ultimately got blown out
- 2007 Brady: heavy favorites before getting upset by Giants
- 2002 Gannon: favored to beat Buccaneers but ultimately got blown out
- 2001 Warner: heavy favorites before getting upset by Patriots
- 1984 Marino: underdogs to / lost against one of the best teams of all time

Besides Marino in 84, all of these took place in an era where Super Bowls have typically been close and 50/50 propositions, and all of them were favored going into the game too. Even if you throw out the Manning and Gannon blowouts, you still have two of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, and a very competitive contest in SB 52.

I guess you can make the guess that the betting line probably overvalued the team with the prolific passer to begin with, but it is quite surprising that they never pulled it out still.

Add to that Stidham unexpectedly made plays with his legs and the defense just wasn't prepared for what the Raiders tossed out.

And let's not underrate just how potent the Raiders weapons are either. Adams, Waller and Renfrow are no slouches and Jacobs is the #1 rusher in the league. Our pass coverage scheme wasn't great and Lenoir got beat by Adams a lot, as I'd expect tbh since Adams is a top 5 WR. We probably should've had Ward following him more.

We also had some pretty terrible penalties on defense as well. I don't think we were ""exposed"" so much as the defense just had a bad game and we had to lean on our offense to win us this one.

For example, the original post used throwaways as an indication that Brock is smarter with the football and has more situational awareness. You used stats from the same timeline to support your opinion that they are essentially the same because they are taking roughly the same amount of sacks. 

I’m saying that the context of those sacks and throwaways is much more important than the raw stats themselves.

Also, there’s definitely an eye test thing going on here. Where the stats don’t match up with what’s on paper. Purdy is better at spinning out of the pocket away from defenders and seems to understand when to throw the ball away better than Jimmy. The raw sack stats could be misleading depending on how those sacks happened too.  Jimmy could take a sack trying to wait too long and not throw the ball away and Brock could take one because of a missed block that he didn’t see coming. One is on the Qb and the other is on the OL but we look at the stats after the game and just see that they took the same amount of sacks without the context.

19553,137228,137228,PossumOnAGoKart,"I get the question, but the answer is a hard one. I don’t have a solution but I can share some ideas on what might be considered in the future.

Tech. Integrating tech to the game could help change the game without diminishing the appeal. The NFL is just starting to dabble with it but I would accelerate it. 

Sensors in the pads, ball, cleats, we can detect when a knee is down and where the ball is, if 2 feet are down, etc. 

Improve the fields. Turf and grass have their own issues but as far as leg injuries go, a lot have to do with the fields and lack of uniformity. Met Life stadium is among the worst out there.

Pads. The more pads they got, the more the players have become human projectiles. Helmets also became weapons but with CTE the NFL is working on that. I don’t have the answer but the question is how to maintain the physical attribute but not incur such severe injuries. Look at Rugby and Lacrosse, both physical but way less violent.

What is a tackle or downed play? Like pulling a flag or a knee down, how do we agree to end the play? Can tech be apart of it? Can you legislate action like not landing on the QB? Idk - but this part is key to consider.

Buy in from the players. These guys make mega bucks and often go from poverty to prosperity. There is always going to be someone who will risk their health or others to change their lives and the lives of their families. If the game is going to get safer or less violent, everyone needs to buy into that. Consider the unspoken rules of baseball. You break one of those taboos and the whole league turns on a guy. If football had the same rapport where no one dared make a dirty hit because the whole league would come after you, things might change.

This isn't so much exposure as much as it's just people not expecting the Raiders to have the tonic, and not many teams really having it. The Chiefs and the Dolphins both had success this year (Dolphins didn't beat us but they did make some plays) extending plays and throwing it deep. You need a quarterback capable of getting outside the pocket and avoiding the pass rush to really trouble us. Then you need downfield receiving threats that are capable of capitalising on mismatches with our secondary. The Raiders happened to have that with Stidham, Waller and Adams. The Chiefs have that with Mahomes and Kelce. It helped the Raiders a lot that they had some success running the ball with Jacobs (who is the NFL's leading rusher and I think a lot of people forgot that part), which meant we couldn't sell out on the pass as much as we probably otherwise would have.   


Of all the teams we can possibly face coming up in the NFC, the Eagles are the biggest threat by far. Hurts is mobile as all get out. They have great receivers and a great RB. They are a team we will need our offense to fire to beat. Lions, Buccs, Packers, Cowboys, Vikings, Seahawks don't have the ingredients. None of them have QBs that can handle our pass rush and with each of them it's already demonstrated.
