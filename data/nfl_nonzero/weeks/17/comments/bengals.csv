If the Bengals end up having to play the Bills on the road in the second round of the playoffs, assuming they beat Baltimore and their first round opponent, it would be a damn shame in my opinion. Going into the playoffs the Bengals will have only played 7 home games...everyone else has/will have played 8. Not to mention that Bengals fans just had to cancel a home game in the absolute worst way imaginable and handled it pretty well. Cincinnati deserves that home game. 

While a tie screws the Bills out of a first round bye, that second seed was so incredibly important for home field advantage in the divisional round. Although you can't obviously get angry given the horrible circumstance of the situation (no team or player wanted this) if Cincinnati lost that second round game in Buffalo it would be hard to not be pretty upset about it.

EDIT: to clarify my statement, this was meant solely in reply to the person saying all other 30 teams would do this no doubt. I only expressed some doubt that Pittsburgh fans would have handled it with quite the same level of decorum. I'm not trying to epic-burn PIT or use this as an opportunity to jab. Just a comment made representing a personal opinion based on lived experience and some other [evidence](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/seahawks-darrell-taylor-wave-steelers) from similar situations.

The framing of this comment in the terms of ""their white hot offense"" etc was meant to further qualify that statement through the lens of a game of similar implications, in Pittsburgh, with their team on a hot streak and playing well to start the game. These factors could have further influenced shitheel behavior. 

Obviously I don't think any sane person (or entire fanbase) would be partying while obvious CPR is going on, but they did the freaking WAVE in the stadium while a guy was worried to have been paralyzed and medics were stabilizing and putting him on the board.

A non-conference opponent, at 2-3.

So apologies to those that think I'm just using opportunities for cheap shots at Pittsburgh, but they unironically were making merry in the stands while a guy was getting carted off the field already. I could definitely see them behaving a little less graciously if they were the home team in this situation.

I've been on the field in a sports match where CPR was needed. I donated to the charity. I don't give a fuck if they play this game or KC gets the seed or anything about the playoff implications. Right now I worry about Damar and Tee, and if we can learn anything to prevent this already freak occurrence from happening to any athlete in the future.",-84.0,nfl,t3_102dky5,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals ,2023-01-03T11:40:15Z,bengals,-0.0459083242073012
