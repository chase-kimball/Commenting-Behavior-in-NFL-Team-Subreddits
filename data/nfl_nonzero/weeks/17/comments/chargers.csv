Process was: 
    -	Acquire clips via YouTube. (Ytmp3 was my ripper)

    -	Arrange clips in Adobe Premiere Pro with music 
    -	Export clips to Adobe After Effects to RotoBrush the color out of everything but the subject. (Takes a while)
    -	Add Player Names in after effects so they appear between the in-color player and B&W background. 
    -	Add clip back to Premiere

I would argue that the reason Herbert has worse stats this year is because he has had one of the most injured teams all year to include himself and his two top WRs as well as his LT and other members of the OL.
