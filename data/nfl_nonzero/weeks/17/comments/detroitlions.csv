1 1/2 cup soy sauce 

1 cup *loosely* packed brown sugar 

1 bulb of crushed garlic. 

1 3-5 inch peeled and crushed ginger root 

1 full side salmon fillet (if you don’t have experience picking out fish, goggle it. You don’t want to pay $35-$50 for a shitty piece of fish). 

Toss the marinade together, put the salmon in an extra large freezer bag, add mixed marinade, press/roll the bag to get all the air out.

Marinate for 2-6 hours (don’t go over 8 as that will start to effect the texture and taste of the fish too much). 

Create a tinfoil packet, add fish and half of the marinade, cook in an oven at 350 or on a closed grill off direct heat. Pull the fish when it temps between 120-125 (if you don’t have a meat thermometer, wait until the fish just starts to have the fat come out of the top), let it rest for five minutes.

A single heart beat gets the brain about two minutes of oxygen. If they get to him quick enough, those artificial heartbeats can prevent any significant brain death provided that there is enough oxygenated blood continuing to circulate through his system. The good thing about having a team of doctors and medics in the immediate vicinity is that they are trained to use medical equipment such as pressurized oxygen systems that can force oxygen into his lungs in concert with the CPR. He literally was probably in the best place he could've been for such an event, short of a trauma room. As with many things, speed is the key.

They used a defibrillator and successfully got his heart started again, too. Yes, brain death is a very real possibility, and there are other major problems that can occur in such a situation because of the way the body prioritizes oxygen to the brain, such as kidney/other organ damage, lung damage, or even damage to the heart muscle itself. Lack of oxygen = death for whatever part of the body gets affected by it. Fortunately, most of our organs can heal, save for the brain and the heart.

With all the focus on preventing head trauma and safety around the brain, this should definitely be a wake up call for cardiac health and safety, especially if it winds up that he had some underlying condition that made him more vulnerable to this sort of thing. Never in my life will I forget the way he just flopped down like that. Horrible, horrible. I've seen plenty of shit up close including brain aneurysms and strokes. I watched my own mother die after they had to stop CPR when she coded in the hospital in September.

I agree with the sentiment that if that happened anywhere except an emergency room or a football field, this dude wouldn't have made it. It's a miracle he's stable, even if critical. 

Praying that he had enough oxygen in his blood to sustain his brain while he had no heartbeat. I don't want to think I just watched a young man die like that, out of the blue.

36348,218061,218061,Wiggymaster,"So let me get this straight? PMC is trashing the Lions for refusing to give him an interview with the head coach - the same head coach that he threw low-key shade at and tried to make out to be a absent-minded dumbass (he knew the Sewell shit was sarcasm, yet he put it out there as real for the marks - man works in both football and the wrestling business so there's no way he didn't pick up Dan's joke). He's doing this during the week of their biggest game of the season, against the team who's quarterback is a guest on the show literally every single fucking week, is a known douchebag heel ESPECIALLY in Detroit, and simultaneously has so much heat with the rest of the national sports media that the PMS (what a fucking ironic abbreviation, by the way) is about the only outlet that'll host him... and he agrees to come on primarily because they fellate him more these days than even Packers fans do.  

This is making me sneeze pretty hard, because to quote wrestling legend Jim Cornette, ""I got this bad allergy - I'm allergic to BS.""

I mean, again, McAfee knows what he's doing. He's totally playing heel right now and knows he's gonna get a lot of heat in Detroit over these comments, and heat generates attention, which generates ratings, clicks, et. cetera. I get it - he's a media personality now, through and through. But what eats me is that he still tries to come off as though he's one of the boys - a former player who deserves to be treated as a former player and not a radio host.. WHILE HE'S BEING DISINGENUOUS for the sake of creating controversy. Sorry, Pat - you can't stand on both sides of the fence at the same time and not have a post either go up your rectum or crush your nuts. And that's the main reason the coach won't be on the show this week. McAfee took advantage of his ""I'm just a regular guy, former player like you, etc."" persona to get Dan Campbell on the show - a show which primarily caters to Packers fans as of late - and then he goes on to sell Dan Campbell as a meathead. He earned his ire, and isn't going to have a single NFL guest other than Throw Rogan trust him if he keeps up this up. And to respond in this petty ass, weaksauce passive-aggressive manner makes me think that the goal all along was to have MCDC on to amuse and cater to the Packers fans who think he's dumb.

36350,218064,218064,Wiggymaster,"You're trying to create a strawman argument that suggests I'm saying speed alone equals success at wide receiver. That's not what I'm saying, and you know that. What I did say is when you combine sub 4.2 speed with the other traits that Jamo has, you have a recipe for greatness, and that's the type of receiver you build around. 

Your classification of ""the best"" wide receivers is completely subjective and irrelevant, but we'll dive in anyway. Tyreek Hill literally moved Tua Tagovailoa from bust-watch to (briefly) the MVP conversation. Calvin Johnson is easily considered by most to be among the best wide receivers of all time, and he ran 4.35. Jamo doesn't have the size, strength, or ups of Calvin, but he definitely has the hands and ability to make contested catches. In the case of Cooper Kupp, you're dealing with a slot receiver, so that's an apples to oranges comparison. 

The bottom line is that the league has changed quite a bit since Jerry Rice was catching passes, and the advantages speedy receivers have over contemporary NFL corners cannot be overstated.

You talk about ""jerking off over speed"" when speed is literally what separates the pros from college. Ask anyone who's played the game, or hell, just go look up some damned interviews. The speed of the NFL is why some rookies have a hard time at first. Yes, timing and precision is also important, but you can't learn to be precise at NFL speeds if you lack the speed that it takes to do so.

Been a fan since 1967. It's a low bar but Holmes is the GM of my lifetime. MCDC - along with Brad, Sheila, and Spielman - created a dramatic shift in the culture. They are easy to root for, but probably the most encouraging thing is the way they have gone about this rebuild. This is not some band aid, frankenstein approach to roster construction. This was from the inside out, vision oriented, built-to-last-rebuild. Have never been so confident the Lions finally got it right.

Goff has played well this season. Especially since Chark got healthy, his deep ball passing has been great. What I love most about him is he is fine with throwing a worm burner or into the 5th row when it's not there. His decision making has been superb.

Let's enjoy the ride, brother man. Ain't no reason to be petty or small minded. Life is too short, truly, to waste it on vainglorious micro-victories.

This leaves Hutch totally unblocked, right in Fields’s face, 1-on-1. The Dline doesn’t fall for the play action, Alim drops into coverage in the flat, and Cominsky drops off his blocker (no one picks him up). The entire bears OL is left blocking Houston and Buggs, with Hutch still on Fields, Cominsky closing in, and Alim acting as an impromptu QB spy.

And as for the team, I honestly love this collection of players more than any team we’ve had since. The passion and energy, the selflessness of these guys who share job titles with divas and douchebags on other teams, who just come in and work and love this city, it brings a tear to my eye. 

I hope we continue to build this team the way we’ve been building it and establish ourselves as playoff/championship regulars for a long time. I have patience and can understand that this takes time, but with every draft I really hope we just get better and better, and keep up that fire that we’ve been building.",1.0,detroitlions,t3_101jtfi,False,0.0,DETROIT -VS- EVERYBODY,2023-01-02T12:40:45Z,detroitlions,0.0648573587521649
