6976,77351,77351,LifeTableWithChairs,"Could  I remove intentionally tackling other players without making football a different sport?  No.

If I were trying to reduce the number of tackles that occur in a game while still keeping the closest thing to current football as possible, here's what I would do.

All players are designated as either Tackle positions or Flag positions.  Tacklers cover all trenches and RBs.  Flags cover QBs and Receivers.  They are discerned by the fact that Flag players wear flags.  Tacklers can advance the ball by the ground and only the ground.  Flag players aren't allowed to get hit intentionally.  To 'tackle' a flag player, pull the flag.  TEs need to be declared Flag or Tackle positions in advance.  On defense, Safeties and CBs wear flags and are the only players who can advance an interception.  All other players are immediately downed with the interception at the spot of the catch.

This way you can still have run plays and throwing plays.  You still have a fight in the trenches and the potential for sacks.  You can still have trick plays where a RB takes the ball and throws it sideways to the QB who makes a forward pass.  But you don't have scrambling as much or YAC as much as 'tackling' flag players is a lot easier.

It's much closer to the current sport than Flag football.  The main benefit is that if a kid wants to play football, weary parents can easily say 'you can play QB, WR, Kicker, or CB' rather than the current situation where Kicker is the only 'safe' position.",-1.0,nfl,t3_102evhm,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-03T13:35:26Z,falcons,0.0461374189861789

If football becomes viewed as equally dangerous as boxing by parents, the number of kids interested in playing football may not be enough to put together a 53-man team at many high schools.

Sure, you have plenty of people who become boxers with the financial incentive, and you have plenty of fans who watch boxers pretty often, but the number of boxers in HS are nothing compared to how many currently play Football.

I don't mean that *no one* will want to play football.  I just mean that the potential recruit population will shrink from 900k HS players to less than 50k.  Colleges will feel this first.
