Look at the top QB for each team and it’s a mixed bag of top 10 picks, mid-to-late first rounders, and day 2 - day 3 picks.

Edit: here’s the list of starters in the NFL.

By my count there are 10 or 11 guys who were drafted on the top 10.

So about two thirds did not get drafted in the top 10.

Say we trade up with CHI at 2 to draft CJ Stroud.

That entails two firsts in return.

Given we’re drafting a QB so early, it’s safe to assume he’s the starter.

With a rookie QB it’s also safe to assume we will struggle and likely to be picking top 10 the year following.

So in essence we will have sacrificed two top 10 picks for an unproven rookie QB.

It’s worth considering if Stroud pans out but it’s DAMN risky. The odds are against finding that franchise guy. 

I’d rather we stay put, take a gamble on Levis / Richardson and see what Darnold can do in the interim.

The Rams (Lions) would pick after the Panthers if they had identical 6-11 records due to the Rams having a harder SOS.

The only way the Panthers pick above either the Falcons or Raiders is with a Panthers loss, and Raiders/Falcons win respectively, as both would pick above the Panthers with an identical record due to a weaker SOS. 

Even with a win, the Panthers won't fall below the 9th pick as they have a weaker SOS than any of the current 7 win teams.

So the Panthers are currently selecting 9th, and can't fall with a win, but could move all the way up to 6th depending on how the other games play out.

For the record, the Panthers play the Saints, Rams play the Seahawks, Falcons play the Buccaneers, and the Raiders play the Chiefs.

I can live with a loss, and ultimately this team didn't deserve to make the playoffs. But it's frustrating that the loss can basically be pinned on a WR not known for having elite speed, scoring 3 times on go routes with zero adjustment by the coaching staff to stop it.

Darnold played decent enough this year that we could go BPA in the first round, but it’s obvious we need QB depth. 

IMO, WR/TE round 1 would be good to develop a young receiving core. TMJ shows promise. Shi Smith did okay. DJ Moore obvious WR1 just need a solid WR2. Maybe pick one up free agency but idk.

Initially, I was high on trading Thompson but keeping core veterans to establish identity is key. Maybe he takes a friendly deal to free up cap space. 

Keep the OLine especially Cade Mays. I’m also sold on Giovanni Ricci. Scrap CBS minus Horn. If we’re going to make a splash Free Agency it needs to be secondary compliment Chinn and Woods. 

Add QB, keep RBs especially Foreman. Hubbard I’m on the mend but a viable RB2 would be nice.

definitely go for another WR compliment DJ Moore.

Go for TE. I like Tremble as a route runner. I like Thomas as a run blocker.

OL is solid. 

DL is solid maybe give someone to compliment Brown cause he had a good year. Of course you keep Burns. Whoever said trade Burns go play in kinetic sand. I also like Haynes and McCall as Depth. YGM is developing and becoming more well rounded. 

LB, keep Shaq. He’s up and down but he’s a core player. Everyone else can kick rocks.

Secondary, Jaycee can stay. But it’s obvious and I’ve said it for years CB is our weakest link. CJ can go, DJax can go, build this position through the draft and FA. Gotta have depth if Horn goes down for a third year. Taylor can go too but I like Sam Franklin cause he can play the nickel and FS. Also a good contributor on special teams.
