This straight up is not true. All of the guys who were slated to be the good free agents in 2023 signed extensions over the course of the offseason. Diontae Johnson for example, didn't even sign his until August. 

> Everyone says we’re purposely tanking, but I’d argue we’re not cause that’s a terrible move to trade away high seconds if you’re intent is to tank.

They traded the 2nd pick for Chase Claypool. He is our draft selection with the 32/33rd overall pick. We didn't trade away any other pieces, so it's essentially selecting Claypool at 32/33. I don't consider that a knock out of the park but there aren't any receivers in this upcoming draft class with his athletic profile available at that draft slot. It was an overpay, and it is what it is. He's got upside, fits the style of WR Fields likes to play with, and is a solid building block for this WR group. I understand not liking it, but it is help for Fields. 

> Look at teams like the Chiefs or Steelers.

Yes, the Steelers consistently invest high draft picks to WR's, to a fault. No idea why the Chiefs are listed here, they've spent 2 draft picks since 2016 on WR's within the first 3 rounds.

Everyone says we’re purposely tanking, but I’d argue we’re not cause that’s a terrible move to trade away high seconds if you’re intent is to tank. 

Especially considering we traded for the guy Pickens pushed out of the lineup. 

You’re in a rebuild you can go WR/S/T/T. Now we’re likely spending another high pick next year on a WR and maybe spending in FA on one as well.

Fields is one of the worst statistical qbs by nearly every passing metric. And we have no idea how much of that is fields, the terrible line, the terrible and increasingly terrible from injury to the recoevers. Which is exactly where we were last year. Knowing fields was a tremendous athlete since the escape against the 49ers his rookie year. 

Go back to off season post. No one predicted the offense was going to he worse then nagy's last year. Poles was touted as an offensive line guru. That the line and recievers couldn't possibly be worse then last year because scheme alone was going to fix it. 

Mooney was putting up 20 yards a game less than last year before his injury. Kmet is going to finish with 100-150 yards less then he had last year. Despite the injury to mooeny that should have increased his targets and thus totals. Claypool had back to back 800 yard seasons and was around 350 when we traded for him, has barely managed over 100 yards since we traded an extremely high two for. Every other reciever poles has acquired has also been awful and somehow managed to be worse then Goodwin last year. Pringle, st brown, Harry, velus.

Then those poor acquisitions extend to offensive line. Mustipher somehow made the 53 man roster. The free agent lineman were all terrible. His one ""good"" addition is Braxton who is one of the worst pass blocking tackles in the nfl.

The decision to trade mack in the off season coming off injury before he could show he was healthy and trading Quinn at the deadline after he showed he's an every other year player reduced the returns on both trades. Roquan and poles both share blame for roquan wanting out. And those moves plus losing hicks, we knew the defense would be worse. And that would make the team worse. 

There is next to nothing to point to poles making a positive move. Anyone can get rid of talent. He got as little value as possible in trading mack, Quinn, and roquan. Made another increasingly bad looking trade for Claypool. 

The only good thing about this season is justin fields legs. And it's not that the bears made any change after the Thursday game. Fields started scrambling. Getsy made some improvements in the red zone, but it unless you think getsy is calling up 3rd and long for fields to scramble for a first down. It was fields legs and fields legs alone that gave that nice stretch of optimism. 

There are far more examples of poles ""plan"" to suck not working then working in the nfl. Even more so if you aren't drafting a generation qb.

We're competing for the #1 overall pick because that's how bad the team is. We have one of the worst pass offenses in the last 2 decades in the nfl. Fields is the most sacked qb in bears history despite the supposed ol guru revamping the line.

Which is a pretty pedestrian at best qb.

It's so incredibly frustrating to evaluate fields. The line is terrible. The recievers are terrible. And scrambling out of the pocket is almost always a better decision on any given pass play then an actual pass. Especially into man coverage. 

So you can't blame the decision to run, which has been undeniably effective and the only reason our offense has even sniffed competence. But my worst fear after career altering injury for fields was this. Fields learning to not trust his line or recievers. He doesn't trust the tight window throws and his recievers don't make the catch to when he has tried. He doesn't trust his line and gets happy feet when his first read isn't college open. Even in the rare instances they do give him protection. 

So on any individual play you can understand why he made the decision he did, but also you just can't play qb that way for a long period of time. Hopefully he has a goldfish memory and can clense this year from him and next year he can develop the way we hoped he would this year. When touting mooneys floor as 1k. Pringle and st brown being better than Goodwin. And that surely mustipher wouldn't make the final 53 after signing Patrick. 

Poles has a lot to do this off season. It's why I'm so against taking  Carter or Anderson if we somehow don't trade down.

Kmet went from 610 last year to likely 500 this year. With injuries that should have increased his targets. Mooney went from 62 yars/game to 41 this year. So is Braxton Jones as stud and this year's line better than last year or not? Was getting rid of nagy curls supposed to fix all our offensive woes or not? 

Yes the talent around him is abysmal and he was never going to be getting 3300+ yards. But we do not have the worst line in the league. We do not have the worst recievers in the league. We do have the worst passing game on the league by a wide margin. 

When's the last time you saw a qb throw a 50 yard bomb and still finish under 200 yards as consistently as fields? Those are the kind of chunk plays that get other qbs 300+ yard games.

We had **30** net passing yards against the 3rd worst pass defense in the league. Fields only managed 242 yards in two games against the lions. This is the 4th time the team has managed under 100 net passing yards.  The only time fields did that in a start last year was the browns game that is 100% on nagy.

If he was considered elite, I can see Fields being elite, if Bears can get him a top pass catcher or Claypool steps up and Bears draft a future stu. Fields is a muuuuch better runner too. Watson played hero ball a TON, and always had Hopkins as a safety blanket to just throw the ball up to. You see Fields doing a lot of what Watson had to do, bc of the oline issues for both guys, but WRs failing him. I think a #1 WR is much more important for him than a really good line. We obviously need to upgrade the line tremendously, but he can still be elite with an avg line and legit top pass catcher.

I dont think Fields will be any higher than 4th, if he does make the elite category. Getting around 3800 yards passing and say 700-800 yard running, will get him there.

That’s generous. 

Year 1 he had an adequate, but far past prime Roethlisberger. Year two he was playing with the corpse of Ben who could only dump off to the RB. Year three he started with a Trubisky-led Matt Canada offense. Canada is likely to be fired this year, and if he isn’t, well, he should be. He’s a bad OC. 

Then he traded teams and had to develop chemistry with a new QB and learn a new (and what appears to be complicated) offense on the fly, while his QB1 missed some time. On a team with low passing volume, so less live reps and game tape to learn from. 

I’m not saying he will or won’t perform next year, but I am saying that he has at least reasonable excuses for his career so far, and has done more with his circumstances than a lot of WRs could have.
