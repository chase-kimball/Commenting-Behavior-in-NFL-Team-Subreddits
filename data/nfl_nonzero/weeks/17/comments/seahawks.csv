138,1230,1230,1620081392477,"> 3 years 70 million

I'd bet PCJS would have signed that deal yesterday if they could have (at $23m/yr). As a fan who wants to keep Geno I'm hoping we can get him for something close to the franchise tag still, but even that will be hard since we don't have a lot of cap room next year

**Edit**:

> The Seahawks have $53.7 million in available cap space in 2023, which is fifth in the league. However the Seahawks only have 33 players under contract, which makes them bottom three by that measure. What this means is that the $53.7 million won't go as far as people expect, a lot of that is going to be used just to fill out the 53 man roster... 

> ... In 2023 OTC estimates the Seahawks have $29.9 million in effective cap space.

Taken from [this post](https://reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/zzbr4s/the_hypothetical_geno_smith_contract/) in the Seahawks reddit recently. Also the ""effective cap space"" is assuming they fill all 33 spots with rookies and only vet-min free agents, which would be a terrible roster. 

So yeah, we might have to get creative with things like void years (and probably cut a handful of players, especially Gabe Jackson) if we want to keep Geno",2.0,nfl,t3_1011p41,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2023-01-01T21:38:00Z,seahawks,0.0988946204185485

He has a high completed air yards per attempt  but a very low attempted yards per comp  His game is throwing ball short in volume which is what kills the WR TE numbers. Like Minshew had  100 more yards with one less comp last week as a example. 

Geno's stats are kinda what you want to see. You could make a strong case for or against him depending on what you bring up and put more value on, which is probably why there isn't a general consensus on here about what he is worth.

If you pay him like a upper tier QB it negates his value. Unless you have him grooming a young QB, which makes it more of an investment to the future while staying competitive. We have to draft or trade for a QB because both of ours are FAs. Even if it's a mid round guy with reasonable upside potential 

I think best case scenario is a non exclusive franchise tag  and someone gives up 2 firsts for him. If  you keep him, you still buy yourself a season to evaluate the options. Paying him more for the opportunity to see if he can maintain a higher level of play without committing long term is worth it.  Plus you get a season to groom a young QB and evaluate if he will be able to take over.  

I just don't think he will live up to a bigger long term contract. So sign him to a 1 year deal somehow or let him go. I don't think what he is good at is that hard to replace.

If you look at our teams over the late 2010s and early 2020s, the biggest and most consistent flaw of our teams is that we can’t stop the run, like at all, and we have an incredibly difficult time getting to the QB in pass rush.   Assuming they aren’t busts, Carter likely solves the first problem and Anderson solves the second.

Ultimately, I wouldn’t be too opposed if we go with any of the Top 3 QBs (Young, Stroud, or Levi’s), I just think that a balanced approach to rebuilding this team is the way to go.  It’s how we won back in 2013 and it’s how Pete’s system thrives.

I honestly disagree with the narrative that Geno is not the answer.   The key issue with his falloff has less to do with Geno himself and more to do with our defense regressing heavily and our depth at skill positions drying up down the stretch.

Geno has still very much been the key to our team not being complete ass.   

If we managed to shore up our defensive issues (which a Carter/Anderson type would be great for) then our team would probably look a lot more dangerous.

The only thing that would convince me that moving on is the right move is if another team is willing to overpay for his services.
