OL is playing better as a unit, although you could argue that's more a function of who we've played recently and not their improvement alone.

So it comes down to what's best for our team. To me that's health. I'm fine with starting the usual starters, but I think I'm leaning on pulling starters fairly quickly to ensure they don't get seriously injured in a meaningless game. And the game is meaningless for our team. 

It's not like putting our starters in vs. PHI starters is a guaranteed W for us, so for me, it's about ensuring the best health possible for the playoffs.

14501,126147,126147,Niccio36,"Yeah but if you’re good enough WR talent doesn’t matter. 

And the Ravens have Andrews but the Giants have Barkley. Also Andrews has been a non-factor this year. He hasn’t had a big game since we played the Ravens back in October (7 catches for 106 yards and a TD). And plus, the Giants have Barkley, so I think it evens out in terms of a star skill position player outside of receiver. The Ravens haven’t had a receiver catch a touchdown since Week 3, so they have a pretty shite WR corps too. I think their #1 receiver right now is honestly DeMarcus Robinson, so they have it really bad too. 

DJ has definitely improved, don’t get me wrong, but the amount of corny shit the Giants have to run to move the chains on offense reveals the lack of ability they have. 

Someone like Lamar is just such a game-breaker that even though he is not the most consistent passer (although he has drastically improved in throwing the ball every season), he is a one-man offense that needs literally nothing around him to succeed. 

Also just a reminder that Lamar has been out the past four games, where the Ravens have been held to 17, 3, 16, and 10 points respectively. 

With him, they average 25 PPG. That would put them at #8 in the league. The Giants have averaged 20.7 for the year. That puts them at 20. Definitely a big difference whether or not he’s on the field for them. 

I don’t mean this to sound like a bash of DJ, I’m just using an example of what a superstar with a limitless ceiling can do compared to a GOOD quarterback who is everything you see. DJ is a good quarterback and we’re in the NFC where the QB collection is a lot weaker, but he is a Top 15 or so guy as compared to Top 5",1.0,nygiants,t3_zyi8kq,False,0.0,:Helmet_Catch: Helmet Catch :Helmet_Catch:,2022-12-30T09:14:09Z,nygiants,0.0128302463402859

Lamar Jackson is another QB I can look at who has a poor receiving corps and an excellent defense, but then again he’s a superior player to Jones.

Mahomes
Herbert

- Saquon wasn’t involved yesterday and honestly I kinda preferred that. Rest his legs and get him fully healthy for playoffs. I don’t expect much Saquon or DJ next week, if at all

- WE HIT THIRTY POINTS!!!!!!!

- Not only that, but we did it with minimal Saquon and the WRs we’ve had all season. I feel like we needed that going into playoffs.

- Landon Collins is bae

- Anyone saying Thibs is classless for his snow angel celebration is a fool lookin for a narrative. Dude clearly didn’t know Foles was hurt.

- Great playcalling on both sides of the ball, and special teams was on point too

- I expect to rest our key starters next week, as it’s officially a meaningless game
