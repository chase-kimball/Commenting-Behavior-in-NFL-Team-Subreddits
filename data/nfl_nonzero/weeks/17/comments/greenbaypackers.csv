mRNA was discovered in the 60s and had been theorized as a potential way to deliver a vaccine but real research into that didn't happen until 1990 when they started testing on mice.  

The first human clinical trial of an mRNA delivery system was in 2001.  Moderna and BioNTech were founded in 2010 and 2008 respectively. 

The first human clinical trial of a mRNA vaccine against an infectious disease was 2013.

-On offense it’s either run or pass for stretches of game with little mixing. And we did another couple of the 30 yard bomb into double coverage down the sidelines on third and short again. Always frustrating, but even more so when both Jones and Dillon were punishing with the run. And it’s become the default so that we aren’t going to catch any other team sleeping on it. They know it’s more than likely coming. Fortunately converting on 4th helped negate that along with the special teams and defensive scores giving us the wiggle room for it to be OK.

-On defense we were seeing great success with the press coverage and then they would sit back and allow them to move down the field. A couple times Romo pointed out how easy it was for Kirk to pick apart that zone. Kirk fucking Cousins. The end of the first half was a prime example.

Brady’s defense has ranked on average about 12th since 2010. So he’s had a defense well above league average more often than not. That speaks to how impressive the Pats dynasty/SB winning Bucs have been at maintaining good defenses. 

That being said, it doesn’t matter how good your defense is without your QB/offense putting points on the board. Brady won the SB in 2014 with the 15th ranked defense, and took the 29th, 18th, ranked defense to the Super Bowl in 2011 and 2017 respectively.

He had played really well coming in for a injured Favre against the Cowboys in 2007 and a lot of us thought he might be the real deal. 

Fast forward to the next season and Favre had announced his retirement and the organization went ahead with Rodgers as the starter all through OTAs and training camp. Now, family night at Lambeau is the last big event before preseason starts and the offense and defense have a scrimmage and tickets are pretty cheap and they have fireworks afterwards and raffle off jerseys. It’s fun. I went to that family night and I will never forget the crowd booing Aaron Rodgers when they announced the offense. For no other reason than he wasn’t Favre. I was pissed. I remember watch him be really good and prove all these dumb fucks wrong. Well turns out…

What’s more, Favre had flown back to Green Bay that night and wanted his job back but obviously the organization was like gtfo. Fast forward to next season after his stint in New York, and those same fans that booed Rodgers were now LIVID when Favre signed with the Vikings. That was definitely the nail in the coffin for most fans. Of course there were plenty of us who realized that the NFL is a business and the Vikings were the perfect fit for him at the time.

However, he gave a more in-depth answer to sportswriter Sam Farmer: 

> “The only time that fans don’t like prevent defense is when it doesn’t work,” Madden said. “When it does work, you don’t even notice it. It’s like good officials and a well-officiated game, you don’t notice them at all. If you have poor officials, then the whole game is based on officiating.

> “If the prevent works, no one ever talks about it or writes about it or mentions it.”

> That said, Madden never liked the prevent.

> “I thought it made the players play too conservatively,” he said. “Pretty soon they’re aware of everything and doing nothing. But I bet if you did the statistics on it, the amount of times that you use it and it works and you win the game would be a pretty high percentage.”

> Indulge me in a funny aside: The late Mike Heimerdinger, a well-traveled offensive coordinator, used to say he was jealous of his defensive counterpart because, while everyone thinks they know offense, few fans spend the time to grasp the complexities of defenses.

> “I know my wife never sits in the stands and hears, ‘Hey, why’s the defense in two-deep?’ ” he told The Times in 2003, when he was with the Tennessee Titans. “The only time you ever hear a fan complain about a defense is when they’re in the prevent, and that’s probably because TV announcers are always talking about how they hate the prevent.”",7.0,nfl,t3_103b861,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers,2023-01-04T13:08:44Z,greenbaypackers,-0.0448155722257704
