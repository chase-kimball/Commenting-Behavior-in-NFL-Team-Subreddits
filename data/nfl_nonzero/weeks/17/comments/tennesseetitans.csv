My take away is that players show up for practice, do the bare minimum, then don't put a single second into anything outside of the practice facility.

1867,18513,18513,Bieber_hole_69,"Henry and Tannehill's contracts are done after 2023. They can keep them both next year and not be in cap hell for 2024.

They're not even that much in cap hell next year. After making the expected cuts that won't make the team much worse, (Lewan, Dupree, Cunningham, Bullock, Woods, Jamarco Jones,) they'll have over $31M in cap space free for next year. Extending Simmons will get them even more as his cap hit gets spread out into the future. Before any extensions we'll probably be right around top half of the league in cap space for next year. 2022 was our real cap hell year.

Cutting RT and Henry doesn't free up any of the dead money in prorated bonuses and void years, we're stuck with those regardless it's just a matter if you want to take them all in 2023 or spread them out. If we did cut both of them we'd have right around $55M in cap space for 2023, but then the issue is using that $25M freed up by cutting them to find replacements, and I don't know that you can find any at that number that won't make the team worse.

Unless you want to tank, there's not a lot of upside in getting rid of them as I don't anticipate the return for RT or Henry in a trade to be all that significant. And if you tank in 2023 without both of them, then your cap situation for 2024 is not all that different than if you had kept them, it frees up like $15M in additional money for 2024, and that's when the first really big spike in cap space for the new media rights deal is expected to hit so that's probably just a drop in the bucket of what the league-wide cap spike will be.

The extensions for Henry and Tannehill in 2020 were made with the intent of this window being closed after next season and both being gone for 2024 with the band-aid totally ripped off.

I don't see any situations on that list that are comparable to a 34/35-year-old Ryan Tannehill who has one more year left of a contract that only has one remaining year on it with a $36M cap hit and two more void years after that. It's a pipe dream to me to think anyone is giving up a first rounder for that. Are the Raiders going to get a first rounder for Derek Carr? Probably not, so why is there reason to think anyone is giving up a first for Tannehill?

Wentz was younger than 30 when the Colts gave up a conditional first to get him and was 3 seasons removed from looking like an MVP caliber talent on a 13-3 team and still played a lot of good games in the two years after that. Wentz at his peak in 2017 looked like a better player than Tannehill ever has, and the promise of his former OC bringing him back to that level after one disastrous season in 2020 made the Colts think that it would be worth giving up a 1st for him, and even then they still hedged it with a playing time condition. Wentz was a much more valuable asset than Tannehill is now, and that situation in particular with Reich vouching for Wentz was very specific. It would be like Arthur Smith trading for Tannehill if they desperately needed a QB to win now in Atlanta, it just makes sense for that specific team and makes them willing to give up more than other teams would because of the potential.

Stafford, while having played for three more seasons in the NFL than Tannehill, is still just a few months older than him. Stafford had just turned 33 when the Rams traded for him, whereas Tannehill would be 35 when he first suits up for any team that trades for him and has more of an injury history than Stafford did at that time. They're also not even in the same league as players, I love Tannehill, but c'mon Stafford is just a different level of QB at the level he's preformed over his career. Tannehill at his best in Nashville has been an efficient QB playing off a dominant running game and requires play-action to really scare any defense with his passing ability. Stafford is a legit QB that can drop back 40 times and can have an entire offense designed around his arm. They play the position in completely different ways and the value Stafford has over Tannehill makes that clear. Tannehill is more comparable to Goff in LA than he is to Stafford in LA, he doesn't unlock the passing element of that Shannahan West Coast scheme any more than Goff did. He works really well within the confines of that offense and specific scheming, but when it comes down to it if you need a QB that can just open up the offense with arm talent and improvisation, Tannehill doesn't have it.

Bradford's trade came in a really weird spot where the Vikings believed they were a team built to win now and Bridgewater's knee exploded like a week before the season started. It's rare to ever find a team that desperate to get a starting caliber QB. Bradford is also less than a year older than Tannehill and was 28 at the time the Vikings traded for him. The book on Bradford was that he was a legit QB that could put it together if he could just stay healthy. Obviously we know now that he couldn't stay healthy, but still a 28-year-old proven starter at QB is a very valuable asset, and the Vikings were a team with 0 leverage and desperate need. The Vikings also got Bradford from the Eagles for a $7M salary in 2016 and with another year on his contract at $18M total salary, they were able to get him at a decent price and then bail on him or extend him after having him in the building for two years. Whatever team that would give up a first for Tannehill would almost certainly have to extend him immediately. If they're giving up a first for a guy, they're not just going to let him walk in 2024, so they're stuck with him deep into his mid-to-late 30's and will probably have to pay him $25M+ per year if he agrees to take a pay cut.

When the Chiefs traded for Alex Smith, once again it was a QB under the age of 30, (Smith was 29 in the 2013 season,) and was a guy the Chiefs could plan their future rebuild around. Hard to compare those trades at that point because the Chiefs thought they could get at a minimum 5 years out of Smith as their starting QB and maybe more. Who is betting on Tannehill being their starter beyond even 2024? Any team that's trading for him has a clear win-now window if they want to compete with him and they've got a year or two to do it.

To me the most comparable trade we might be able to do for Tannehill is what the Chiefs got when they traded Alex Smith to the Washington [Redacted] in 2018. A mid-tier starter and a 3rd round pick. Tannehill is basically the same age as Smith was at that time, and although he's played worse than Smith did in 2016 and 2017 the last two years statistically, I think Tannehill showed enough that he could be seen around the same tier of QB as Smith was in 2018. Any team trading for Tannehill will also have to immediately sign him to a new extension like Washington did with Smith (four-years for $94M, a Tannehill extension would probably be more like three-years for $85M-$90M based on current QB contracts as I would assume Tannehill wants similar yearly money as Cousins got with his extension in 2022,) unless they value the flexibility of being able to get out of his contract with few issues in 2024. He's a bridge QB that you can get *maybe* another two years of high-level QB play out of. After that you better hope you have a plan for the future and you can groom somebody under him or let him be a veteran backup.

To maybe sweeten the deal for two thirds instead of a third and a player or maybe even a second for a Tannehill and a later round swap we may have to eat some of his money for 2023. But I think to a certain point, unless you're trying to tank in 2023 what's the point of eating all that money instead of just keeping Tannehill for another year? Unless they plan on drafting a first round QB in April, who's gonna start for us in 2023 that won't tie us down to an aging QB at a comparable skill level to Tannehill? I just don't get the benefit of giving up assets to get a guy like Carr and paying him similar money instead of just keeping Tannehill in the first place and seeing what's out there in 2024 instead.

Now if they want to tank, fine then. Trade Tannehill for whatever assets you can get and play Dobbs or sign Trubisky to be tank commander so we can get Caleb Williams or whoever in 2024. There's no need to replace Tannehill if you want to suck.

Vrabel doesn't strike me as the tanking type though, I think if he gets rid of Tannehill he's going to want to replace him with someone else that can win games. I just don't get the Derrick Carr thing though, he's not that much better and costs similar money and you're stuck with him. Trading for a younger QB I get, like a Jordan Love, and you'll need to get Tannehill out of the way to play him. Even Jimmy G to an extent, I get, but I just don't think the value is there to give up whatever you need to give up for Jimmy instead of just sticking with Tannehill for one more year.",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10382zu,False,0.0,11,2023-01-04T14:00:08Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0077019670564621

Designating a guy to return opens up a 21-day window in which they can practice but do not have to be on the active roster. If they are not activated by the end of that window then they are reverted back to IR and are ineligible to return for the rest of the season.

They don't have to activate Long until Friday, (Saturday game this week, normally it is Saturday for Sunday games,) but it seems highly unlikely they would be activating him to play without at least a few days of practice since he's missed basically a month at this point. With one week left of the regular season, there's no point in saving the activation and the window to return ends around conference championship week, so there's no reason for them to not have designated Long to return if they have any inkling that he could be ready for Saturday.

Long is a vet that the staff has confidence in so maybe they have faith in him to be ready for Saturday on just a day or two of practice, but I just see no way he can play Saturday without being at practice by Thursday at the latest.

It‚Äôs pretty rare that top 100 picks end up not getting another shot somewhere after they get cut, normally there is off the field stuff in those cases. Day one and two picks of a high draft pedigree, they‚Äôre the picks you bank on to be contributors.

And I don‚Äôt mean it in being weird that the Titans would cut him, what I‚Äôm saying is that if they cut him somebody else is going to claim him before we could get a chance to keep him on the PS squad.

In a comparable situation, Kellen Mond was cut by the Vikings in August and got claimed by the Browns. He‚Äôs stuck in Cleveland ever since on the active roster, and if the Browns cut him he‚Äôd 100% get claimed again. QBs with the talent to get drafted that high are going to get way more shots than their play would deserve just because they‚Äôre so rare and everybody is looking for two of them.

Assuming Tannehill is back for 2023, if you want Dobbs as the backup the options are to either keep three QBs on the active roster all season or give up on Willis after one year. I guess the best option in that case clearly is to keep 3 QBs, but how often has Vrabel kept 3 QBs in his time here? It can't have been for more than a week or two at a time because of injury.

1876,18524,18524,Bieber_hole_69,"Copy/pasted from the other thread on this question, but:

We have two decent playmakers on this team in Burks and Chig that need to get the ball in their hands for us to have a chance at winning as just giving Henry the ball 45 times probably isn't going to cut it.

Chig had as many receptions last night as he did in all 3 of Willis' starts and Burks had a 300% increase in targets compared to last week. You can't get the other rookies experience if you can't throw the ball with Willis under center.

Dobbs can at least competently execute an NFL playbook and get the ball out of his hands in less than 3.5 seconds in order to facilitate an attempt at having a passing game.

The o-line sucks, but no offense without the Eagles o-line is going to survive a QB that holds the ball for 3.46 seconds on each dropback like Willis did last week, it's a recipe for sacks regardless of how shitty the line is.

The game is way too fast for Willis, he can't read the defense in enough time to confidently place the ball, so he runs around to by himself more time and get where he's comfortable outside of the pocket, but that just leads to sacks and holding penalties. Dobbs got sacked half as many times last night as Willis did last week against a much better pass rush because he didn't hold the ball for an eternity.

Willis has never been sacked less than 3 times in a start. almost 17% of his goddamn pass attempts in his three starts end in a sack. Yeah, the o-line sucks and that's a reason for some of them, but that also means the QB needs to adjust and get the ball out of their hands at even a moderate pace.

Would you throw the ball much when 1 out of every 6 dropbacks results in a loss of 5-8 yards? Of course not, so Downing, (not saying he's a good OC or anything, but his hands are kinda tied with the Willis situation,) has to throw out probably over half of the playbook so we're left with a triple option offense that doesn't cut block and doesn't pitch. We have to call dumb shit like end-arounds and reverses just to get the ball in the hands of our outside playmakers so Henry isn't just plowing ahead for 2 yards every play against 10-man boxes. We're getting behind the sticks on all these negative plays and then forcing Willis into playing a bunch of 3rd & Forevers that he's not comfortable in.

No credit to Downing because he deserves none, but it makes all the 1st & 10 runs a bit more understandable when there's a 58% chance any pass is going to be an incompletion, sack, or interception. Almost 6 out of every 10 passing plays during Willis' starts result in a negative play or incompletion, (Not accounting for positive scrambles here because I don't have the time to count them to include, so maybe the number is closer to 5 out of every 10, but it's still half of them.) so passing on first down gives you a coin flip chance of being in 2nd and long, i.e. fucked and preparing to punt. You've got an equal chance of getting to 2nd and 2 as you do to being in 2nd and 15 when passing on first down with this offense. Even with Andy Dalton, another awful QB, it's still more like a 45% chance a pass is a negative play with his 66% cmp per and 18 sacks taken with a higher upside.

The offense is simply broken when Willis is at QB. Maybe he can turn it around some day or maybe he can's, that's beside the point because at the present moment we're doomed to the worst offense in the league with Willis at QB for certain. Dobbs is limited, but he can at least process the game at an NFL level and do what needs to be done to bring our offense up to a bottom 5 unit rather than a bottom 1 unit. It's pretty similar to how it was with Mariota and switching to Tannehill in 2019, but with much lower of a ceiling. An offense is always just broken when the QB can't process or execute it.

Coaches see these guys in practice pretty much daily for months, they know if they're worth continuing to play more than we do from seeing them once a week for 17 weeks.

The coaching staff saw Dobbs for less than 10 days and thought he might give the team a better shot to win than Willis who they've watched since May, and they were correct.

There's nothing that Willis has shown this year to justify sticking with him in the future, other than that he's better than he was in camp/pre-season, but even then that's not very much. Does that disqualify him from ever being a franchise QB? No, but it also doesn't make it seem likely as it's pretty rare for any QB to make the extreme leap that Willis would require to be a starting caliber QB in the NFL, and he'll already be 24 at the start of next season which is older or the same age as Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields, Bailey Zappe, Brock Purdy, and Desmond Ridder, who have all shown more as NFL QBs than Willis.

The issue is also just that there haven't even been many flashes that make you say, ""Wow this guy could be the real deal,"" that give confidence to taking a chance on him in the future. The coaching staff felt more confident in Josh Dobbs coming in off the street to throw the ball than they did with Willis after a whole season and off-season, that's definitely pretty concerning.

That doesn't mean he is blameless at all, but the Titans have quite literally done next to nothing to make the offense easier for Willis outside of telling him to hand the ball off to Henry against stacked boxes so he will have to throw in obvious 3rd and longs (though they did it for Dobbs).",6.0,tennesseetitans,t3_zz2sut,False,0.0,:RanCarthon:,2022-12-30T15:24:04Z,tennesseetitans,0.138457728

The idea of tanking to get a ‚Äúgenerational‚Äù qb who may not even be one is dumb.

Going through the teams and their weaknesses.

Bills: even though we got destroyed week 2. The bills have shown some weakness is there late game drives on both offense and defense. They also can be flustered to commit turnovers.

Chiefs: we lost 20-17 in OT with Malik Willis. They almost lost to the Texans in OT. The chiefs are very beatable by any team. There defense is eh at best.

Bengals: Defense is eh. Although they held Henry and Chubb in run game do you really think they hold Henry with a halfway decent line. They also can be scored on. 

Chargers: we lost 17-14 and the chargers were basically at full strength. They had all their offense of weapons back and still could only put up 17 and we had an injured qb trying to win that game for us.

Yes all these teams have generational qbs but to act like this team won‚Äôt topple them for that exact reason is dumb. We have a top 5 coach (in my opinion and many others). We have great defense with missing maybe one player and our scheming is great. We have a once in a lifetime running back and a qb who really gives it his all and doesn‚Äôt quit and almost took us to a Super Bowl.

> Can You Use an AED on Someone with a Stopped Heart?

> The short answer to this is no. An AED can only be used on someone with a rapid heart rate. You cannot use it on victims with an extremely slow heart rhythm or those whose heart stops beating. 

> When the user puts the pads or electrodes on the victim‚Äôs chest, the AED determines whether the victim‚Äôs heart needs an electric shock or not. The defibrillation device instructs and guides the user on the next steps in the process. Many of the advanced models talk to the user to give clear instructions and automatically deliver the electric shock if it is necessary. 

> Can You Use an AED on Someone with a Stopped Heart

We still have played off coverage a ton. In fact, a lot of really good defenses play off coverage because you can keep the play in front of you and attack for minimal gains each play if the players have any football IQ at all. 

Problem is we were playing with 1 CB on the team and he wasn't bad but was failed by his counterparts. Kevin Byard dealt with a lot of the same.

31413,168913,168913,WhiteXHysteria,"Don't get me wrong, if I am  taking  a QB I prefer the 2024 options. 

But if the scouts and new GM step in and say X 2023 QB(who I know 0 about) is likely to be a Mahomes level QB with a year on the bench to get up to speed on the league then you can't just sit there and not go do whatever it takes to get him because you are afraid your team is bad. Good teams fail every year because they don't have a QB(broncos, Jets, colts the last few years, commanders this year, saints, falcons even). Very rarely do elite QBs fail to even be a contender because they elevate the players around them.

If the chiefs/bills/bengals called and said they'd trade us Mahomes/Allen/Burrow right now and we would only have to pay him 7-10m a year for the next 4 years and we would only have to give up a couple of firsts and seconds no one would say no. Around 28 other teams would jump at it, maybe even all 32 teams would, because that level of play at that cost lets you fill the other holes in FA until their 3rd year when you are back to full picks anyway.

However, saying we were gonna suck week 1 was in no way being some soothsayer. We were plenty good for months, and slowly getting better even, until the injury bug just got too big to overcome starting with the chiefs game where we took them to overtime with malik fucking willis and no Burks. 

Things didn't actually get bad until Burks got knocked out of the eagles  game and then hilliard got hurt the next game and Tannehill got reinjured and our already patchwork line lost 5 out of 5 starters and multiple backups.

The fact is we are able to compete with these teams that obviously have more talent than us. We do so often and to a point where all we need is 1 play for it to be our game. 

If we don't throw 3 picks we beat the bengals in 1. If Big jeff learns to wrap up when tackling or weaver learns to keep contain we beat the chiefs. Don't take a 9 yard sack on 3rd down in fg territory against the chargers. We play with a small margin of error but we force other teams to do so as well usually.

When you are in a best of 1 and all you need is one break to go your way anything can happen. A well timed pass breakup. A broken run by henry, chig, or burks. A defensive score. Things that could happen at any moment. We saw similar happen against a great broncos defense when NWI's corner fell down and he got a huge TD. 

You ultimately asked if a patch up could get us over that hump and considering with all of our injuries we have been right there with those teams, I think if we sign a WR and bring in a run of the mill LT and LG that puts us in an even better spot to get over that hump.

31458,168963,168963,WhiteXHysteria,"I have said it 100 times. 

If we cut tannehill to save money for the future then we have to commit to the rebuild. If you think Tanny can't win us a super bowl then no QB that is available can. 

If we are for sure not winning a super bowl this year or next then we need to assess who is actually part of the plan to win one in 2024 or 2025. Anyone who isn't needs to either turn into cap space or draft capital. 

That means Tannehill, Byard(expensive and will be 31 in 2024), Henry, Lewan, Woods, Cunningham, Autry, Bud, Ben Jones, and probably others all have to be gone this offseason so they are fully off the books by 2024 opening up as much cap or draft capital as possible for when we expect to try to make another real run. You get any draft capital at all if a team will take the contract or you cut them outright. 

Keeping players just to appease the fans or because they are fan favorites and wasting millions of cap space that could be rolled over is a  quick way to find the team right back in the mediocre teams space.

45129,259560,259560,numbersix1979,"The biggest advantage toward ensuring a top ten draft pick would be to draft a QB, which I do not think we plan to do nor do I think it would be wise to do. The benefits of having that higher draft pick, with QB drafting taken out, is substantially lower than the possibility of things breaking our way in the playoffs.

Granted, the team fucking sucks right now. We are objectively worse than many teams, especially the ones we would face in the playoffs. But still, a chance is a chance, and it‚Äôs a significant one. Every year Tom Brady has been in Tampa, he‚Äôs had a period during the season where he looked awful and his team has been a laughingstock and every year he‚Äôs gone to the playoffs and had those same people laughing at him state they expect him to win it all. Green Bay and Pittsburgh both looked like jokes at mid season and both had quarterbacks playing atrocious ball, yet both could still get in. Seattle could get in and they were universally expected to be a bottom two team to start the year. Trent Dilfer won a Super Bowl. Weird, flukey shit happens. People get hurt (God forbid, but it happens) and other people dig deep into themselves to find their potential.

That‚Äôs why we cannot adopt this fucking pathetic loser mentality of tanking when there‚Äôs a chance we get in. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. You could spend years horse trading to try to get a perfect team together to make a push and still fall apart come playoff time. There are no guarantees except that getting into the playoffs gets you a shot at the ring.

Additionally, I want the players to win. You think KB and Henry are thinking about next year? They want to win and they deserve it, they and others have worked too hard, sweat too much, suffered too much pain to give up whatever remote chance there is to win now for a worthless ‚Äúmaybe next year.‚Äù

Finally: because fuck the Jags. Fuck them, fuck the bandwaggoning fans who want them to beat us, fuck their incompetent ownership, fuck them ruining the WR market. They had an easier schedule and an irate Old Testament God isn‚Äôt festooning them with injuries likes us. We deserve to win and they don‚Äôt.
