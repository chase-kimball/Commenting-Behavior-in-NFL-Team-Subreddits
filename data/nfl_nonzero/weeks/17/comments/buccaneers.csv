It has cursed their QB's since day one... yeah, Fiedler was hot garbage, but the curse made him worse.  Tannenhill showed he was pretty damn decent in TN, and now Tua is gonna die if he  doesn't leave.   The solution, Dan Marino needs to be their next QB.   Don Shula's ghost will coach those games and those curses  will be lifted.   Yeah, there's still the whole  burial ground thing, which may or may not be really true, but 2 out of 3 ain't bad.

Which just isn't feasible, it's honestly better to make it a tie/no contest or whatever than going that route.   The only real option would be to push the playoffs 1 week, which has an impact, but not nearly as much as moving 16 games, because a) it is fewer games and people impacted, and b) some of the participants/locations are still undetermined.   Honestly, I'd like to see them finish this game in week 19.   Unfortunately the teams that probably benefit least from this are the Bills and Bengals, at least within the playoffs. But as we have #1 seed implications here, it probably should be played out, unless both teams and the league can come to an agreement prior to this weekend.  

That sounds totally callous, but the reality is that things keep moving regardless of one event.

When is this stat from?

Tonight? After the games?

Ridiculous, 538 one more time outdo themselves with some moronic stat/prediction.

As a special highlight, half a year ago:

https://awfulannouncing.com/online-outlets/fivethirtyeights-warriors-prediction-is-already-horrible.html

538 projected that the Golden State Warriors would go 36-46, finish with the eighth-worst record in the NBA, miss both the playoffs and the play-in tournament, and have only a 0.4% chance to make the Finals and 0.1% chance to win the Finals.

""Oh well ya know...""

GSW made the finals. They played really well all playoffs. They faced the Celtics in the finals.

When a team that plays well, has historically great players and is a well run franchise...SURELY, you'd say ""Oh it's the finals, everyone can win, it's a 50-50 game, maybe 40-60 or so...hell maybe 30-70 cause I am biased"", right??

Many people online thought Warriors were favorites and gave them the edge.

....538 gave the Warriors a 17% chance at winning the Final series against the Celtics.

Warriors won the series 4-2.

They won the c'ship after starting the season with a 0.1% at winning the title.

538 are terrible, it takes skill (and...money and connections and other stuff, i guess) to be this bad at something and still be considered an expert or something that is worthy to hear.

27197,166481,166481,idaho22,"At the end of the day.. the fact he is still repping the Bucs this hard makes me fall back in love with him somewhat so I shouldn't have used the word hate. I met him in person with Josh Freeman and thought he was cool so I shouldn't say I hate him. It just left a bad taste in my mouth. He was a nice guy.

But let me get to the meat here and my reasoning that I think he left on bad terms with us.

I'll never get over him commenting to his team on beating the hell out of us on the other side of the ball like they've done for years. It felt like an ex-gf just talking shit to rub in bad feelings for jealousy. It felt immature and he was 30 at the time.

Overall, I don't enjoy the revisionist history in this thread. Suh signed for LESS than what we offered Gmac. He was owed $13m or $14m if I remember correctly and he signed for $10m to the Panthers. We had been trying to get him to restructure the entire season and he was sitting around on the bench laughing with players as we were getting blown out. It reminded me of Fournette and Jalen Ramsey at the end there with Jacksonville.

So instead of restructuring with us on a team friendly contract like Mike Evans has done time and time again.. he then signed for LESS to the Panthers than what WE offered him or the Ravens offered him. This was at least what was reported that we offered him $11m. Even if we MATCHED the Panthers.. why did he leave? He screwed himself out of a ring. He would have played well in the role we offered to Suh.

Further, at the end.. I thought he was lazy, took off plays, and instilled a bad culture for the Bucs at the end there. So maybe I have hindsight bias on his last few years there. Because he did have 5 good seasons for us.

With that said, I think Gmac is the most overrated Buc ever in looking back on it all after so many years. Two of the years he made the pro bowl I'm not sure he deserved it. He had three ELITE seasons. Two GREAT seasons. His last two seasons with us.. he wasn't near pro bowl material and was in a constant pissing match with Jameis on who the leader of the team was.

Sometimes it's not how you start but how you finish. And his finish with us in that one off-season left a bad taste in my mouth.",1.0,buccaneers,t3_zxc3yk,False,0.0,:atlantasucks: atlanta sucks ,2022-12-30T11:05:55Z,buccaneers,-0.0187154846320852
