But you *also* can't discount that these social media platforms are not in it to be an extension of our social circles, not fundamentally- no matter what their goals at the outset were, ultimately their goal at this stage of existence is to make money, and to do that they have to sell ads, and to sell ads they have to have *engagement*.

Functionally, Reddit and Twitter (and umpteen other social media platforms) are different in how they manifest that goal, but at the root they all aim for the same ends- capture as many eyeballs as possible for as long as possible to sell enough ads or platform-specific credits to profit as much as possible.

And so in pursuit of those goals, they design systems in a way to keep people engaged as much and as long as possible, as interactions are a raw statistic that they can use to drive ad spend. 

So while many of us have been expressing our natural human instinct to watch, learn, share, and grieve, there is at the same time a non-natural drive to engage and interact with content about this tragedy forwarded by the algorithmic design of these social media platforms that is ultimately hypernatural- it preys upon our social instincts and leads to engagement beyond the point that is healthy by employing ""dark patterns"" that keep users of the sites engaged longer than they would under 'neutral' circumstances.

Than man who was walking through the door causing it to open quickly ran over to see if I was okay and to apologize to me and my dad. Him and my dad chatted for a couple minutes and the man left.

Right after he left my dad got down on one knee and said ""buddy, do you know who that was?!"" I said no, and he exclaimed excitedly ""That was Tom Coughlin, the head coach of the Jaguars!"" He then had to explain what that meant😅.

I was probably going to be a Jags fan growing up anyway, but once that happened it kicked my Jags fandom into 1st gear. I started watching games as a kid so I could see that guy I met at the stadium on TV. Before you knew it I was yelling 'Thunder and Lightning', going to games/tailgating as a kid and telling people all about my favorite player, Fred Taylor.

Hope y'all enjoyed my story. GO JAGS, FTT, DUUUUUVAAAAL!

Edit: Tom gets a lot of hate, deservedly so, but the man was the best head coach we ever had, even now, until Doug gets us a couple winning seasons/playoff runs. He was a dick and screwed us up when we brought him back, but the man was nice to me and my dad anecdotally, kicked off my fandom personally, and brought us the most exciting jags football over multiple years consecutively.

You might want to get a hotel by the river on the south bank. Or consider an air bnb in the riverside/Avondale area. Murray Hill is the buffer between riverside and the slums. East of US 17. That is a historic neighborhood and mostly old family areas with plenty of parks. Other people will point you towards the beaches, but I figure since this is in reference to the jags, you'll want to see the game. Riverside is local to the stadium. 

Take the family to MOSH while you are in town, and hit the cummer art gallery too. There is a garden there that the kiddo can enjoy if they aren't old enough for the art yet. There are plenty of good restaurants in the five points area.
