Saying that, even if the Bills lose there is still a path to the #1 Seed, albeit an unrealistic one. There is also a very realistic scenario where the Bills lose this week and still get the #2 seed (Ravens win out).

26776,189578,189578,UberHansen,"Burrow typically takes more Sacks than other Quarterbacks in comparison to his Pressure Rate. This season he's at a 6.5% Sack Rate with a 17.0% Pressure Rate. Last season he was at an 8.9% Sack Rate with a 24.5% Pressure Rate. I tend to attribute Sack Rate to the Quarterback and Pressure Rate to the OL so in the Bengals case both have improved.

Using both of those numbers you can see a big difference between Burrow and Allen on how they deal with and escape pressure. Allen is pressured more, albeit marginally more, at 17.6% but he is sacked significantly less at 5.5%. Add to that that when Allen is sacked he loses on average 4.67 Yards and Burrow 6.31 Yards and you can see a big difference between the two.

My conclusion is this. In 2021 Joe Burrow was one of the worst Quarterbacks in the league when it came to taking sacks (Even if he said he does it on purpose). In 2022 Joe Burrow has become about average in regards to taking Sacks, which is a major boon for the Bengals. Meanwhile, Josh Allen has been and continues to be an abnormality at avoiding Sacks in the NFL.
