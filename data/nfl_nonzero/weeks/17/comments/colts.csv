2809,35302,35302,DaBlakMayne,">One developing rookie LT who the jury is still out on, and and one overpaid liability at RT

Eh I disagree. Raimann has been pretty damn good lately. He's been going up against top pass rushers and has started being able to hold his own. I think he's the starting LT going forward. Smith had a rough beginning of the season but has since bounced back for the most part. 

>An unbelievably horrible QB situation

Yeah our QB situation is atrocious but hopefully it'll be on the mend soon with the upcoming draft. I think getting Young/Stroud/Levis will bring an air of hope that we haven't had since 2018. 

>Some decent pass rushers, but not a single difference maker

Yannick nearly had 10 sacks before he went on the IR but he's a little one dimensional. I think we should re-sign him though. Paye has been good but he's been hurt. Dayo has been decent as well. Wouldn't surprise me if we draft another EDGE in the upcoming draft. Having a lights out pass rusher is sort of rare. There are some good ones in the first round this year but we need a QB badly.

>An good aging corner and a young corner our DC refuses to play

Gilmore has gone off this year. I just hope he doesn't regress going into next year like Rhodes did from 2020 to 2021. I'm not entirely sure why Rodgers was behind Facyson after the first few weeks. I know he's hurt right now though. I expect a free agent pick up to add to the group and a late round CB draft pick 

>Our team is built around a left guard (whose play has fallen off a cliff), a weakside linebacker (who can't stay healthy), and a running back (the position with the shortest shelf life).

Yeah I'm not sure if Nelson or Leonard ever completely bounce back. Both have back issues. No way we trade Nelson but Leonard could be decent trade material. He shouldn't have tried to rush back but we also played well without him. We won't get a first round for him anymore but maybe a conditional 2nd round picks and some change. JT would be fine if we had a QB who could throw for more than 15 yards. Defenses know we're exposed so JT isn't as scary as he was during his rookie season. 

>We also have a GM who is clearly a failure, and who the owner apparently doesn't trust (since he forced an interim head coach on him), but who he also refuses to fire.

Hot take, Ballard is gonna stay for two more years to try and clean up the mess. Most GMs get two coaching regimes before the plug is pulled. Getting a new GM means full rebuild and completely different schemes and cultures for both offense and defense potentially. Irsay is going to hold off on doing that for now. Ballard is good at talent scouting and drafting but he's horrible at the free agency and making a decision at QB. It's like he's so afraid of whiffing on a rookie QB that he's convinced himself that having a vet would always be better. That outlook has failed. We need a young QB to build around and I think his leash is going to be a lot shorter going forward. Bringing Saturday in to override him may have been a warning by basically getting another front office guy to assess the talent as a second opinion.

>Looking at our team from the outside, what top coach would choose the Colts over another team? 

I agree with you but I think there are some things to look forward to coming up with the roster. I also never thought Harbaugh would come here. I want Ken Dorsey or Demarco Ryans and I don't think it would be impossible.

I think Carson’s descent was a little more than just that one game against the Jaguars.

He had an entire season of questionable decisions that repeatedly happened in much the same way they had for the Eagles in the prior season, and worse - he did a shit job of taking accountability for those decisions. Whether or not we care about it now - I do think Irsay personally took issue with Carson being the poster boy of “respect my choice” in our locker room and then missing a game without having the elite performance that Leonard did to back it up.

You have to figure out if people have bias towards a certain QB so shit on the others. Or have a bias towards a certain college program and shit on others.

Others are people who think we need to fix other things besides QB first and will shit all over anything they can find negative about someone.

Hendon Hooker is the absolute most ready NFL QB, but the downside is he's 25 years old already so you get less out of the pick if you take him in top 10.

The rest aren't generational talents like that last couple times we had a pick this high and were looking for a QB, which I think this franchise is used to seeing. But those types of QB's come around every once in a while, so you might have to take a rough around the edges prospect and actually coach him up.

But the thing is....it's not a guarantee we have a pick this high next year. We could have a 10-15 pick next year and would have to give up even more to move up to try and get a QB next year.
