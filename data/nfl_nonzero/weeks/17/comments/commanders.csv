He’s coming back now to a pretty different offense that is in some areas better than what he started with so let’s just see what he does against Cleveland. This game could possibly make or break his career going forward so hopefully that pressure can spark some resemblance of what he used to be.

As for Heinicke, he’s not a franchise QB nor the future of this team. He doesn’t have a rocket of an arm and isn’t the most accurate. He’s had some decent games but would make costly mistakes at times. But one thing is for sure, he just won’t quit. He fights for every single yard on every single play especially during the last few minutes of the game when they need to score like we’ve seen him do this year. You can’t help but love the guy for it. The team, offense and defense, really does rally around him and they play with a chip on their shoulder when he’s behind center. Most likely because of his underdog story and wanting him to succeed. He’s selfless and a team player. This is, in my opinion, [one] of the reasons that Washington went from possibly having a top 5 draft pick to knocking on the door of a playoff berth. So credit to Heinicke for that.

38121,297877,297877,thehomiemoth,"I'm an ER physician in residency. Keep in mind this is some speculation, but here is my thought process. 

Intubating someone after a cardiac arrest is standard procedure. When you are intubated you need to be sedated, because having a breathing tube down your throat and a machine breathing for you is extremely uncomfortable. Then they will slowly wean down the sedation to allow you to wake up. In many cases they will also induce hypothermia for 24 hours following the injury to try to prevent damage to brain tissue

When we think about a cardiac arrest patient, everything really comes down to brain damage. Once we get pulses back, medicine is pretty damn good at keeping people's bodies functioning (especially someone young and at peak physical fitness). The issue is that many people suffer irreversible brain damage after being found down. The purpose of CPR is to keep the brain oxygenated (and your other organs as well, but the brain most importantly) until you can get the heart started again.

Outcomes for people who have had cardiac arrests outside the hospital are generally not very good. The exceptions are usually people who are otherwise pretty healthy, and people who get rapid high quality bystander CPR. I've seen patients in the ICU with absolutely no deficits after having a cardiac arrest because there were healthcare professionals with them at the time who immediately initiated CPR. Hamlin is at peak physical fitness and had rapid access to care, so he has some protective factors.

Immediately concerning for a sudden cardiac event.Blunt force trauma can cause the heart to stop, something called commotio cordis, which famously happened to Chris Pronger after taking a hard slapshot to the chest.But blunt trauma to the chest can cause far more serious things as well.I hope he's okay.

Hopefully commotio cordis. The fact that they got ROSC so quickly might indicate that. If it was something even worse like blunt aortic trauma I don't think he would have gotten up so quickly. Terrifying stuff.

&#x200B;

Edit\*\*

Just to clarify some terminology, commotio cordis is when blunt trauma to the chest causes an abnormal heart rhythm. Classically in medical school I learned about it as cases of a baseball player getting hit in the chest with the ball, usually if they have some underlying arrhythmia. Although this causes the heart to stop beating, it has a reversible cause (abnormal rhythm) that can be fixed with electricity. So if they got return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) back quickly, then it may have been this. This would generally have a much better prognosis, if he got CPR quickly enough to prevent brain damage.

The other big thing I'd be worried about is blunt trauma to the aorta, the biggest blood vessel in the body. But that would cause massive bleeding which would not be reversible with CPR/electricity and is almost always fatal. So the fact that they got pulses back makes me think its unlikely to be that. There are other causes as well, but these are the first two that jump to mind.",130.0,nfl,t3_101uzj8,True,0.0,:Commanders: Commanders,2023-01-02T20:13:29Z,commanders,0.0091679241559398

Any other team in the league sells that game out. 

This isn't blaming the fans either - it's just a manifestation of the stasis that Snyder has the team in that he can't sell out what's now a 65k stadium for the most meaningful game the franchise has had, that fans could attend, in ~7 years.

This is 7-9 record shit we've been doing since 2015 is the absolute worst place to be in too. Win enough just to never pick top 10 but not enough to make post season.
