This is true. But this chart is showing **cumulative win probability** **added (WPA)**, or the difference between a team's win probability before and after the play. Negative numbers for WPA mean the team is less likely to win after the play.

>each game should contribute a net of +0 or +1 to the running total

A win would contribute +0.5 to the metric *if* each team had a 50% chance to win entering the game. Since one team is usually favored entering the game (home field advantage being the largest contributor to this), this usually isn't the case. For example, a home team with a 55% chance to win would gain a maximum of 0.45 wins from the game (if they won).

Joe Buck and Troy Aikman. Cris Collinsworth and Mike Tirico.

Joe and Troy always take the side of the referees and are painfully one sided in that regard. Their commentary is bumbling and provides no depth to what’s actually happening. When they get bored they delve into the realm of pure speculation. Their analysis of what’s happening is oftentimes demeaning or just repeating the mainstream medias talking points. They provide no real insight into a game and actually make it harder to watch. I’m just thankful the manning cast is there some games so I don’t have to listen to those two. 

Mike and Cris are much like Joe and Troy; Tirico is the best out of all of them and that’s not really saying much. Cris is fun when he just gets excited and comments on the game like big catches or turnovers, but a lot of times his comments are just really stupid. His comments on things like playcalling or situational gameplay make it seem like he’s just making things up. Tirico from time to time says awkward things and then Cris will come back and say something even more awkward.  They also have the problem of constantly believing the referees and not questioning the obviously bad calls they make. 

My big takeaway is that we deserve better for the so-called “Big Games”. Monday night football used to be a massive deal, same with Sunday night. Now I find myself looking more towards Thursday night games because there won’t be blatant lies or speculation, it won’t be unfair towards the players, and there will be actual knowledgeable interpretations of the game itself.
