Hondo, the Raiders' most reliable source, said that moving on from Carr was primarily JMD/Ziegler's decision. Davis had been 'lukewarm' on Carr for awhile, so he didn't object. It's a perfectly sensible decision to make, considering he's due $40m next season and they have an opportunity to get out of his contract with little to no penalty. The way it's been handled, paired with the fact that we have McDaniels leading the team, is where all the outrage stems from.

Vic has already walked back on his report since Hondo released his small piece on it.

The source additionally told me Monday morning: ""There is wavering on Derek, and certainly this team's issues are not all, nor even close to all on Derek. But, his contract is massive, and while others won't return in 2023, you can't expose that much of your salary cap to chance."" *this just let's you know why it happened. And when you realize that McDaniels and Co. didn't lose the locker room with the decision it means that everyone involved understands thst at the end of the day, it just didn't work out*

AND

Another big factor that multiple NFL and team officials (not associated with the Raiders) have made is this: ""No NFL team can have as many NFL Draft misses as the Raiders and have any sustained success. That defense is terrible, there are too many holes to mention, but those draft disasters aren’t on Ziegler or McDaniels. That has to account for something, and no doubt Davis has been well informed on that.”

This one ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️

That's the one. NO NFL team. Not one. NO team can have as many draft misses and have sustained success. Derek has been playing against a stacked deck. And so have the other stars on this team. Don't worry, there's really only two outside of Adams who just got here. (It's jacobs and Crosby). Now that the team can get fixed, Derek and his cost is more of a liability than an asset.

Stidham spread the ball around. Carr has been locking onto one dude for stretches at a time all year.

Stidham ran the ball AND Josh called some designed bootlegs that Carr just can't run 

Stidham made FAST decisions with the ball whereas Carr seemed to be really bouncy on his toes all season AND then has thrown into a lot of double or triple coverages instead of to WIDE open guys. 

Those things, coupled with that *look* that the team just seemed juiced and loose with Stidham as opposed to everyone seeming tight when Carr played this season.( this loose vs tight isn't my eye seeing it, this was Lincoln Kennedy on the radio broadcast). Yes, when Sanchez's dumbass was announcing the game, I muted it to listen to Raider Nation Radio as I watched.

Edit: also, look at the score. 34 points against the #1 defense in the league with a hostile crowd. While Carr has 4 games of 30+ this year, he also has the following points totals this year: 10, 16, 0, and 19. That's 4 games under 20 points. Three games under 16 points. With this offense.

I believe if that had happened it would have been a much different scenario as we sit here today. Harbaugh is a tough coach, like Gruden. A champion doesn’t 100% of the time need that, but IMO football is still a man’s game, a tough man’s game.

Why/how would Rodgers possibly be available? Being here in the Bay Area I would take Jimmy G, he’s serviceable, but he’s really the same thing as Carr, maybe not quite as good. This is a tough spot. On the one hand I know Carr is an above average QB that’s been on mostly shitty teams his whole career. But he’s such a likable, actually good person, in the context of compared to many pro athletes, and he actually loves this franchise it’s very tough emotionally to see him go out like this. On the other, as a fan of the team, if MD is really sticking with Mickey D and Zeigs, it makes sense to let them do their jobs. We aren’t going anywhere with out a defense and better more consistent drafting. Now, I firmly believe, coaching, particularly in the NFL, is of extreme importance. So, have our rosters been that horrible and drafting that horrible over the years? Or have our FO and coaching just been cluster fucks and not maximized our rosters/draft classes? IMO what really sucks is that Gruden was just starting to have this team ready for that leap to consistently be contenders, it was the remnants of Gru’s team/system that made the playoffs last year, and his firing, which I personally think was total fucken pussy ass woke cunt bullshit was just another event in the pain of being a fan of this franchise.

Tom Brady or Rodgers makes this offense a championship caliber offense  with Adams/Waller/Renfrow/Jacobs.

Seriously when is our DB situation going to be fixed. I feel like that’s what is holding this team back. We never get any interceptions, or timely stop when we need them late in games due to our horrendous coverage. The only player who did anything worth a damn was 31 year old Harmon.


Hobbs has played okay this year definitely struggled due to his injury.

Moerhig completely regressed this year mostly due to the scheme.

Ya-Sin was completely average didn’t make any flashy plays at all but also wasn’t a liability. He’s also scheduled to be a free agent so I don’t know if the team will re-sign him unless it’s on team friendly deal.

So the  only two players that we have that will most likely be brought back are Hobbs/Moerhig since they are under contract. I’m sure we might draft a corner in the first couple rounds but every time we draft a cornerback early he turns out to be a bust no matter what regime it is.

Exactly!  


>The way I'm thinking about it is, let's just give him the benefit of the doubt and give him the lowest plausible lambda. Even given that, there is real risk of injury in each game and that's why I responded to you here as I did.

> I think the contract amount next year is large enough that the injury risk is not negligible. It would be negligible in the vast majority of cases, but not if almost $40M is on the line.



There are less tangible costs to making the move we did, in terms of trade value, team morale, league reputation and it's effect on other potential players, etc. Also only a career ending injury is likely to cost the true $40M.  For example, if there's an injury that triggers guarantees but will heal within a few months you're likely going to be able to trade him and the guarantees cost nothing.  But more to your point, that makes the $40M risk less likely but not 0.

25460,198475,198475,YourPM_me_name_sucks,"As much as we all like to point at one single thing because it makes it easier for us, football is an intricate and complicated sport.  It's almost never one thing.  A lot of what we're doing is not what the players do best.  It may have been what the Patriots' players did best, but not our players.  There's a philosophical debate about matching scheme to the players vs players to scheme.  I don't want to get into the debate of which is better, but the point is that for better or worse Josh is a believer in scheme supremacy.  This is typical for Pats coordinators, btw.  



For example, what routes do our receivers run best?  Now what routes are we running them this year?  Hunter became a legend for creating tons of separation via China routes last year.  This year he hasn't been doing them.  Sure, he's missed almost half the season, but he's still been here for 9 games. Adams is not a burner but he is good at change of direction.  GB used him for routes with a change of direction.  He's the king of comebacks, slants, etc.   But go routes?  GB only ran those if they needed him to keep a safety high for a play going to the other side of the field.



In Josh's offense the X receiver (Adams) runs a TON of go routes.  This year Adams has 10 long (25+ yard) TDs vs 12 in his entire 8 years in GB.  We're using him differently than GB because GB matches scheme to the player's strengths.  Don't get me wrong, Adams is a beast.  Adams running his worst route is still better than most receiver's running their best.  But regardless of whether it's wise or not this is the reality of a Josh McDaniels head coached team. 



Neither Carr, Hunter, nor Adams are ideally suited for Josh's offense.  (yes, I'm aware of Adams' raw numbers and I stand behind what I said) Honestly, if I was the GM and I wanted to keep Josh and his offense in place (spoiler: I don't) I would trade Hunter since he doesn't fit and move Adams to the slot. 




QB is a more difficult question. Would Carr have gotten better with another year?  Of course.  How much better, and would it have been enough?  Hard to say, and Josh's career likely depends on his QB play next season.



Josh knows that he won't get a mulligan every year and this is a results oriented business.  He has to have success next year or he'll likely never get another HC gig.  The scheme Josh learned from Belichick (and to a lesser extent, Weis) is a scheme that was specifically tailored for what Tom Brady does best.  Is there any QB Josh would rather tie his career to than Brady?  Of course not.  Looking at it logically, I don't think Josh gets rid of Carr without *knowing* that Brady will be here next year. As Gronk confirmed, Mark already had a secret deal with Brady to join but Gruden nixed it.  Brady is unhappy in TB and looking for a new landing spot.  Josh isn't going to risk his career on a maybe.  The only way he gets rid of Carr now is if he has a secret agreement with Brady.  Otherwise Carr was his best chance to be successful next year.




The good news is that Tom has the clout and the mindset to tell Josh that they need to make schematic changes that will suit their personnel better.  I would suspect that we'll see the return of Hunter's China routes as well as Adams running more slants and fewer go routes. ",4.0,raiders,t3_1036yw7,False,0.0,:projector:,2023-01-04T12:51:25Z,raiders,-0.0002101036130253

To answer your question though, no, that wasn't Carr's best offense.  A spread offense is better.  Gruden likes a very conservative offense due to complementary football.  He loves 3 yard runs because his ideal drive is a 15+ play TD.  Short, high % throws are his drug of choice.

29750,222440,222440,cloudedburst7,McD’s system is a plug-and-play system meaning any player should be able to come in and do their job. Rather than working to his players strengths he forces them to adjust to his system. It’s better to mold newer players into this system rather than vets hence his boy stidham seemingly understanding the system better than Carr because he was mentored by mcd from jump and came with him from the patriots. Why would he care about Jacob’s when In his eyes any running back can come and be just as effective? I’m assuming he had a say in declining Jacob’s fifth year option as well. This means unless they franchise tag Jacob’s he will be a FA and will likely follow the money to a better team as he should. If mcdaniels really values him perhaps they will tag him this off-season but based on recent circumstances it doesn’t seem likely. Another point is how he forced Carr out because Carr wasn’t able to adjust to his system given it’s his first year and it’s not an easy system to grasp quickly. He has absolutely no loyalty for a player that has been here a lot longer than he has and was quick to give him the boot. If that can happen to Carr it can happen to any Raider.,19.0,raiders,t3_10111lb,False,0.0,:Logo_95-Present:,2023-01-01T23:02:44Z,raiders,-0.0049127210951

44702,307568,307568,thegreyquincy,"Waller in 2020 and Jacobs this year are the only ones who could realistically be considered all-pros. 

The fact you put Cook and Crabtree on there when they've done fuck all since leaving say more about Carr's ability to elevate receivers than anything. 

Putting Marshawn Lynch 2 years off of retirement and Latavius Murray on there make it seem like you're just trying to fill out a list. They were fine backs but far from even pro bowl level when they were on the Raiders (aside from 1 year with Murray, which was the same year that Carr was a MVP candidate).

Also Waller was out a big chunk of the season last year and he and Renfrow have been out for most of this season. 

You say they've thrown a lot at the offense, but the fact remains that injuries have also derailed the offense quite a bit. Antonio Brown was supposed to be the #1 in 2019(?), but we all know what happened, so Tyrell Williams was his #1 until *he* got injured and Jared Cook was his #1 target. 

He had Ruggs last year who killed a person, so Renfrow and Zay Jones were his WRs. We had to sign Desean Jackson to round the corps out. 

Dude took a ""washed"" Nelson Agholor and got him paid. Has had WR1s like Brice Butler, Rod Streater, the corpse of Jordy Nelson, and Andre Holmes and still was able to win games (has the most 4th-quarter comebacks since he's been in the league). 

Has had 4 different HCs, 2 interim HCs, 6 different offensive schemes he's had to learn, gone through like 3 rebuilds, has had the worst defense of any stretch for a QB ever, and still gets shit on for being ""average.""",7.0,nfl,t3_zzln1o,False,0.0,:Raiders: Raiders :Raiders: Raiders,2022-12-31T13:35:51Z,raiders,-0.0613658259934371
