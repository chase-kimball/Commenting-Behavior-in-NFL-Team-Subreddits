Watson was a .064 (17th in league with 20+ plays). Which also seems about right. Pretty average game tbh.

That's a good place to start, however, if you are REALLY interested in it, Cleveland has a wealth of knowledge on the subject in their historical societies especially at Case. Also the Plain Dealer operated in that era, so they may have info on it in their microfilm archives.

Cleveland has a very rich history with the Mafia starting with prohibition because of its location to Canada. Rum running gave the mafia a foothold and they really never looked back. From Joe Lonardo in the aughts/20s all the way to the last great don John Scalish in the late 70s, Cleveland was shaped by the mafia (for good or bad (it got really ugly in the late 70s between the irish mob and italian mob with car bombs going off everywhere)).

 Even Vegas was built using Cleveland and Detroit mob money. Go to the mob museum in Vegas and you will see Cleveland names plastered all over it.

Anyway. If you are interested in the numbers game specifically, either contact Case, or you can talk to any old guy who grew up in Cleveland and they can tell you all about it.

Edit: Also, those papers werent the only ones running the numbers game. They were just 2 of many. In fact one of Micky McBride's first jobs was coordinating paperboys to sell the paper. He recruited boys that could fight using clubs, knives, and guns in order to hold their corner.

His closest associate was James Ragen, who was killed in the 1946 chicago gangland feud.

One thing I‚Äôd say is I think there were some questions regarding the WR room. They did have Claypool and DJ, but in terms of how Pickens would develop, that was still up in the air.

With Najee, I think people were over inflating his upside because usually in their second year, RBs have a slump. Not establishing the ground game can really harm your passing game, which, considering there were two new QBs, doesn‚Äôt help.

The defense looked good from what I remembered. The injury to Watt, however, seemed to put them in a slump.

Add in the addition of OBJ in the offseason, the signing of Kareem Hunt, Freddie and his high powered offense as our new head coach, and that season had more hype than any other.
