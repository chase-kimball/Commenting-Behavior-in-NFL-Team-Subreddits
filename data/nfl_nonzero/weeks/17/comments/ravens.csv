But he does a poor job enabling their success with his hires. The best OC we ever had was Kubiak and it would have been gross negligence to pass him up for the job. Everyone else has been a card-carrying member of the Harbaugh Family‚Ñ¢ (said mostly in jest).

Harbaugh's biggest weakness is also his biggest strength. He believes in guys. He believes that *his guys* at their best can go toe-to-toe with all the other guys. 

Sometimes, that makes guys rise to the occasion. Players with no business stepping up step up and play great. Look at Ben Powers having the best LG season in the NFL this year.

Look at how Pitt lined up all night. 8 in the box, stack it up, and dare us to run. And we did. Sure JK showcased why he's a premiere back with some slick runs, but the downhill running in the trenches was swallowed up by pure manpower. Defense just had more guys to block with, so they won. Heyward and Watt are beasts.

But GR could have risen to the occasion here, especially at halftime, and made some adjustments.

Look at what Andrews was doing to those poor CBs. It should be illegal. We could have targeted him off play action all game and just waltzed into the endzone. Instead Greg's ego got in the way and we kept running into their teeth expecting maybe this time we won't get chewed up.

In the trade market I'd like to see us aggressively target Tampa Bay. They are primed for a fresh rebuild with new coaches, figuring out their QB situation, etc. They're going to start planning for the next 5 years of the franchise soon, and shipping off Evans or Godwin (but not both) for some picks is a smart move from the FO. 

There's a world where we can trade a 2023 3rd and 2024 2nd for Evans or Godwin and suddenly we're in a very healthy place. Evans is the more likely candidate imo since he's going to be 30 this off-season.

Imagine Lamar throwing to Evans, Bateman, Duv and ""3rd round rookie wr prospect who plays mostly special teams."" With Andrews, Likely, and Oliver in the TE corps. That's a very deadly passing offense.

To me, if you want 50 million per year full guaranteed, you need to be able to carry an offense on your back to being top 5 and come through regularly in the playoffs. The only player in the league that almost fits that description is mahomes and if you take away andy reid, he probably wouldn‚Äôt. 

Lamar is an amazing QB that carries a bad offense to being good but not great and we regularly fall short in the playoffs, often because of our offense, though not necessarily because of him, but the point is that he couldn‚Äôt carry us to victory alone. Combine that witch the fact that he has something like 38 total touchdowns and 25 total turnovers in the last 2 seasons and that he missed the last 5.5 games last year and will probably miss the last 5.5 games this year, i don‚Äôt see how giving him the biggest contract in NFL history is justified. Him winning an MVP 3 seasons ago doesn‚Äôt mean much for the negotiations to me because he hasn‚Äôt played at that level since then. 

You can complain that he has a shit coordinator and shit wide receivers, but to me if you are getting the largest fully guaranteed contract in league history, you need to be coordinator-proof and receiver-proof, and that probably isn‚Äôt even possible. 

The offer i heard they gave him sounded very fair, if he doesn‚Äôt accept it, i think they should trade him.

I don't inherently have a problem with max protect, but it is a tool to use situationally, not an every-down utility. If you want to make yourself frustrated next week, watch the protections. Count how many times we have 7-8 players in pass protection, and consequently have no checkdown option if everything is covered downfield. It's one thing if you do it with TEs and keep a dump-off option, but because our entire passing game is predicated on TEs - and for some reason we never split any of them other than Andrews out wide in spite of Likely and Oliver both having prior experience as receivers - it is down to the backs a frustrating amount of the time, which means that there's often no option other than ""run for dear life"" when everything is covered downfield.

Greg's offense has always prioritized big plays when it uses the passing game - from San Fran to Buffalo to Baltimore, they've consistently ranked above average in air yards per attempt - but it has gotten so myopic that we are doing at at the detriment of any kind of safety valve. It's great when it works because you get a big play, but it is doomed from the start when you only have one worthwhile target so everyone knows they just have to cover wherever Andrews runs.

Gus, JK, and Justice combined have been in on 60% of our snaps this season. They have collectively been targeted for 20 passes all season.

Part of this is on Huntley - I know expectations have to be tempered with a backup, but it's not 2020 anymore, you're not a rookie, you need to be better than bottom-three - and part of it is on Greg - I get that we've had injuries and Huntley is not playing well, but that just makes 0 second-half carries for Gus and a 7/16 run/pass split in the second half even more perplexing - but all of it goes to show just how many serious, serious flaws this team has offensively that are covered up by Lamar being an otherworldly talent.
