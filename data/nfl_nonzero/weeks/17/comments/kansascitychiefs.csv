Having said thst historically fumbles are not a sustainable defensive model. Thst was my point. It took a big play to ultimately change thst game. Ripping thr ball from kelce feels far far less sustainable than something like that great pass Burrow hit on third and long to ice it.

Regardless my point wasn't ""Bengals can't win"" obviously that's stupid. As I said before I think it would be a toss up and close either way. I think for the idea of power rankings it dosent do much good to just point to games from a month or longer ago.

Now imagine a scenario where every time someone in the workforce died, their coworkers added 0 productivity to the market for 5 business days.

Roughly 800k working age adults (15-64) die a year in the US. That’s about 2200 people a day. There are roughly 130 million adults in that same age group.

Napkin math says about 1/150 working adults fare going to die in any given year, which is going to result in a huge number of weeks with no productivity from huge swaths of the economy.

Football to me is more exciting because every play has so many 1v1 situations happening and you have guys using their agility, strength, technique, or just mental aptitude to try and win in the situation and form an advantage (or take away) on a single play. Athletic ability is also more on display in football than baseball that may have a handful of athletic plays a game. I also like the fluidity of football, like one play the LT might demolish the DE and a big run happens... Next play the DE beats the LT for a sack.

51119,340473,340473,morgster87,"I think the trade Chris Jones ship sailed a few years ago. I remember there were lots of analysts and talking heads saying we’d tag and trade cj95 before his contract extension in ‘20, but I just don’t see that happening anymore. He’s such an integral part of our defense. 

The only reason we’d trade him is for a king’s ransom. I’m talking multiple firsts and seconds, and there l are very few times I think that give that up at this point. 

Secondly, I think Frank Clark is a hot-cold edge rusher. When he’s on, that dude plays like a top 12 edge, but unfortunately we only see that in maybe a few games a season. I think a lot of it has to do with that weird stomach issue he gets a lot and really slows him down. Alternatively, we are seeing exponential growth in Furious George that makes me think he could soon become a corner stone of our d line and edge group next year. 

I know a lot of folks are calling for maybe trading up in the first for a serious edge rusher, but I have reservations on that. With the exception of those “blue-chip” type prospects, any edge we draft is going to take at-least a year to develop. Without trading up into the top 5, I doubt we get an immediate contributor that will play better than what we got. I don’t think we have that kind of draft capital. I feel like picking up a good prospect in the late first is probably the best option. 

Veach always seems to get a vet along the d line on a team friendly, 1 year deal that provides a spark especially later in the season. Suggs, Gordon, now Dunlap. If we continue this trend, it might be foreseeable that Veach aggressively goes after Ngakoue or Marcus Davenport who are slated to hit free agency next year. I doubt we would be able to afford both of those FA and also keep Clark who has a substantial cap hit next year if we keep them. My money is we cut Clark and sign another FA that can complement Karlaftis.

I think the general idea for our defense is we’re going to have to compile a “good-enough” defense since we’re so top heavy on contracts that’ll keep us in games. That seems to be our hallmark in the Mahomes era. I don’t think we’ll see any of those complete “shut down” defenses early in the year, with the idea being they get better as the year progresses and by playoff time are playing as a top 15 defense which should be enough if the offense is clicking.",4.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_zyyv1m,False,0.0,Mecole Hardman #17,2022-12-30T07:09:06Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0314477683944356
