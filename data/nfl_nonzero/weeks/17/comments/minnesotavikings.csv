What I think we should look for is a Kendricks replacement because he seems to have lost some coverage ability which was his defining trait. Hicks is a straight up liability, and Asamoah has shown flashes. Either another tape job in FA (money's tight) or a day 2 off ball LB is my solution.

While that could be because Kendricks has lost a step and Hicks is a liability in coverage, I'm betting on the former being too predictable. The rest of the secondary is generally young and inexperienced so this may be a cause of the soft coverage. Pass rush doesn't seem to get home much but the pressure's been there.

Offense has been underwhelming as a whole, too. JJ is him, so we don't need to worry about that. I've heard Thielen's been getting open but isn't being targeted as much as he should. KJ hasn't broken out like we wanted. Hock is great, provides matchup problems and opens up JJ deeper in the field. Kirk is fine, he's not top 10 but he's just outside that range and holy shit has he been clutch. Cook still has the home run speed but the run blocking has taken a tumble, especially without Bradbury. Pass blocking has been hit or miss, as the misses have been the primary catalyst for the offense's struggles in blowouts.

The issue is that he's not some nobody like me, he's a fuckin HUGE name, and stirring up shit isn't easy, MORE so when you don't have LeBron titles to your name, which sucks, because he has the talent to get out there and bring up these topics and be heard, but without the gold behind him nobody will listen, it'll be more ""Shut up and play ball"" like you said.

Apologies, but you're incorrect here on a fundamental level. The issue in 2019 was how to reconcile firing Zimmer when he had just won a playoff game.  
 
But if we go back into the context of that we'll remember that the Vikings had offered him up for trade to Dallas and that Stephanski was a strong portion of the FO's choice for HC the following year. It was very well known that Zimmer was either to be fired or traded if the Vikings lost that Saints game. It is even better known that Zimmer doesn't coach offense.  
 
Therefore, the team winning the coin flip in OT against the Saints and selecting offense and winning on the first drive is not attributable to Zimmer in anyway. As such, winning the Saints playoff game should not have saved his job, but it did.   
 
He'd gone scorched earth since we signed Kirk, and most of us who are with or close to the team know that. Kirk saved his job in 2018 with his throw to Kyle.",1.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10348l5,False,0.0,moss fro,2023-01-04T12:13:33Z,minnesotavikings,0.0384718687657265

Patrick Mahomes couldn't pull his team to a W in the SB when his O-Line was decimated by injuries, and he's the pinnacle of QB play in the NFL today. Why would Kirk be able to do it while being pressured more, missing his 1st and 2nd string C - with a C who doesn't know snap counts - one of the best RTs in the NFL, and a RG that is on pace to shatter the pressure and sack rate. 

Some of those batted balls are on the O-Line. Anyone who has played football knows that linemen are taught to hit players attempting to jump when they know the ball is in the air. Between that, forgetting how to snap, and Ingram loving to step back into Cousins; some of our linemen are lacking basic football skills that *can* be taught. 

Add in the inability for our WRs to create separation and take advantage of JJ commanding double teams. 

We spent decent money the last two seasons on defensive acquisitions and it's amounted to nothing. We've missed on several draft picks and have some horrible contracts (AT, Cook, and Kendricks contracts are worse than Cousins for those who are quick to point to Kirk's $. You could also argue Harry since I don't believe he's being utilized to his potential with blitzing to justify his big number). Those are bigger issues.
