He and Buck were discussing that the fans at the Linc were so welcoming to them, and that he respected how Reid ran the organization so much, that he felt more at home when he visited there than he did Dallas. I'm sorry I don't have a hard reference to it, but I can't be the only one that remembers it.

> Announcers usually aren’t heavily involved in team things as to not project favoritism that people already think they have towards their old team

That's true, but Aikman takes it to the extreme. Moose didn't hide his love of the team, Romo is more hands off but still freaking cried the first time he announced one of our games, Jimmy doesn't hide it, nor does Garrett now (although he did pick the Eagles.) And then there's Michael Irvin, who makes it his entire shtick. 

> And I guess you weren’t really around during his time otherwise you’d know he was cut

Dude I grew up watching Aikman. Of course I know he was cut.

And I felt like that was being jeopardized by decisions that were being made beyond my control within the organization.

The Jaylon deal wasn’t lauded by anyone but regardless it’s not revisionist history to say he was a 3 years removed from a knee injury, had one very good season and one awful season and was a restricted free agent at a lower value position. Those were the facts at the time. 

You’re congratulating them for signing a deal just because it was less injurious to the cap to not have the player. That’s not a good deal. A good deal would’ve been giving him a market extension at 18 million instead of letting him reach free agency. But they couldn’t because they were fucking around with the franchise tag on Tank which brings me to my next point. 

Tanks deal was bad only because they were so adamant they weren’t going to top the market in 2018 even though everybody knew Khalil Mack was coming up. Again not revisionist history. They tried to play hardball and lost because the team never wins when it bets against their own players which brings me to my last point.

The Dak contract was handled as dumb as possible because these dumb motherfuckers tagged him while simultaneously giving him weapons out the ass. Was his demand going to go down as his stats got better? Was he supposed to do them a favor after that fought him tough and nail over a year of control? Dude broke his leg and he still got to write his own contract essentially. All that happened was they had to play a year with that giant cap hit and they still gave him the exact years and money he asked for.  


Sorry got the essay but I think you underestimate the cap flexibility teams lose on signing a new contract versus an extension.
