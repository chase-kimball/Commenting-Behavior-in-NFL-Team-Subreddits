14097,99687,99687,NannigarCire,"Not really, his season is pretty ~~bad~~ mediocre. He's got the lowest ADOT in the league, is league average in amount of interceptable throws, so he's throwing conservatively and still getting tons of potential INTs but leads the league in lowest INT rate...huge luck for him. His ""plumbers"" are guys from extremely talented teams, and because he's throwing underneath all game, teams aren't really going to stop him. It's not much different than how Mike White was winning. But then Jones on top of that, has one of the worst sack rates in the league despite being a checkdown heavy short passer.

Like i don't know what about him makes people think he'd be good with better WRs, but when he did have better WRs, he was still bad. He's just never had a single good passing career ever. Not even in college. He's not a talented QB. His arm is kind of mediocre. He has surprising athleticism for someone who looks like such a dork. But he's completely behind the curve in every single way. Like again, if the Giants didn't have a winning record, no one would even consider Daniel Jones to be a QB option.

Like they are in the bottom half of the league in every way. They are having the flukiest season in the world. It's reminiscent of the Jets 2013 season.

14098,99688,99688,NannigarCire,"Carr's a better option than Brady or Daniel Jones, by miles. One of them is washed, the other has never in their career of either College or NFL had a good season as a passer. And i'd consider trading for him if it's possible to do with only one 1st rounder. Cap space or not, he's been a very good passer in the league for three of the last four years with an insanely high 67% comp, 2.1% INT, 7.6 YPA, and 5.4% sack rate- which includes his shitty down year this time around. All of those numbers are above the league average for the last four years which is: 65% comp, 2.2% INT, 7.3 YPA, and 6.4% sack rate. Two of his last four seasons hit an insane 7.9 YPA, which is very impressive even for players with a talented team. There's only like two guys who have hit that mark at all in the last four years and aren't considered ""good"" QBs, and that's Jimmy G and Tannehill. Who will also likely be on the market. Everyone else is either elite or a franchise QB- Mahomes, Tua, Allen, Prescott, Cousins, etc. You could probably argue Carr is in the same space as Cousins as this sort of uninspiring but fully capable player.

And unfortnately, although he has what i consider Bad Brain disease- he is an insanely talented player who refuses to really play like it for most of his career. At least under Gruden he seemed to let go of his worst instincts and play more loosely, leading to those high statistics, but he's a firmly tier 2.5 player who isn't much different than Stafford was on the Lions. There's still a non-zero chance that Carr entering his early 30's (where often QBs actually tend to peak) will finally let go. IDK. It's weird to think he has upside, but anyone who hasn't seen him throw might not realize that he's able to hit some insane ones. He just has the stupidest conservative mindset.

I also just...don't understand how people keep putting Daniel Jones on this pedestal. If the Giants weren't winning, no one would care.

14099,99689,99689,NannigarCire,"don't know where to put this, but I just wanted to write something out in my head about Development vs Initial perception vs Luck. This is going to be sort of ranty story about unrelated players, but I hope it gives someone who reads it something to think about

Anyway, Keelan Cole came into the league as a UDFA for a pretty solid Jaguars receiver room in 2017. It contained Allen Robinson, Marqise Lee, Allen Hurns, Dede Westbrook- a lot of guys who had either draft capital placed onto them or had already shown some real production. Cole was himself an elite producer at KY Wesleyan (Cole, in his best season, was 60.7% of his team's passing offense. 99th percentile amongst WRs since like 2010). He got lucky to get onto the field for Jaguar's offense in 2017 as basically everyone besides Marqise Lee got injured. He'd end the season with 2 games of over 100 yards, [including one that went for 180](https://youtu.be/ZOx1B3HwysQ). At the start of next year, he looked fantastic with a 116-yard game that included this [killer highlight catch](https://youtu.be/z7cX9WRaWx0) and seemed like he was about to break into a rare group of great UDFA WRs. But then Jaguar's offense started getting bad, and Cole went through a three-week slump of drops and bad play. And suddenly he was benched. He'd never really make a lot of noise again but keeps hanging around the league.

Quincy Enunwa is another weird one. I love the guy and thought he was incredible as a prospect. Drafted by the Jets in the sixth round of 2014. He was a late breakout in college who only really did his damage as a senior, generally a bad sign, but at 6'2 225, running a 4.45 he was a weapon. But he was very raw. His rookie season was spoiled by an accusation of Domestic Abuse, that was later dropped, which led to him being sort of put on the end of a roster containing no one special beyond Eric Decker. It's pretty likely that if he was active in 2014, he gets a lot of playing time. But The Jets didn't expect much out of him at that point, they basically were fine assuming he wasn't gonig to be a significant contributer going forward, Jets even drafted Devin Smith in the 2nd round. They don't do that thinking that Enunwa is going to be an important piece for the future. 2015 comes around, Marshall is brought in, and Decker is healthy after a season of being in and out of the lineup in 2014. They stay healthy all year and maintain the outside spots, and Quincy is slowly eased into the offense over time. He's barely used for most of this season, save for randomly getting 10 targets against Philadelphia. But with low expectations and low pressure, there's not much to be upset about for his play. He's the #3 on an offense with a clear #1 and #2. Then comes 2016. Marshall has hit the age apex. Decker is injured. Quincy is thrust into the role in year 3. 2 years of completely low-pressure development. Quincy...turns the fuck on. Getting the ball to Quincy becomes a priority. He can make amazing plays happen out of nowhere. This [70 yarder on a random curl vs the Ravens.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lshokI5OBzM), this [Beautiful catch and juke vs the Browns](https://youtu.be/Avi2nbCU5IQ), and this [skillful highlight touchdown against the Patriots.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgJuK6UuvMo). Quincy is a potential god. Injuries derail what is looking like a very bright future.

Cole was placed in a high-pressure do-or-die situation early on as a rookie, easily swam, but was completely replaced after just a short stretch of bad play in year 2. The lack of investment and subsequent substandard play on a team that desperately needed it in 2018 led the Jaguars to bench one of the most promising UDFAs ever. Unclear if a greater investment and commitment to him would've led to a much different career for the guy. Meanwhile, Enunwa was given low pressure, had the 4-year contract commitment due to being drafted, and had a long time before his number was called to show up. Despite being drafted to a barren team, and mostly because of luck. If Enunwa was forced to play more for the 2014 team, there's a good chance his inconsistencies that showed up in the 2015 season would have been much more costly and resulted in a significantly worse perception of him as a player. Even in 2015, i remember defending Enunwa and getting a DM when he dropped a pass in week 16 asking how can i stand to defend someone who plays this badly? Yeah, people really do that.

I think people see coaches as being like seers or something sometimes, but I'm willing to bet they don't see anything more than we do although they have the tools to mold and shape what they see more than any of us do. And because of that, they're just as biased in their initial perceptions vs their reaction to their initial perceptions and so on. You know, a first-rounder struggles in their first year and they're right back on the field in year 2. A UDFA struggles in their first year, and they're likely to get cut. And there are players whose college careers do not back up giving them more opportunities, even for a first-round pick, while there are UDFAs and very late guys whose college careers do give a lot of reason for optimism.

This leads me to someone like Isaiah Hodgins. I like Isaiah Hodgins, I tried trading for him for years in my very deep dynasty. I finally got him this year off the waivers. We use contracts in my league, and get 1 contract extension to use on a player off waivers each year. Between Greg Dortch (also a huge fan of), Justin Watson, and Isaiah Hodgins, I picked Hodgins. This was in week 10. Hodgins just played 1 game for the Giants, 1 game for the Bills, and spent the rest of the season inactive. Hodgins missed his rookie year due after being drafted in the 6th round by the Buffalo Bills to a shoulder injury he sustained in the preseason. Gabriel Davis was the other day 3 rookie they drafted, similar build and use as Hodgins- and he got the shoo-in from there. Davis sustained his momentum in year 2, plus they brought in Emmanuel Sanders which further pushed Hodgins down the depth chart as the Bills wanted to make a real run for the championship. In year 3, he was just the odd man out with Davis performing, Diggs at the top, McKenzie playing slot, with Crowder brought in to back that up, and then new fourth-rounder Khalil Shakir blowing up the camp. Between him and the remaining receivers, Jake Kumerow, also a similar body and usefulness had special teams ability so he was kept. Hodgins ends up on waivers mid-season, and with the Giants struggling and their GM + HC both having Bills familiarity with Hodgins, they brought him in and nearly immediately placed him on the field. Hodgins was a killer player in college. He was 40% of his passing offense at Oregon State (85th percentile), broke out as a significant contributor at a young age (19), and was an early declare for the NFL. These are the stats of an NFL WR hit, most players who hit in the NFL have these traits. Yet when talking about the talent around the Giants, Hodgins is treated as a practice squad player. The initial perception of him seems to be the biggest reason why. 

Development, luck, player careers...it's kind of random. There are a lot of great players or HOF-would-be's whose likeliest biggest reasons for not making it are just randomness, and not because of injuries. The idea of a meritocracy within the NFL is just an idea, the flow of money and jobs being on the line means that teams have a lot of other factors for why/who they choose to play. And in a way, guys like Mike White and Zach Wilson are also victims/beneficiaries somewhat. I don't believe you should sit a QB, but it's undeniable that playing more is the only way to get better. I think Kevin Durant said this about Lamar Odom, that he's not a bust because he was just injured. You can't be a bust if you never really get to play. There's probably a lot of pretty good players who aren't thought to be as much because they don't get to play enough to prove it.

14108,99699,99699,NannigarCire,"This is a good post about the Jets free agency, and i mostly agree. Although the Jets should keep Berrios because i think people are misevaluating him having a season where none of his dynamo is showing as him being bad suddenly. Last year it just hit more often, but he's still just as dynamic. It happens. However, it's very funny how people other than you tend to think about Free Agency because the basic premise of free agency is that the team the player was on didn't think the player was worth keeping. There are so few good players on FA, if you can find anything that isn't actively bad on it, you've done enough. Fans make it worse by trying to calculate the amount of money being paid to players sometimes when they analyze it, but then forget to calculate (or rather, can't) the actual desire of players to come play here which would've been a huge factor in the quality of players to begin with and are the reason the Jets pay heavily for some mid to low-tier talent.

Anyway, it was a good FA class, and Tomlinson is really the disappointment. But Tomlinson has played well in the past, and there's a chance he'll play well next year. New system, team, chemistry to get used to, so there's a lot of excuses that can be pointed to.

Daniel Jones currently averages 6.4 air yards per attempt. Lowest in the league amongst starters. basically a checkdown heavy player. Despite being a checkdown heavy player, he's league average for turnover worthy plays (according to PFF), but leads the league in lowest INT rate. Guess what that means, he's getting very INT lucky this year.

But there's more! On top of being very checkdown heavy, he's holding the ball 35th longest in the league. And here's the funny thing with that, he's also got the 7th highest sack rate in the league. Here's the funnier thing about it- that's common for him in every season of his career! At this moment his season-long YPA is no different than any other year of his career, so he's playing exactly as efficiency as he was before with only one difference, he's running the ball more, and he is to his credit a pretty good runner.

But reading “Daniel Jones is a competent QB” with 80 upvotes might be what breaks me for good. Guy is playing out the most Alex Smithian fearful season ever, on a team often getting the luckiest breaks you’ll find (watch next season if they keep him) and everyone thinks the Jets should fire staff? Because what? A lot of important players got injured? Zach sucks and they should’ve been able to peer into the future to recognize that because they’re seers? The jets had one of the worst talent rosters as recently as LAST YEAR. In one offseason the entire trajectory of the team has changed in an insurmountable way and 1 COMPETENT B- draft class probably pushes the jets right into regular wildcard competitor territory.

They like raw size, speed, power because they believe it's not something you can coach, so they sometimes lean towards player with those attributes, and try to coach them into better players.

However, there are just some players who will be nothing but those raw stats and that means passing on some players who are just a bit smaller, bit slower, and just don't have measurables in favor of those that do.

That's how we get a guy with arm like Wilson, or a leg like Mann, who can make the big throw or kick, but have major accuracy issues. It's not to say that the theory doesn't work often, but there are always going to be players who can't be coached up enough  to make use of their big skills.",3.0,nyjets,t3_zzx501,False,1.0,":PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya",2022-12-31T11:21:26Z,nyjets,0.0200376
