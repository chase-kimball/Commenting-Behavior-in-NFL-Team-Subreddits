This is one of those straight up nonsense regurgitated Reddit shit takes that is so ridiculous and so easily verifiably untrue that it's honestly crazy that I need to explain further. No, sacks allowed is a GREAT stat and it is almost always very EASY to assign correct blame. You need to do more research into how sacks allowed are counted. It's nowhere close to as tricky as you put it in bad faith. 

Also it’s easier to not allow a sack when you have a mobile QB. 


More absolute nonsense. With mobile QBs you also have multiple times a game where they take off but don't make it past the line of scrimmage which counts as a sack. 

>Also PFF is pretty good imo for every position other than DB, LB and IOL
