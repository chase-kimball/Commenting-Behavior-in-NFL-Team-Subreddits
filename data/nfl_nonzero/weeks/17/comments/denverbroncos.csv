4866,20693,20693,Bronco30,"I hate to be ""that guy"" but I work in cardiology and I'd like to make a correction to your post so there is not any confusion around the subject. He didn't suffer a heart attack. A heart attack is a ""myocardial infarction"" and is the result of a lack of blood/oxygen supply to the heart muscle tissue that contracts during a heartbeat.

What he suffered was cardiac arrest. It is very common for the two things to be misconstrued. Cardiac arrest is the sudden cessation of cardiac function usually due to a problem with the electrical pathways that deliver the impulses for a heartbeat. Cardiac arrest can occur AS THE RESULT of a heart attack but usually this is not the case. Most of the time in athletes the cause of SCA (sudden cardiac arrest) is due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This is thickening of the heart muscle from regular, prolonged endurance activities. When the heart muscle is thickening it can lead to problems with the electrical pathways that the impulse uses to tell the muscle to contract. 

In this specific scenario that is more than likely NOT what happened. Athletes at this level tend to be screened regularly to ensure that they don't have any underlying problems such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. What the doc is saying in the video is that he likely suffered from a condition called ""commotio cordis"" in which blunt force trauma causes a sudden, deadly arrythmia as a result from the heart being jarred at a specific time in the cardiac cycle. This throws off the rhythm and can spiral into ventricular fibrillation (quivering of the main pumping chambers of the heart as opposed to a cohesive squeeze.) From the ventricular fibrillation the heart can quickly fall into asystole and complete cardiac arrest. 

Below is a great and quick video of an example of an EKG going from normal sinus rhythm into a deadly arrhythmia and finally into cardiac arrest:

edit: format + adding a tldr since this is being downvoted for some reason

tldr: heart attack is lack of blood flow to heart muscle tissues. cardiac arrest is the electrical activity in the heart stopping suddenly.

The play on the field was better, but I don't think it was THAT much better. We were always able to play relatively well against the Chiefs anyway.

The thing that got me was Rosburg acting on the field and on the interviews. He's an interim. He's probably getting canned soon. But even then, he really showed passion. He didn't need to, nobody would care if he didn't, but he went there and showed passion anyway. I think we were missing it. That's an improvement.  

I don't know who will be the next HC of the Broncos and if he'll be able to fix Wilson, but more than an experienced coach, we need a leader. A TRUE leader.
