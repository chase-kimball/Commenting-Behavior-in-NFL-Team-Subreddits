I think I gave off the wrong impression when I said ""It takes nothing to support them the way they supported us last season."" For the Lions fans who genuinely came here to support us last season, I choose to support them since the Rams season has been derailed by injuries. You, of course, don't have to.

As aforementioned in this thread, I'm well aware there were Lions fan who never cared about the Rams or only cared about Stafford. I didn't mean to imply that Rams fans should kiss their ass because of the trade. You're well within your rights to feel the way you do.

However, you're missing my point, and though I mainly lurk here, I recognize your username as a frequent poster here so I know you know what I mean when I say this:

No matter what their extent of devotion to the Rams were, Lions fans did mostly come in peace last season and it was all smiles and laughs. Very little animosity between us. It was ""Lions Bros this, Lions Bros that"" up until the start of this season. 

Now some of us jump down their throats anytime they come here because they wanted us to lose for a better draft pick and now they want us to win so they can get into the playoffs? It's not rocket science. It's what they should be doing. What else did y'all expect?
This is what I mean by ""sympathize with them"". They just want to win. 

And where was all this vitriol last season?
 
It's the people who were chummy with them last year, switching it up now because Lions fans want something different. That. Shit. Is. Fake. Rams fans don't have to support them, but acting like they're this humongous problem is phony as fuck after the way this sub was last season. That's the only thing ""corny"" here.

HOLD UP! After writing this big ass post I just realized something. Did you write your post thinking that by supporting the Lions I meant hoping to lose from the get go to give them a better pick as recompense for Stafford? Because that's not what the original post was saying. I was hoping their pick was no. 32 like everyone else. I just meant since the Rams are super injured this year, from our point of view, who cares about them wanting us to lose.",1.0,losangelesrams,t3_101605z,False,0.0,Blue & Yellow #99,2023-01-03T01:01:15Z,losangelesrams,0.0120413830611184

All they need is a game manager, which Purdy is providing and why they can have 3 different QBs at the position with little change.

Regardless, it's still irrelevant to the point - good for the Patriots that they managed to overcome it. That doesn't mean it's not stupidly hard to overcome.

The Rams record has nothing to do with aggressive trading. Do you think us having a few extra 1st round picks that were basically seconds would have helped more than Stafford or Ramsey did this season? I don't. Losing your entire OLine room to injury which then causes you to lose QB1 and WR1 is never going to go well. 

Our defence has been good, it's our offence that's been the problem. If we scored the same points our offence was scoring last year we'd have been 10-5 or something I don't remember I stopped caring.

Oh also, it doesn't help that we had a massive drama with our running back room in the middle of the season and now it doesn't matter anymore that seems to be sorted.

The Rams have had a circus of a season, yeah it sucks but we just won a Chip and it's not the end of the world. Next year we will literally be playoff threats injuries permitting and anyone who thinks otherwise is out of their mind.

We’ve had unprecedented injuries in a single room. We started 13 different OLine combinations in the first 13 weeks. Now that we’ve had stability at OLine even with fourth stringers it looks much better.

I love european football and i played it for 16 years.

After seeing him collapsing, back when i was 11 Years old, i developed a deep underlaying fear everytime I stepped on a football field. 

I had panic attacks and irregular heartbeat episodes while i was playing football. The doctors never found anything. 

Now at 26 and after I am done with the kind of playing sports i did back then, I had therapy and worked myself through it. After 15 years I am doing good. 

But everytime something like this happens on TV, i fear that my anxiety will come back to me. 

So my advise to everyone who needs to talk after witnessing this scenery yesterday is to search for help if you are able. If not, talk to your family and friends. 

Its ok to have anxiety after seeing something like that.

Its not a good idea to put it slightly to your own mental health. Because it can drag you down slowly and longterm. 

Thinking about Hamlin all the time. I hope so much that he will come through all of this ♥️

1) ""They mortgaged their future for the SB win""

2) ""Sean McVay is going to retire""

With everyone healthy next year, we're right back where we were going into 2021. McVay isn't retiring. Sure we don't have our 2023 #1 or #4, but we still have our 2023 #2 and #3 and 7 other picks. We also have all our draft picks from 2024 and beyond. Our skill position players on offense are all returning on multi-year deals and we still have Donald, Wagner, and Ramsey under contract. 

We took a beating on injuries on OL and offensive skill positions, faced a tough schedule and decided risking an average seasons' record and maybe barely making the playoffs wasn't worth risking the health of our guys trying to rush back from IR for, and have decided again to make a run in 2023 instead.

Now I'm not saying we're going to be a perennial SB contender the next decade or so; but the notion that we went ""all in"" in 2021 flies in the face of the logic we have the 3rd best record in the NFL the past 5 seasons from 2017-2021, with 2 Super Bowl appearances.
