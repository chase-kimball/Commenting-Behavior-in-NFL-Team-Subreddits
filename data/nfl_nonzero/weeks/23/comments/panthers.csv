This is the real reason he can't get a HC job. That and the fact that Nagy and Mahomes have made people suspicious of Reid's OCs.

But the NFL doesn't give a shit about 20-35 year old legal issues, especially from a guy who's kept his nose clean for over 20 years.

No, bridge QBs being our only plan is what got us here. The only QB we have on contract as of this moment is Matt Corral; a 3rd round pick who looked bad in the season, who's coming off a Lisfranc.

That's not me saying we should go get another Darnold, or another Bridgewater to bet the future on. You still need someone who can play in case your rookie can't.

>Capers is old and washed

You criticized Capers despite him matching what you later described Caldwell as. Capers was in the same role last year with the Broncos, so it shouldn't be a surprise nor should we read too much into it. 

It's fair to criticize Staley for Swift, but if you also don't mention the season Williams had, it feels like you're only telling half the story. 

>McCown is hardly some quarterback genius

Nobody is calling him that? He's a guy who's been seen as a potential HC candidate already, so to get him as a position coach feels like a big win.

>the rest are castoffs and nobody special.

Ejiro Evero was a HC candidate this hiring cycle and led one of the best defences in Denver. Hardly a castoff. 

>Why are people talking about the Panthers staff so much?

The Panthers' staff under Rhule was essentially his staff from Baylor. We now have a HC who has had success as both an OC and HC in the league, 2 former HCs on staff to lend a helping hand (Caldwell, Capers), one of the better DCs in the league who is seen as a future HC (Evero), while retaining the 2 coaches whose units had the best success from last year's Panthers team (Tabor, Campen).

Given that there are only so many available coaches each hiring cycle, it's hard to view the staff Reich has put together as anything but a win. He has a good mix of up and coming coaches, with veterans who have been around for awhile, and nearly every single one of them has won as either a coach or player.

I'm not pounding the table for us to draft one of these guys, but there are very obvious benefits to adding a borderline elite talent at the position, of which there are many this year. To act like drafting a quality TE in the 2nd round is a waste of a pick is equal parts ignorant and dismissive of the actual value of the position lol.

It's a garbage year to be looking for off-ball LB help in the draft, same with Tackles and, to an extent, Guards (though Center is surprisingly deep). Filling holes is for free agency; the draft is where you add upside talent that can turn your roster from average to elite, and the best way to have a bad draft is to chase perceived needs at talent-shallow positions while ignoring the inherent value in taking someone from a position group with a deeper talent well.

Plus, let's not ignore the fact that as a franchise, we've had amazing success when we've added talent to a position of strength; we drafted Jon Beason when we still had Dan Conner, took Luke when we still had Beason and Thomas Davis, took Shaq when we still had Davis & Kuechly, took J-Stew when we already had D-Will and created double trouble, signed Jeremy Shockey the year we traded for Greg Olsen (and had a ton of success with 2 TE sets), and more.

Skipping over a quality player at a position bc you're ""all set"" there is a great way to miss out on creating an elite position group. Doubling down on high-end talent at the same positions is how the Eagles created an OL factory, how the Bengels put together the best WR room in the league, and how the Niners built a legendary front 7.

He may never have gotten any good weapons to throw to and probably would have had an outdated old-school offense that wasn't up to date with modern offensive ideas. But his natural talent would shine through and he'd still succeed enough to show promise that he could be great. Maybe even wins MVP with his mediocre surrounding cast and coaching and makes it to the super bowl. Maybe he is forced to use his athleticism more to make up for that cast and gets hurt. Maybe injuries pile up for him and his throwing talent diminishes, ending his career. The Cam Newton playbook is right there.

Because from what I can tell there are no excessive security measures, there doesn't seem to be a massively enforced split of the fans to avoid any skirmish. Overall people are really out there to have fun, no matter what team you root for.

See, if there's a high-profile ~~football~~ *soccer* match over here in the Netherlands (say... Ajax vs. Feyenoord) then you should expect trouble. Fans are kept separated by police, fans don't get to enter the arena at the same locations and basically the whole area is on edge.

Seems *completely* different over there. That NFL live show with fans from both teams just standing around and having fun?  I'd deem that completely impossible over here.

We need to decide if we are signing a veteran or drafting a rookie. From there determines how we restructure deals and who we extend. I think it’s safe to assume Burns get an extension no matter which route we take at QB (otherwise we would’ve traded him for those firsts).

If we are going for a veteran, then it should be Rodgers or Carr. Absolutely no reason to gamble on anyone lesser. If we can’t get either, then we draft. We’ve got the capital from the 49ers to move up, so we strike there.

Our O line is solid and the supporting casts is good, but a receiving TE would be great to pick up in round 2 or 3. 

Since we are switching to 3-4 on defense, I think any major free agent signings should be for players that *fit this scheme*.

Young is obviously like Tua and Hurts. Same build played in the same system at Bama. Smaller qbs worry me though but that's a personal preference.
