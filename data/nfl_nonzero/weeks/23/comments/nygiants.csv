We’re gunna blame a first time OC for not being able to make *Colt McCoy* a franchise quarterback? Clearly it was all his fault and not Shurmur’s, or their GM for surrounding him with elite offensive talent such as Chansi Stuckey and Mohammad Massaquoi.

>  there’s mountains of evidence that says paying a RB doesn’t lead to big time winning and they usually don’t live up to the contract.

...literally every team that has won the Superbowl in the past 20 years has either had an elite QB, a QB on a rookie contract or both. The only exceptions are Stafford depending on whether or not you consider him elite and Eli in 2011, who played like an elite QB that season. 

For the teams who had non-elite rookie contract QBs (not counting guys like Brady, Mahomes & Roethlisberger who were already studs in their first few years in the league), they all had very good bell-cow RBs. This list includes Marshawn Lynch, Ray Rice and Brandon Jacobs (was in more of a lead back role in 2007 than 2008 and averaged 92 ypg rushing). All of these guys got second contracts and all of them lived up to it besides Rice, who if he didn't drag his fiancee out of an elevator probably would've had a longer career in the NFL.

The clear best way to win in the NFL is to either have an elite QB or build a team around a good rookie QB, but if we plan on resigning Jones then we can't do either of those. Saying ""don't pay a RB"" only works when you have a Mahomes/Brady/Roethlisberger/Manning level QB, but if you have a Flacco/early career Russell Wilson/Eli Manning level QB then by all means you can't win a Superbowl without a stud RB.

Edit: also if you expand this list to teams that have _made_ the Superbowl in the last 20 years instead of just won it, there are a ton of examples of teams with mediocre QBs led by very good bell-cow RBs, with many of them on second contracts. This list includes Mixon, Gurley, Devonta Freeman, Jonathan Stewart, Marshawn (already mentioned above), Frank Gore, Thomas Jones, Shawn Alexander and Brian Westbrook. It does hammer home the simple fact that great QB play almost always beats a mediocre QB with a good team, so there is definitely an argument to be made that resigning Jones is a mistake, but if the move is to build around Jones then I don't see how we do that while letting Saquon walk.",2.0,nygiants,t3_111e0jw,False,0.0,:Jason_Garrett: Jason Garrett :Jason_Garrett:,2023-02-13T14:59:22Z,nygiants,0.0455550813893967

7721,68608,68608,FuckTheStateofOhio,"> There are a plenty of teams who have solid starters across positions for less than 6.5 million annually. 

Unless you're talking about making two diamond-in-the-rough signings, odds are we aren't finding two quality starters for under $13M that would have the same or greater impact on our team as Saquon. For reference, Mark Glowinski has a cap hit of over $8M next season, and was one of the worst players on our team this past season.

> Paying jones and saquon together would pretty much lock in the giants ceiling so I think the only way you can justify paying Saquon is if they’re drafting another QB and letting jones walk.

I mean yea, of course it locks in our ceiling, but not because of a measly ~$13M contract, but because of the $40M+ we'll probably give Jones. Signing Jones ties this coaching staff and FO to their QB for however long the contract is, so in that time we need to give Jones every weapon possible to succeed or else it's wasted money.

Sometimes I think this sub gets too wrapped up in the ""don't pay a running back"" mantra so much so that they ignore the literal results from this season. Without Saquon our offense would have been bottom 3 in the league and there's no way we make the playoffs. Letting Saquon walk not only takes our offense backwards, but it also deprives Jones of any semblance of a running game and almost guarantees that whatever contract we sign him to will wind up looking foolish.

This simply isn't true, unless you're talking about low tier starters such as the ones we have across our roster. I don't think replacing Saquon with a career backup guard and a journeyman linebacker is a worthy exchange. 

What you're referring to is rebuilding, which I'm not necessarily opposed to, but if we're about to hand Daniel Jones $40M+ coming off a season that we just made the playoffs, then letting our best player walk in the name of trying to save money for the future 2-3 years down the road feels like a poor strategy. We are in win now mode whether we like it or not. If we want to rebuild, we should let both Saquon and Jones walk and tear this thing down to the studs while starting fresh with rookies in place.
