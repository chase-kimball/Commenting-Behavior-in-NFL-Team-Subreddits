As for the qualifications: 

>Why do you want to be a mod? 

I’m quite active on this sub, even if I don’t comment/post as often as others. This is definitely my most visited subreddit as I check it multiple times a day (sometimes obsessively) and comment/post when something really interests me. My name should be fairly recognizable at this point. 

I also pride myself on being level-headed and never getting into arguments with others. I haven’t had any scuffles with our subscribers or on any other team sub. I don’t see any benefit to a one-sided dialogue or anything constructive about shitting on other people. It’s tough, but I’ve stuck with this team through and through. My post history will show some positive takes on this team, especially during our losing streaks and low points. I’ll fume internally about a loss but don’t feel the need to rage about it on reddit — that’s what my wife and friends are for! 

Overall I enjoy the commentary and opinions here and I’d like to maintain that integrity. Feel free to check my post and comment history of course. 

>	Do you have prior experience as a mod? 

Probably my downfall, but I have no experience moderating any subreddits — this would be my first time. Feels like a chicken or an egg problem - I haven’t had the opportunity to be a mod so I haven’t gained experience, but the lack of experience makes it hard to find an opportunity with a sub I really like. That said, there also aren’t really any other subreddits I’d be super interested in being a mod for.  

I also don’t have any CSS experience, but I’m willing to put in the time to learn if need be. I’ve got extra time at work that I use to practice R and SAS coding. My job also requires minimal experience with HTML that I need to brush up on anyway. I’m really excited about the prospect of moderating and doing so with the Chargers sub would be a great first opportunity. I’m a fast learner and am 100% willing to put in the time!

>What time zone do you live in?

PST. Actually just moved back to the west coast after a 7 year stint on the east coast. Glad to be back in the pacific time zone for more reasons than just the chargers! 

I’m also almost always on the game day thread just to see what others are saying and to upvote/downvote as I see fit, as well as to call out terrible reffing and praise incredible plays. Almost to a fault, I schedule my Sundays around Chargers games during the season so I’m almost always available. 

>How long have you been a fan for? 

Since the mid 90s! Grew up going to Qualcomm with my dad and his friends and have stuck with the bolts through the move and everything. For better or worse, I’ll be a fan until I die. 

>Why should we pick you? 

Not much to add to answer to number 1 above, but I’ll just add that I’ve applied to be a mod before and had some solid support. I was asked to be more involved in the sub, and I feel like I’ve really done this over the past several years. 

>Fuck the ____?

Raiders, of course. But over the years this is quickly shifting more towards Fuck the Chiefs, so why not add that too? Here’s a Fuck the Broncos as well for good measure. 

I don’t have a Raiders decal on my toilet, just some close die-hard Raiders friends I’ve known for years. At this point, the relationship is based more on pity than anything.

So, lightly touching a WR on the back while not impeding him nor redirecting him is a hold?  Ok, guess so since Bradbury said so himself.  But if you want we can sit down together and watch the game frame by frame, I will guarantee we will see the exact same penalty go uncalled several times.

If the refs were calling that all game, fine whatever.  But they weren’t, the previous 58 minutes set the precedent for what was acceptable in terms of contact with a WR.  That’s why Bradberry said he hoped they didn’t call it, he figured that he was within his right to lightly touch him when 1) he didn’t redirect him, 2) he didn’t impede him in his route, and 3) the ball was uncatchable.

There is a lot to look forward to for next season (despite that always being the case).  Herbert is a top 5 QB in the league and, when you have that, you’re always a threat.  In my opinion, Staley is a good coach but he is inexperienced and there is a learning curve.  That’s what happened vs. JAX, Doug Peterson is a much more experienced coach and we were out-coached that second half.  That being said, the team is VERY bought in; they trust him and what he’s doing.  He has shown a tendency to take care of coaching issues aggressively during the offseason and chase excellence at every facet.  Last offseason, he replaced our special teams coordinator and this season we had a top 5 unit in the NFL.  Our hiring of Kellen Moore reflects this too.  Moore has orchestrated a top 5 offense 3 out of the last 4 years in Dallas (the 1 year he didn’t their starting QB broke his leg).  Our weapons are better than Dallas at the top of our roster (we desperately need a WR that’s fast), so he should be able to make a lot happen.  Staley is definitely on the hot seat and Moore had been a serious HC candidate for like 3 years, which is why I think he took the job because lateral moves (OC to OC) don’t happen.  It would make sense to bring him in so you don’t have Herbert and co with their 2nd HC change and 4th OC.  This way, even if Staley does get fired, there would be consistency in the building.  Sorry, I know this was long winded, but I wanted to give you my take on the current state of the team.

Since you’re new to the sport as a whole and it’s the offseason, the only real football discussions going on right now are about the NFL draft in late April.  I definitely recommend checking out r/NFL_draft, several people from this sub are fairly active there (myself included).
