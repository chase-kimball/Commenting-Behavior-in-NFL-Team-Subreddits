68,1040,1040,-makehappy-,"Yeah but that argument's cutting it a bit short IMO, because the Eagles D starts and ends with the pressure the front four can get, (the best front four in the NFL). The Chiefs are more balanced with a really strong back 7. 

A slippery field impacts the receiving offense and defense nearly equally as both WRs and DBs can't cut with the same precision. But in pass rush, it hugely benefits the Oline since a slippery field means its way harder to bend around the edge for DE's, and for the whole Dline it's way harder to move laterally to adjust for filling running lanes.

It's like a pro motorcycle race when riders bend hard around a turn on dry asphalt vs in the rain... In order to make the turn in the rain you have to be more upright, making it way less efficient.

One major difference was the Packers didn‚Äôt really ever do too much in FA, and they squandered a little of early draft picks. Ted Thompson, at the time of this ESPN article (2015) apparently signed 12 UFAs since 2005. 4 of which never played a regular season snap. He only hit with 2, maybe 3 of them, being Charles Woodson (100 games played for Packers), Ryan Pickett (110 games played for Packers), and Brandon Chiller (34 games played for Packers). Outside of that, all the other 5 UFA pickups played 16 games or less for the Packers. The article does mention Julius Peppers and Letroy Guion coming on in 2014, but says they were ‚Äústreet‚Äù FAs since they had been cut by their previous teams. Honestly kind of difficult to find FA signings from the past via google, if someone could help me confirm that 12 number, it would be appreciated. Regardless, the Chiefs last offseason alone signed MVS, JuJu, and Justin Reid to help their situation.

Everyone complains about how annoying it is, but it's not his weekly segment that's annoying; it's the endless discussion (if you can even call it that) that follows.

Rodgers is the guy that kicks it off each week, and of course he's using that position to play into it, but it's not like he's tweeting about himself every single day.
