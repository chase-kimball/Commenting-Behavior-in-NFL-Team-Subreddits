In real time the hold is a lot harder to catch and I think you‚Äôd have to be watching the play pretty closely.



Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî It‚Äôs absolutely a hold by the letter of the law. But, just like OL holding, this kind of thing happens virtually every play and isn‚Äôt often caught. The majority of holding calls are far more dramatic than this and they attract attention even if the ref wasn‚Äôt looking at first. This was practically a blink-of-the-eye foul. Now‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôm an official and I observe this head-on, I absolutely have to throw the flag, because it is textbook holding and I‚Äôm on camera witnessing it.



This play was one of those things that often gets hidden from the officials and only caught on camera in retrospect, and depending how you look at it, it‚Äôs either a shame or a good thing that the one ref happened to be looking.


TLDR; I‚Äôm saying it was indeed a hold but it‚Äôs the type of hold that happens almost every play, but if I‚Äôm the ref and I see it, I have to flag it.

He got injured in the dying seconds of the first Jets game, whenever that was. This isn't really something that is disputed or kept unknown?

No Keenum is not a bad backup at all, but our team is picking in the top 10 maybe top 5 level outside QB play. Allen made us contenders while Keenum can't elevate a bottom tier roster.

The one season part does make somewhat sense.

But injuries are what we should be afraid more than a lack of ability to win. At our full uninjured strength, we beat both this year's and last year's SB champs in the same season. Even with injuries, we escaped with the AFC East title (which many forgot was a red hot division at one point) and crawled to the divisional round. Our regular season losses were all extremely tight, and two of them were avenged. Then with all of this, our boys had to deal with their teammate nearly dying on the field.

50320,359575,359575,xT1TANx,"I'm going to be fully honest here. I don't think the issue is Beane. My concern is that McD is Marty Schottenheimer 2.0. 

Marty preached fundamentals and toughness. It worked... in the regular season. He did a great job at beating up the majority of teams but any time he got to the PO he got his head kicked in by smarter coaches.

He had a 14-2 Chargers team with Drew Breese and Ladanian Tomlinson... and lost to a pretty bad Pats team.

McDermott is a great motivator and life coach it seems, but I am not sold that he's a great X's and O's guy. His entire philosophy is ""growth."" Get better every day and EVENTUALLY you will be better than everyone. This sounds great but the NFL is not the kind of place that it works. You're players don't stay with one team long enough to fully benefit from this mindset. They all want to get paid, and the cap doesn't allow that to happen.

Team turnover is now on our doorstep. We will be very different next season if Tremaine and Jordan walk. New players will come in and be at level zero in our system. 

Meanwhile, KC is just going to get better. They won the SB, can easily replace WR/RB because their SYSTEM is intelligent and gets them open or into space.

The Bengals are going to get better. They have 2 more years of Burrows on his low cost deal. They have tons of weapons and can go draft more OL to shore up their one weakness.

We either have to get new coordinators who can outsmart those teams with what we have or we are not going to win anything with this group, and I guarantee next year heads will fucking roll if we don't win. If we think the masses are pissed now, when our D does the exact same shit next year in the PO and gets smoked, I'm going to blame Beane and McD for not having the foresight to make a change this year.",2.0,buffalobills,t3_11111x5,False,0.0,:BUF:,2023-02-14T16:07:23Z,buffalobills,-0.042057867575289
50321,359577,359577,xT1TANx,"How? The draft? The majority of WRs do not perform in year 1. So you can just waste another year at minimum waiting for them to get better.

We have little to no cap room for WR, so FA is likely not a good place to overhaul our entire corps.

So how will you do this?

The sensible thing to do would be to upgrade the OL, which can be done in the draft, as many OL do start and perform at a high level.  

We have no starting guard ATM. We also need to not have players like Bobby Hart backing up our starters. Go get competition for all of our OL. 

It keeps costs down and gets rid of our budget OL. It replaces them with talented low cost players. It helps to protect Josh, so our current WR can produce. 

You can still draft a WR this year to prepare for the future, but any WR is going to be that, a pick for the future.",0.0,buffalobills,t3_11189zm,False,0.0,:BUF:,2023-02-14T13:44:07Z,buffalobills,0.0033573251982303
