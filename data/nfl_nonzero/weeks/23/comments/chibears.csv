I did take out weeks 1-4 and predicated that in my original comment saying, that’s when Justin turned a corner. We’re looking at a young qb who is progressing. Looking at splits is a very reasonable thing.

I also included week 17 in all of my stats and added it without it for additional context that for a bulk of the season he was good. And when the season was out of hand and we were turning in the towel he also performed poorly.

I'm also not sure what the alternative was.  The 2nd rounder is a steep price, but the Packers were bidding a 2nd rounder as well, so that was the price.  Without Claypool, the Bears would probably be stuck trying to overpay Jakobi Meyers, the best WR FA available, or hoping a high draft pick rookie could pick up the offense enough to be a starter opposite Mooney.  I wouldn't really be enthused about either one of those options, I think Claypool has shown he can be a decent starter at least.

If it's all teams, I'm going with an incredibly boring top 5 of Chiefs (Mahomes), Bengals (Burrow), Bills (Allen), Eagles (Hurts + stacked offensive and defensive lines), and Niners (QB is a question mark but they'll probably figure it out + Deebo/McCaffrey/roster talent).  Unless I'm missing something, Mahomes, Burrow, and Allen seem like perennial playoff guys.  Eagles and Niners have the most roster talent in the NFC and I'm not sure why that would drastically change.

If it's teams who have been bad, I'd go Bears, Lions, Jets... and I'm not sure who else.

Bears spent about $140 mil of the $220 mil this year on their actual roster.  That was ~$20 mil less than any other team.  A lot of that was dead cap, some of that was Poles stripping the roster down, knowing the team didn't have the resources to compete this year.

Bears oline was one of the worst pass blocking lines, if not the worst, in the league.

Bears #2 and #3 receivers in playing time was Equanimeous St. Brown and Dante Pettis.  When Mooney went down, they were the #1 and #2.

Despite all that, we still get clowns like you citing his passing yardage as proof that he's bad.  His pass yardage was affected by the roster around him, his propensity to run, and the play calling which was oriented towards handing the ball off.

If you look at accuracy instead of volume, [his completion percentage was better than Josh Allen and Hurts completion percentage in their 2nd years and not that far off in overall stats.](https://twitter.com/DaveKluge/status/1613287898417188870)

31813,178511,178511,SwissyVictory,"Good write up.  As a Bears fan here are my nitpicks.

1. I havent even seen a Bears fan saying we should draft a QB in the first this year. The fan base is all in on Fields. Some experts have them taking one, but the fans don't see it that way, and word is the front office is all in on him. It would even help with a trade back if they made it look like they might take a QB, but we haven't seen anything.

2. I still believe the Claypool trade was good, especially in hindsight. If the Steelers offered us our pick for him back, I wouldn't take it. Only 4 WRs in the past 3 years taken outside the 1st have gotten 650+ yards. Claypool has gotten 800+ his first two years. His production this year even was way better than most 2nd round picks. The odds of him getting back there is higher than any 2nd round WR, or likely free agent. The only way I'd revert the trade is if we could move it for someone better.  Lots of fans disagree with me on this. 

3. Whitehair is expensive, but he was worth his contract last year, and played this year next to a rookie LT and a horrible C. I expect he sticks around, and LG isn't a need.

4. WR and CB arnt major needs. While I'd love a star like Hopkins if a trade worked out, I wouldn't be supprised if we went in with just a guy from free agency in the #2 spot behind Mooney and another depth guy. Upgrading CB is a luxury, it might get addressed, but it's far from the biggest need. LB is a much bigger need, and they offered Roquan 19mil a year, he just didn't like some of the wording in the contract and it made some bad blood with the whole, him not having an agent thing. I'd expect the Bears to go after someone like Edmunds who will be solid but cheaper.",8.0,nfl,t3_1129m7j,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2023-02-14T16:22:54Z,chibears,0.0097231234157081

Otherwise teams will just hire the day after the superbowl (oth the second it ends) and it wouldn't fid any of the issues. 

So this gives new GMs and or Coaches 3 weeks after being hired to, 

* Move your family across the country and everything that includes

* Appraise all of their current staff and coaches (there's ussually alot of turnover) 

* Interview and hire any new staff

* Apraise the current roster, and make a long term plan for the team. 

* Understand other teams needs and who's available

* Understand the draft to the point where you know you can be less/more aggressive at some postions beacuse you know there are going to be players available that fit your team at said postions. 

* Decide on major free agents. You're not supposed to talk to them before free agency officially begins, but teams sign players seconds into free agency, so there's no way that's true. 

Then your 3 weeks are up, and you have another 7 to interview and sign free agents and build a draft board.  

There's no way you can confidently do that in 8 weeks let alone 3 weeks

31815,178513,178513,SwissyVictory,"Teams hiring head coaches and GMs are already at a huge disadvantage compared to the rest of the league. 

Especially for new GMs or head coaches who have a say over some/all of the roster.  Even if your coach has no advice or input on the roster, their schemes are going to be at minimum slightly different requiring different player valuations.

Right now teams need to hire their guys then get the whole front office ready for free agency in April. They have 2 months to do an impossible task. If this rule would go into effect teams would now have one month.

Even worse, you'd need to realistically make it so they hire a week after the superbowl or can't interview coaches at all until after the superbowl. 

Otherwise teams are going to interview before hand, and hire their head coaches the day after the superbowl before they even have a chance to interview anyone after the superbowl.

So what this would really do is help coaches on the deep playoff teams get hired, and not put teams who are doing their due dillegence in the hiring proccess at a disadvantage over the few other teams also hiring head coaches.  It also puts a team that has a head coach retire after a deep playoff run have a chance at some of the earlier coaching candidates. 

This is going to hurt every team that would have hired their coaches earlier in the proccess who are already at a major disadvantage to other teams.

32796,185924,185924,ThatsNotRight123,"First off let me say I am in favor of keeping Fields this season. Most QBs make a 2nd year ""jump"" -- and since Fields first year was under that idiot Nagy I consider it a throwaway. I consider 2023 as Fields 2nd season for all intents and purposes -- and I believe he is about to make that leap.

That being said, there ARE a lot of reasons to trade him. First you mention you want to build a strong team outside of QB (like the 9ers). If we could trade him for picks that we convert into two solid O-Lineman that start for 6-8 years wouldn't that help us do that? Would Levis/Stroud/Whoever + 2 solid O-lineman be better in 2024 than Fields + the O-line without those picks? 

Second is timing. We have 3 years left on his rookie deal. If he IS the guy we may have to start paying him after 2023. Can we build a competitive team in 24 and 25 and beyond with a QB making more money? That won't be a problem with a QB we draft now.

To me character is important, and one of the reasons Chicago is unique is that this place has character. It has personality. In this country you can go to ANY fucking suburb and it is all the fucking same -- whether you are in suburban Chicago or Indianapolis or Atlanta or Dallas or Denver. There is a strip mall with a Dicks Sporting goods, a Petsmart, and a Best Buy. There is an Applebees or a Chilis or a Chik-Fil-A in the massive parking lot. Replicate this a million times. It is all just the same boring dull homogenous suburban crap.

But Chicago isn't the same. Soldier Field isn't the same. Soldier Field is -- as Jules would say -- ""one charming motherfucking pig"".

Now we are giving up that charm for something as base as money, and it is kind of a shame. We are sacrificing games like we had week 1 or we had when we beat the Saints to go to the Super Bowl for the same damn thing anyone can find in Minnesota, or Indianapolis, or New Jersey, or Atlanta.
