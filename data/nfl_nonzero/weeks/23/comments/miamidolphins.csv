Yeah let's just throw this one away right now lol

So based on your links KC was pretty much a top 3 Super Bowl contender pick across the board. 

>Preseason odds had our win total tied with the Broncos and chargers, and below the bills of course.

This football reference link shows them having the third best preseason Super Bowl odds besides Tampa, even though the win total was tied with the Broncos.

What was actually predicted is a far cry from ""nobody thought we would win"". 

May be an unpopular opinion but the pompous yelling by T. Kelce after their playoff wins and the playing the victim card after the Super Bowl win knocked Travis a few pegs down for me personally.
