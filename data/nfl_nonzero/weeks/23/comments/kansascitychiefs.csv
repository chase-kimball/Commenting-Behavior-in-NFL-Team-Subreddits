681,2333,2333,AU_wde_2,"This will be an interesting draft and off-season for us, after SB54 I think Veach fell into this winners fallacy of yeah we have to improve buuuuut we can have a little fun with it - aka drafting Clyde in the first. I think it was a valuable lesson for him and we won’t see that sort of “this pick is a luxury” mentality towards our picks anymore 

The big ticket FA items are:
- Extend and restructure Frank or cut, after listening to Frank all week talk about Andy and seeing that clip of those two after the AFCCG win, I think they both agree on the prior 
- Tag & trade or re-sign Orlando Brown, I’m stuck on this one, because while he certainly turned it up over the latter half of the season he’s still not a top 3 LT and that’s what he’s going to want to be paid like. He can probably field a reasonable 1st round pick but if we do give him that top dollar contract I won’t be pissed but it’ll be a cointoss of a decision 
- Re-sign or let Andrew Wylie walk, he is complete value, I can’t imagine him commanding a large contract and similar to Brown has played well over the second half of the season. Still he’s not a long term solution
- Re-sign or let Juju &/or Mecole walk, since Hardman sat a good chunk of the season I think we may be able to get him back on a reasonable one year “prove it” type deal which I’d be for and Juju I’d have back but not for a ton of money, throwing numbers at the wall something like $15-17M/yr would be fair 
- Re-sign Jet McKinnon, to me it’s a no brainer, of course you carry the risk he’ll get injured but he was extremely valuable to us in the long run and given his age at the position should be a bargain bin contract 
- Re-sign or let walk Thornhill, I wouldn’t mind having him back but he’s not a guy you break the bank for so I wouldn’t be surprised if he walks to find bigger money elsewhere

As for the draft:
- DLine is a priority, maybe rose tented goggles but I feel our defense is one stellar pass rusher away from being dominant 
- Tackles are also a priority, if OBJ is out then we need a starting LT quality guy which is going to be hard to find at pick 31, maybe with a tag and trade option we’d have the draft capitol to get both a higher quality DE and LT 
- Safety, Cook is designated as a SS, so technically we’d be missing a FS unless they think they can make Cook work otherwise we’d need to make a move given Thornhill walks
- Corner, we’ve got our starters set but we go 4 deep which is really playing with fire so another later round flyer would be a great pick
- WR, we won’t truly know the need until a few moves are made but if Juju & Mecole walk then this moves up pretty high because we’d be rostering Toney, Moore & MVS with the hopes Justyn Ross can emerge which would need some work 

Frankly as of now, (for 1 I don’t really care about this cause we just won the SB) but we won’t know a ton about this drafts plans till some FA moves have been made, all we can do is speculate and look at the roster in its current construction what areas need improvement",10.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_112we1f,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2023-02-15T09:23:15Z,kansascitychiefs,0.29693203125

Sure I’m still a *little* skeptical if he’ll be able to shine as brightly when the Great Wall isn’t standing in front of him but I’ve seen supposed better QB’s squander even better opportunities with their own subpar play and he didn’t do that - if you’re starting a franchise and you get the pool of NFC QB’s to choose from he’s going #1.

Or the coaching mismatch. Like, Reid and even Spags were running rings around the Eagles. We had our defenders in the right place to make a play time and time again - that's why the Eagles had 18 third downs or something to begin with. But Hurts made the plays anyway, dropping balls into tight windows, trusting his receivers to make a play, juuuust barely running faster than Saunders or Danna or whoever was nearby.

""My earliest Chiefs memory is lying on my living room floor, in my huge oversized red sweatshirt, watching Lin Elliot be unable to kick to save his life. But I remembered the 'glory days' of my early childhood, symbolized by the Joe Montana poster on my bedroom door, and so I didn't take That Game as the warning it was.

Man, I remember Tony G being called out of bounds against the Broncos the next year (replay review was instituted for the 98 playoffs), when he was clearly in, as the Chiefs lost by a touchdown and the goddamn cheating Broncos went on to win their first Super Bowl. I remember Stoyanavich missing the final game-winner of the season against the Raiders, who we had beaten something like 10 times in a row. Make that and we're in the playoffs - instead, he missed, the Chiefs went home, and three weeks later Derrick Thomas was in a car accident.

I saw the no-punt game, the pathetic 2006 and 2010 wild card showings, but as I grew up and moved out of town, I didn't watch religiously anymore. I checked in every now and then, to see us bumping along at the bottom.

In 2013, the first year Reid was our head coach, and the Chiefs were playing the Colts in the playoffs, I was in Florida at a restaurant with my whole family, and we got into a furious argument about whether or not you had to stick with your hometown team forever. My mother stubbornly insisted that I was raised a Chiefs fan and a Chiefs fan I would stay, while I wanted to know why I should subject myself to this pain and humiliation every single year (on the television screen above our table, the Chiefs quietly imploded).

But Smith, Charles, and Reid seemed to invigorate a fun new era of Chiefs football. 2014 and 2015 were dominated by the Royals, but I remember being thrilled at seeing my first-ever playoff win (I couldn't remember Joe's) as we thumped the Texans 30-0. Sure, we lost to the Patriots the next week, but we'd shown we could do it. And so I stuck by, even as we failed to score a touchdown against the Steelers in 2016. And I remember being out to dinner (again) during the Titans game in 2017. ""See, they're winning!"" my girlfriend at the time said, pointing to the 20-3 score. ""I don't trust anything until the game is over, I said."" (You all know how that one ended).

I was crushed after the 2018 AFCCG, but also weirdly at peace. We had proven we were respectable. We had our first ever MVP. And under Mahomes? We just might break through, at last.

Moral of the story, guys: don't take today for granted. We are in our third SB in four years, and that's awesome. Even if we lose, there's no team in the league that wouldn't trade places with us.

The biggest difference IMO is unlike Gronk and much of Travis career, Tony didn't have a hall of fame caliber QB throwing to him. Obviously Matt Ryan was great but that was only in his latter years after he established himself.

If Tony didn't have a carasol of nobodies throwing him the ball verses all time great talents like the other dudes, then I think people would pretty much have to recognize him in the one spot.

I watched Matt Cassel and Tyler Thigpen take snaps under center.

When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

If he’s going to stay with the Chiefs, I would be alright with him succeeding Andy under the following circumstances:

1. Remove the “Run Game Coordinator” aspect of his role and give the full offense to him in 2023. The rumor I’ve heard is that he and Nagy essentially split the offense right now with Nagy having the passing. EB should be running the whole thing if he wants to step into Andy’s shoes. 

2. By 2024 Andy should have relinquished 100% of the play calling to EB. 

3. The Chiefs confirm that EB has the support of the player captains of the team (Mahomes, Kelce, Humphrey, Jones, Bolton, Sneed). 

Then in 3-4 years EB succeeds Andy. I would much rather have Andy around for another 6-8 years but not a lot of coaches go into their 70s.

 It’s well understood in KC that the offense runs through Andy Reid. With past OCs (Pederson, Nagy) varying levels of control have been given to those guys to run the offense. For whatever reason, the perception is that Bieniemy hasn’t been given that same level of freedom and control over the offense. If that’s true, maybe the reason is because Reid doesn’t trust that he’s ready for it.

15936,115929,115929,KeegoTheWise,"“Warned by refs” could have gone something like “Bradberry, bud, you can’t do that. That’s getting a flag next time I see it.” Maybe I’m just ascribing the in-game talk between NHL players and refs that I’ve heard to the NFL, but who knows. Heck, there might have been no warning at all, and the refs just missed the earlier call because it’s a fast game and they’re human

Otherwise I totally agree. Inconsistency sucks, especially for us fans who aren’t privy to the on-field communication taking place. I would have preferred they called the PI in Q2 to keep calls consistent, but at the same time it’s kinda dumb to say *they missed a call before so they’re not allowed to call it at all*

I can’t say for certain if this call gets made had the prior PI not happened, but I also think the Chiefs were likely to score on that drive had the missed PI not forced them to punt. If no PI occurs, if the refs actually called the PI, if the refs were consistent in the second half about what constitutes a catch; if *any* of these things happened then the Chiefs are kicking that field goal already up one score. At that point, I don’t think nearly as many complain about this call (or a lack of call) because the score wouldn’t have been as close

Again, totally understand why it would be frustrating to be on the receiving end of this call tied at 35-35 with 91 seconds left in the SB. But I can’t ignore the fact that it was tied that late in the game in part due to multiple instances of ref inconsistency that went in the Eagles favor",1.0,nfl,t3_111ifmb,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs :Lions: Lions,2023-02-14T12:47:02Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0031364755868911

Notice the jersey-stretching hand is the right one while everyone complaining about the call points to the contact with his left hand later in the route.

Also, I put neutral in quotes because it doesn’t mean unbiased. There’s been a lot of nephews online coming out saying “as a neutral fan, refs did everything in their power to give KC another win” despite literally every other controversial (tho more often than not, correct) call in the game going the Eagles way.  Let me ask you this, would you care about this call if they had correctly flagged Bradberry for PI on Juju in the second quarter?

This video very clearly demonstrates that a lot of (not all, but a lot of) what we typically think of sports analysis these days has devolved into just a race to try and come up with the next “hot take”. It’s just heads and mouths competing with one another in a race to outdo what they said the day before. Why? Because that’s what goes viral. “Oh my god - did you hear Skip yesterday?!” There’s no real merit to it. No value. Just a race to the overly absurd. No one learns anything either. It’s just, noise. 

Keep that in mind over the off-season and leading into next year. Some of these people that we tend to think of as knowledgeable sports minds are not paid by their expertise of the game, but rather by the number of likes, retweets and ratings their latest take can generate. Their job performance has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not their opinions (not analysis) was correct. If it did, none of these people would still have a job.

27708,180783,180783,RedScribbles,"Like this one.

Why is there no talk about the Chiefs missing the playoffs, and Patrick Mahomes not being thought of as a Top 5 QB after this season ends? This is a very plausible (if not likely) scenario.

I've been very surprised this off-season about the lack of discussion around the Chiefs missing the playoffs, and even more so surprised by Patrick Mahomes consistently being Top 2 on most QB lists.

To start, I don't believe Patrick Mahomes was a Top 5 QB this past season. But I understand that when you've had as much success as he has to start a career, it takes more than 1 season to knock you out of the Top 5. 

Additionally, as I'm sure I will be asked about it, I would've taken Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Justin Herbert, Joe Burrow and Josh Allen's seasons above Mahomes. I also believe Matt Stafford played better than him this past season, *but do not believe Matt Stafford is a better QB than Mahomes.*

There are a number of reasons to think that by the end of this season, Patrick Mahomes will not be a Top 5 QB, and without him being at that level, the Chiefs will miss the playoffs in a loaded AFC.

My analysis also is largely based on the talent Mahomes has had to start his career. I believe with a Top 5 All-Time Tight End, a Top 3 All Time Coach, and the best ""speed"" WR to ever play in the NFL, he has had a situation most QB's can only dream of, and that has led most to falsely rate his individual play.

&#x200B;

1. Well the Chiefs offense had a good EPA/play last season, Patrick Mahomes PFF grade was very poor. His 77.1 grade ranked 11th among all QBs. As we all know, PFF is not the gospel, but it is the best indicator of QB play we have, as EPA/Play, QBR, Passer Rating, etc is all heavily dependent on how good the rest of the offense is. With two HOF receivers and a HOF Coach, the rest of the offense is going to be quite good, and drive up those stats.
2. Patrick Mahomes did not show an ability to adjust to different defensive concepts last year, and success this year will rely on him adjusting constantly, due to inferior receiving talent (compared to previous years). His struggles when Tyreek Hill was taken out of the game in Cover 2 scenarios were something that plagued him all year, and in the playoffs.
3. The loss of Tyreek Hill. This probably could be #1 on the list. Chiefs fans will point to Mahomes stats in 5 career games without Hill, but neglect the fact that 4 of those 5 teams won less than 7 games those years. No one is doubting Mahomes ability to beat up on 7 win teams without Hill, that will happen. But against strong competition, the loss of Tyreek Hill will be a massive factor. This was shown in the 2021 playoffs. Against the Bills, Tyreek singlehandedly took over the game in the 4th quarter. After a drive to put the Bills in the lead, Mahomes threw a 10 yard dig to Hill, who then took the pass another 50 yards to the end zone, out running the entire Bills defense. Then with 13 seconds left, it was Tyreek's speed that allowed for a big completion on play #1, and then, the Bills were clearly terrified of another Hill 60 yard masterpiece, that they left a Top 5 TE all time in basically single coverage! Allowing for an easy completion and Field Goal. Tyreek Hill is a true gamewrecker, he makes everyone on the field better, because of the attention he has to receive. The Chiefs and Mahomes will miss that dearly, and it will show.
4. Travis Kelce's age. Kelce is 32, and with each year it becomes more likely to see a drop off. I don't think a massive drop off is likely, and even with Kelce at full strength points 1-3 apply. But if he does drop off, then I expect Mahomes drop off to get worse.
5. The schedule. The Chiefs have 3 easy wins on their schedule, the rest is loaded with top teams and top defenses.
6. The Chiefs without a Top 5 QB, do not have a playoff caliber roster in a loaded AFC with a very tough schedule. 

&#x200B;

In summary, I do not believe Mahomes played like a Top 5 QB last year (11th PFF Graded QB) and believe that his play will decline further this year due to the reasons above. This decline will help lead to the Chiefs missing the playoffs, which will in turn strengthen the belief among most fans that Patrick Mahomes is no longer a Top 5 QB in the NFL.

I would expect at year end, the Top 5 to be Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Justin Herbert, Joe Burrow and Josh Allen. With another 1-2 QBs making the jump in front of Mahomes (hard to predict exactly who, just as it was hard to predict Burrow, Herbert, Mahomes, Allen before their breakout years)",1.0,nfl,t3_1137y1d,False,1.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2023-02-15T17:07:57Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0042986031823889

resign Jerrick McKinnon. He plays a very specialized role with us and wouldnt garner near as much success in most other schemes, so i feel like this means we wont have to overpay him.

let Mecole Hardman walk (sadly. but Toney does everything he does, and better)

Let Justin Watson walk. Best 6th string WR in the league for sure lol but we have Justyn Ross hopefully breaking into lineups, as well as the chance of drafting someone. There's just no room for Watson unless both Hardman and Juju walk. 

Resign RT Andrew Wylie. Think he proved he can be a starter after his back half of the season. he does let up some sacks, but not a worrisome level.

Resign LT Orlando Brown Jr. Yeah he sucked ass first half of the season and wants a lot of money, but dude was a baller 2nd half. And hes the best available FA tackle so literally cant do better. Possibly could sign and trade him, using the first rounder on an o-lineman either to straight up draft or as part of a package to trade up and get a for sure stud.

let safety, juan thornhill walk unless we can get him cheap cheap. Hes been aight, but nothing that cant be easily replaced.

Resign DE Carlos Dunlap/another D line vet for cheap. Can never have enough pass rush

DT Nnadi - no clue. he plays that position that doesnt produce tangible stats like sacks, he sets up other guys to make plays. so its hard to judge his worth to the team without like doing flim study and I dont wanna do that lol

I would have said cut Clark before the playoffs, but if he can be this dude every playoff run then fuck it, lets keep his clutch ass.

Laugh at denver some and remind them fortnite didnt even exist last time they beat us.

then we have 12 picks in this draft. Which is absolutely phenomenal because we dont have many holes. Either we trade some picks for a right tackle, or we draft a pass rusher/safety in the first, o-line/safety in the 2nd, and whatever other hidden gems Veach sees for the rest of the draft.

I knew that was pretty hard to argue against on the offensive side (because - let's be real, our Patty/Kelce/Reid led offense is legit), but it's kinda hard to win a lot of games if you're not at least really good on defense so i knew you were not trash.  How big that gap between ""what we've seen you do against teams not us"" and ""what you'd against us"" was going to be i wasn't sure, but I thought with your edges and our tackles it'd be quite interesting.  Our scheme was the difference maker I think - that became apparent in the 2nd quarter.  Plus I mean jesus, Mahomes at times isn't real.  


Our defense against your offense...Jalen scared the crap out of me and the reason for that was on full obvious display, kid's as real as it gets.  I knew we'd be better than expectations as the latter third of the season and during the playoffs our D really started performing well (not shutdown well, but well enough to allow us to beat CIN), and therefore we'd get some stops against you all.  I wasn't sure how big the difference between our stopping power and your running power would be, but I gave you all the edge there (like everyone else).  Your Thanos-level QB sneak will haunt me for years to come.  Seriously, it needs to be called Thanos in your playbook.  Seeing Chris Jones get forcibly crowdsurfed 3 yards downfield blew my freaking mind.


Bonus anecdote: I legit had a dream 2 days before that we'd win and Killatrav would be our top receiver and that shit actually happened.

And multiple replays showed the ball wasn't catchable because the route was altered due to the route runner being held twice before it ever came out. Hence, it's a holding call.

>  
>　1997年に大学卒業後に横浜ベイスターズ社に入社した小島さんは、7月に来日したパットさんの通訳を担当。毎日家に通い、マホームズの世話をした。「2歳前後の彼（マホームズ）のおむつを交換していました。日本にいる間におむつを卒業したことを覚えています」と振り返った。  
>  
>　マホームズ家とは今でも交流がある。今年年始にマホームズに「プレーオフいけそうだね」とメッセージすると「頑張るよ！」と丁寧に返信が来たという。素顔は「本当に謙虚」だという。「今後も活躍が楽しみです」とエールを送った。

>  
>A “Japanese Babysitter” congratulated Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (27) on winning the MVP at Super Bowl 57. From 1997 to 1998, Kojima—now president of the Sports Culture Lab at 49—was the interpreter for Mahomes’ father Pat, who was a pitcher for the Yokohama Bay Stars at the time. “I knew he’d be great, congratulations,” Kojima praised.  
>  
>After graduating college in 1997, Kojima joined the Yokohama BayStars organization. Upon joining he was tasked with interpreting for Pat Mahomes Sr, who arrived in Japan in July of that year. Kojima recalls taking care of Mahomes daily, “I remember changing his diapers when he was around 2. He graduated from diapers while living in Japan.”  
>  
>Mr. Kojima still keeps in touch. “Looks like you’re headed for the playoffs,” He sent to Mahomes in a message at the beginning of the year. “I’ll do my best!” Mahomes replied. Kojima describes Mahomes true self as, “very humble.”  
>  
>“I look forward to seeing more of your efforts in the future!” Kojima cheered.

It was pretty obvious to see.  I was high up in the stands at the game, and I could see it live and could not believe there was not a flag. I can’t imagine how obvious it would be on TV or field level.  Point being, we suffered from bad calls or no-calls as well throughout the game that may have hindered our ability to put points on the board.  Everyone always likes to complain about a call in crunch time, because it seems the most important, but in reality, calls of that nature impact the game throughout the ENTIRE game.  Also, I really do believe that Juju could’ve gotten to that ball to score the TD if he hadn’t been hindered.  Additionally, I’m not sure that I’ve ever seen a fan base become so salty over a call, even after their own player came out and admitted to the penalty being legit and admitting fault ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16eXhNwokK4)).

Additionally, in the modern league, most top RBs are asked to be pass catchers in some capacity. Henry is once again the obvious outlier in this.

47400,311662,311662,jeffp12,"Man I get why that ending was underwhelming for anyone other than Chiefs fans. 

I feel like that ending was really similar to the Chiefs-Bengals regular season game from last year: https://youtu.be/kU6yIpghmLU?t=798

It was a back and forth game, tied in the 4th quarter...and then penalties...and then kneel downs into a fg and the Chiefs never got to touch the ball again. As a neutral fan, I can 100% see why you want the chiefs to kick the FG then get a chance for the Eagles to tie/win it, then a chance at OT, etc. 

But my god, the degree of salt, or accusations of rigging are ridiculous. After that no-catch fumble (which I agree was not a catch, and said so at the time), but how do you see that and then think they're going to rig the game with some bs later when they could have just let that stand? 

Also Bradberry held JuJu worse in the first half and it wasn't called: https://streamable.com/djflj9

So to me one of those two getting called pretty much evens it out. If the Chiefs go down and score on this drive instead of punting there, the Chiefs probably arent' in a 10 point hole at the half. 

I think it's really just timing and just like in that Bengals-Chiefs game it kinda feels like refs are playing too much of a role...but what are you going to do, not call penalties anymore in the last 4 minutes of a game just because? 

If the NFL were rigging anything, you know it would be to get the crazy back-and-forth 4th quarter, possible OT, not some kneel downs and a fg and no chance for the Eagles to respond.",8.0,nfl,t3_111b61y,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2023-02-13T13:56:06Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0454241121710524

But not enough people could hear him and so the play kinda happened. But there's a replay where you can see him running in to stop it. You cannot count a play where one of the refs is blowing his whistle. That could have gone both ways. IF the Chiefs had made a big play...it wouldn't have counted and then everyone would have said it was rigged for the Bengals. And in any case, the redo didn't actually change anything, the Chiefs still ended up punting. 

That questionable holding call? It was holding. It wasn't an eggregious hold...that happened in the first half and they didn't call it: https://streamable.com/djflj9

People just want to see bias everywhere, when the most likely explanation is just that refs are imperfect.

I thought this is how our season will end. Coming up short once again in the Super Bowl. We’d toil all off season on who was to blame for the loss, how do we fix this, etc etc. 

It was a familiar feeling because I had those exact same doubts during the Texans game when we were down 24 points. I had that feeling during Super Bowl LIV when Patrick had thrown is 2nd interception in the fourth quarter and we were down 10 points. I had that feeling last year during the divisional round when Josh Allen scored a go ahead touchdown with 13 seconds left on the clock.

When that same doubt crept into me, that’s when I knew we’d win. In Mahomes and Reid I trust evermore. No lead is insurmountable, no defense impenetrable, and no game too big for our guys.

I know the narrative of all season has been “Mahomes has done this without Hill” but in that particular scenario I am less confident w/o him. If we’re down a field goal with 13 seconds left on our own 25, I am less confident of us pulling it off this year.

2. Two of those losses came on super bowls 😭 but i would definitely lean on the Chiefs to have the more experienced and better coaching staff overall.

3. The Chiefs have shown a remarkable ability to stop the run game in the playoffs. We held Henry and the titans to sub 50 yards in the afcc when they were at their peak and did similar to the 49ers during sb LIV. I’d say our defense is actually better against the run this year than those. They will have prepped for the run game extensively and while Philly will still get a big run or two, I don’t think they’ll be able to run at will.

Either thru the New Heights podcast relation, or the Andy Reid connection, or the fact that we both played our bigger nemesis enroute to this game during the playoffs and don’t have the emotional capacity to “hate” the other team.
