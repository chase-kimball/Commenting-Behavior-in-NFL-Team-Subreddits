Sure, I agree with this sentiment in a vacuum, but it doesn‚Äôt apply to us. The thing is we still ran quite a bit to close out games.

5193,34173,34173,DangoAteYourBaby,"I see your point but that doesn‚Äôt apply to our season.

In our week 1 win against Carolina, Chubb ran the ball 12 times in the first half while the game was still a close 10 point game, score being 17-7. We aren‚Äôt running the ball to burn clock in the first half so those runs don‚Äôt apply. We go up 20-7 with 4:24 left in the 3rd quarter, and Chubb touches the ball 0 times before the Panthers make it a 20-14 game where the game becomes too close to burn clock. Chubb ran 8 times in the second half when the game became much closer, so I wouldn‚Äôt say he had more touches because of the lead seeing as we never really had an insurmountable lead in that game. Chubb ran 22 times this game. 

The Steelers week 3 game was a close game so no correlation there. The final score makes it seem like a more dominant performance then it really was. It was a one possession game with a score of 23-17 until the last 9 seconds of the fourth quarter when our defense scored on a fumble to make it 29-17. So there was never opportunity to run out the clock with Chubb in this game. If he was running, it was because we needed to score, not kill time. Chubb ran 23 times this game. 

Week 8 against the Bengals, Chubb runs 14 times to get us up 18 points halfway through the 3rd quarter. He then touches the ball only 9 times the rest of the game. Before we were up 18, we were up 11. We aren‚Äôt running to run out the clock only up 11, so I don‚Äôt count his touches before we‚Äôre up 18 as touches that would apply towards running out the clock. So we actually ran him less when we had a lead worth burning clock to protect. Chubb ran 23 times this game. 

Tampa bay game was an OT thriller and as we all remember we actually came from behind that game, so your theory doesn‚Äôt apply here either. Chubb ran 26 times this game. 

Houston game he only ran 17 times and we won 27-14. But this game is an outlier. We would have lost if we had to rely solely on our offense for points as we only generated 6 points (2 FG‚Äôs) on offense. Our three touchdowns came from a DPJ punt return for a TD, a Denzel Ward fumble return for a TD, and a Tony Fields II interception return for a TD. But still all that aside, Chubb only ran the ball 2 times after we had a 16 point lead, the first lead in the game worth burning clock for. I‚Äôm not counting any runs before we are up 2 possessions as runs designed to burned clock. He ran the ball 15 times before we reached that lead. So once again we actually ran him less when we had a lead worth burning clock to protect. Chubb ran 17 times this game. 

Week 14 vs Baltimore we won 13-3. Goes without saying this game was so close that we never had a lead worth burning clock to protect. But for the sake of the argument let‚Äôs count his runs after we go up 13-3 as clock burning runs. Chubb ran 9 times after that lead. He ran 12 times before that point. So even if you decide that those 9 runs were ran to protect the clock he once again touched the ball less when we had a lead. Chubb ran the ball 21 times this game. 

And in our last win against Washington we won 24-10, with Chubb running the ball 14 times. Chubb didn‚Äôt run the ball once when we had a lead worth burning clock to protect. All 14 of those runs came before we went up 2 possessions with a score of 24-10. 

So while I understand the point you were trying to make, it‚Äôs incorrect. It makes sense in a vacuum. But when you apply it to the season we just had it doesn‚Äôt add up.",1.0,browns,t3_10ygvx4,False,1.0,:chubbatman:,2023-02-10T04:49:31Z,browns,4.298466020342834e-09

One of the wins where he didn‚Äôt get 20 attempts but still won was the Commies game where Watson was actually cooking so we didn‚Äôt need to rely on him. And the other was the Texans game, Watsons first game back so we were giving him more reps to get him back in the groove. And we only won that game because of our defense.

>Amid the lobbying blitz against stronger transportation safety regulations, Norfolk Southern paid executives millions and spent billions on stock buybacks ‚Äî all while the company shed thousands of employees despite warnings that understaffing is intensifying safety risks. Norfolk Southern officials also fought off a shareholder initiative that could have required company executives to ‚Äúassess, review, and mitigate risks of hazardous material transportation.‚Äù

>‚ÄùPrior to the stock buyback era, railroads agreed that ECP brakes were a good thing,‚Äù said Ron Kaminkow, a longtime railroad worker and organizer with Railroad Workers United. ‚ÄúThe railroads hadn‚Äôt yet come to the realization that they could do whatever they wanted. ECP brakes were on the drawing board, then off.‚Äù

> The railroad, oil, and chemical industries came out in full force against the regulation, arguing the new requirements would be disruptive and costly. The American Association of Railroads (AAR) ‚Äî a lobbying group to which Norfolk Southern has long been a dues-paying member ‚Äî in particular fought the ECP braking standards.

>‚ÄùAAR strongly opposes any requirement to use ECP brakes,‚Äù the association said in one of multiple comment letters on the rule. ‚ÄúECP brakes would be extremely costly without providing an offsetting benefit‚Ä¶ [the Federal Railroad Administration] assumed that business benefits would more than compensate for the costs of ECP brakes, but industry to this day has not identified business benefits that would justify transitioning to ECP brakes.‚Äù

> A Tier 2 quarterback can carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.

> A Tier 3 quarterback is a legitimate starter but needs a heavier running game and/or defensive component to win. A lower-volume dropback passing offense suits him best.

> A Tier 4 quarterback could be an unproven player (not enough information for voters to classify) or a veteran who ideally would not start all 17 games.

> A Tier 5 quarterback is best suited as a backup.

If you have a Tier 1 or Tier 2 you pay them whatever it takes to keep them (and if you dont have one you should do whatever you can to get one). You can win a Super Bowl because of those guys. Tier 3 and below are guys would win despite having them as your QB, or because they were on cheap rookie deals where you could put loads of talent around them. If you have a T1/T2 QB you have ""the guy"".

Tier 1 is like... Mahomes, Burrow, Rodgers, Allen.

Upper part of Tier 2 contains guys like Stafford, Lamar, T-Law. Kirk Cousins is debateably around the bottom of Tier 2, according to its description.

Whether you pay Carr or not depends on where you think he can land on this scale. For my money he's probably among the best of the Tier 3 guys. 

If you've got a non-rookie contract QB who isn't firmly T2 or T1 you should be wary of how much money you give them, whether you can get out of their contract, and what you're going to do to allow yourself the possibility of acquiring a new QB through draft or trade. Even if you can't get better at the position you should consider getting cheaper.

To their credit... this is partially what the Raiders have done. They evaluated Carr as not being T1/T2 and gave themselves the option to move on, and if they can't get a guy better than Carr they can certainly get cheaper.",2.0,nfl,t3_112fhrl,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2023-02-15T07:15:17Z,browns,0.0254920823961251

35158,250351,250351,tedrivers,"Mazi Smith souring report:

SCOUTING REPORT: STRENGTHS

A compactly built, high-motor lineman, Smith brings a nice blend of power and quickness. Smith shows impressive get-off, often exploding off the line and getting into gaps before blockers can react.

Crazy athletic skills -- Made Bruce Feldman's 'Freaks List' at number 1. He wrote: ""The 6-foot-3, 337-pound senior has rare power and agility. Smith does 22 reps on the bench press, but that‚Äôs with 325 (not 225). He close-grip benched 550 pounds. He vertical-jumps 33 inches. He broad-jumped 9-4 1/2. Smith, who had 37 tackles last season, has clocked a 4.41 shuttle time, which would‚Äôve tied the best by any defensive tackle at this year‚Äôs NFL Scouting Combine, and it would‚Äôve been better than any defensive tackle weighing 310 pounds or more in the past decade. His 6.95 3-cone time would‚Äôve been by far the fastest among defensive tackles in Indianapolis. The fastest was 7.33. Smith‚Äôs 60-yard shuttle time is 11.90.""

Provides some secondary interior pass rush, getting most penetration when playing three-technique.

He has the strong core and powerful hands to shed blockers, and he shows excellent instincts with the ability to quickly locate the ball.

Can make the impressive chest-to-chest bear hug tackle in the hole due to his ability to wreak havoc in the backfield.

Amazing weight-room strength, which translates onto the field in terms of his anchor.

Smith plays with leverage and brings good power, especially in his lower body, consistently holding up against double teams in the run game.


SCOUTING REPORT: WEAKNESSES

He‚Äôs a bit stiff, as Smith lacks the flexibility to truly threaten the edge.

Smith frequently fails to locate the ball in the run game, too often taking himself out of plays.

Despite having impressive speed Smith lacks the elite suddenness as a mover you look for, and doesn't do enough in the pass rush when working one-on-one.


Michael Wilson scouting report:

SCOUTING REPORT: STRENGTHS

He‚Äôs equally dangerous in catch-and-run situations as Wilson is taking the top off a defense

Wilson has reliable hands and shows the willingness to make catches in traffic over the middle.

He catches the ball with his large, soft hands and is tough. Deceptive jets and a smooth route runner.

Escaping the jam won‚Äôt be a problem with his upper-body strength and quick hands. He‚Äôll help as a perimeter blocker in the run game.

Wilson runs precise routes, showing an innate feel for setting up defensive backs to create separation.

Physical player able to get off press coverage to release up the sideline or position himself inside the cornerback on slants and crossing routes.

SCOUTING REPORT: WEAKNESSES

Wilson lacks the twitch to create consistent separation, and despite his size and ability to track the ball downfield, Wilson isn‚Äôt great on contested catches.

Wilson doesn‚Äôt have the ability as a run blocker or the violent run-after-catch ability.

Plagued by injuries while playing on an awful Stanford team - only managed six games in 2022

Wilson's ability to take the top off of a defense was questioned - but he may have quashed these criticisms during an outstanding week at the Senior Bowl

The score was tied. Up until that point in the game, the good and bad plays for both teams had balanced out. Then a finger got put on the scale.
