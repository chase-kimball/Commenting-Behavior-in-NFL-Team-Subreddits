130,287,287,09-24-11,"The Saints often restructure contracts of their good players such as Cam Jordan (twice). During the restructure the player benefits because base salary is converted to guaranteed money, so the player is happy. The team is happy because it allows the GM to move cap hits to open space, but the cap hits don’t disappear. They increase in later years. Example: 

> Jordan restructured his contract with the Saints on March 6, 2021 for cap purposes. We are estimating that Jordan will receive a $1.1 million salary and a $12.7 million signing bonus. The move will create $9.525 million in cap space for the Saints in 2021 and increase Jordan's salary cap number by $3.175 million in each of the 2022 to 2024 seasons.

The Saints have done this with Jordan, Kamara, Thomas, Ramscyk, Davis. 

This is not “cheating” the cap and the cap is not a myth as some like to think. The Saints have lost Marcus Williams and Trey Hendrickson and many others as cap casualties. 

“Why don’t more teams do this” they do all the time and we have as well. We did this with CJ Mosley this past offseason. The key is that you need good players you reasonably want to keep around for a long time, the Jets have no had this until recently. Some GMs also want the flexibility to their books clean. Cap manipulation is objectively a negative thing for the GM to do, it’s a desperation move. The Saints get the call outs from fans because they’re typically in the negative every year pre-restructures so it looks like magic but it’s not.

From the literal broadcast game footage.

Mahomes releases the ball at 5 seconds in.

At 6 seconds in the official on the goal line has already thrown a flag into the air. (look at the top center of the screen at the goal line, don't look at the ball)

At 7 seconds the pass falls incomplete

The defense wasn't too impressive in some of those either, the Detroit/Jacksonville/Indy/Green Bay/Chicago wins were all by one score despite the Eagles being vastly better on paper.

They were certainly a good team, but imo the 14-3 record was a bit of a mirage and with a slightly tough schedule they finish closer to like 12-5/11-6.

13811,99342,99342,NannigarCire,"continuing to write about QBs because i'm feeling the itch to write- Already having gone through my top 3 options of [Lamar](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/10eigeh/qb_weekly_megathread/j4r67v3/), [Rodgers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/10eigeh/qb_weekly_megathread/j4wjht9/?context=3), and [Carr](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/10eigeh/qb_weekly_megathread/j52wkgs/), this ones about my next personal pick: Geno Smith. i don't care if he is likely to be franchised, until he is, he's still an option.

I'm aware this is not who others would have in this spot, so i'll make my case but a lot of it is going to be based on my own appreciation for the player. I've been defending Geno Smith's career for a very long time, and i was always under the belief that 2014 was unfair for him. He was awful in 2013 and the team did him no favors that year on offense, but 2014 was a different story. Eric Decker was bought but constantly injured and spending a lot of time out of the lineup, while Geno was playing well for a long period of the season and keeping games very competitive. But the stats didn't reflect that. Regardless, all but two games he started that year were within 1 score during his final possession. And he was playing with some horrible offensive casts when Decker was off the field either due to being knocked out from his recurring hamstring, or just not active because of it; the other players were Jeremy Kerley, David Nelson, Greg Salad, and Jeff Cumberland with Jace Amaro sprinkled in. Until they brought in Percy Harvin and there was more than one player on the field worth throwing at. And despite this, his numbers when you dig into them weren't as bad as they seemed. His play on the tape (which i went through on all-22 for and broke down) was...good. He was having to cover for other players flaws and doing the best a second year QB could do in that situation. Especailly with the terrible offense that was being called- like these routes were so independent and entirely placing the onus on the receivers and the QB. No rubs, no options, just...be good.

It wasn't without flaws, but it was so clear that some interceptions or bad throws were just other players making the wrong decisions. Comparing it to the following season of Ryan Fitzpatrick and logging all the data i found from both seasons showed what something obvious- the problem for Geno Smith was that against man coverage he had no options. Otherwise, he was killing zone coverage. And that's where the mental game of QBing is most prevalent. Your brain can not help David Nelson beat man coverage. Not consistently.

But that's the past- what happened this year was also obvious to me and clearly surprised a lot of people. Geno Smith, placed in a situation where the receiver talent matched his own, was good. He led the league in completion percentage, put up 7.5 YPA which is higher than Joe Burrow had this year. Geno Smith was 9th in the league in YPA, efficient. The high completion % along with great yardage efficiency, led to him being 8th in the league in getting first downs as a passer. Right on part with him being 8th in the league in passing attempts. So this was a high volume passer, performing high efficiency, and being good at it. He was also careful with the ball with a 1.9% INT rate, 9th best in the league. Geno Smith received 1 MVP vote this year and at the seasons half-way point, he was a legitimate contender for MVP before falling off in the second half. Geno's a big reason why i focus on supporting cast strength when evaluating players now.

I think one thing that's sort of cool, [is this little project from Steven Ruiz of the Ringer](https://qbrankings.theringer.com/)- a beautiful website with fantastic web design. I'm not some Ruiz fan, but i think this idea was great and one thing that stood out to me was Ruiz watching Qbs every week and ranking them- and the ability to hover over the top bar for any QB and see how they were being ranked across the season from week to week. At the start of the season he had Geno ranked 22nd and by the end at rank 11 above Kyler Murray, Kirk Cousins, and Derek Carr. At one point in the season, he had Geno as the 8th best QB in the league. And this isn't just Ruiz, PFF also thought in their grades that Geno's season was top 12 in the league. These values are subjective so these are just to say that people watching the games this year came away seeing a very good player. It's not empty stats, the Seahawks were winning games because of the Geno Smith led offense.

Geno at this point is a known product as far as his skills go, very accurate arm, willing to take risks and make plays, but has a problem specifically with pocket movement. he still gets sacked a high amount. But that doesn't stop him from being good at passing. I think part of the upside with Geno is how much is unknown about what it looks like to maximize his skills and how good or bad he even is at them. The Seahawks offense was built with Russell Wilson in mind, and Geno could play that role pretty effectively but he's not the style of player that Wilson was. I think after the last two years of stepping in for Russell, he's clearly shown that he's not bad but he could be only a Jared Goff-like player, a stopgap with offensive firepower ability. However, because there's also other factors like this being the first season in 8 years where Geno was spending the offseason practicing with the first team and knocking off all the rust that came with it, there's the chance he is still better than he was this year. For all that's known, 2 years with Garrett Wilson and he starts showing some really impressive chemistry that can produce even better seasons.

Another beneficial part of Geno Smith is that it's very possible to pick him up, be very competitive to 2-3 years and then transition to another QB. A problem the Jets will run into with guys like Carr and Rodgers is that with Carr, they're stuck with him for a while if he's not as good as anyone hopes. And with Rodgers, you can not do anything about the QB until 2025 and if Rodgers has no gas in the tank in 2024 then you're screwed. You're probably drafting someone in 2025 to start almost right away. Geno offers a lot more flexibility in that, you can draft a 3rd round QB next year with Geno on the roster and see what happens by 2025 and then recognize if you need to draft another one. All while staying very competitive.

13816,99351,99351,NannigarCire,"So i disagree a lot about this and its purely subjective- but Tannehill has been putting up numbers on a team that does not rely on him. The team he's on is almost entirely based around Derrick Henry and has given him a fantastic offensive line because of Henry. And he had great support with very athletic, talented players who could make plays relatively easily like AJ Brown and Jonnu Smith. Tannehill peaked at 531 attempts in 2021, and at his lowest threw 481 across 16 starts. This is a team that was keeping him tight so they didn't have to use him much. That's not the case with Carr. And while he got lucky to throw to Darren Waller, there is no other player on the field to take attention away from Carr. Until this year where Jacobs suddenly became very good, but unfortunately the team around him got very injured.

*To put a number to this idea, Tannehill since coming to Tennessee- has averaged 28 passes a game that he's started. Out of every QB to throw at least 200 passes since 2019 (that's 63 QBs), that number is 55th in the league. Derek Carr has averaged 33 passes a game in the same period, and he's 37th. He's providing better efficiency over the same time period, on a higher volume, and while having more pressure on him to perform.

On another subjective level- Carr looks more talented than Tannehill. Carr can special throws but his brain keeps him from attempting them because he is conservative. Tannehill is much more maxed out as a player. He's less talented, less impressive as a passer, but plays within his boundaries overall. I think Tannehill is a better pivot from Jimmy Garappolo than he is for Carr.

To me, Carr is in a tier 2.5 area of players who are outside of potentially elite guys (Allen, Burrows, Herbert, Hurts) and can produce in a way that competes with these guys because they have talent but lack the ""intangible"" trait of being good at football, but Tannehill is in the space of Tier 3 firmly alongside players like Goff, Garappolo, and other placeholders who are good enough to start but not good enough to be a yearly engine for your team.

That's why personally, i'd choose Carr over Tannehill because Carr has the potential to go on a Superbowl run where he has 4 immaculate games from the wildcard spot, but i don't think Tannehill can.",3.0,nyjets,t3_1115nin,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-02-14T18:34:26Z,nyjets,0.0019936309451426

Mahomes is insanely careful- with the addition of unbelievable playmaking upside and sack avoidance on top of that. Brady has a higher career sack rate than Patrick Mahomes.

""how to tell a person knows nothing about DMT""

since seemingly you dont know/understand Hallucinogenics, ill explain a bit since it does sound weird if you dont understand how DMT works. Theres reoccurring creatures that often show up for people on DMT, they call them stuff like ""positive"" and ""negative"" entities. Basically, doing DMT, people often see things that are kinda the same. Some examples

 - for some reason, people see elves as being a weird protector. They would be a positive entity, because they help you.

 - often times, people see a dark looking man with a hat doing evil ass shit. My friend said he saw ""the hat guy"" kill a rabbit with a knife. Thats a negative entity because its there to make you fearful, and panic.

Turns out, doing drugs makes you a bit loopy, who wouldve thunk it!(If you think im crazy or some shit you can look this up btw, didnt believe it myself until i looked it up/asked my friend about it.) 

Now lets return to the comparison:

one posts hitler quotes and doubles down on them defending them.

one does Ayahuasca(a relatively normal thing for people who know about Hallucinogenics )

never said that. were getting to the point where it seems kinda like youre projecting other arguments on to me so this will be my last reply to you.

i mean this in the nicest way, dont mention how many years. The amount of times ive seen the stupidest takes justified with ""well ive been alive longer"" is mind numbing.

all of these guys are the same tier. Carrs the higher end person on that tier but they are all tier 2 starting QBs.

Its as simple as this. He is probably one of the best defensive players in our history not name Joe. When he asked for the money he deserved, he had earned, they fucked him around for no reason other than being cheap.

He took a discount to play for a like 50% chance at a superbowl ring. There has never been a freer superbowl ring than most of the patriots rings, prime Brady, prime Belicheck, so many garbage ass dudes have rings from just being like third string kickers on those teams. If i was him, id take the fuckin contract in a heartbeat, how many players do we sit here and say ""he was really good..... but he has 0 rings so....."" ?

it had nothing to do with ""fuck you jets im going to the pats for less!"" as a spite thing. He wanted a ring, and the Patriots all but guaranteed it.",3.0,nyjets,t3_10zeh80,False,0.0,:Retired_Mangold: Nick Mangold,2023-02-11T09:56:36Z,nyjets,-0.0058286474191599
