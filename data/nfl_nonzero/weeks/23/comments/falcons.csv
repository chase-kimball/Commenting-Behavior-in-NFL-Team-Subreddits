You could say you only give the kid 4 games because you’re not urgent to play him, because you’re already certain from what you see in practice and what your grand plan is. 

2. They picked Ridder as a flyer in the third because he was there still, and they liked him but didn’t love him, and decided to roll with Mariota to salvage this lost year. Ridder was showing exactly why he wasn’t a first or second rounder in practice all year, and mediocre Mariota provided the veteran experience to keep him off the field. They gave him a few games late when we were out of the race just because, and still didn’t see anything concrete to include him in their future franchise QB plans, because the plan all along has been to get a bonafide guy like Lamar or draft a stud in the first round that they actually like.

If he doesn’t, then you see what Ridder has. The benefit for Ridder is that he can take his time on his development without being thrown into the fire. Arthur Smith said several times he doesn’t believe in immediately starting rookie QBs and he thinks that can derail their careers.
