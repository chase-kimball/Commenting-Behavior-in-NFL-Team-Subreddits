2. They picked Ridder as a flyer in the third because he was there still, and they liked him but didn‚Äôt love him, and decided to roll with Mariota to salvage this lost year. Ridder was showing exactly why he wasn‚Äôt a first or second rounder in practice all year, and mediocre Mariota provided the veteran experience to keep him off the field.
