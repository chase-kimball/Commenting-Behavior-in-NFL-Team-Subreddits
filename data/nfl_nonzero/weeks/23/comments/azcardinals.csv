Mahomes is almost certainly gonna have a greater career than both of those guys and has had a superior start especially in regards to team success.

I think he has an excellent chance of retiring as a top 2/3 QB ever though, but there are critics who want to see him win titles without Kelce (who's turning 34 this upcoming season) and without Reid (who's only gonna coach for a few more seasons probably). Brady was able to do it without Belichick in 2020, and he essentially did it without Gronk in 2016. Then, there's questions about longevity and how will Mahomes perform in his mid to late 30's.

The last time any of our big four teams won a championship was over 20 years ago and that’s the only one across the history of all our teams. So if you want a winning culture or any kind of consistent success, the Cardinals probably aren’t for you. 

That being said, we are perpetual underdogs. When we win, it’s the best feeling in the world because no one ever expects us to do anything noteworthy. You won’t find many bandwagon or fair weather fans here either because you have to have at least some level of sustained success to get those. 

As for the roster, it’s just okay for the most part. Budda Baker is one of the best safeties in the league and is the heart and soul of this team. We will defend him fiercely. Kyler Murray is going to be coming off an ACL injury and still has a to prove that he can elevate the team beyond just using his talent to pull some crazy shit out of his ass a few times a season. How good he is and if he’s the franchise QB of the future is consistently a hot topic of debate. Our other “elite” player is DeAndre Hopkins who is one of the premier receivers of the league even if he’s getting up there in age. There’s been some trade rumors with him but we’ll see how that shakes out. 

You also have some up and comers in the form of Zach Allen, Zaven Collins, Isaiah Simmons, Rondale Moore, and Trey McBride who are all from the last handful of draft classes or so. All of them have the potential to be great but haven’t reached that status yet. 

We’re expecting to hire a HC here in the next couple days and it’ll be interesting to see how that shakes out as well. Expect excitement or a riot depending on who it is.

Again, this is the same for every team with a new head coach.

It would make zero difference if the Cardinals hired a coach at the end of January  or the beginning of March. You are making a nonsense argument.
