There’s a stat about leadership in America, specifically businesses. I’ll have to backtrack to source the specific numbers, but in the ballpark of “78% of managers feel their replacement is unqualified, while 36% of replacements feel underprepared” in terms of their ability to *lead* a team, not just do the job. If we can agree that the NFL and it’s franchises is a business (it is), then let’s assume these stats translate pretty even into nfl organizations.

The point: there *will* be coaches who have the knowledge but lack the leadership ability to run a team. These coaches go to teams like the Bills, Chiefs, Eagles, and 49ers to develop their leadership *as well as their knowledge*. I’m excited because Demeco might add us to that list, and I wonder if guys like Slowik and Johnson factor that into their decision.

I’m probably wrong, but this line of thinking is some of the strongest kool aid I’ve had and I don’t know if I can put it down now…. I really hope this is even marginally true.",10.0,texans,t3_110m352,False,0.0,:ka:,2023-02-12T17:35:50Z,texans,0.0942456111133098

13438,102844,102844,Nectorist,"I agree with much of your assessment here. Pep Hamilton's offensive tendencies lean towards power run with a 2 TE set in order to establish deep shots off of the play action, but we just didn't have the personnel to execute anything like that. While Tunsil and Howard are good, their strength is pass pro, while the IOL was a complete liability both in the run and the pass. I think from a personnel standpoint we'll have to lean into the run. Pierce is a great asset and this draft and free agency lack a lot of receiver talent. Green did fare better in the run game, and he was touter as this mauler off the line, so I think a good center who can support that will hopefully elevate his game.

I wouldn't mind having Jimmy G, I like him more than most and he obviously has connections to the coaching staff now, but I think it comes down to pay and how much he'll want to play the role of being a bridge QB.

There are some very obvious examples where teams were just able to run all over us (Titans, Jags, Bears), but there were some games where the pass defense stepped up and played legitimately well against high-level competition (Dolphins, Browns, Cowboys, first game against the Jags all come to mind). I think one of the few areas people are willing to give Lovie credit is that he did transform the passing defense both last year and this year and made us one of the better teams in terms of takeaways.

&#x200B;

That said, it obviously isn't perfect. Mahomes and Herbert exposed us pretty badly, but I can't say that's too damning because they're both at the top of the league. Overall our passing defense did benefit on paper (strictly speaking about numbers here) from a poor run defense, but I can't point to very many games where I think our secondary lost us the game or was otherwise a massive liability, which can't be said for almost every other unit here.",12.0,nfl,t3_1131lpn,False,0.0,:Texans: Texans,2023-02-15T23:06:56Z,texans,-0.1037320087448559

I think we're really going to be banking off of Collins taking a step forward and Metchie returning to his college form. Neither are guarantees, so I think you are onto something when it comes to drafting a tight end.

Tua (2020) - also had Justin Herbert picked right after. 

Daniel Jones (2019)

Sam Darnold (2018) - Josh Allen was taken a few picks later.

Patrick Mahomes (2017) - Deshaun Watson was taken a few picks later.

Definitely a mixed bag here, but I think that it shows that the emphasis here is on talent evaluation and how well the pick can develop. I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong about picking a QB at #2 overall, as obviously you can have successful QBs selected even later on.

Second, there are no o-linemen who are early to mid round talent. We could try to trade back some and pick up Torrence, but spending 12 on him would be a huge reach. We did that last year and ended up with Kenyan Green We can pick up a solid center (even if we sign a vet) in the 3rd or 4th round, the drop off past the second round guys is minimal whereas that isn't true for WR.

2.  I'm not a wait for Caleb guy. I said I'm fine with drafting a QB even though I think the risk is much greater here than elsewhere. I would prefer to get a guy I actually like but if we aggressively go after at least a WR that isn't a rookie I think we can at least give our OC and rookie QB a chance. 
 
3. Taking a vet does not put you in QB purgatory. Your draft strategy does. If you miss on a QB because your environment sucks, that puts you in QB purgatory as well.  
 
4. Punting on a class of relatively weak QBs and taking a chance to build your team up elsewhere is not a stupid strategy. Y'all impatient fans just hate it because you're QB thirsty.",-1.0,texans,t3_112jovo,False,0.0,:H-Town-Cal:,2023-02-14T22:18:32Z,texans,-0.0495667117201739

Keep in mind that the last super bowl winning QB that was both the first QB selected in his draft class and still playing for the team that drafted him is Peyton Manning for the Colts. Urgency to get the number one guy is rarely the wise move. 

If the answer is that there is only one super bowl run calibre QB, we sell the farm to trade up. 

If the answer is two, we stay where we are and draft one at 2. 

If the answer is 3+, we trade down from 2 to the 4-8 range for extra picks, including a first rounder at least, and grab QB 3-4 off the board from there. Under this logic, multiple high level picks are simply more valuable than the difference between Stroud over Richardson, or whoever. 

If the answer is none, we sign a free agent, perhaps trade pick 2 into a package that includes a good first rounder this year, another first rounder in 2024 and more, and then get ready to trade those picks next year to get a great QB then.",8.0,texans,t3_112wtk9,False,0.0,:doodle2:,2023-02-15T10:32:42Z,texans,0.122642561596632
