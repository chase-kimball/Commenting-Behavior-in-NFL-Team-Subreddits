I think you‚Äôre spot on with Hyatt atop our WR list. His combination of size and speed would be a great fit for our offense, I think there‚Äôs a real chance we target him early. 

One observation with this WR class and your list - there are a ton of slot guys, and I‚Äôm not sure the Vikings will draft someone they project as slot-only, due to how often we use it to get JJ a clean release or put him in motion, which in turn forces our other WRs to line up on the LOS and face more press coverage. I think JSN gets type-cast as a slot-only too frequently by the media, but guys like Downs, Flowers, and Dell will likely be limited to the slot due to their size.

- if last year‚Äôs theme was culture & collaboration, this year‚Äôs is aggressiveness. KOC and Flo both mentioned multiple times that they want to be aggressive on both offense and defense, and that their alignment with this vision was a big driver in Flores taking the job. 

- Flores was still in the mix for the AZ HC job, but withdrew and took this position on a ‚Äúgut feeling.‚Äù I‚Äôve seen it misrepresented by some Vikings media members, so here‚Äôs the full quote for context: ‚ÄúThere was still an opportunity with Arizona. Like I said, this was ‚Äî you get a gut feeling. I think we‚Äôve all kind of had those that, this was the place for me and my family. This was the right opportunity‚Äù

- Flores noted that his lawsuit against the NFL is ongoing so he wouldn‚Äôt get into the details, but that ‚Äúhe is where his feet are‚Äù and reiterated how happy he is to be here. He spoke highly of the diversity in the Vikings‚Äô building throughout the organization. 

- When asked about leaving for a HC job in the future, Flores said he obviously has long-term career goals, but again reiterated he‚Äôs where his feet are and extremely happy to be here. He said he‚Äôs not training a successor, but rather is always teaching and learning from everyone around him - his players, his assistants, his kids, his friends. His wife is a teacher and they share ideas with each other frequently. 

- A few stories about their overlap in New England, with both noting the leadership they immediately saw in the other and that they‚Äôve followed each other‚Äôs careers from afar. KOC said he spoke in-depth with Jerod Mayo and Matthew Slater, among others, about Flores‚Äô personality and leadership style, and that he didn‚Äôt have to pry to get everyone honest and overwhelmingly positive endorsements for Flores.

The deadline to get under the cap is 3/15, so we‚Äôve got a month to get these deals done and create space for free agency. 

My bet on the first official move is a restructure for Brian O‚ÄôNeill, converting salary to signing bonus and freeing up cap space. O‚ÄôNeill is a surefire starter for years to come, and will gladly take guaranteed money now, making this move a slam dunk.

The next moves will be the easy ones - cutting players with minimal dead cap. I‚Äôd put Jordan Hicks and C.J. Ham firmly in this category, and maybe some defensive depth players like Troy Dye, Ross Blacklock, etc. 

After that, I‚Äôd focus on the players that are giving the least value on large contracts, which in my opinion is Thielen and Cook. I‚Äôd love to have Thielen retire a Viking, but reading between the lines it‚Äôs seeming a bit unlikely either player takes a pay cut, so we may have to bite the bullet and cut them, eating the dead cap hits in 2023.

15053,101855,101855,Nijo32,"Appreciate the write-up, these are some really good points.

I agree with everything you're saying here, and the volume of good RB options on the market has convinced me that Mattison probably isn't getting a great contract. I do still think he and his agent will be pushing for one - it's likely his best and only shot at maximizing his value while he's still in his prime. But if his market never materializes, I do hope it's the Vikings who give him a good offer and opportunity. Who knows, he may even take a one-year prove-it deal here and try to hit free agency again next offseason if there's a less loaded RB market. 

I also agree I'd rather be taking shots at defense with our draft picks, I think I'd only use a round 3-5 pick on RB if a real game-changer were available, one of the upper-tier prospects you mentioned. Spears has gotten a lot of buzz of late, so he could also be an option. I think my best-case scenario would be Mattison on something like $3M / 1 year with bonuses based on production, paired with a 6th or 7th round pick who complements his skillset. My personal favorite is Deuce Vaughn, I think he'd be better in such a role than Nwangwu, and Chandler would be the backup to Mattison.",2.0,minnesotavikings,t3_110h32y,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2023-02-12T12:00:01Z,minnesotavikings,0.0879261233432081

I just want to avoid paying over ~$6M AAV for an RB unless they‚Äôre really, really good, because at the middle tier of RB you‚Äôre much better off spending your money elsewhere. Running games are predominantly successful thanks to scheme and OL play, and elevated by elite RBs, which I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre in the market for.

I don‚Äôt think we can just roll into 2023 counting on Nwangwu and Chandler as our RB tandem, we need some sort of proven starter, I‚Äôll be really curious to see what kind of market Mattison has and if we‚Äôre able to bring him back on a deal that keeps both sides happy.",1.0,minnesotavikings,t3_110h32y,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2023-02-12T09:42:25Z,minnesotavikings,0.1503216670953361

I‚Äôll be interested to see where guys like Zach Evans, Tyjae Spears, Zach Charbonnet, or Devon Achane go in the draft - I‚Äôd guess rounds 3-5, but all of those guys have lead back potential but not the premium draft cost of a Bijan Robinson or Jahmyr Gibbs.

This FA class is also stacked, so I think we may be able to find a bargain deal after all of the top names.

Cousins‚Äô problem is that he refuses to go off-script.

If they Ravens did trade Lamar, I think it‚Äôs more likely that they‚Äôd want to maximize draft picks instead of receiving a veteran QB, so we may be at a disadvantage compared to teams like Carolina, Atlanta, Houston, etc. with better draft picks available and less cap restrictions.

Not to mention often lip syncing isn't actual lip syncing, she likely sang behind that mic with the power cut to make it more authentic.

One thing I wish I would see get more credit is the absolutely PHENOMENAL arrangement behind her on that song by John Clayton. So many things going on at a music theory level that obviously your average Joe wouldn't know about (why would they) that creates so much more power and emotion that your average Joe can still feel, then with one of the most powerful and emotional voices of all time singing it. Everything about that rendition was musically elite. I am not a very patriotic person and everything about that rendition makes me want to fly on a bald eagle and drop American flags across the globe while chanting ""USA"" at the top of my lungs.
