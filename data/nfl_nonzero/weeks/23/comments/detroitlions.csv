7224,40715,40715,Clit420Eastwood,"*How did the Lions look compared to the beginning of the season?*

Much better. They finished 8-2 over the last 10, and the defense improved to roughly average (thanks largely to some turnover luck/playmaking). DJ Chark’s return led to some deep balls, and the Jamo threat was present by the end.

*Did the firing of Aubrey Pleasant actually make that big of a difference?*

Hell if I know. The defensive numbers before/after his firing make it look like it made a difference, but there could be a million factors we don’t know about. Okudah didn’t finish the year too strong (multiple benchings), but Kerby Joseph stepped up big time at safety. Also hard to judge the full picture when most of the season was spent without Tracy Walker. If the insubordination rumors are true, then I understand the firing. But AP got hired pretty quickly, suggesting he still has perceived value among the league.

*Did Jamo actually play this year?*

He did, and the results were mixed. Obviously shaking off some rust, and didn’t have much time to build chemistry with Goff. We saw a taste of the speed, but also saw some drops and miscommunications. There wasn’t enough from him (good or bad) to sway my pre-existing opinion of him.

*Do we feel like Goff is the answer?*

Depends on what the question is. Goff’s undoubtedly earned himself another year at the helm, but if Holmes sees an opportunity to upgrade I hope he takes it. Won’t be upset at all if he runs it back with JG though, who I expect to have another respectable season.

*What does everyone think the Lions are doing with both first rounders?*

Most say defense, and I hope they’re right. Only exception I’d make is if there’s a *great* OG at the 18th pick. Some want Bijan Robinson (RB), which would be extremely fun behind this o-line, but the value is obviously questionable.

The entire Brad Holmes approach is to build through the draft for *sustained* success as a consistent winner. That means carefully balancing the short-term and the long-term in all decisions.

And a mid-round QB *can* be a great move for the long-term. We’ve seen it work out for plenty of teams, and *not* work out for plenty more.

I’m not advocating for or against Hooker specifically, because that’s a different discussion altogether (he’s old). But if Brad Holmes sees a high-floor prospect (solid QB2 at worst) with some upside, then I don’t think a 3rd-round pick is out of the question. At worst, you’d have a steady backup, which the Lions haven’t had in years. At best, you’d have a franchise QB making 1/10th of what Jared Goff is. Low-risk, potentially high-reward.

31109,180908,180908,Skraxx,"The biggest flaw with this argument, is that it assumes that DJ Chark's absence was the *sole reason* why we struggled with the deep ball. While DJ Chark was out, so were other key receivers: Josh Reynolds and Jameson Williams.

Josh Reynolds isn't a deep threat, but he does come in key for something later. The main one is Jameson Williams. 2021 proved that while Kalif Raymond was a solid target in short to mid passes, he was never really a reliable deep threat. On the other hand, Jameson Williams throughout his college days was a consistent deep threat and in his limited 2022 time showed that he could be at the NFL level. I too, am a massive Goff truther, but I could see that it was just simply chemistry between the two that prevented a couple more TDs.

Now, let's go back to Tyreek Hill. He's mainly known for his speed, but beyond that he's just a great receiver. What the Chiefs did after trading him, was effectively rebuild his characteristics. They got back his speed by acquiring MVS and later Toney. But to keep the reliable receiving ability, they went ahead and also got JuJu. Of course, Mahomes is gonna make anyone work, but the Chiefs scheme can do a lot of the same things they did previously without Tyreek, by instead subbing him out for guys who can fulfill the same roles.

So let's go apply this to Detroit. What are DJ Chark's main characteristics as a receiver? Well, he's a fast enough guy to be a very reliable deep threat. I have already reasoned that the role can be filled by Jameson Williams, with more chemistry between him and Goff. But the other key characteristic Chark has, is size to be able to make contested catches. That's where Josh Reynolds comes back into the fold. If you remember in 2021, Reynolds was a key target in Goff's bounceback for this reason. He had reliable hands and the ability to make contested catches guys like Kalif Raymond couldn't. Even in 2022, Reynolds was less efficient than Chark, but it's a yardage (and efficiency) gap that Jameson Williams could easily make up. Chark and Reynolds only had a 23 yd gap between them, and Jameson Williams sure is more than capable to fill that.",3.0,detroitlions,t3_10z0y4s,False,0.0,CornDoggyLOL,2023-02-10T14:09:44Z,detroitlions,0.0291366236493661

Yes, I think there's key guys on this team we need to re-sign.

But also... You can always get better, and always be more efficient. Sure, Cominsky won't ask for much but he wouldn't be getting much on the open market anyways. But someone like Chark? It's a WR class where he's one of the best options for a lot of WR-needy teams. If Holmes believes he can get that same production out of Jamo and WR depth behind him, I'd rather use that Chark money elsewhere.

It's why the Chiefs managed to trade Tyreek Hill, one of the best WRs in the game, and got to the super bowl immediately after.

34836,208165,208165,Therooferking,"I think for me, it was just a few different things. Montana, I think, was a given, although I should have said him. Young is iffy. Marino is a no for me. 

It's hard to compare eras statistically. If you throw Montana into today's nfl, does he play 20 years and not miss time? Because of the rules? Does he throw for 80k? 

Also, it's a difficult thing where players land. Brady and mahomes, young and Montana, were gifted great coaches. It matters. Is mahomes a champion if he was drafted by the Texans?  Probably not. I'm sure he'd still be a great player, but we just don't know what happens. It's not just coaches either. Marino was in a tough position in Miami. They threw the ball a lot, which was good statistically, but they either didn't have a run game or had bad defense. Elway carried a lot of those Denver teams until he was at the end of his career then he had a great supporting cast. If you put Marino as a 49er instead of Montana and young, do you get the same result? I'm not so sure. I think Danny would win some rings because he was super talented, but his decision-making was always suspect to me. Or maybe it was just his big game trouble. I don't know, but Joe was much cooler headed. Joe would stand in there and get it done in the biggest games.  Other guys were gifted trash coaching and trash teams. Stafford is a great example. A carousel of coaches and coordinators.  Terrible defense and no run game at all. Yet he still found ways to make it interesting and win some games. Then he gets out and lands with a good offensive minded coach, a defense and weapons. Lights it up and gets a ring. Stafford is a lock for the hof imo. 1st ballot if he plays a few more seasons. 

If you go back even further, it gets even more convoluted comparing guys to mahomes.

I was (foolishly) trusting Mr. Bob at that point, as he had hit on most of his picks along the offensive line. I figured Hock was another one. And I grant that he wasn't a terrible player, or even a bad player. What gets me is looking back at his plays, he'd either make crazy-silly decisions or just not put in the full effort. It goes back to that dive he took after the catch his rookie year that earned him a concussion. There were other, sillier plays throughout the years. That shouts to me that he was a guy who relied on his natural talent at the position rather than refinement or learning from his coaches over the years. When he got to the pros, suddenly he was up against guys who were much, much better - not to mention much more sophisticated defensive schemes - and that wasn't going to work anymore.

Again, I have nothing against him; it just wasn't working out here and it was time to move on. The comment after was what really rubbed me the wrong way.

What's dehumanizing is when you simp for what was a 24 year old man (at the time of his leaving Detroit) who, again, made a ton of money from an organization even if it was only a rookie deal, especially when he didn't get hurt like so many other more unfortunate rookies do.  

Being immature is a KNOCK against someone, not a compliment. The grand majority of athletes in their 20s act mature, especially those who happen to excel at their positions.

... Sorry, couldn't resist.

The Lions started 1-6 and finished 9-8. Jared Goff played hero ball for the entire second half of the season to finish with 29 TDs to only 7 interceptions. An interesting statistic someone else pointed out here awhile back: he also had 7 passes downed within the 2 yard line that did not count as a touchdown pass. 6 of those 7 were converted into Jamaal Williams touchdowns. 

Speaking of Jamaal Williams, thanks to those 7 passes and 10 other TD runs, he broke Barry Sanders' regular season touchdown record of 16 (though he had an extra game to do it). 

Jamo had himself a couple of good TDs, though one (in the Green Bay game) was called back on a holding call which, in my opinion, was pretty ticky-tack, if legitimate. No real complaints though because I have the feeling he's fixing to light it up next season. Goff was throwing dimes on deep routes to DJ Chark and Kalif Raymond for crying out loud, so watch for him to take a HUGE leap next season. 

We had a bunch of Lions go to the pro-bowl as alternates. No Lions were selected as all-pro despite several worthy candidates, especially along the offensive line (that's not me saying that; it's Jim Miller from Sirius XM channel 88). 

My feeling on the first rounders: Lions will either take a stud edge, defensive tackle or corner with the first pick. I have no idea about the second.

The inconsistency is the problem, and that's an issue that goes back to the state of officiating in the NFL. It is a BIG PROBLEM, and the commissioner is completely TONE DEAF about it. Goodell has demonstrated that he's a craven coward and absolute bitch on numerous occasions, but claiming that officiating has ""never been better"" amongst a record number of blown calls, no-calls on obvious penalties, mistakes made with the clock (including one in the Super Bowl), substitution issues and outright dysfunction among game crews where they're literally swearing at one another is beyond preposterous and may be the single defining example of how spineless this ""man"" is. 

If this call is a catalyst to address the elephant in the room that is bad officiating, more power to it. Was it a particularly bad call? I wouldn't say so. I think that the ruling on the [Miles Sanders ""incomplete pass"" that was knocked loose for a second Chiefs fumble recovery/TD](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-catch-rules-super-bowl-57-controversy/q6xmgnhrbjax2s7bsnu2wsro) was much worse, as was the [DeVonta Smith catch where he had two feet down in bounds](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2023/2/12/23597102/devonta-smith-no-catch-refs-super-bowl-nobody-knows-what-a-catch-is), yet was still overturned even after getting another play off (""deFeNsE wAsN'T GiVeN EnOuGh TiMe fOr SubS!"" - when the hell did THAT become a thing!?). 

Bottom line: I knew the Eagles lost when Sirianni made the decision to punt on 4th and 2.

Of course, the bad punt and return to the 2 mean that the Chiefs offense didn't even have to work to score again. If Sirianni had gone for it, I believe in my heart of hearts he would've got it, and this ""bad call"" wouldn't have even been an issue.

Game changing calls should be reviewable, challengeable, etc. I don’t care if it stops a game dead in its tracks, there needs to be some sort of third party oversight into this.

Currently, the refs have the same accountability as refs in the WWF. When you have utter impunity, what’s driving you to do your job to even the most adequate level?

That's how close this game was, and a call like that tips the balance in favor of one team over the other.",1.0,nfl,t3_111rlbq,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2023-02-14T08:24:09Z,detroitlions,0.1252930105452675
