5033,46524,46524,Domestic_AA_Battery,"Well the pass defense was great because the pass rush was usually forcing inaccurate throws. The pass rush couldn't get home because of the field (plus they have a great O-line). The Chiefs pass rush is generated through the middle of the lines, where less leverage is needed and thus they were able to have more success. Someone did the slip percentages and the Eagles were sliding far more often.

That said, Mahomes wasn't the one that really succeeded. That really goes to Andy Reid and Eric Bienemy. Those guys had a gameplan that was absolutely perfect against us. All Mahomes had to do was play safe and he did exactly that. He played well but he wasn't the driving force behind the win. It was the Chiefs' coaching staff vs ours. Add in the field and it took away our biggest advantage going into the game.

Sucks but we can't change any of it now. I don't blame the Chiefs at all of course, but the NFL should be ashamed of itself for using that field.

5177,46738,46738,Domestic_AA_Battery,"The good news is that Hurts was 2nd in the MVP. So **arguably** we have the second best QB this year. So despite QB being the most important position and Mahomes being the best in the NFL, we can be competitive in that area still with Hurts. Their major issues will be CB. That's where the Eagles really distinguish themselves. That and the overall D-line.

If Defense really does win championships, we should win. IIRC, this is the third time the best Offense has met the best Defense in the Super Bowl. And best Defense is 2-0 in those games.

Statistically, we should win. We have the better D. We have the better talent across the board (like this post says). Their WRs (while rested) are banged up. Their QB is more recently banged up.

The biggest concern is coaching and experience imo. Reid is very very experienced. Mahomes has been to two Super Bowls already. Travis Kelce has been there with him too. They may have issues with their WRs being ill experienced but Kelce will be his security blanket. And Reid probably has thought about that. Expect Kelce to be targeted a lot. And Gannon's job has to be eliminating that security.

The Chiefs are human though. They almost lost to the Broncos. Lost to the Colts. I think they struggled with the Raiders too. Bottom tier teams and they had problems. We lost once to Washington with Hurts, and that was due to freak turnovers.

We have a good shot of winning. I'm just concerned nerves will get to our guys. And we can't afford to be sloppy to start.",3.0,eagles,t3_10zw86q,False,0.0,Santa isn't real ,2023-02-11T19:57:42Z,eagles,-8.760640313553148e-05

Granted, it does suck to get cheated on and it does suck to have your partner not be stoked to do something on your birthday and it does suck to experience drifting away in a relationship.

But what I’m also picking up in what you’ve shared is a resentment on your part that’s built over a while. I’m also picking up blaming her for your unhappiness. In a situation like you’re in, it’s tough not to fall into victimhood, but I’m reading you blaming her for your actions (or inaction in this case).

If getting ramen on your bday was important, go and get ramen. If she doesn’t want to go, that’s not stopping you from enjoying your own company and a meal you know you like. But to then sit at home and complain about missing out because of her, when it’s you who chose to stay home isn’t healthy imo.

The ramen meal is also a fair metaphor for the relationship. It may not be easy, but it is simple: if you are unhappy in the relationship, you can make the decision to leave or stay. But it’s selfish to blame your partner for your decision.

7624,70681,70681,IFoundHimInTheSea,"I’m down with this take and you’re totally on point. I’m attributing it to social media culture.

Anecdotally, concerts have changed a lot in similar fashion. Take a big festival like Coachella. Before Insta became as big as it is, that fest used to have a wide breadth of different genres represented and usually some big legacy rock acts and reunions. With the rise of influencer culture, the fest’s music became more homogenized to mirror Tik Tok hits and it became a fest to be seen at and go celeb spotting. I’m sure it’s still fun if you’re into the lineup, but it’s way more streamlined than it used to be.

Similar deal with the movie industry and larger chain theaters. They’re trying to make stuff that appeals to eeeeveryone in order to make more dough, but in turn it gets watered down and your handful of local theaters are now just all showing the same few movies with a zillion showing times for each. Hell, look how much of a film gets spoiled in trailers compared to a decade or two ago. Or the teaser of a teaser trailer.

I am surprised we barely did anything. I'm quoting Sheil Kapadia here, but that was the 6th best performance by success rate for any team this season and the best Chiefs game this season by success rate.   
  
Look at the Bengals and Eagles performances this year alone. look at what their DC is doing with less talent than the Eagles (but still good talent) then talk to me about how great Gannon is. It's just delusional man. **He's a good defensive coordinator.** I only emphasize that cause I have a lot of disdain for his overall philosophy he was good here: just not great. We're going to regress defensively next year with or without him because we have a lot of FAs and it's hard to have back to back historical type performances like we did especially rushing the passer. Losing him lowers the floor of the defense but raises it's ceiling since there is definitely room to upgrade.  
  
And the schedule point was true insofar as the defense didn't play anyone. We absolutely earned the SB berth but the defensive philosophy was flawed and routinely exposed by quality competition. Any time we played a quality QB the last two years - including this year - the defense got lit up for 30 points minimum. Every statistical and film analysis shows this.

I disagree, they had signed him to an extension the year before and he was still playing at a top 10-15 QB to that point. It’s moreso about how the Eagles value the QB position. The organization’s philosophy is essentially that if you don’t have a Mahomes/Burrow/Allen, you should be constantly investing in QB since getting a good one on a rookie contract is astronomically more valuable than any other asset in the sport. It’s why they traded a solid QB in Bradford to go up for Wentz, and it’s why they drafted Hurts, who they liked as a prospect and wasn’t going to let having a good-not-great QB keep them from getting.

So many NFL teams fall into the trap of thinking they no longer have to invest in QB once they have a top 15 guy. But once you have to pay that guy, it’s no longer a particularly valuable asset, and it’s probably a good idea to start taking swings at rookies. But teams are afraid to get it wrong and look “bad” if they move on from their average QB too early. But as Roseman says, he’d rather take a smart risk and be wrong than end up stuck in the middle like most of the league.",1.0,nfl,t3_10ysz3l,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-02-10T09:00:27Z,eagles,-0.053401732635498

Our defense helped contribute to a 16-4 record this year.  Nearly an all-time sack record.  Interceptions were plentiful.  We were truly dominant.  I can't ignore the success the team had with big years from Slay, CJGJ, Sweat and, of course, Reddick.

On the other hand, that performance yesterday was just *abysmal*.  He got outcoached.  Badly.   
 I don't know if the shitty turf neutralized our defense and made it ordinary and beatable or it was all his scheme.  Either way, the L was on the defense and he was the one calling the shots.

I think the fans are going to have a very hard time trusting him again.  If Nick trusts him and he can learn from this, I'll give him another chance too.

But that's not why the Eagles.  They lost because the defense couldn't get a single bloody stop in the 2nd half. 

3 TDs, 1 FG, 0 punts.

I'm really not sure why Gannon didn't put more pressure on a QB with a bad ankle, but alas.

The turf condition, btw, was a joke.  *Shame* on the NFL for rolling that shit out on Super Bowl Sunday.  It affected both teams, but KC seemed to have a sense of it beforehand and didn't seem to need to change their cleats midgame like the Eagles did.  And, feel free to disagree, but I feel like the turf could have impacted Philly more as their defense was more considered to be the better unit (Gannon's play calling aside).

14372,121500,121500,NotLordVader,"Tough loss for sure.  

What sucks is that this was sooooo close.  If we make literally one stop in the 2nd half or even reduce a TD to FG we probably win.  

The Hurts fumble and botched punt return were unfortunate, but just single bad plays.  Our defense, however, was toothless the entire 2nd half.  Literally one stop and we very likely win.

Yeah, the holding penalty sucked.  It was accurate but given that zero defensive holding was called prior to that, and the players adapt their play to how the game is being called, and of course it effectively gave the Chiefs the game, it was very questionable.  BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE LOST.  We lost because our defense couldn't get the job done.

35-35 tie with 4 minutes left and we let them get into FG range and run out the clock.  Two walk-in touchdowns.  Zero pressure on Mahomes.

I'm not AS devastated as I was in 2004 because we were still winless then.  We have a championship now which is a huge plus and takes some of the sting away.

But, it still hurts because this championship was here for the taking.  We had a win just 30 minutes away.  We were leading by 10 at the half.  We just needed a liiiittttle defense and didn't get it.  Sucks but that's the way it goes.

It also didn't need to be called because no defensive PI calls were made previously and the light tug didn't affect the play was the ball was uncatchable.

Down 3 with 1:45 to go and a timeout, the Eagles could have very easily forced OT or maybe won.  Down 3 with :08, bit different story.

All that said, Philly's defense played poorly for much of the game.  Zero sacks.

This advice is very common, but I just fundamentally disagree with it.  I can't be happy without a relationship.  Honestly if I had a crystal ball that foretold that I would never for the rest of my life find a good woman who wanted to marry me, then I'd probably just create a bucket list (going to Tokyo, maybe trying opioids once to see what it's all about, etc.) and then off myself.  I keep going based on the hope that one day I'll know that happiness.  It doesn't feel likely right now, but the chances aren't zero, so I haven't given up completely yet.

Even if you just look at the defensive line, for example, Fletcher Cox, Brandon Graham, Josh Sweat, and Javon Hargrave have all had fantastic seasons.  And on the offensive side of the ball, you could make the argument for example that Jason Kelce is a better center than Jalen Hurts is a quarterback, even though Hurts has played really well this year.  That being said, many of these positions like defensive tackle/end and center may be harder to appreciate for the casual viewer, so if I had to pick one player for you to ""watch out for"" on the Eagles, it'd still probably be Hurts, especially with his rushing ability having the potential to electrify any snap.",1.0,nfl,t3_10zpjof,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles ,2023-02-12T05:50:12Z,eagles,0.111137344

14889,126654,126654,One_Hall_8290,"I just want to vent for a minute.

My girlfriend hasn't been treating me very well lately.  It's my birthday today, and I told her in advance that she didn't have to buy me anything because I really wanted the following two things:

1. Her to have sex with me (we haven't had sex since November, and one of my new year's resolutions was to stop masturbating, so I haven't had an orgasm since December 31, and I'm so horny it's driving me crazy).

2. Us to go out to eat ramen (one of my favorite foods).

So far #1 has not happened, and I highly doubt that it's going to because she's made no mention of it (I specifically asked her to initiate because I've gotten so discouraged by trying to initiate and constantly getting shot down that I don't even want to try anymore).

I asked her about #2, and she just kept saying that she doesn't want to go but will do it if I really want to.  I tried explaining to her that it takes the fun out of it if I feel like I'm forcing her to go to the restaurant and she's just going to be miserable the entire time, but she refused to get up and genuinely say, ""Okay let's go.""  She's now taking a nap, and they close in less than three hours.

I'm sick and tired of being in a completely sexless relationship when I'm still young (in my 30s).  Honestly at this point I feel like I'd be justified to cheat on her because if she is making literally zero attempt to satisfy my needs, then she shouldn't get upset if I take care of them elsewhere.  She actually had the nerve to get pissy when she saw me looking at another woman in public the other day.  So hypocritical.  It's like, ""Bitch, I want **you**, but you won't let me have that.""  Having sex with another woman isn't a realistic option though because we live together, so I can't spend the night somewhere else (or even be gone for an extended period of time without a valid excuse) without her knowing.

So yeah, my birthday is going to consist of making myself some bison and a salad at home and then trying to resist the urge to masturbate.  Hooray.

I'm sure a lot of people are going to ask why I'm still with her, and the answer is: 1) I do love her, and I didn't talk about any of her positive qualities in this post, and 2) I don't think I can get any better, and I **strongly** disagree with the conventional wisdom that it's better to be alone than in a mediocre relationship (based on personal experience).

14909,126696,126696,One_Hall_8290,"What would be the best way to buy Super Bowl tickets if all I care about is getting legitimate tickets at the absolute cheapest price?

This Super Bowl is kind of a ""perfect storm"" for me and my girlfriend for the following reasons:

- The Eagles are playing and are probably going to win.

- The game is in Glendale.  We live in Los Angeles and could easily drive to the stadium (saving money on a flight).  We could potentially even wake up early that morning and drive instead of spending the night (saving money on a hotel).

- We're actively packing to move back to Pennsylvania later this month, so we wouldn't have to take time off work.

All things considered, this feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity.  There's no guarantee the Eagles will get back to the Super Bowl any time soon (let alone as the favorites), and even if they do, we'll be living in the northeast where we'd have to fly to the game.

So we're thinking about going.  The only problem is that we don't have the money, but we've talked it over and are considering just putting it on a credit card since it's such a unique situation.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel uncomfortable about being so financially irresponsible, but it's going to be so deflating if they win and we're stuck watching at home six hours away.

My question, particularly for people who've actually purchased Super Bowl tickets, is what is the best way to get the absolute cheapest tickets (without getting scammed by fakes)?  We don't mind if we're all the way in the top back row behind one of the endzones; we just want to get into the stadium and have two seats somewhere.

Where would you guys suggest buying the tickets?  Ticketmaster is the ""obvious"" choice, but we all know the fees are ridiculous.  Then there are a bunch of random sites that advertise having no additional fees.  And there's always the option of just falling back on eBay.

Also, when would you guys suggest buying the tickets?  I assume later is better since the sellers will drop the prices the closer we get to the game.  I could definitely wait until Saturday to make the purchase, and honestly I even thought about driving to Glendale Sunday morning and trying to purchase the tickets on my phone that afternoon (just a few hours before kickoff) to get the absolute best price.  But I need information from someone with actual experience buying Super Bowl tickets to know if the prices actually drop enough in the finals hours to make it worth going through all that trouble.",-7.0,nfl,t3_10yu2po,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles ,2023-02-10T16:13:50Z,eagles,0.0191991273397375

...because on Saturday my kid got hit by a fucking car. My sweet, sensitive 4 year old. He was holding his dad's hand crossing the street, and some old lady ""couldn't see because of the sun glare"" and turned left and FUCKING HIT HIM WITH HER FUCKING CAR.

Amazingly, he is physically OK. He has a tiny fracture, but no broken bones, no concussion and no spinal injuries. 

But that was the worst moment I've ever had as a parent. Like by far.

And today, the responding officer called me and he sounded all awkward. (we live in a small town so he happens to be someone I work with.) and he was like: ""well, the lady that hit him, she feels really badly and has some presents she wants to give him.""

And I'm irrationally angry about it. Like I'm sorry YOU feel badly right now, but I don't really care how you feel or what gesture you want to do to make yourself feel better. YOU were being careless. YOU could have literally killed my kid and frankly, no, I don't want your apology gift.

Besides that, my husband and I are not sure what we're going to do, legally speaking, because the impacts of an injury like this can have long-term ramifications and we may need to sue. We haven't completely decided yet.

QB1 inks an unprecedented deal and WIP melts down at Howie because he's a fool and we'll lose all our players. Super Bowl glory is taken for granted by draft day.

Then, all the other QBs coming due sign deals in a more traditional structure and the world laughs at Howie. Jon Richie keeps mumbling, ""Howfrey, Howfrey.""  He's been duct taped to a hand cart next to Joe Decamara's bathtub.  Angelo Cataldi begins tweeting like the Donald Trump of Philly sports from his la-z-boy, threatening his return.

5 years from now, everyone wonders how the Eagles are at Raymond James, back for another Super Bowl.  Nick Sirianni regained his mojo after studying Buddhism in the offseason.  Jalen Hurts took lessons with the Philadelphia Ballet to gain an edge in his core flexibility and explosiveness as the years began to show.  A now grizzled Josh Sweat reflects in the Player's Tribune about how he traces his pass rush lineage back to Reggie White and the lessons of leadership passed down from BG and Fletch.

17317,151356,151356,RepresentativeAir735,"For me, a win Sunday achieves what I dreamt of when I was a kid and spent my time drawing Randall Cunningham with crayons.  I wanted him to be our Joe Montana and I wanted our guys to be the ones in the TV booths and on the pregame shows.  I wanted the kids in Dallas to buy kelly green Joyner 59's and wear them to their schools on Monday after we beat their ass. I wanted the one, no doubt about it, no one can say anything cause this team '85 Bears good, team.  The one we could say with no doubt, no asterisk was as badass as any Cowboys or Giants or WFT team.

I became an adult and went to law school and Donovan and crew were on the rise, but January 19, 2003, against the Bucs was the last dance of my remaining innocence.

Players came and went and I cheered,  but I was working 80-hour weeks, cheating on my ex-wife, and becoming an alcoholic. The Phillies had their greatest era and that was rad, but it's still not the Eagles.

By 2017, I was a full-blown,  movie of the week alchie, divorced and remarried and (not really) holding it together with gum and scotch tape.  So, it was magical for me but didn't hit the way it should have.  It didn't hit me the way I thought it would if Roger Mason had pitched another inning or if Ronde hall-of-arfing-fame Barber never split cells from Tiki.

Here, it's 1 AM on Saturday before and the Birds are back in the Super Bowl with their greatest-ever squad. They have the matinee star young QB, the franchise legends, and with one more win are the team that gives me my personal and permanent FU card to any fan of any other team and anyone who says that Philly teams are losers or flukes.  Jalen Hurts is Joe Montana. Jason Kelce is going to have more commercials than Shaq.  Jeff Lurie is the best owner of any sporting club on the face of the planet (write that article in the offseason Roob!).  Howie Roseman's got us. And, the head coach is as geeky about it as we are.  So henceforth, all the Dallas cockroaches can get fuct sideways with a proverbial chainsaw because we will have a team that (no matter what happens ever after) could roll it out with all comers: the Lombardi Packers, Gibbs Hogs, and give them a game.  I will never again have to push up my glasses and have to explain that, if you read the collected works of Ray Didinger, then you would have already known that the '48-'49 Eagles are one of the NFL's early greats.  Nope. Now, I will have it all on tape and can bring it up on my phone.

I'm California-sober and happily married.   Even my dogs like me more.  Enjoying the run this year has made me feel like the kid who mailed Reggie White his Starting Lineup football card with a self-addressed stamped envelope and got it back from the Minister himself inscribed 1 Corinthians 13.  Love is patient, love is kind...I'll tell anyone that reads this goofy post that love is my Higher Power. Young me did not know the wisdom that passage would reveal to me in time.  Yeah, winning Sunday would be amazing and in a whole new way.

19765,178887,178887,TheKingInTheNorth,"I’ll argue it as an Eagles fan coming in peace. The game had 95% slipped away already by that call.  But here goes….

That was a hold in the way that “there’s holding on every play if you inspect all the linemen.”

The bump and tug during the break in the route happens literally any time a receiver breaks back into a DB.

The grip on his jersey after that probably effected his route and speed by like a few inches. The ball was overthrown by ten yards.

You can’t look at all those things as a ref and decide “this is the moment I’m going to literally decide the (currently tied) Super Bowl.” I get they need to call the penalties that they see, but “let them play” is what everyone agrees should be the default stance of a ref in any big moments. Call the penalties that affect the game. Don’t affect the game by calling penalties.

Just such a devastating way for the tie to be broken. The Chiefs may have won anyways without the call, but instead of earning the last little bit of that already colossal comeback… they were handed it.

It doesn’t take away all the things in the comeback that got the game tied. Eagles D was lost out there. It’s a game that would have gone down as one of the greatest SBs in history.

> Hurts is every aspect of being a qb is better than Wentz

Nowhere have I said he isn't.  I'll say it again... Hurts has done far more with his talent than the other guys did, but a 600lb squat =/= transcendent god given talent, which is what Vick, McNabb, Wentz (though not at the insane heights of Vick or Randall, but few in the history of the sport have been) were all picked top 2 for in their respective drafts, while Hurts was 53rd.",2.0,eagles,t3_10yssim,False,0.0,always open,2023-02-10T12:55:18Z,eagles,0.1773767359999999
26460,245592,245592,devonta_smith,"Hurts is easily the better QB than Vick ever was. But more naturally gifted, not a chance. 

A 600lb squat is insanely impressive but that's not the same as being able to flick your wrist and launch a perfect spiral 75 yards or run a 4.33 40. Wentz, ofc, didn't have the 40 time but the bazooka arm was similar to McNabb (which, while elite for any era of football, is well below that of Randall/Vick but still ahead of Hurts). Counting stats in different eras, with more games in a season, don't change that. Not to downplay what Jalen has done but Vick in the early 2000s was a supernova in a way that few people ever have been, in any sport. All while not giving a fuuuck about football or improving his craft as a QB.

I'm using draft position to illustrate perceived upside, which is heavily influenced by natural ability. Hurts is a top top athlete, better than Wentz at most things... except for pure arm talent and off-platform throws, which is a key reason why there was a 50+ pick discrepancy between where their careers started. The height was another. All in all, Wentz was seen as having the higher ceiling. The most extreme case of height + big arm was Jamarcus Russell. But Kyle Boller, Paxton Lynch etc were all overdrafted in the first round for the same reason. There have been less than a handful of top-5 pick FCS QBs in the modern era - Steve McNair, Wentz, Trey Lance - all 3 were picked that high purely for their absurd arm talent (and the high ceiling inherent in that assessment of 'special' arm talent).


Hurts OTOH was seen at the time as being overdrafted even at pick 53, and was introduced publicly as a budget Taysom Hill (his pro comp was Tim Tebow). If anything, his throwing mechanics early on hurt the way he was perceived, because as we've seen this year, he can sling it. But ""AJ McCarron with wheels"" was the label on him for multiple years before he took the steps we've seen him take. Obviously couldn't be happier he proved everyone wrong, but that doesn't change the facts of how these guys were seen in the beginning of their careers.",0.0,eagles,t3_10yssim,False,0.0,always open,2023-02-10T12:52:19Z,eagles,-0.0249555369267713

27836,255126,255126,eaglesnation11,"53 Man Roster: Just would like to break down the 53 man roster a bit. On the offensive side Hurts is a franchise starter with Mariota being a high level backup and Ian Book being our developmental guy. Zach Evans and Kenny Gainwell will both share the RB1 role with Boston Scott sprinkling in and Trey Sermon being an emergency option. AJ Brown and Devonta Smith are back as lead dogs with Quez and Pascal sharing slot duties and Britain Covey returns as the return guy. I like what I saw once blocking developed. Dallas Goedert will lead TEs with Jack Stoll being in for blocking and Grant Calcaterra possibly stepping up more to be the TE2 in passing packages. The line is back with Jurgens replacing Kelce. Jack Driscoll will be the backup RG/RT, Wagner the backup LT, Opeta the backup LG. Forsyth will probably be a healthy scratch for much of the year.

Defensively it greatly benefits the team to have its entire pass rush back on the EDGE. Javon rushes from the interior and Mazi is a guy who can do a little bit on everything, but will also be solid in the run. Milton Williams will be a sub in NASCAR packages while Marlon Tuipulotu can be a bigger guy in goal line D. Jordan Davis should have his snap count increased with more 5-1-5 packages with John Jenkins backing him up. The LB core remains good, albeit younger with young athletic students Nakobe Dean replacing Kyzir White and thumper Jack Campbell replacing TJ Edwards. Darius Slay will play across his eventual replacement at CB1 in Joey Porter Jr with Maddox playing in the slot. Zech McPhearson can be a special teams guy and Josh Jobe can still hopefully develop into a nice depth CB option. CJ Gardner Johnson will play centerfield as Reed Blankenship who put together a great first couple games takes over next to him. Safety depth is a little shallow, but in a Zone D it’s not a horrible position to be shallow at. Josiah Scott and K’Von Wallace will compete for the S3 position with Chachere being a specialist. Special Teams wise we need to replace Siposs, but that will probably be from a UDFA competition that I don’t feel like getting into.

The Birds were supposed to be the worst team in the league last season. Next year they nearly take home Lombardi.

Idk much about the Union, but I know they took the final to penalties against a vastly superior juggernaut.

I’m mixed. I’m sad for the players, especially the vets who might have just played their last game. I’m sad that the game ended on a call that will be talked about forever. I always wondered if a Super Bowl could end on one of the many terrible calls we’ve seen in our lifetimes, well, here we are. The 2022 Eagles will have that legacy until the end of time, as the team that got jobbed on the biggest stage.

But I’m also grateful for the season we had. We have some fantastic people (not just players) on this team that were an absolute joy to root for all season long. I finally got my friends into football the semester before we graduate and probably never see each other again. I hope I helped give them some fun memories. And as for the trolls? It’s honestly been funny getting texts from fans of teams *loooong* out of this conversation. This was never their game, and acting like it ever was is so petty and pathetic I can’t help but laugh at them a little.

When Jalen got that ball with 10 minutes left in the game, I thought to myself, there’s no one else I’d rather have under center for my team than him. Not even Mahomes. He marched right down the field for that TD and 2 pointer like an all-timer. What a fucking baller and a class act he has been all season. Unfazed even on a stage like this. Lock that guy up for the rest of his career, no matter what happened tonight, he is him.

Championships are hard. You have to be good and be lucky. Well, there’s no question how good this team was. They belonged here, and they’ll be back next season as always, to bring us more elation and heartbreak and every memory in between.

I complained at the time about Hurts throwing into double-coverage...and someone with more knowledge explained that in the modern NFL, if the corner has his head turned around and isn't looking at the QB, it's a high-percentage throw and its fine to throw it there even if there's two DBs in the area (whereas if the CB can see the ball coming, that ball should never be thrown). The [TD throw to Brown in the Super Bowl](https://youtu.be/BWkt79xkd00?t=225) was another one of those: the corner #21 is just turning around to track the ball as it arrives, and gets tangled up with AJ who separates to get to the ball.
