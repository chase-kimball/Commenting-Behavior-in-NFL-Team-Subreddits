CB and DT are the current biggest needs IMO.

As much as I'd like them to get someone like Siaka Ika to just clog the middle and eat double teams it hasnt been the recipe for over a decade. They also like their DT to be under 6'5"" for the appropriate leverage and also able to rush the QB from the interior. They dont seem to like the 330+lbs NT types anymore, either. I feel like they may try to re-sign Larry Ogunjobi and play him at DT rather than DE if they can find someone to fill his role. 

Bryan Breese feels like a top guy who could fall the same way Karlaftis did... but maybe not as far. If he is available at 17 it would be hard to pass up on a guy who fits as a 3-4 power rushing DE.

If hes not available I'd really like them to yake Jordan Addison. I know WR isnt really a need but if they have offers or interest on Diontae Johnson it would be nice to get his contract off the books to they can pay Highsmith and begin working on his extension early. If they got a 3rd round pick for him i think that would be on the low end but maybe they wait until the trade deadline and get as a 2nd to a playoff team with injury at the position.

Im really starting to like CB outside of the 1st round if a top guy falls but there are some interesting prospects who could be taken in the late 2nd or even 3rd round. If Addison isnt taken I would use one of those 2nd round picks on an Edge rusher but Deonte Banks from Maryland could be a nice pick at 49 if available.

The last guy I'll mention is Cameron Latu at TE. Hes a willing blocker who just needs some polish and is a great athlete. Just in terms of ST usage as a former Edge/LB I think hes an easy roster spot and if hes a 4th rounder thats not bad for a guaranteed football player no matter his level of impact in the offense early in his career.",6.0,steelers,t3_10zpcl8,False,0.0,:primantis:Primanti Bro's,2023-02-11T11:31:08Z,steelers,0.0379754927036667

All the acrobatics we take for granted in WRs today started with him. He used to be called ""soft"" by opponents for taking ballet lessons in the off-season, but those ballet lessons are what helped him develop his elite body control and concentration in contested-catch situations, and they also demonstrated how beneficial off-season preparations could be.

Because of the dedication to his profession, Lynn Swann raised the standard for how WRs were expected to play and prepare for the game. In fact, his performance and preparation were so revolutionary that he inspired others to become WRs in the first place. Just ask Jerry Rice and Cris Carter. I trust their judgment over anybody on Reddit.

It's just a damn shame that the football-history-illiterate among us try to boil his entire career down to one catch in Super Bowl X.

Jerome Bettis is a Hall of Famer in fact.

He's a 2X First-Team All-Pro.

He played all 16 games in only six of his 13 seasons in the NFL. It's also worth noting that he led the NFL in rushing yards in 2001 until he missed the final five games of the regular season with an ankle injury.

>...had a heavy workload...

For a few seasons, he was the only reliable weapon the Steelers had, so they'd have been stupid not to use him. Furthermore, because he was the only reliable weapon they had, he often ran against eight-man fronts.

>...He’s basically Frank Gore with a ring, a Steelers marketability bump and a punchier nickname.

Because the 49ers have no ""marketability"" of their own, apparently.

They have Myles Jack who is an average NFL starter. Even if they had other guys under contract, they don't have a single above average NFL starter caliber ILB. Spillane is shit. Bush is gone. Robinson probably won't be ready. It's definitely the biggest need on the team.
