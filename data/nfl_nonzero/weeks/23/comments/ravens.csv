9/10, an outside CB following a WR sprinting across the formation, the WR is going to win in this situation. 

The solution for that is passing off responsibility. A safety takes the motion guy, your slot corner floats back to cover for the safety, and your boundary corner (who has nobody on his side to cover) takes over for the slot corner. 

This fake exposes that adjustment, by the time the snap happens they are already doing that switch off, and can’t adjust “back to normal” before it’s too late.

The result is leaving the boundary corner in a position to cover both the slot and fake motion WR.

That’s 3 guys all moving together who have to instantly go “no wait fuck go back” in the span of like 2 seconds. Two of whom probably don’t even have a view on the WR.

At least in the first one, Slay is responsible for Kelce, not Toney.

Edit: Ideally you coach the secondary to look for it, so as soon as the fake happens Slay knows he’s back on Toney, slot corner knows he’s back on Kelce, and the safety hangs back when he sees there is no WR.

What about the 9 times this year that hurts scored less than 27 points? I guess 27 is good, but only in those games right?  Absolutely ridiculous arguments lmao

So the rest of your argument is that some people(not me) incorrectly and stupidly said that Minshew would take Hurts job? Thats gotta be one of the dumbest responses ever. A very small percentage of stupid football fans said minshew was gonna take his job so now you think everyone thinks hurts was bad. 

I, and anyone that knows anything about football, have literally never thought that minshew was good or would take hurts job. For you to even mention that tiny percentage of fans is ridiculous. You keep saying this “starting QB Minshew” shit like i said it. I didn’t and maybe 1% of people believed it, and those people aren’t worth listening to or getting worked up about.

12078,80916,80916,JBrundy,"I’m aware that WR’s making a lot of money doesn’t equal good wide receivers, but the whole point of the post is that we don’t pay wide receivers and how thats a problem. The post itself literally equates paying wide receivers with not just how good your receivers are but how much effort your putting in to get good wide receivers. So i countered that by saying that teams that pay a lot for wide receivers don’t win a lot. Thats seems like a fair rebuttal. Also, of those 16 teams i mentioned there were 6 playoff teams, 4 had cheap QB’s and the other 2 lost their only games. 

As for your other points, we wouldn’t have been able to afford AJ Brown this year, and we certainly wouldn’t be able to if we paid lamar, unless we gutted our team. 

As for devonta smith, when do we draft in the top half of the 1st round? Only recent times was hamilton, when all the good WR’s were already gone, and when we drafted our franchise LT. Can’t complain about not getting a guy like him early in the 1st, because it isn’t possible for us. 

As for the chiefs, juju, MVS and toney is a terrible WR room that only looks good because of mahomes and andy reid. If we had those 3, I guarantee you our offense wouldn’t be any better and you would complain that we don’t have any good receivers. Hollywood or a healthy bateman would be the #1 WR on the chiefs and would put up huge stats. Even duvernay on the chiefs would be a serious weapon. 

The rams found a diamond in the rough in the draft, the bucs took evans really high and godwin in the 3rd round. Kupp and Godwin are legitimate arguments, we had a chance at those guys but we didn’t take them. However, i bet they wouldn’t be who they are today if we did take them. 

I know you don’t need to spend a lot of money on WR’s to get a good WR room, i specifically mentioned teams spending a lot because that was the point of the post. However, the other options are drafting them early in the 1st, which we can’t do. Drafting them late in the 1st, which we’ve done relatively successfully with hollywood and bateman. Drafting them in mid-late rounds, then we have to rely on our god awful WR development. And trading for a proven WR, which will cost a lot of draft capital and will still cost a lot of money. That option basically goes away if we pay lamar, unless we gut a big portion of our team. 

The only real options for us to get a good WR are drafting them late in the 1st, which as i said, we did pretty well. Or drafting them in mid-late rounds which is extremely unlikely to work out for us. 

The main problem in my opinion is greg roman. If we got rid of him earlier, we could have hollywood, bateman and andrews which is a serious receiver room. Short of getting a truly elite wide receiver like tyreek hill, JJ, or Adams, no wide receiver we got would’ve significantly improved our offense because greg roman wouldn’t allow it. I think we found 2 good wide receivers in 4 years, which isn’t bad.

21244,125314,125314,Pheasantluvr69,"I had that same heuristic as well a couple years ago, but after the emergence of Jaylen Waddle I reevaluated my position and realized that WRs being more comfortable catching with their bodies is a lot more viable than I thought.  Sure it isn't preferential to a guy with a giant catch radius and hands strong enough to consistently contest jump balls away from his body, but it really doesn't disqualify a receiver from being not just successful but elite in the NFL.

Travis Kelce is the best TE in the league and he is another guy who i realized catches with his body or bucket catches 90% of the time. But he makes it work by being an incredible athlete who can get open and make plays after the catch, and having the technique, aggression and body control to box out defenders in traffic and on contested balls. He is honestly a decent comp for Johnston in my view, since their playstyles are kinda similar. Big bodies who are YAC monsters. 

Johnstons biggest weakness isn't his hands or tendency to bucket catch imo. Like I said I am not really that worried about the body/bucket catching, and if you watch the tape he does show flashes of improvement in that regard with several high point catches, one handed catches, and catches where he plucks the ball off the turf. His biggest weakness is his lack of aggressiveness at the catch point. He was not as successful as a guy with his size and strength should be at the point of attack and allowed incompletions and tipped passes that he could have caught. But again, there are examples on tape of him making some fantastic contested catches that a WR 3 inches shorter than him could never make. Just watch his Sophomore tape vs Oklahoma and you will see what I mean. 

All in all, I think people are missing the forest for the trees when it comes to Johnston. His size, and athleticism are ultimate equalizers. His hands aren't the best for a prototypical WR, but guys with the elite traits he has like Kelce (elite after the catch ability and size) and Waddle (elite speed and after the catch ability) make that technique work effortlessly. His aggression leaves something to be desired, but he can still compete for balls that smaller WRs could never make just on account of his size and jumping ability. And considering he has the agility and balance after the catch of a guy 3 inches shorter than him, it's really not such a glaring weakness. He's gonna be a steal at 22.",1.0,ravens,t3_10zxgoy,False,0.0, :SHADES:,2023-02-12T12:43:11Z,ravens,-0.0286567978117147

Peters was honestly a liability at times imo. He is still a ball hawk, but his decline was pretty sharp this year. He used to be able to get away with the low effort plays and poor tackling, but now they stand out like a sore thumb considering his coverage skills aren't what they used to be.

26725,157634,157634,StylezG_White,"Oh yeah I definitely don’t wanna have to depend on DeSean, but I think we should at least keep him around for training camp and the preseason to see what he’s got left and to be a veteran presence since we’re still young at the WR position. Wouldn’t be bad to use him sparingly as a 4th/5th option until/once we get the depth chart figured out. 

I didn’t list Hyatt because I agree that he most likely won’t be there in the 3rd. Right now idk if he’s worth pick 22 but the next month or so ought to give more clarity to that. His biggest concern is the same as Tillman’s—Tennessee ran an offense that frequently stacked its WRs, so they never had to face a bunch of true press coverage. Both of those guys will have to prove that their skill sets will transfer to the NFL. 

If we trade Duv, is it the same as cutting him in terms of cap hit? I’d hate to let him go for nothing but unless he can get healthy and contribute more on offense, I definitely think that $4.4M could be put to much better use. 

Something I keep forgetting is that there have been some trade rumors surrounding Corey Davis. I’d like to take a swing at him because he’s younger than Hopkins and Evans and would probably be cheaper, too. I’d happily give NYJ pick 86 for Corey if that’s all it took.",1.0,ravens,t3_112mw2k,False,0.0, :OLD2:,2023-02-15T10:09:28Z,ravens,0.0257642484395967
26726,157642,157642,StylezG_White,"Of course I think Mike Evans would be great on this team but I think Tampa will hold on to him due to the way his contract is structured. And we don’t, as far as I know, have the money for Hopkins. That’s why I’ve never seriously entertained the idea of us getting someone like that. So we can agree there. 

I think a more realistic scenario is signing Lazard as a FA. He’s a great fit with a proven track record; I just hope we don’t get outbid for him by someone else. 

I like DeMarcus Robinson and wouldn’t mind having him back. Also, how much gas in the tank does DeSean Jackson have left? I’d hate to have to rely on him too much but he sure caught on quick and looked okay when we used him. 

I also think that no matter what we need to draft two WRs. That way we don’t have to rely on Proche, and depending on who we bring in and how they perform, Duvernay could possibly become expendable and get us back something in return. Maybe we even trade him before the draft for a pick. Even if we don’t have another WR who we like as a returner, we can still use Justice for that role (and give him all offseason to practice it more). 

Also, don’t forget about all the speculation about us trading Chuck Clark; he could net us another draft pick if we let him go, but I personally hope we keep him. 

A hypothetical scenario could look like this: 

Sign Lazard (Jakobi Meyers is good too but might be harder to get; Chark is okay but can’t stay healthy; I also like Slayton but NYG might try to keep him and we’d be taking a chance that he can finally live up to his potential). 

Trade both Chuck and Duv for a couple of picks (two 3rds or two 4ths? A 3rd and a 4th?)

Kyle Fuller comes back healthy and we retain him; at the very least he competes for CB2. 

Draft best available WR in the first. Draft best available CB if no WRs we like. Trade back if there’s no one we like at all. 

Possible WR picks at 22: Johnston, Flowers, JSN (if we’re convinced he’s healthy enough, although we drafted Bateman in the first knowing his medical history).

Remaining picks (let’s assume we have 7 total and draft one of the three guys I just mentioned): at least one CB, another WR, an edge rusher, an OG, a 3rd-down back (Kenny McIntosh is my first pick now that we have Monken), and go BPA with the remaining pick if we didn’t use it on a CB. 

Even if we don’t draft a WR in the first, there’s guys later on who I think have the potential to be great. Here’s a few I like:

Rashee Rice (might not be there past pick 50 or so though)

Cedric Tillman (concerns about the offense he played in though; also might not be there by the 3rd)

Xavier Hutchinson (big-body sure-handed guy)

Parker Washington (same build as Duvernay with a real talent for working his way back to the ball and making great catches)

AT Perry (great blend of size, speed, and technique)

Jonathan Mingo (big-bodied, athletic guy who would be great in the slot and who can stretch the field)

Andrei Iosivas (big-boded deep threat who played in the Ivy League, which could raise concerns about the lack of competition he’s faced)

Dontayvion Wicks (dude went to HS an hour away from me so I’ve been hearing about him for a while now; big and fast, but had a lot of drops last year, however the whole offense took a hit because of a new OC) 

So I could see the new WR corps look something like this:

Lazard/Chark, Bateman, Johnston/Flowers/JSN or other draftee, 2nd draftee, Robinson, Jackson(?)

Don’t forget that we still have Isabella, Victor, and Bridges still on the practice squad. Proche might join them as well. Not saying any of those guys are great, but at least we have options. 

And I’m not giving up on my dream of us letting Likely practice with the WRs and taking some game snaps as one, since we still have Oliver and Kolar (both of whom are young and could use more development) to play behind Andrews.",2.0,ravens,t3_112mw2k,False,0.0, :OLD2:,2023-02-14T23:26:51Z,ravens,0.0138211335442723

I like Foskey but if we go edge at 86 there are, in my opinion, better options still on this board like Zach Harrison and Adetomiwa Adeboware. And tbh I’d rather get Kyu Blu Kelly (who was drafted at 87) or even Darius Rush with that pick.

I like McIntosh and think we need a RB like him who can run routes and catch passes. But I also think that’s a little early to be drafting him.

All of your points are valid and I don’t want you to think that I think otherwise. 

I definitely would rather trade for or sign a veteran WR1 who won’t break the bank as opposed to trying to draft one. Godwin and/or Evans could be available; would they be cheaper than Hopkins?

Don’t get me wrong, Johnston’s tape is jaw-dropping and he should be great if he can stay healthy. I just see CB as a more pressing need, and in my opinion there’s more mid/late-round potential in this year’s WR group than there is in the CB group.

February 21st to March 7th will come and go.

This is an excellent article with all the data and facts, no speculation; an accurate timeline and covers all scenarios:

> The franchise tag window officially starts on Feb. 21 and runs through March 7. Here’s something to keep in mind when thinking about whether the Ravens will use the exclusive tag, which will cost roughly $45 million but prevents the player from negotiating with another team, or non-exclusive tag, which costs closer to $32 million but allows the player to sign an offer sheet with another team, to keep Jackson off the free-agent market. The exclusive tag will be counted on the cap at the non-exclusive number until April 21, the deadline for restricted free agents to sign offer sheets. So if Jackson doesn’t sign an extension before free agency starts, his cap number would be approximately $32 million, even if he gets the exclusive tag. That will go up on April 21. Either way, if the Ravens do use the exclusive tag, they will eventually have to account on the cap for that $13 million difference between the two tags. They’d just have a little extra time to do it.

43288,253656,253656,ripthisaccount6,"NFL will always be an unfair league. 

The “officiating” problem has been a problem since the inception of the league. 

If a many billion dollar league cannot employ full time unbiased refs, there is a reason behind it. 

Could they make the league fair? Absolutely. They would just have to hire full time, unbiased refs and they would have to ensure that no team has a given narrative, and a system in place to prevent bad calls.

Instead, the current system is for them to make the bad call, not review that call, and then “apologise” for it the day after. 

Guess what? Making that bad call was intentional. They want to push a given narrative, or rig the Vegas line. They want to tell you how great mahomes is by handing him the win, or they want to fuck over people betting on the eagles.

The NFL, a multi billion dollar league, could easily implement a fair system, but choose not to. 

People casually watching the sport don’t realise this.

Just look at the AFC Championship game where there was a whole do-over to give the chiefs another down, so that they could win. 

Let’s look at the 2019 NFC championship game. There was the most blatant PI of all time, and all refs on the field, including the one that saw the play, decided not to call anything. 

They then made PI reviewable, for only a season before taking that away. Why did they take it away? Control. They wanted to appear like they’re helping the Saints, but really it’s intentional. 

Anyone with a brain, including a 3 year old, and the ref, absolutely knew it was PI. But didn’t call it. 

If that doesn’t open your eyes I don’t know what will. 

I’m not saying every NFL game is rigged, but select games, specifically playoff games are 100% rigged on the officiating side of things. 

I don’t believe the players are in on it, but the officials control the narrative.

Once you understand that the NFL ultimately is an entertainment product, and that the NFL has incentives to push a given narrative, and has monetary incentives of a particular team winning. The only way they can push this without it being blatant is through poor officiating.

Acting like the NFL can do no wrong and that it is all the refs fault is a mistake, the NFL control these refs.",-6.0,ravens,t3_110y2k9,False,0.0,Poor Mans Taysom Hill,2023-02-12T21:32:58Z,ravens,-0.0009934894825877

We came back from the half and offense put up 1:11 drive for a punt, 2:49 for a punt, 3:32 for a INT, then the final drive INT on the 2 yd line after 9:29 drive.. oh and we had rushed for just shy of 300 yds and passed from 2 yds out.

Giants game week 6, longest drive 5:27, 3 under 2 min, and ended the game with INT and Fumble on last 2 drives resulting in 2 TDs.. defense forced 4 Punts and a fumble, only gave up a FG and TD until the turnovers by the offense.",5.0,ravens,t3_112x2sj,False,0.0, :SHADES:,2023-02-15T10:38:24Z,ravens,-0.1049246763545953
