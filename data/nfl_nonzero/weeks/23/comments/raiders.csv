779,2335,2335,1trillion69,"I do find it funny that so many people were on this super bowl or bust train before this season. Then the season plays out. Some people blame the qb. Some blame the coach. Others blame the defense. So many people thought that playoffs in 2021 meant more in 2022. And now that 2 things have happened, and it's only 2 things (Carr leaving and a 6-11 season) they have completely switched to ""our roster is full of holes"" and we are going to suck forever. 

The roster has holes. Full of them? No. 
We made the playoffs scoring less and giving up more points than we did this year. That's fucling wild man. 
The team has offensive weapons, a good left tackle, a great young guard, a tackle who wasn't compete crap as a rookie and can play, and a serviceable center who can be cut if needed for a cheaper option. What's missing? A qb. And the stidham game vs the 49ers shows what? That stiddy is a stud? No. That weapons matter.  The chiefs game exposed Stiddy as not being great. Ok no worries. The offensive holes are really just the qb. 

The defense? 1st, like i said, it's important to remember they have up less points this year. Also important to remember: Hobbs missed 6 games, Rock missed 6 games, Deablo missed 9 games, Perryman missed 5 games, Jayon brown missed 9 games, and Chandler, after he started playing well missed the last two games. That's a lot of missed time from your starters. And finally, free agency and the draft we are loaded both salary cap wise and draft pick wise. Yes we had a bunch of 1 year deals and need to re-sign some dudes and let others walk. That's normal.

I, personally, don't think (and this is now my opinion) he wants to do that. Here are my reasons: the Saints represent the best or 2nd best situation for him. The coaching staff is already in place, in a weak division, with a good defense and a good running back and good receiver (Olave, not necessarily Thomas). Also, they are in a dome, and the media market is a joke unlike if he went to the Jets, Commanders, etc. My second reason he'd agree to a trade instead of free agency is that while there is a *chance* a team willing to take on his contract wouldn't then in turn offer it to him on the open market, there's also the chance they won't. Meaning he could end up with a team/teams not offering him that amount. This is also sort of shown with the amount of reporting that teams will want to renegotiate the current contract. If they want to do it, that means he won't get it on the open market. 

So those are my reasons why I think he will accept a trade. 

Side note about other teams and why the Saints still remain the best option for him, trade or free agency:

Jets: the media and cold weather will kill him
Commanders: lack of talent, cold weather, media
Bucs: who is the offensive coordinator? Replacing Brady isn't a great desire of anyone
Colts: who is the coach? Coordinator? Etc
Panthers: lack of talent around him
Texans: lack of talent around him

Chargers have been by far the most annoying little shits I've ever encountered in my short 3 years of following the Raiders. 2021 season week 18 was the best feeling I've ever felt watching sports in my brief time doing so

Chiefs are kind of a respect hate team-wise, their fans make it high for me though. Complaining about how it's rigged when shit has gone their way almost laughably since Mahomeless showed up.

Steelers are a personal one since I grew up in WV in the 2000s/2010s. WV is bonafide Steelers country and having to hear all about this stupid ass Pittsburgh team that everyone liked really got on my nerves, even when I didn't care about sports. 

Broncos are here because they kinda have to be. Idk since I began watching the Broncos have just been this sad shell of a team clinging onto past glory (same). I less hate them more so I pity them.

9ers are a recent addition but BOY are they up there. This year in particular made me glad that we don't have to share a bay with those fuckers anymore.

Good teams do not restructure contracts often.

Sometimes it's necessary. Sometimes you have a high caliber team and need an extra player or two to push you over the edge.

The 2002 Baltimore Ravens are the perfect example of what not to do. After winning the Super Bowl they restructured a bunch of contracts to keep the exact same team together, and with some extra space signed a pro bowl quarterback. They would spend the next few years tight against the cap and unable to participate much at all in free agency.

Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that the injured ankle is what caused the poor 2nd half of his season. The first half (pre injury) was just as bad as the 2nd, and the QBs who replaced him had at or near their worst performances of their career.

McDaniels refuses to adjust his scheme to match players skillsets.  Adams made a killing on his route running even though he's not the fastest.

28655,215450,215450,breterpan,"In the National Football League (NFL), the franchise tag is a designation a team may apply to a player scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent. The tag binds the player to the team for one year if certain conditions are met. 

The tag option allows NFL franchises to retain a ""franchise player"" who is valuable to a franchise. The one-year, guaranteed contract that is offered to the player is a known, non-negotiated salary. If a designated player does not sign the offer and is unable or unwilling to negotiate an alternative contract before week 10 of the designated season, the player is unable to sign or negotiate a contract in the NFL for the remainder of the season.

The franchise tag provides general managers and owners a strategic way to manage salary costs and limit exposure to the financial risks associated with a long-term contract. Unsurprisingly, many designated players have criticized the use of the franchise tag by teams when it restricts their perceived ability to negotiate a more lucrative contract.",2.0,raiders,t3_10y3zt3,False,0.0,:4:,2023-02-10T02:05:17Z,raiders,-0.0571442048563341

It's also partly a question of what you consider deep. A lot of stats are given for 20+ yard throws but to me 20-25 yards isn't deep. It's the 40+ throws that he didn't have on his resume at Fresno. When Cooper was here, Carr underthrew him on the deep balls almost every time. He throws off his back foot too much which caused then to come up short. It's a problem of being unwilling to step into a hit when throwing. He also doesn't see open receivers deep when it's not his first read.
Sure, if his first read gets open deep right away and he has a clean pocket, he can throw a deep ball. But so can most NFL QBs. But to really excel at deep throws and have it be a weapon that the defense really has to respect, you have be willing to extend plays, see the field better, and throw accurately deep against tight single coverage or under duress, he doesn't do those things.
