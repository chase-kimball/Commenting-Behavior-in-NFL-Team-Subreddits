And there‚Äôs no reason for them to pay a player to sign with a particular team to do national marketing and even less reason to pay for them to sign with a team to facilitate local marketing when they are involved in markets that are vastly larger and more profitable than a smaller market like Tampa. If they have 10 million dollars (or whatever number) to spend on a player in a particular market they have a fiduciary duty to maximize the return on that investment. That 10 million incentive is going farther elsewhere, like Atlanta, LA, or NYC. 

The only financial incentive they could possibly have is from the payment scheme you mentioned, where they get more or less subsidized marketing due to kickbacks from the franchise. A payment scheme like that is a clear attempt to circumvent the salary cap and is going to get dicked down by the NFL seven days a week and twice on Sunday.",1.0,buccaneers,t3_112aehg,False,0.0,OldBucsShip,2023-02-14T13:29:58Z,buccaneers,0.1171428926611797

The mere fact that Geno had a fantastic season makes me say this is a fantastic idea.

I am interested in seeing what he can do on his own. Hopefully he learned from Pete (sidenote: Any stats on Pete Caroll coaching tree?)
