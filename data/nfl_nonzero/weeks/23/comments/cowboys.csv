Our defense was literally on pace to be the worst in **NFL HISTORY** just a couple years ago. It was still mediocre as hell in 2021, which was a huge step up. 2022 was the first year Dak had a good defense to back him up.

1. There was about 15 yards to get to the endzone - 20 yards to the spot where the ball hit the ground.
2. JuJu runs a 4.5 yard 40 with a 1.5 second 10 yard split and a 2.6 second 20 yard split. Simple physics dictates that most of the acceleration is in the initial 10 yards, which is why that first 10 yard split takes 1/3 of the total time despite only being 1/4 of the total distance.
3. Bradberry holds him for about 1.5 seconds throughout both of the holds in that initial acceleration period.
4. The play was live for 5.3 seconds.
5. The ball is in the air for 2.5 seconds.

is straight up hating no matter how much praise you disguise it with. Saying Diggs locked down Jefferson doesn’t take away from the team success because that’s literally his job. 

Plenty of teams have had similar success against the vikings in many of the ways we have and the only people who have had similar success against jefferson are slay and alexander. Jefferson had more catches and yards against Slay but slay still clamped him. Unless you only consider “clamped”
zero catches for zero yards with the qb having all
the time in the world to throw. Like give us some examples of a cb “clamping” a wr so we know bc most people consider it to be holding a wr well below their average production. 

You’re pointing out 3 plays in an entire football game. What was Jefferson doing the rest of those snaps? Can you admit that he was clamped in the second half of that game? No penalties and basically zero production from jefferson. 

Idk how else to explain it to YOU, I mean you literally used Kirk being afraid to throw the ball as an excuse to why he wasn’t clamped as if that’s not a credit to Diggs.

Then Brady retires, and of course he's getting the Romo A team fast track.

> Take it a step further.  Who decides which players are kept at what prices?

I think that’s probably 95% a blend of Stephen + McClay and scouts + coaches + Prasifka, but I’ll forever believe Zeke getting his contract extension was Jerry (and maybe some Garrett) folding and forcing the issue.

> Who is slotted to start... 

Feel like that’s predominantly the coaching staff, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s some “Zeke needs to be out there” pressure from the Jones family. 

> Who is slotted to coach...

Head coach? Rumor has it Stephen pushed for McCarthy and got Jerry on board. Wish they did a more exhaustive search.

Coordinators and assistant coaches? Certainly seems like that’s predominantly McCarthy, but I do believe the Joneses probably were the ones to propose bringing in Quinn. Still think McCarthy got to have a say in it but I don’t think he was the one to bring up the idea.

> Zeke's contract for example and then forced to validate that contract for so many years while in decline over TP.

Yep I’ll continue believing Jerry forced that move until there’s compelling evidence to the contrary.

> GMs have a lot of power in other places that are spread out over multiple people in Dallas.

Ehh, it’s tough to know for sure but there are a handful of teams where the GM in title takes a back seat to the head coach, a couple of teams where the owners still seem to force decisions on the GM (or even HC), and others still where there are a group of high-level executive titles that seem to collaborate with the GM to reach decisions. The only thing unique about the situation here is Jerry having the official GM title and thus our GM being wacky on the radio, but I think more teams have collaborative structures at the top than you realize. Listening to Thomas Dimitroff’s _The GM Journey_ podcast sheds some light on the different ways teams operate like that. There was also an episode of The Athletic Football Show with some former personnel executives that echoed the same.

> I absolutely think that Jerry and Stephen get input and respect McClay.
>
> It just seems disjointed in different areas on how they are executed.

I can agree with that. Much like my curiosity about what a Moore offense will look like with no McCarthy or Jones influence, I also wonder how McClay would run the operation with full autonomy instead of an owner/EVP who could potentially overrule or set constraints for him.

That’s fair.

> We heard MM say he didn't even know the Offensive Language.
>
> Why wouldn't he know it if he was involved?

He doesn’t need to know all of the terminology to be involved. Moore has publicly talked about pulling in concepts from McCarthy’s offenses, McCarthy in weekly press conferences alluded to becoming more involved over the season and local reporters shared that belief as well.

> Could you imagine Dan Quinn as Head Coach and a DC that had some issues in certain places just go, meh I don't even know what the play calls are.

The only issue that didn’t get fixed was first-down tendencies and efficiency, and there’s a non-zero chance that stubbornness came at least partially at the direction of either McCarthy or somebody with Jones for a last name. Our offense was 7th-best in DVOA on first down in 2019, Moore’s first season calling plays. We were even 11th in 2021 before plummeting to 28th this year. That was largely due to our stubbornness with early down runs but we’ll learn this year if that was Moore’s philosophy or someone else in the organization. No C and Stanback had touched on that topic this year and feel if Moore had his way he would pass more on first down, based on his comments on offensive philosophy over the years. I think it’s more likely that change was forced on him than him coming to a regressive change in philosophy all on his own.

> To me, if you think that.... You fire your HC for being a lazy POS.

I don’t believe Jerry actually forced that. He (or others in the front office) may have encouraged it, but I don’t think it was forced upon him against his will. While it’s certainly possible, the way McCarthy and the Jones family spoke about that decision originally sounded like they were all on board with it, but it obviously just soured since then.

> I think it is pretty obvious at this point that this relationship between those two got dysfunctional.

That can be true without it being the result of Jerry forcing McCarthy’s hand. It sounds more likely the relationship had run its course and they had different opinions about where to take it next.

??? by all accounts, he was. He just wasn’t the one putting together the game plan and calling the actual plays.

Easy answer doesn’t mean it’s correct, but fair enough. He’s definitely the easiest scapegoat but to anyone who has been a fan for more than a decade it’s clear the way the organization operates has changed in a mostly good way.

Playoffs are one-and-done in the NFL and good teams lose all the time. What we’re asking for is a better chance to keep making shots at the playoffs in the hopes that things fall the right way.
