Our defense was literally on pace to be the worst in **NFL HISTORY** just a couple years ago. It was still mediocre as hell in 2021, which was a huge step up. 2022 was the first year Dak had a good defense to back him up.

Let me break down the numbers for you:

1. There was about 15 yards to get to the endzone - 20 yards to the spot where the ball hit the ground.
2. JuJu runs a 4.5 yard 40 with a 1.5 second 10 yard split and a 2.6 second 20 yard split. Simple physics dictates that most of the acceleration is in the initial 10 yards, which is why that first 10 yard split takes 1/3 of the total time despite only being 1/4 of the total distance.
3. Bradberry holds him for about 1.5 seconds throughout both of the holds in that initial acceleration period.
4. The play was live for 5.3 seconds.
5. The ball is in the air for 2.5 seconds. 
6. JuJu could have covered 40 yards of field during the play if he was unimpeded and still would have had a second to spare.

Blocking is legal within 5 yards. Holding is illegal everywhere on the field. If he tried to hold, and succeeded, then he illegally impeded the receiver by holding him.

I think that‚Äôs probably 95% a blend of Stephen + McClay and scouts + coaches + Prasifka, but I‚Äôll forever believe Zeke getting his contract extension was Jerry (and maybe some Garrett) folding and forcing the issue.

> Who is slotted to start... 

Feel like that‚Äôs predominantly the coaching staff, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there‚Äôs some ‚ÄúZeke needs to be out there‚Äù pressure from the Jones family. 

> Who is slotted to coach...

Head coach? Rumor has it Stephen pushed for McCarthy and got Jerry on board. Wish they did a more exhaustive search.

Coordinators and assistant coaches? Certainly seems like that‚Äôs predominantly McCarthy, but I do believe the Joneses probably were the ones to propose bringing in Quinn. Still think McCarthy got to have a say in it but I don‚Äôt think he was the one to bring up the idea.

> Zeke's contract for example and then forced to validate that contract for so many years while in decline over TP.

Yep I‚Äôll continue believing Jerry forced that move until there‚Äôs compelling evidence to the contrary.

> GMs have a lot of power in other places that are spread out over multiple people in Dallas.

Ehh, it‚Äôs tough to know for sure but there are a handful of teams where the GM in title takes a back seat to the head coach, a couple of teams where the owners still seem to force decisions on the GM (or even HC), and others still where there are a group of high-level executive titles that seem to collaborate with the GM to reach decisions. The only thing unique about the situation here is Jerry having the official GM title and thus our GM being wacky on the radio, but I think more teams have collaborative structures at the top than you realize. Listening to Thomas Dimitroff‚Äôs _The GM Journey_ podcast sheds some light on the different ways teams operate like that. There was also an episode of The Athletic Football Show with some former personnel executives that echoed the same.

> I absolutely think that Jerry and Stephen get input and respect McClay.
>
> It just seems disjointed in different areas on how they are executed.

I can agree with that. Much like my curiosity about what a Moore offense will look like with no McCarthy or Jones influence, I also wonder how McClay would run the operation with full autonomy instead of an owner/EVP who could potentially overrule or set constraints for him.

He doesn‚Äôt need to know all of the terminology to be involved. Moore has publicly talked about pulling in concepts from McCarthy‚Äôs offenses, McCarthy in weekly press conferences alluded to becoming more involved over the season and local reporters shared that belief as well.

> Could you imagine Dan Quinn as Head Coach and a DC that had some issues in certain places just go, meh I don't even know what the play calls are.

The only issue that didn‚Äôt get fixed was first-down tendencies and efficiency, and there‚Äôs a non-zero chance that stubbornness came at least partially at the direction of either McCarthy or somebody with Jones for a last name. Our offense was 7th-best in DVOA on first down in 2019, Moore‚Äôs first season calling plays. We were even 11th in 2021 before plummeting to 28th this year. That was largely due to our stubbornness with early down runs but we‚Äôll learn this year if that was Moore‚Äôs philosophy or someone else in the organization. No C and Stanback had touched on that topic this year and feel if Moore had his way he would pass more on first down, based on his comments on offensive philosophy over the years. I think it‚Äôs more likely that change was forced on him than him coming to a regressive change in philosophy all on his own.

> To me, if you think that.... You fire your HC for being a lazy POS.

I don‚Äôt believe Jerry actually forced that. He (or others in the front office) may have encouraged it, but I don‚Äôt think it was forced upon him against his will.

That can be true without it being the result of Jerry forcing McCarthy‚Äôs hand. It sounds more likely the relationship had run its course and they had different opinions about where to take it next.
