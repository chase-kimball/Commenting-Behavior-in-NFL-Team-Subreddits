1. He's too expensive. His contract when it was negotiated was for a top 5 - 10 QB... and he's not... to make matters worse we also pushed his contract back to make more cap space during our superbowl run years... and now we are stuck paying for it.
2. He has proven that he is not a QB that can elevate the team he is a part of. Yes he can win games, Yes on a perfect team he can play well enough to get them far... but most teams are not perfect, the chances a team has enough talent at every position that they don't need an elite QB that can further elevate the roster is low/unlikely and is DEFINITELY not the case for us for the foreseeable future.

We got 1... and while I like NPF, it was easy to see we were going to struggle. 

As far as our WR core goes... we needed someone young to pair with AJ Brown... that was the expectation. A lot of the fanbase wanted us to jump up to grab Burks while retaining AJ Brown to have a very strong WR X/Y pairing.

Instead we basically downgraded our WR room... Woods was basically a non factor usually getting covered up completely... Burks had moments but also had health concerns and may still not be a true WR X (time will tell).

19217,120332,120332,RyokoKnight,"Radunz was labeled in his draft as a potential starting LT, that may be forced to become an Interior guard at the NFL level.  (The reason for this is that in college when faced against inferior opponents he could easily overpower he did great at LT but on the few occasions he was matched against an equally strong opponent he had trouble dealing with them when he didn't have an overwhelming advantage.) Essentially that analysis played out perfectly as he had trouble sticking at either tackle spot (it would have probably been better in retrospect to leave him at LT or LG in truth rather than move him around as he never had the traits you'd want in an RT) but is best used at interior guard where he can get better size/length match ups that mask some of his issues.

In essence we took a chance on a backwater Tackle on the cheap and got a guard. 

NPF on the other hand was mostly mocked at RT at the nfl level, while he has LT experience he didn't have the overpowering size, length, and strength traits you want in a starting LT... He probably is an okay backup/relief LT, but he is best left at RT where his traits for his footwork, agility, and run blocking are best placed. (I never once considered NPF a true LT, and I don't think most people looking at his tape thought that either as he has basically every characteristic you want in an RT and will probably shine at the position next year).

When I think of the LT position, I imagine an immovable bulwark someone who can win a 1 on 1 (and maybe a 2 on 1) strength battle every time, and has the arm length and power to keep their target blocked down or at the very least make them move so far around them that the play still has a chance to get off.  When I imagine the RT position, I think of agile quickness and shiftiness... someone who can form the backside of the pocket to protect the QB and keep their hands on their target battling them blow for blow every step of the way. 

It's why if we don't end up with Paris Johnson, the next person with LT traits we should look at is Dawand Jones as he has the elite LT traits NFL teams look for even if he played mostly at RT. In truth he will probably be a better LT than he ever was at RT in college it will just take some time, and the few times he played it in college he was excellent at it. (The reason he played RT btw is that Paris Johnson was Ohio's LT and he is a natural at the position and is a more balanced and polished overall OT than Dawand).",6.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10yx5ca,False,0.0,"""BIG Jeff"" Simmons",2023-02-10T13:12:14Z,tennesseetitans,0.0562909417545295
19218,120333,120333,RyokoKnight,"I mean prior to the 2022 draft it was known Lewan was developing an injury history and having a hard time getting into game ready shape.

Realistically, under a better GM, we would have looked for his replacement probably in the 2nd or 3rd round... someone with the traits to be a starting LT but needed time to develop and so would be Lewan's backup last year.

We didn't do that though... so this year its mandatory.

As for cutting and then hiring lewan back on a vet minimum or something... I'm not sure he would want to do that, as he can make fairly good money from his podcast without the health risks at that price point... and frankly speaking i'm not sure he's worth a roster spot when we know he probably won't be there half the season.

Only if he (Farve) wins that civil case should the defamation case (which is the harder case to prove) be allowed to push forward, and even if he DOES win the civil case, the odds he wins a defamation case when he is currently being accused of stealing from the poor is still low. 

He'd have to prove prior to Sharpe and Pat talking about it he has a good reputation, which he doesn't as again... he has been accused of stealing from the poor by misappropriating funds they simply responded to these allegations.

Furthermore he'd have to prove damages which is very unlikely as its not like Brett Favre lost an NFL contract due to what they said or anything like that, so it seem very flimsy and I hope Shannon Sharpe and Pat McAfee counter sue for legal fees incurred by what looks to be a frivolous lawsuit.",1.0,nfl,t3_10y8rbk,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2023-02-10T11:23:43Z,tennesseetitans,-0.1188703125
19220,120337,120337,RyokoKnight,"Sure, but I guess I'm also just saying this draft class doesn't seem bad overall. Take Will Levis for instance, he's drawn comparisons to Carson wentz or a Josh Allen... 

Not flattering comparisons on either account as both came into the league with flaws and a bit raw.

The difference between the two ultimately came down to the team working with them and the player learning/developing. Josh Allen slowly gained composure in the face of pressure and started playing less hero ball focusing more on tight accurate throws and still has the legs to get yards when absolutely needed. Carson Wentz on the other hand kept pushing himself beyond his physical limitations and continues to rely on hero ball plays that more often than not end up screwing himself and his team out of winnable situations.

Will Levis could be either of these...a Carson Wentz that developed, gained composure, and learned his limits would be an Elite QB leading the Eagles to a superbowl... a Josh Allen who didn't develop, gained poor running into sack traits, and began playing hero ball every game would be a potential back up on some roster.

At least stroud/young will cost nearly no cap AND we could play them as we see fit to either make a massive push or lengthen their career with 0 accumulated NFL hits on their bodies so far.",4.0,tennesseetitans,t3_1102l4s,False,0.0,300 to link?,2023-02-12T10:23:18Z,tennesseetitans,0.05930440899868
30969,168394,168394,WhiteXHysteria,"100% agree we aren't a Tannehill away, but that is not the proper framing.

The proper way to assess this way is are we 20m worth of players away if we extend tannehill, obviously knowing that if we do we are going full rebuild in like 2 years. 

---
#####Here is where I start to go on a tangent. 

I can certainly see some reasonable scenarios where that works out really well for us. 

Let's say we use that money to get orlando brown and dalton risner on backloaded contracts since we build knowing we are throwing 2025 in the trash entirely. If we get them on the cap for ~15m total, grab a meh speedster at wr like breshad perriman for cheap to put pressure on the safeties deep, then we have a lot of flexibility with the draft. 

We could move our pick/picks for a proven talent similar to how the rams made their run. Or we could go straight BPA to try to stack as much young, cheap talent as possible knowing we are going to be blowing up our fets in 2 years while also maybe landing a stud CB/WR/Edge in the process to help us with our push. 

We could also go the entirely opposite route and cut/trade a bunch of vets now and make 2023 our trash can year and gear up for a real run in 2024/2025. Or anywhere in between, but I tend to prefer committing 100% to one plan or the other to either succeed or fail big as opposed to just kind of staying relevant but never good enough a la the 2018-2022 colts.

Outside of that, it's not like Mahomes really has an incredible amount of competition at the position.  


Brady, Manning, Culpepper, Vick, Palmer, Brees, Roethlisberger, Rivers, McNair, Warner, McNabb, Eli Manning were all capable of producing insane stats and carrying teams.  


I guess my point is all this stuff about Mahomes leading in stats more often kind of goes out the window when you consider his competition vs the kind of competition Peyton and Brady had to deal with

WR- Treylon Burks/Jalin Hyatt/Kyle Philips

At that point our biggest concern is the left side of the OL. You’ve got to imagine that Radunz gets an opportunity to start at one of those spots, otherwise he’ll probably be traded too. I think it’d be LT because that’s where he’s played his best the last two years.

This then caught fire amongst pop social media, and caused a bunch of speculation about which  mysterious NFL player was laying pipe to Jeff Stars cavern of mysteries.

Bussin with the Boys, a now Barstool owned podcast is hosted by Taylor Lewan and some fat guy. As any social media driven business goes, it is important that you remain relevant and you remain popular..

I genuinely don't understand all this talk of trying to unload Tannehill *this year*. This is, as I understand it, for all intents and purposes, the final year of his contract. You can get out from underneath his contract relatively cleanly next year if you need to. AND next year, our cap frees up immensely (again, as I understand it). So you only need to make it past this season with his contract and then you can start getting creative and investing in new blood. 

YES, TRUE Tannehill is one of our most expensive players counting against the cap this year - but the overall amount we are spending at the QB position is about on par with what every team in the league not featuring a QB on a rookie QB deal spends. So you're gonna jettison Tannehill and lose a BUNCH of high round picks trying to move up to get a guy to replace him... So you can't use those picks to beef up the roster around a rookie QB? It just doesn't make sense to me. To say nothing of the fact that I don't think we can afford the ammo it will take to get into a bidding war to move up ahead of Indy and Houston.",0.0,tennesseetitans,t3_1138izb,False,1.0,:Titans:,2023-02-15T17:20:14Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0499670570683562
