> Since at least the 1970s, anthropologists have described gender categories in some cultures which they could not adequately explain using a two-gender framework

> For our purposes, the term ""gender"" designates the cultural categories, symbols, meanings, practices, and institutionalized arrangements bearing on at least five sets of phenomena: (1) females and femininity; (2) males and masculinity; (3) Androgynes, who are partly male and partly female in appearance or of indeterminate sex/gender, as well as intersexed individuals, also known as hermaphrodites, who to one or another degree may have both male and female sexual organs or characteristics; (4) transgender people, who engage in practices that transgress or transcend normative boundaries and are thus by definition ""transgressively gendered""; and (5) neutered or unsexed/ungendered individuals such as eunuchs. - Comment from me: this is from a book by an anthropologist

> The Indigenous māhū of Hawaii are seen as embodying an intermediate state between man and woman, or as people ""of indeterminate gender"", while some traditional Dineh of the Southwestern US recognize a spectrum of four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man. The term ""third gender"" has also been used to describe the hijras of South Asia who have gained legal identity, the fa'afafine of Polynesia, and the Albanian sworn virgins.

> In a study of people in the United States who thought themselves to be members of a third gender, Ingrid M. Sell found that they typically felt different from the age of 5.

1) Implement a sky judge which can call flags as they see fit, or neutralize them, or show a different camera angle of the play.

2) Make reffing a full-time job. In the summer they have classes and practice sessions and rule review to get them prepped for the season ahead.

3) Conduct thorough ref reviews at the end of the season and discuss individual calls (or lack thereof). Make it clear that no one bad call would constitute a firing, but general incompetence or repeatedly missing calls could lead to adjustments in role.

4) Encourage refs to discuss more often on the field. Yes it slows down the game somewhat, but generally discussions yield positive results, and I’d be willing to sacrifice some time if they get the call right.

5) Allow challenges and automatic reviews for penalties. Like any other review process, it has to be clear and obvious to overturn, but this will allow for any errors that slip through the cracks to hopefully be mopped up.

Bonus step: Get the rules analyst to talk more - generally they can clear many concerns the average viewer has up. For example, one big exception to holding is the rip move.
