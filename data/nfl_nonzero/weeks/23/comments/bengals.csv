The only guy on the oline that performed at a high/probowl caliber level in their career was Collins and maybe kappa.  Carras was a rotational lineman and 6th man iirc.  Jonah has been up and down and injuries haven't helped much.  When they were all healthy they started to play pretty well together.  I think this is obviously the best we've had at oline in quite some time and you can't fault pollack too much for the previous few seasons.   That said, I think this upcoming year will be key in seeing how he is at developing talent.  I've said in multiple posts about this I don't think we spend anything in FA on oline this year since we spent so much last year and jonah/Collins are ok their final year and I don't anticipate extension,  also Collins likely to miss half the year.  That said, can pollack coach up Carman to be an every down starter while Collins is out and in 24+?  I hope we draft 2 OL early and expect them to sit next year, will pollack get thise glass eaters ready to replace Jonah, Collins and possibly Carman in 24?  People were hard on volson but I expect him to continue to improve from his rookie year, that can almost be directly tied to coaching as well.

Defensive players rarely get it because the Super Bowl MVP is the most idiotically decided award. I genuinely feel like they decide either before the game or in the first quarter who’s going to win the MVP for each team. 

1. Like last year, they probably said if the Bengals win it goes to Burrow and if the Rams win it goes to Stafford. They only change their plans if said player has a terrible game or if someone else has an amazing game. In the case of Super Bowl 56, Stafford threw 2 INTs and Kupp went off so they called an audible and gave it to Kupp. Probably should’ve been Aaron Donald. Donald had 2 sacks, 2 TFLs, and 3 QB hits including the game winning hit. You can probably argue they don’t win that game without Aaron Donald.

2. Same story the year before. You had a defense that held Patrick Mahomes to ZERO TOUCHDOWNS and yet they gave the MVP to Tom Brady who had a mid game. Meanwhile, Devin White had 12 god damn tackles and a pick. Devin White 1000000% got robbed here.

3. Same story again the year before. Mahomes turned the ball over twice. MVP should’ve gone to either Damien Williams who had 100 yards rushing. Tyreek Hill did have 100 yards receiving but he had 16 targets. If it must go to a receiver, Sammy Watkins had 98 yards on just 6 targets.

4. The year before that, Julian Edelman, an offensive player, got the SB MVP despite being on an offense that only scored 13, and the Patriots defense held the most potent offense in the league to 3 points. That year absolutely should’ve been a defensive MVP.

5. I will not argue against Nick Foles winning Super Bowl MVP the year before that though. He actually did ball out that game. Almost 400 yards, three touchdowns, and a touchdown reception that he called to himself. That shit is what makes you a Super Bowl MVP in my eyes. Not simply being the QB of the winning team.

I genuinely don’t think they put any thought into this award. They need to either stop considering it when deciding whether or not to make a player a Hall of Famer, or they need to start actually awarding it properly.

Nick Bolton ALONE had more solo tackles than Chris Jones, Juan Thronhill, and L'Jarius Sneed COMBINED. Not to mention the fumble returned for a TD. He damn near had another one as well. The Chiefs do not win this game without Nick Bolton. But honestly there are a lot of QBs that could've done what Mahomes did today.

I don't like the Chiefs, but I was damn impressed by the defense last night. You can point out the score, but that isn't the fault of the defense, they went to war and were constantly on the field. They played incredible football against an incredible defense and proved so many people wrong about their abilities. They deserved the chance to prove it completely by stopping one last drive from Philly, which they were effectively doing, but the officials stepped in because they didn't wanna risk it.

The way I look at it is that had we played better, the cheating wouldn't have mattered. It was possible to overcome it. We earned the loss. However, the Rams did not earn the win and neither did the Chiefs. If fans would just remember that and make it a thing to refuse to respect fake champions, the league will be less likely to let it happen. Unfortunately, people are easily led into narratives and the narrative that Mahomes is the goat after getting carried by his team and the refs is the new story designed to make people forget and pretend he earned something.

21528,154556,154556,Razzberry42069,"I feel like the rational view is always lost in these situations. The past two Superbowls were undeniably influenced by one-sided reffing that served the bottom line of the NFL. However, this is not a scripted sport and biased refs are not impossible to overcome because they have to be selective in what they do and have to avoid pushing it too far. At most, biased refs are gonna swing a game by one score. This is not an impossible hurdle. They've certainly gotten a lot better at picking the right time to get involved, but that's kind of the issue here. You can't let a game get to the point where it CAN be influenced by bullshittery. If it's not bad reffing it's injuries, fluke luck, weird weather, anything. Anything can happen at any moment. Play to prevent those situations from occurring.

The Bengals and the Eagles do not deserve to be retroactively crowned champions, they didn't earn a win. However, neither did the Rams or the Chiefs. They didn't deserve to win either and only got it because the refs were in their pocket. Bandwagon casual fans will make that win their identity and flaunt it without shame, but no fanbase wants a gifted championship because it comes with no respect and only makes you the villain. It's worse than a loss. As a Bengals fan, I'm actually worried that the NFL is now gonna try to create a narrative about Cincinnati vs Kansas City and the illusion of a rivalry and start giving us that type of protection next season. If I see us start winning close games because of controversial calls next season, I'm not watching anymore. 

I'm worried that there's too much conversation about this team now and the NFL is gonna wanna seize that opportunity. I'd much rather go back to the classic days of the Bungles than be paper champion. All we need to do is maintain a healthy o-line and even bad reffing won't be enough to keep us from winning it all.

QB - top half of the league in spending at QB position. dispels the myth that you need a QB on a rookie contract to get to a SB

RB - i think everyone knows about this one, SB winners generally don't spend big on RB

WR - similar to RB, not a lot of spending here for SB winners

TE - well, Gronk and Kelce are the explanations here

OL - LA is an outlier but spending on OL seems to be a helpful way to win

DL - KC is outlier spending so high on DL, but they key here is production without huge spending. Interesting that LA is not top 10 in spending last year but also had Donald, I think the contract structure really helped with that.

LB - not required to win SB

DB - not as much spending here as you would think, it's really all about the trenches

I would really like to look at this along side with positional performance rankings by team, but that is too much for my pea-brain to put together. 

It doesn't take into account the rookie contracts and where they are and might have more performance at a specific position than spending.

The first play he threw into double coverage, and the throw was short. The throw looks impressive because he didn't get set, but it was an ill advised throw that he's lucky wasn't intercepted. 

2nd play was a drop by Kelce, he was pressured, scrambled, but there was nothing I haven't seen 10 other QBs do.

3rd play he scrambled and threw the ball too high, and even if the receiver would have caught the ball they would have been out of bounds. Again the play looks impressive because of his arm position, but it was an inaccurate throw.

4th play is a sidearm throw, (to no one? they don't show the receiver).

5th play he scrambles and chucks the ball out of bounds to Byron Pringle. I've seen many QBs do this. I have no idea why the defender is lamenting this play.

6th play he throws on the run, it's impressive, but he throws into double coverage again. The mechanics of the throw is impressive (and looks like a MLB shortstop). The only thing about the throw that is impressive is the position of his body, it's an ill advised throw into coverage with four defenders near the ball. This looks like a hailmary. He's lucky it wasn't intercepted.

Mahomes benefits greatly from an amazing offensive line, and an absolute master for a head coach/play designer. Also one of the best tight ends to ever play in the NFL.

Mahomes has a very strong arm. Mahomes can throw sidearm, and off balance like a MLB shortstop. His throws look impressive because of the position he puts himself in. Most of the time it's not necessary. Mahomes' inability to get through his reads, cause him to scramble and make the crazy athletic throws. Again it looks very impressive, but it's not necessary if you are a good QB who gets through your reads.

When Mahomes first came into the league I couldn't believe how good he was, but after a while I figured out that the only reason I thought he was that good was because of the unnecessary scrambling, and contortions he puts his body in to make throws.

Mahomes play style isn't sustainable. The beating that the NFL puts on a human body will catch up to him in a year or two. We will see less and less of these shortstop, off balance throws. I think we will get a true sense of how great in the next couple of years, when Mahomes body won't allow the shortstop/offbalance throws, when Andy Reid retires, and Kelce is gone.",-1.0,bengals,t3_112911h,False,0.0, ,2023-02-15T00:23:36Z,bengals,0.0237882110728501
