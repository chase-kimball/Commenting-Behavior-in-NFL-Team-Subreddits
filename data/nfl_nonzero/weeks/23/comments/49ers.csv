My brother-in-law is a Bears fan and on multiple occasions he's told me that we did Alex dirty, and that's what really pisses me off. 

I don't mind giving him some love, or even the occasional appreciaton post, but he shouldn't be considered a great Niner based on his playing. He was a bust.",43.0,49ers,t3_1139xqb,False,0.0,:jerseyaway20: Garrison Hearst,2023-02-15T18:09:21Z,49ers,0.0127309614896774

To be clear, I'm not necessarily disagreeing that I'd like to see our future franchise QB's get some protection, and some more continuity at the position. But the win rate doesn't directly translate to how many sacks a QB takes. Case and point, the Bears and Broncos in 2022.

481,8226,8226,Actual-Manager-4814,"I agree with all that. And I think you're right, pass blocking help will likely have to be found in the sleeper rounds. It makes too much sense to resign McGlinchey if he's willing to resign on a team friendly deal, playing to his strengths and living with his weaknesses. 

It's been a balancing act for sure, and maybe losing 4 quarterbacks in a season is the tipping point. I didn't mean to imply that our quarterbacks aren't worth protecting because they're not Mahomes or Allen. Bears and Steelers obviously invested in protecting their first rounders and potential franchise guys. I wouldn't be against us doing it the same (though it goes without saying, I don't think it has to be our first rounder). But Bears and Steelers are in full rebuild mode. 

Shanny and Lynch have pulled off magic in the late rounds so maybe we'll find a diamond in the rough. But I'd be surprised if they took a big swing, or make a big philosophical change, unless their hand gets forced.",1.0,49ers,t3_1126jaq,False,0.0,:jerseyaway20: Garrison Hearst,2023-02-14T18:37:37Z,49ers,0.04258982386892
482,8227,8227,Actual-Manager-4814,"It sounds like you're saying the same thing. That the pass block win rate isn't useful in all situations, including ours, because some offenses are designed to get the ball out quicker. I mean, the Bengals aren't even pictured on this list and Burrow's pretty successful. So the stat IS pretty useless. 

That said, I do agree that for offenses that have guys like Mahomes or Allen, it helps to be able to hold protection because those two can basically put the ball wherever they want on the field. It puts a ton of pressure on the secondary to have to cover every square inch of the field even for just a fraction of a second longer.

But unless Trey becomes THAT guy, we're going to rely on the running game and deception in order to get our shots down field. We're not investing in pass blocking hogs to just drop Purdy back there and throw 55-60 yard bombs all day.

Winning a SB years ago is relevant to the conversation if you still have the same coach and continuity from those teams. For example, Chiefs winning in 2019 is still relevant even though they just won another one because they had the same coach, FO, and QB.


The 2017 Eagles? Completely different QB, coaching staff, philosophy, and key players that are on the scene.


How are the exploits of the 2017 Eagles SB team relevant to the current team? Why should I care that the Eagles won a SB in 2017 if it has no relevance to the present?


I've noticed something hypocritical with fans who insult teams with legacy SB wins: they use the recency argument. That's fine if you're a recent SB winner with the same team, but at some point you're just relying on distant history to make your argument since your current teams have no relation at all to your championship teams.

You really wanna see the differences in the fanbase?🤣 I can provide video of Niners fans being harassed in your own stadium for that game, or the numerous examples of your fanbase rioting and destroying your own city because of the Eagles. Please don't even try to pull that card that our fanbase is *anywhere* as bad as yours.


And for reddit, countless of your fans brigaded and got banned from /r/49ers from all your fandom's trolling.


>We lost. We own it.

I don't think you even understand *why* the Niners players started to say these comments in the first place. The Niners have no problem acknowledging that they lost in important games. They've done it against the Rams last year in the NFC Championship and against the Chiefs in 2019, both cases with either a more important game or more rivalry.


The difference is that your team immediately started with the gloating post-game, saying publicly things like how they had Kittle's statements as bulletin board material, that they played better cause they were ""disrespected"". Darius Slay said this post-game:


>Even though I still have a lot of respect for the guy, but it triggered us to go out and play a lot harder to show who’s physical. So you seen as the game was going on, **you see who been the most physical team**.”

Fletcher Cox said this:

>Anyone see that paper  defense ? - I heard they showed up yesterday !!!

>I need answers


And then Cox said this afterwards:


>“So right now we’re just a paper team. Looks good on paper. **I think we made 85 eat those comments.”**

Niners always give teams their props but the Eagles were crowing about being ""the most physical team"" and their so-called domination. And not even acknowledging the circumstances of that game.


Your team didn't deserve shit for respect when they didn't even give any. *That's* why the Niners don't respect them either, hence the comments, which only all happened after the Eagles said all those things publicly post-game on their victory tour.

>Lynch credited one man in particular for stumping for Purdy: Steve Slowik, the brother of Bobby Slowik, the team’s passing game coordinator. Lynch also recalled playing for their father, Bob Slowik, a member of Mike Shanahan’s coaching staff in Denver.

>Steve Slowik is currently a pro scout, assessing other teams in the league, but was previously an area scout responsible for the area including Purdy’s school, Iowa State.

>“Steve Slowik always was a big Brock Purdy fan and when you talk to him, he said you can’t not be,” Lynch said. “Because you talk to the head coach Matt Campbell and everybody at that school and that program really ascended out of nowhere and a lot of people credited Matt Campbell.

It’s a mob scene folks! 

The Eagles fans are drunker and stupider then ever. Hard to believe but, they’ve somehow managed it.

The city is in fact sold out of beer and citizens are resorting to drinking rubbing alcohol and occasionally water by accident.

Cars are on fire, lamp posts are down and the city streets are pure bedlam. They’ve burned down the local sports bars and taken to looting Costco. 

The local library, long forgotten and ignored remains safe as does the employment office.

Only 83 more payments and that Dodge Warlock is all yours!

And the final straw for me is the Midwest fans (who don’t live in KC) adopting the Chiefs and wearing their Chiefs hoodys from Scheels this week.

“Bruh, I’ve always been a Chiefs fan…”

Mf’er, you didn’t like the chiefs when they were losing?!?!?? But you LOVE them now?

It’s just like when the cringe Bay Area traitors adopted Seattle when they won (their only) Super Bowl. 

I hope the best team lose - but let’s be honest…

The NFL is crooked AF!!!

The chiefs got a do over and the NFL intentionally hid the dropped ball/“completion” in the NFC game.

22848,160561,160561,SoKrat3s,"There is a difference between W/L turnaround and talent turnaround.  

Nearly everyone agrees the Vikings had a win turnaround, but not necessarily a talent turnaround.  

It's the same way for the Bears.  With Fields, they could win more games next season than they have over the past several.  But there is such a severe lack of talent on that team that they are not a real playoff contender.  

If they went the route I suggested and rebuilt from the ground up, they would stink regardless of whether it was ~~Aaron Rodgers~~ (kidding) Derrick Carr or Nick Mullens.  

The best path, in my opinion, for the Bears to become a Superbowl contending team, is to trade both Fields and that top pick, build up the team.  Adding a lot of young talent all across the offense and defense.  That way, in 2 years when you draft another QB you have a team with plenty of talent that is ready to win games -- like the Jaguars have done.  

Yes, the Eagles added a lot of quality pieces this season, but the core of that team was built up over years, before Hurts was ready for primetime.  

Goff, to his credit, has played well.  But the Lions built that team from the ground up, adding talent all over the roster, before getting a long-term QB.  

The core of the 49ers rebuild was creating a wide depth of talent all across the roster.

* The first one is straight forward.  He doesn't believe QB runs are a straight up solution to create rushing yards.  This is accurate.  If Trey is running it 6 times a game at 5 YPC, that 30 yards isn't significantly altering the team rushing total.  Trey would have to be running it 10-12 times a game for their to be a large enough volume of rushing yards from the QB to be impactful on the team total rushing yards.  

* Second quote; He's talking about one specific play.  It was a read-option.  Saying that play can help him be successful doesn't say he wants to do it 15 times a game.  

* The third quote very specifically says *""when you are a threat to run, even though you don't have to do it every time.""*  
This is it spot on.  He wants the *threat* of the QB run, without the need for 12 QB runs a game.  When a defense has to account for a QB who can run it opens other running lanes and it forces the defense in favorable situations in the passing game.

Shanahan has an incredible track record in the media of saying things publicly and actually putting into practice the things he is saying.  The only things he's been sketchy on is injury reports.  Outside of that most of the things he said, he put into practice.  


>Did you watch Trey College days?  
>...Does trey has accurate throws like Allen?

Trey was incredibly accurate in college.  You might question the openness of the WRs or the talent of the other defense, but you can't actually argue he was inaccurate in college.  

Josh Allen came into the NFL with major accuracy concerns.  They aren't the same college prospect, but they are very similar NFL prospects if you look at Lance now and Allen in year 2.  Through his first two NFL seasons Josh Allen completed a mere 56.2% of his passes and 65.2% from year 3 and beyond.  

>He uses his athleticism to evade and sometimes ram into opponents. If he slips thru, he has speed! Who the fck does that remind you of? Fckin Lamar Jackson bro! Stop playin!

That does not remind me of of Lamar Jackson.  Jackson isn't a barrel into opposing players type of runner.  He's also so much faster than either of them.  

Josh Allen doesn't avoid contact like Lamar.  A lot of his runs are closer to defenders than Lamar's juking style.  He uses his size, moderate speed, and physicality to gain yards on the ground.  This is probably the closest running comp to Trey Lance's reckless abandon.

When asked about his decision to select Trey Lance for the the very first time, Kyle Shanahan offered 10 points about Trey's mental ability to handle the quarterback position before even bringing up his physical gifts.

I don't believe the narrative that he wants Trey to be Lamar.  
I believe the situations Trey found him in dictated more running than Shanahan would have liked.  

* The Arizona start, Trey was only declared the starter late on a Friday.  He had no time to learn a gameplan or work with the starters (Kittle not among them, because he was inactive).  He only had limited pieces of the playbook that could be used.  His only weapons were Deebo, who dropped 22% of his passes in that game, an Aiyuk who still wasn't getting separation from defenders (and in Shanahan's doghouse), and Mitchell only had 9 carries.  
That situation dictated Trey running the ball more than passing it.  
* The Chicago game, half of his runs came after the defense blew the lead and he was forced to lead a comeback in weather that was not pass friendly.  If he hadn't been forced to lead a comeback He probably would have only finished with 6-8 runs.  
* Just like he only had 8 at Houston.  
* And likely would have finished close to that number against Seattle, where Shanahan even admitted the gameplan wasn't to run Trey all day, but to do it a couple times to force Seattle to adjust to it, opening other areas of the field.

* Any of the negative commentary has come from Brandon Aiyuk; who entirely admitted he was salty and just ****-talking because of that.  
* As well as Jimmie Ward, who is about to be a former 49er, saying what he would do if he were at safety.  Everyone seemed to miss that this was just as much a slight against the 49ers as it was the Eagles.  He doesn't play safety, and he isn't likely to return to the 49ers as a safety.  

* Aiyuk & Ward should be called out for their comments.  But those are really the only truly negative things that have been said about the Eagles from 49ers players.

38240,258260,258260,johnw188,"I totally disagree. The first few games would be annoying, but “there’s holding on every play” happens because holding isn’t called on every play and so if you’re not holding you’re not playing as well as you could be. If you had a robot judge that could call the game with perfect accuracy you’d soon learn exactly what gets called and what doesn’t because it’s totally consistent.

The closest analogy I can think of in the current game, with a rule that’s usually called correctly and can happen accidentally fairly easily, is face mask penalties today - basically nobody tries to intentionally grab the face mask, and when someone does they’re generally going “shit I fucked up” and not arguing a judgement call.

Also, the rules would definitely need to change. You might be like “when called perfectly the holding rules make it impossible to play defense”, and then you might start tweaking it to be like “you can have an open hand on the body of the offensive player for leverage, and holding is when you close the fist” or whatever.",6.0,nfl,t3_111htum,False,0.0,:49ers: 49ers,2023-02-13T22:39:00Z,49ers,0.1587947680898491

If you have perfect robot technology that calls all holds, even the ticky tack ones, people will stop holding. In soccer it’ll lead to people starting their run a half second later than they do currently because they’re the best in the world and they will extract any minuscule amount of edge they can find, and they’ll learn the absolute edge of what the robo ref will call, and the sport will be better for it.",3.0,nfl,t3_111htum,False,0.0,:49ers: 49ers,2023-02-13T21:27:14Z,49ers,0.170240768
