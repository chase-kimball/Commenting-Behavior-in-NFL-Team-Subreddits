Out of all the AFC West rivals, Broncos fans are by far the saltiest about the success of Mahomes and the Chiefs than either the Raiders or Chargers. Chargers fans for the most part seem to have quite a bit of mutual respect for Mahomes and the Chiefs, which I have a lot of respect for. 

I’m definitely not saying you have to like your rival, but when it’s a team like the 2018-2023 Mahomes led Chiefs, you should at least have an ounce of respect for what they’ve done, whether you like them or not.

The Rams can't sign a QB because of negative cap space but grabbing a foolishly offered first round pick is also a bad idea(tm)?

So if I'm right and Stafford retires. And your right and Donald is also done if forced to play with Baker. That leaves the Rams farther from contention rather than closer.

I'll lose some karma and say I'd take this trade. Based on last year the Rams need to retool and first round picks are a good start. 

The 2022 Rams were not a QB and a few injured players recovered away from repeating. Stafford has 1 or 2 years left in the tank, maybe less.

Obviously I'm not unbiased, and it's annoying to have it happen in the way it is, but if you look at other angles of the play, you can see that Logan clearly grabs onto Kupp in order to maintain position and sort of pull himself closer so have leverage and break up the pass. 

If he doesn't do that then it's likely a catch for the first down. It doesn't look like much because it's not much, but it's still a DB holding onto a receiver in order to maintain position/leverage, and therefore the correct call. Other angles outside of the broadcast one show it.

I guess nobody remembers Darrell Henderson being mugged on the play right before that, but no penalty was called despite it being a clear and obvious defensive holding which would've led to a first down inside the Bengals 10. 

Or the TD taken off the board due to ""offsetting penalties"" of a Rams hold that didn't affect the play at all, while Cooper Kupp is smashed in the back of the end zone.

Or the free Cincy TD on the offensive pass interference in the 3rd quarter that even made the game close in the first place?

Oh, and by the way: Cooper Kupp was the WR triple crown winner. You didn't think they were going to let LB's grab him on crossing routes 5 yds deep in the red zone and just let them get away with it, did you? 

[I mean, grabbing the jersey is holding, whether it's barely holding or fully holding.](https://twitter.com/txyesboy/status/1625309601762623488?s=46&t=lhrBuhW_bRPXavd2_1ikMw)

The refs missed calls, but it didn't affect the outcome of the game. We Rams fans already heard this shit in the NFCCG against New Orleans and there was plenty of shit we took for that - and we earned it on that one. This one just screams sour grapes.

Outside of the gift 75 yard touchdown in the 3rd quarter, Cincinnati ran 31 plays for a whopping 61 yards in the rest of the second half and their defense got them their only other points by forcing a turnover deep in Rams territory leading to their only other 2nd half points (FG).

I'll repeat: outside of the clear and obvious offensive PI on the only Cincy TD in the 2nd half - good for 75 yards, Cincy averaged LESS THAN TWO YARDS PER PLAY in the 2nd half. 

They had the ball late in rhe 4th and chose to run Perrine right at Aaron Donald rather than Joe Mixon. And for all the shit AD gets on this sub (many times deservingly), the Cincy OL went after him on a clean play that even Burrow said wasn't dirty at all. All they did was woke up the beast. 

Sorry man; this pisses me off everytime I see this. I'm sorry y'all think the refs were selective about calling borderline penalties. But the best way to avoid being called for borderline penalties is...not committing them in the first place.
