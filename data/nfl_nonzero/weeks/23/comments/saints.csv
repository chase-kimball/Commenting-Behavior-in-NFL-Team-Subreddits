It wasn’t until their 34th year in the league (2000) that they won a playoff game. That 2000 Saints team was the only NFC team to dethrone the Greatest Show on Turf in the playoffs from 1999-2001.

So much happened in that 10 seconds. One of the refs was absolutely reaching for his flag. He saw it. He was positioned on the sideline behind the line of scrimmage. 

There was another ref also on the sideline but towards the endzone. 

As the ref behind the LOS started reaching for his flag, the endzone ref started to violently wave him off. What we know now is the endzone ref didn’t mean to wave off the other ref, he was violently waving towards Sean Payton (who at this point was running down the sideline). 

He was waving for Payton to essentially stay the fuck away. Unfortunately the ref behind the LOS happened to be right between them and thought the ref was telling him no flag. 

Then perennial practice squad player Tommy Lee Lewis (the WR) just stood up and jogged back to the sideline as if nothing happened. 

What would have happened if Payton just chilled out and didn’t run towards the ref. Why would have happened if Lewis actually made a scene and begged for the flag. 

Then how Payton handled it afterwards didn’t give us any favors. The refs clearly had it in for him during the 2019-2021 seasons. And odds are the Broncos fans have no idea what’s coming.

Super Bowl LVII: Tie game. 1:52 left. 3rd & 8 from the 15. Defense has 1 timeout left. Penalty is called and sets up a virtual goal to go (technically could've picked up a first down at the 1-foot line). Chiefs run down 1:38 of clock. Eagles get kickoff with 8 seconds, have 6 seconds of offense to tie/win it.

2018 NFCCG: Tie game. 1:49 left. 3rd & 10 from the 13. Defense has 1 timeout left. If the penalty gets called, and a similar 1:38 goes off the clock. Rams get 3 seconds and no timeouts to try and win it.

I understand, just like the Eagles, the Saints had plenty of opportunities to do something else before and after. But seeing how it could've played out happen live last night is a little disheartening again.

Lots of competition from elite defensive teams like the bears, eagles and giants.
