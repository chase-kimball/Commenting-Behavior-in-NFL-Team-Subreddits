 A lot of that may have had to do with how many starters we lose every year to injury relative to other teams. You don’t hear about it as much on mainstream media sources because broncos are never much of a talking point relative to say, the 49ers (who often seem to have a lot of starters out on IR the same years we do). But we are consistently, year in and year our the most injured team. Not just with ACL tears. Something much deeper was going on here. It’s an anomaly if it’s 1 year.

But I still give it to Raiders game 2 hands down. While it was obvious this wasn’t the team we thought we were getting, there was still an outside chance we could’ve turned it around at 3-6, and maybe not made the playoffs, but at least finished with a decent record and a reason for optimism moving forward. Instead, we hit the full bronco bingo card—a Gordon fumble to completely fuck up momentum and flip the game around, 16 points, a total Hackett game management screw up at the end, capped off by the anti-clutch defense finally breaking when it matters most—all leading to getting swept for a 3rd year in a row by the raiders, by three different coaching staffs, the third being Josh McDaniels. And it’s not like they were even a good team either. I can handle the chief sweeps, those games stopped hurting in 2019. But I cannot stomach this “can’t beat the raiders” thing. That’s a bridge too far. Even if we’d gone 6-11, I could’ve handled it with a raiders win. Hell I’d prefer going 1-5 in division, and having the chargers sweep us, but having that one be against the raiders.

Usually if I start seeing them as a puppy and can educate the client they are the absolute sweetest dogs and some of my favorite patients. They come flying in the door wiggling their butts and kissing everyone.

A lot of the shelter-adopted ones I see are also very sweet, but of course the bad ones at the shelters aren't adopted out.

The ones that have no training or an owner who wants to make them a guard dog are usually the worst because the people think if the dog is nasty it's a good thing, which is wrong. A good guard dog knows its job and its triggers. A good guard dog goes to the vet and behaves because that's not where it ""works"".

I don't know if there's an answer to the ""issue"". You can't stop people breeding dogs, they'll find a way. And you can have chihuahuas and French Bulldogs that are just as nasty as pit bulls. We just need better education on what the breeds are meant for and how to train them. First time dog owner? Here's a lab mix. Don't get a pit/German Shepherd/Rottweiler.

>“Here’s the thing I learned back in ’06: Slow to hire,’’ Payton said. “The mistakes I’ve learned over time is when you’re in a hurry – you’ve got to get your guy. That’s not the right thing. Slow to hire, fast to fire.”

>More than half of Nathaniel Hackett’s staff from the Broncos’ 2022 season has already moved on, and more changes will be coming.

>“I said this earlier, I think it’s important,’’ Payton said. “When you have a 5-12 season, there’s dirt on a lot of people’s hands. Obviously, the attention goes to the head coach and the quarterback. But the key is making the correct changes and turning this thing around.”

…

>Payton’s assistant coaching interview process is much more thorough than when he put his first staff together for the Saints in 2006. One reason is the Rooney Rule that extends past two head coach minority candidates, but also two minority interviews for each of the offensive, defensive and special teams coordinator positions and one for quarterback coach.

>Payton did confirm his former Saints’ offensive lineman Zach Strief would be the Broncos’ new offensive line coach. Strief was coming out of Northwestern, where head coach Randy Walker was previously the assistant coach Payton’s boss at Miami of Ohio.
