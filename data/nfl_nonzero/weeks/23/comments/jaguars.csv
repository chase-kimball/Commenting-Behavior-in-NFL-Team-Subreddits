88,664,664,4thTimesAnAlt,"I'm going to point out yet again that his tape doesn't show much fundamental improvement. It's easy to look like a good OT when your QB is getting the ball out in ~2.5 seconds. Even then, Jawaan wasn't winning pass block reps, he was still getting pushed back into the pocket constantly. A guy who's been a starter for 4 years who *still* can't anchor is a bad sign. 

And we're not even discussing his run blocking. Jesus fuck it makes no sense. He should be an absolute mauler, but he doesn't have the functional strength to move guys. 

Little has shown that he can do what Jawaan can't. Personally, I'd try a tag-and-trade, try and get a 2nd and 4th or 2nd and 5th for Taylor.

5987,46543,46543,Dakar-A,"Realistically, once you get in the playoffs it's a bit of a crapshoot. However, all of those QBs sans Hurts are in the AFC, so they'd have to be playing each other for the honor of getting to play in the Superbowl. 

So the most important factor would probably be the ability to get the #1 seed in the AFC. The Bengals and Bills were in contention for that this year up until the last 3 weeks of the season, so they are good candidates for next year.

However, there were very clear cracks in the Bills, and so their ability to contend for the top spot will be at least partially determined by how they draft/what they do in free agency.

Herbert and Lawrence are typically considered around a similar tier. I'd argue that overall Herbert has better weapons, though he'll probably be losing Keenan Allen this offseason, and there's the uncertainty that a new OC brings. Lawrence has the advantage of Calvin Ridley likely coming in next year, and consistency in coaching and scheme. Additionally, Herbert has to play Mahomes twice a year, while Lawrence gets the rebuilding Colts and Texans, along with the sunsetting Titans this year.

Lamar is in contract hell and likely will be more interested in securing his second contract this year over dragging the Ravens to the 'ship this year. Not saying it can't happen, but he's probably the least likely.

Tua is another dark horse, but he has the disadvantage of having the Bills in his division, along with questions about his concussion propensity. Definitely not someone you can count out, but at least right now, the odds are against him.

With all that in consideration, I'd say:

 1. Hurts

 2. Burrow

 3. Lawrence

 4. Allen

 5. Herbert/Tua

 7. Jackson

I think Lawrence edges out Allen on being younger and on the rookie contract, with fewer question marks on the supporting cast. Herbert and Tua tie in my eyes because while Herbert has fewer questions about his durability, Tua arguably has the stronger supporting cast and coach. These are *all* a lot closer than it may seem, and I think that injuries and schedule will ultimately move the needle a lot more than pure QB play alone.",0.0,nfl,t3_112595d,False,0.0,:Jaguars: Jaguars,2023-02-14T09:34:34Z,jaguars,0.0058299962347462

If you're doing that specifically to land one guy, that's betting the farm. You can also do that by being medicore and trading up for a high pick to get your guy.

But in a vacuum, tanking doesn't have to involve it being for one particular prospect. The 2.1 pick is essentially the same as a late 1st, so tankining is just about getting the most reward the league sets up for the worst team. Really it's kinda shocking more teams don't do it on purpose, since that's what the league is set up to reward. Going 7-10 just gets you a worse draft pick and tougher opponents next year.

30797,211957,211957,dobie1kenobi,"I’ve been using my game pass access to watch all our games from this past season and I’ve got a real question, albeit in the weeds, about the fumble recovery in the Raven’s game where Muma was touching the loose ball while his elbow brushed the sideline. This caused the ball to be out of bounds thus nullifying the fumble recovery that happened within the same second as the infraction. I don’t disagree with the call, but I can’t wrap my head around the rule. If the Ravens ball carrier had possession and Muma made contact with the ball while stepping out of bounds it would be ridiculous to claim the ball went out of bounds, because the possession is key to the play. However, once the ball is fumbled, possession goes out the window. Why is this? I can’t seem to find another point in the game where this type of rule applies. It’s almost like during a kick-off where if the ball is touched while the player is standing in the endzone causes a touchback, but I can see the need for that rule as far as finding the proper position of the ball. However, if a player is out of bounds, not in the endzone, and touches the ball in a kick off, it’s a penalty not out of bounds at the point where the ball is touched (at least that’s my understanding). If a ball is fumbled and possession is gained in bounds, I feel that possession should define the ball’s position, not simply contact with a player that isn’t holding the ball.

40541,259249,259249,pcbuilderdude,"I think our most likely 1st pick is CB, and for that I’d think we’d just choose the best available, likely Devon Witherspoon or Keele Ringo. But, Darnell Washington could also be a great addition. He reminds me a lot of Marcedes Lewis and we could use him and EE together on plays to create mismatches

1st: TE Darnell Washington;
Said what I think of him, whether we keep EE or not he would be a great guy to use like an extra lineman or as a mismatch. He’s also a good replacement for both Manhertz and Arnold as he excels at what they’re both good at.

2nd: DL Mazi Smith;
We need more QB pressures in order to be more successful on defense. Mazi Smith is great at getting to the QB and would be a good pickup for our Dline.

3rd: CB Jaylon Jones;
Incredibly talented CB that could play either slot or outside depending on where we put Darious. I think we move DWilliams to the slot and have Jaylon on the outside opposite Tyson Campbell.

4th: WR Parker Washington;
We need more depth in our WR room as we are likely dropping Marvin Jones, Parker Washington is a good receiver that could comfortably take his place in the roster and replace Zay if the time comes to trade him.

5th: OT Wanya Morris;
We need to protect the Prince, and Morris was the best player available here. Should be able to give TLaw plenty of time to select his shots.

5th: S Jay Ward;
Great safety that could be a good backup for Cisco and Jenkz should one of them get injured. Also seems like he is a good ST player so he’s got that going for him as well.

6th: EDGE KJ Henry;
Could be a potential Travon Walker replacement down the line depending on how Travon plays. Solid Edge, not much else.

6th: OT Zion Nelson;
Good OT/OL player for added depth to the oline roster

7th: IOL Braeden Daniels

Every mock draft I’ve seen so far has us going tight end and I just hate it. Engram proved the player he is this year, he either needs a deal or a franchise tag if the team isn’t 100% sold still.

Stick with the guy Trevor already knows and who is starting to live up to his potential already.

And if we stick with Engram, we might need a blocking tight end, but I don’t think that is worth a 1st rounder.

I can’t see us needing a WR either. Next year we have kirk, zay, and ridley. Even if ridley isn’t a stud anymore (he should be, since it wasn’t an injury), I can’t imagine he wouldn’t at least be able to play at a WR3 level.

We need a young reicever in devolepment for when we let Zay go and to have one in the pipeline with a few years experience when Ridley goes in 3+ years.

I would take Quentin here as a devolpment WR to keep our playoff appearnces going after 3+ years. We need to think long term to be perenial playoff contenders.

2nd : DT.

We need more beef on the interior line as evidenced by our issues stopping the run with Fatukasi out. We also need more pass rush to convert our 4th highest pressures into sacks instead which we where at 26th.

I would taki Mazi Smith here. A athletic freak with extreme upside and let him stew a year for our projected SB window by cap space in 24 and 25. Just enough time for him to get some experience before show time.

3rd: OG.

We could use more beef on the oline to either replace Bartch or work as depth behind him to continue to invest in our oline to keep Tlaw clean and help out on the run which ETN could use.

I would suggest Cody Mauch here if he falls down abit.

4th: Slot CB.

We need a slot CB to increase our pass defense so BPA here of whats available. 

4th: TE.

We keep Engram and resign Sam and get a depth piece here. Sam Laporta if available or BPA.

Not sold on Snoop Connor as our power back esp if ETN puts on weight and muscle as he said he would during the off season.

Israel Abranikanda as powerback if ETN doesent. Deuce Vaugn as a pass catching 3rd down back if he does.
