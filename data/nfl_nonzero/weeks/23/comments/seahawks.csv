In Geno's case, he was an NFL starting QB that got sidelined to the backup role for years and then came back to the starting QB role and made the Pro Bowl.  Other players are injured and recover from their injury and return to their former pre-injury success.  It's vague on purpose, you're the one that's pigeonholed it to mean one thing.

The generally accepted criteria for the award by the Professional Football Writers of America (i.e. people that vote on this stuff): The NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award is presented by the Professional Football Writers of America to the player in the National Football League (NFL) who shows perseverance in overcoming adversity, in the form of not being in the NFL the previous year, overcoming a severe injury, or simply a poor performance. 

While the AP CPOY award is accepted as the official NFL award, CPOY is also awarded by the Pro Football Writer's of America and by Sporting News.  Geno Smith won CPOY honors from both of those organizations and he also won the PFWA Most Improved Award.
