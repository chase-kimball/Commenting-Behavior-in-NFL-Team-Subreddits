I don’t think it speaks Washington, though. A big part of rebranding is to honor history/tradition/location. I’m not sure how pigskins addresses that. Commanders, however, pays homage to the armed forces which is a massive fan base of the NFL so it’s seemingly the business-friendly conservative choice they went with and used the mascot to honor the team’s tradition. 

I personally hate the Commanders name. Under new ownership and some winning seasons, I probably won’t care, but the entire experience would be elevated if the name and mascot were better.

To be clear, Bieniemy will not ignore the run game. He’s a former stud all-purpose running back and running backs coach that coached Adrian Peterson and Jamal Charles through some of the best rushing performances of all time. He’d be good for everyone on our offense, not just BRob and AG.

I think Roman is trash as an OC. If Bieniemy wasn’t smart about how to run the ball, I could see a place where they would compliment one another, but Bieniemy can cover it all so it’s one or the other.

If we don’t get Bieniemy and have to roll with Roman, I think we need to bring in a passing game specialist and heavily influence Roman’s play calling percentages. There’s no point in having McLaurin (and his current contract), Dotson (1st round pick), and Samuel (and his current contract), if we bring on Roman. That’s way too much spend on a receiving core to underutilize it. Furthermore, Howell is best utilized with a focus on his arm. He’s not fast, just a strong body that has gamer instincts/IQ/rushing angles to also leverage some mobility. He’s not a poor man’s Lamar Jackson at all. So Roman just doesn’t make any sense for this roster and the moves the org has made up to this point. Bieniemy, however, does. I could see Howell being a poor man’s Mahomes (a bit worse all around and missing that magic X factor that makes Mahomes Mahomes), which would work well for Bieniemy. Also, KC losing Tyreek Hill and still lighting it up is a testament to Andy Reid’s offense. Bieniemy would bring some of that magic with him.

Incorrect. Bieniemy is not the son of Norv Turner, nor is he the son of any coach. Bieniemy is not a flashy hire at all. He’s a high risk high reward hire. We have to take a risk because we are the Washington Commanders (currently owned by Dan Snyder, potentially getting new ownership in a few weeks, with 7 or 8 win Ron as HC, which means this OC role is short term and not an attractive one except for someone who has a shadow on their reputation and is willing to take the risk, like Bieniemy, to leverage the numerous offensive weapons to build a top 10 offense and secure that opportunity as a HC in the NFL in 2024).

We know what he is and it’s not exciting. He had great success that first year with Chip Kelly and then the NFL caught on and that offense quickly became useless. That was a decade ago. I’ll argue he’s too old school, but that’s Ron’s style and why it’s the backup plan.

https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/2022/01/09/denver-broncos-news-offensive-coordinator-pat-shurmur-fired/

“On December 26, 2021 in week 16 of the 2021 NFL season game against the Las Vegas Raiders, Shurmur's offensive game plan made Broncos history as it yielded 40 offensive plays, eight first downs, and 158 yards of total offense. which is the second-fewest in a game in which the Broncos had a true quarterback playing in the last 29 years. The run offense managed just 18 yards on 16 carries, which is tied for the third-fewest in franchise history.” -Wikipedia

Shurmur seems like a great hire at OC if you’re looking to set a record for the worst performance in team history, since he has recent experience with that. He’s also probably desperate for a job, so he’ll be available, but ask yourself why no one else has interviewed him for OC? My guess is because he’s not good and his skills of the past don’t translate to the modern environment. 

“No other team has interviewed Shurmur for the job of offensive coordinator, and speaking with league sources, none are expected.” https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ron-rivera-backup-plan-eric-154500409.html

I’d rather have Howell as QB1, hopefully hire Bieniemy as OC, and let Bieniemy influence the backup vet QB they target that might be great to have in the locker room, adding competition and learning insights of the system. And draft (don’t overreach/overpay) another QB (and don’t stop until we get “the guy”). 

And maybe as a backup plan, you get TH4 back, so it could be:

Howell > TH4 > mid-to-late draft pick

Or

Howell > vet locker room/mentor guy > mid-to-late draft pick

Previously, I wouldn’t want TH4 in that room because I think he’s got a bit of a chip on his shoulder thinking he’s a bit better than he is (I don’t fault him for this because he doesn’t come off as being egotistical; in fact he carries himself as a humble compadre. Just everyone around him tells him he’s amazing except for the actual experts) and that, combined with the ridiculously positive fan appreciation, would create a potentially hard environment for Howell to succeed. Any mistake Howell makes would earn boos and Heinicke chants which may force the hand of the HC to replace Howell with TH4. Without TH4, the fan patience of Howell increases significantly.

But, TH4 nominated Howell the starter against Dallas, and has repeatedly said how Howell can ball, and has the moxy and earned the respect of the locker room. Howell, in turn, has repeatedly commented on how helpful TH4 has been this season. That’s absolutely fantastic that TH4 has mentored Howell and imparted his best attributes to the young stud. And it’s clear that TH4 believes Howell to be the guy, and to be better equipped than he is. My only question is does TH4 have anything else to offer the kid? That’s a potential argument for bringing in someone who’s just an absolute stoic professional like Jacoby Brissett to offer something new to Howell in mentorship and competition. 

I don’t see a scenario where we have two vets in the same room, though. I prefer only one vet and the rest young potential. Gardner Minshew may be interesting, also, just unclear what he has to offer Howell.

Two ideas:

1. The responsible judge has a wearable device (wristband) that vibrates when the clock strikes zero. They can then keep their eyes on the ball and make the immediate determination whether or not to blow the whistle.

2. Don’t rely on the judge to blow the whistle for this. Instead, put the whistle through the PA system, and it’s inevitably on a timer. The judge holds a button that disables the whistle, and pushes it once the ball is snapped.

In both circumstances there’s the issue of human reaction time, but it’s less than current. In the latter, the ball could theoretically be snapped within the timeframe, but still be whistled because the judge’s reaction time.

Note: there are so many ways to eliminate human error in officiating at this point with technology. But ask yourself, what does the NFL gain by doing that?

And people claim to know what they’re talking about when they don’t. Almost all fans lack the credibility and the subject matter expertise to evaluate players. Furthermore, we don’t have access to specifics regarding the variables that impact decisions. We run our mouths based on speculation and hearsay and then compete with who’s better at it. Not sure where to draw the line with this part, though, since you could go extreme and say then there’s no point in discussing anything about the team… so I just don’t participate in the mocks. Can’t help the human nature to be passionate about a team and socialize that passion.

If it works out this year as the OC and exclusive play caller, he’ll be in the perfect position to be the head coach since he’d already be familiar with the offense and have developed a season of rapport with the team. Would be the safe move for the new ownership to give him the HC job.

For those concerned with him not calling the plays, brace yourself and listen to the noise that is Shannon Sharpe listing numerous coaches that didn’t/don’t call plays.
