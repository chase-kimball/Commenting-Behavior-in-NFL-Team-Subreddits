38010,347451,347451,tag1550,"I was flipping through the stats pages on nfl.com...here's some things that we're *not* particularly good at, right now:

* Run D: Eagles are [tied for 5th-worst run defense in the league, giving up 5.0 yards per carry.](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/defense/rushing/2022/reg/all) I think some of this is a consequence of using a lot of 3-3-5 (light in the box) as our base. I'm pretty sure the numbers are even worse on plays where Jordan Davis isn't in there. Fortunately, our next three opponents are [all in the bottom part of the league in YPC on offense](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/offense/rushing/2022/reg/all) - Steelers are 5th worst with only 3.6 yards per carry - so they have a window coming up to show up well against some less-than-stellar rushing teams. 

* Special teams: Kick Returns: We're the [worse kickoff return team in the NFL](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/special-teams/kickoff-returns/2022/reg/all), averaging only 15 yards a return. Granted, there's only 8 returns to go on; Covey is actually averaging 23 yards/return, but Watkins is only averaging 10 yards/return - I think this is mostly a symptom of teams deciding to pooch it short and high on times they aren't just booting it for a touchback. 

* Special teams II: Punt Returns: We're also the [8th worse punt return team in the league](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/special-teams/punt-returns/2022/reg/all), averaging 6.9 yards/PR. 

* Special teams III: Punting: Siposs and the PR coverage team are [averaging 45.9 yards/punt and 40.3 net/punt](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/special-teams/punts/2022/reg/all), both 10th worst in the league.

* Special teams IV: Kickoffs: we're also [7th worst in kickoff coverage](https://www.nfl.com/stats/team-stats/special-teams/kickoffs/2022/reg/all), giving up 25.6 yards per return. Fortunately our touchback % is 13th best, at 69.7%.",1.0,eagles,t3_y72pox,False,0.0,:eagles: Eagles,2022-10-18T15:01:38Z,eagles,0.06334086673656
