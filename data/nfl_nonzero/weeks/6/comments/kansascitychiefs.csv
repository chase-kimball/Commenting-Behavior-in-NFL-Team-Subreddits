* Biggest implication is playoff seeding. Bills now hold the 1 seed and unless they melt down in the regular season like last year, the road to the SB goes through Orchard Park. That's actually not too bad, though? Weirdly the Chiefs are better on the road.
* Really need the secondary to get healthy. We got away with rookie corners for a while, but now our weaknesses have been identified and teams are picking on them. The Bucs, the Raiders, the Bills - the weak cornerback position has or could have been liabilities 3 weeks in a row now.
* Andy's playcalling with a small lead is consistently bad. The Chiefs leading 3 at this point feels worse than trailing, because we always get too conservative, the other team gets the ball, and our defense scores. In the Cardinals, Chargers, Colts, Bucs, Raiders, and Bills games, the other team scored last. Why can't our guys ever just have a long TD drive to ice the game? My heart would feel so much better.

* The biggest positive one is that the Bills are quite beatable, not some unstoppable juggernaught as was promised. We gave a B effort and still had a chance for a game-winning drive at the end. It'll take an A effort to beat those guys but we are entirely capable of it. 
* The secondary WILL improve. We have a ton of reinforcements between McDuffie and Gay alone coming. Hell, if both of those guys play we probably win *this* game. 
* Defense as a whole is proving surprisingly tough at times, it just consistently can't hold up for an entire game. Offense has a ""B"" day - like here or at the Colts - and we lose a late squeaker. If it's on, then we either win close like Chargers/Raiders or blow them out like the Cards/Bucs. 
* Patrick Mahomes is still Patrick Mahomes. 

On the whole, it's a bummer of a loss but it's not the end of the season.

The folding in half after the attempted catch isn't PI since its after the ball is dead. It isn't face mask, it isn't UNR, its an unfortunate play but I have no idea what you would call. 

That leaves the armbar, which would be the bucket you would put this in. The reason I say I could support a no call is the head was turned around when contact was established (really hard to see where he was looking real time but the benefit of video makes it obvious that his eyes weren't locked on the ball). As for the arm bar itself, the arm is raising with the receivers arms (very obvious in the second clip) and the receiver gets both hands on the pass. The maybe clamping was done right at the beginning of the clip but its not super obvious.

31841,213033,213033,SylvesterTaurus,"I agree completely. If Veach makes a trade for an DE at the deadline, I want it to be a long-term player and the unquestioned replacement for Frank Clark. Doing a rental trade like Ingram was great for last year’s team, but not for a retooling and window-expanding team like we have now. Our edge players have been healthy all year (minus Clark) and aren’t producing sacks. I would feel better about our high pressure rate stats if we were getting more turnovers in the secondary. We only have ONE interception all season. That’s tied for dead last in the league. By contrast, the Bills lead the league with 10 INTs. 

I think a lot of this is on the coaching staff too. As smarter football people have mentioned, our defense is very static right now, the coaches put our DBs in too many 1-on-1s, and our secondary doesn’t collapse to the play well (I.e. WRs are wide open with only 1-2 guys in the catch area).

31842,213034,213034,SylvesterTaurus,"Biggest difference in the game: Bills got pressure with 4 and their secondary covered well causing Patrick to hold onto the ball longer than usual. 

Plain and simple: Our DL isn’t getting home enough for sacks without a blitz against any team we’ve played. I don’t know what it is because this is a better DL than last year by far. The secondary injuries play a significant part in this because we arenMt getting coverage sacks either. Getting McDuffie, Fenton, and Cook back will help with that, so long as Spags doesn’t put them on an island every play. That tendency by the coaches has been the difference in keeping teams in the game. Joshua Williams was set up for failure on those 2 TDs he gave up. It was the same with Fenton last week. We need doubling and reliable safety help bad. Deebo and Aiyuk next week cannot beat us over the top like Diggs and Davis. 

Offensively, we are not living up to our full potential. Which is crazy to say given we are the #1 scoring offense in the league. We need to pick a RB plan and feed them better plays. Pacheco flashed yet again but he’s not getting the ball enough. Stretch plays out wide with CEH when that’s not his strength. Not nearly enough screens and Patrick throwing check downs to RBs. Contrary to the what the hot take factory says, I think we have a solid RB group and the coaches need to play to their strengths when playcalling. We saw it in the Cardinals and Bucs games so we know they can do it. 

Additionally, as many in Chiefs media have said, we don’t have a true offensive identity yet. That’s hurting Patrick’s decision-making and is leading to the bigger mistakes we saw against the Colts and Bills. This is also hurting our O-Line because we need to help them against the edges. We have a damn good team, and once we figure out that identity (along with consistently positive playcalling), good luck to the rest of the league.

EDIT: Forgot to say this: I’m torn on the trade deadline. The only offensive player I’d be excited to add is Odell or a top-tier RT (not likely), because the bigger need would be defensive line. Even then, I don’t know who would become a true difference maker that’s available. Brian Burns is off the table per NFL Network (we’ll see I suppose) and I definitely don’t want to overpay for him. I’d obviously lose my mind if Veach managed to get Robert Quinn or Roquan Smith, but I can’t think of anyone else behind them who would be an immediate impact player as an Edge that could be traded.

Offense had a few great drives throughout the game, and they had a few failures as well. A lot that the team can learn from and get better from. Sometimes a loss like this isn’t the worst thing in the world. Learn from it and move on to the next one.

Problem is I don’t know how to fix it. I suppose getting rid of the spot foul and making it a 15 yard automatic 1D would be a start. That could open defenses up to blatantly interfere to prevent a bigger play though. I don’t want refs to make a judgement call on what’s a DPI and what’s an underthrown pass either.
