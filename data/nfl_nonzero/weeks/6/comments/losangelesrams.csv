In 2019 he started at LG, tore his ACL/MCL 6 games in and went on season ending IR. In the span of the games he did play in, he was ranked as the 2nd worst LG out of 76 qualifiers. 

In 2020 he performed better at LG, but again his body failed and he ended up on IR for 6 game. When he came back he filled in for Whit well for a few games but progressively got worse and over 600 snaps he ended the season with an abysmal 60.3 PFF grade

By 2021 he lost his starting LG role and was relegated to being a Swiss army knife backup. He excelled at this role and performed well in the games he filled in for.
