You brought him in to be an offensive guru and not only has he not done that, he hasn't even come close. The only reason we have won even just 2 games is because of the defense and a Raiders meltdown.

Media darlings and NFL favorites to go to the Super Bowl for 2016

2016 everyone was healthy we were ready to go to the Super Bowl. Opening game we thought we had in the bag with Tom Brady out and then Garappolo…we lost to a missed field goal kick.  Same season where we had the ridiculous 6-6 tie overtime bore fest/anti-climatic game (some people would say) where both team’s kickers missed against the Seahawks. 

That was the worst to come in with HIGH expectations and respect from fans and the NFL to miss the playoffs to a mediocre 7-8-1

So dumb. 

2018 was a close second. We couldn’t do anything. Constant 3 and outs with Josh Rosen taking the lead. I had high expectations and even had a license plate with the ROSN1   That offense sucked.
