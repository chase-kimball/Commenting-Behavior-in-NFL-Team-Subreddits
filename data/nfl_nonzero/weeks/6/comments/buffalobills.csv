2021: Lost to the Chiefs in one of the best playoff games ever in the divisional, came down the the wire in a huge way

2020: Lost to the Chiefs in the AFCCG after being maybe the biggest breakout team of the year

2019: Lost in the wildcard with meh Josh Allen and, admittedly, a bit of a choke job with some controversial

2018: 6-10 with a Nate Peterman and a raw, rookie Josh Allen as relief, a roster that people were saying would go 0-16, and taking the biggest cap hit ever to that point (40% of the cap)

2017: Backed into the playoffs with some luck with a rookie head coach and a roster that everyone thought would be tanking

2016: No one from this roster or coaching staff were on this team that season outside Shaq Lawson and Aaron Kromer, both of whom left and came back this season

I'll be the first to admit, Buffalo had some rough games sprinkled throughout 2021, but they haven't collapsed by any stretch in McDermott's tenure.

Defenses are figuring out how to take away the freaky deep passes, and there are fewer offenses that can force the issue and make it happen anyway.  I think the run game may come back fairly soon like you said because it's the easiest way to break the two high shell looks guys like Allen, Herbert, Mahomes, Burrow, etc. are seeing.  It may be inefficient, but it can also keep the other guy off the field which is huge

I have nothing to back this up with, but I also feel like there are a lot of younger fans now that have Mahomes and Madden brain.

A cut above the Dinosaurs of years gone by,in so many ways. Athletically, schematically,  functionally, and dare I say it, personally. Marino, Brady, Rogers and more are observed yelling at teammates. That's not leadership, it dictatorial. Watching Pat scramble at the 5, thinking thru the all permutations , while avoiding the 250+ pounders 18inches away, was beyond talent and 3D chess. Watching him throw the TD was awe inspiring to ANY fan base, even ours. There's probably 10 more years of this stuff and I'm thrilled to see it. Our men are top of the newest class.

The audacity of refs to make a horseshit call like this (sorry Bills bros, it‚Äôs a bad call) and then turn around and start issuing out make-up calls.

It felt like from a certain point on, refs decided they were going to alternate making terrible calls - and then recognizing that post-play - and THEN making it up to the other team on the subsequent drive. 

It drives me crazy. Try your best to make correct calls. If you miss one, live on to fight another day. Nobody is demanding perfection from the refs, but this obvious ‚Äútraded‚Äù style of assessing penalties just drives me bonkers.
