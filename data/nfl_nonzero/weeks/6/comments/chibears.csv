3942,11865,11865,Antitypical,"> Its not inherently harder to get high R2 with large datasets. A large dataset just means you'll be more confident that your observed R2 is close to the true R2.

That's exactly what I'm saying, and why I gave the finance example. It's also why I don't trust the correlations people show using PFF grades-- they're usually formed from tens of data points and the charts are never made available, so it's very possibly skewed by the tails. If that's the case, the only thing you can use PFF grades to predict is that the absolute worst players are likely to stay bad and the absolute best players are likely to stay good, and everything in between is unpredictable. And most people can do that with their eyes.

I will admit though, the discussions about predictiveness are all somewhat meaningless anyway; teams may use some of PFF's advanced stats, but they're doing all the grading themselves using their own systems that factor in nuances of play design and assignments that PFF doesn't know, so it's not like anyone's actually making any predictions based on PFF grades.

As I said, I mainly use PFF grades to say that the player with an 85 *probably* played better than the one with a 55, and that's about it.",1.0,nfl,t3_y89j2g,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-10-19T18:35:58Z,chibears,0.0815802643299102
3943,11867,11867,Antitypical,"Anscombe's quartet is saying that data can come in many shapes, and that some of those shapes look very different but can have the same points of balance within them, so the summary statistics look the same.

If we flatten this out into one dimension, what we're saying is that if you wish to add to 13, you can choose 12 and 1, or 6 and 7, or  -348 and 361. Thing is, the way you get to your summary statistic matters because your summary statistic isn't detailed enough to be meaningful on its own.

For example when we look at NFL QB data, I think there's a chance that Mahomes and Brady are elite in all statistics including PFF grades (graders may even have unconscious bias that leads them to grade these players even higher) and so they fall on the top right corner of any graph you make correlating two statistics with each other, and Nick Foles is the exact opposite and ends up in the bottom left of every correlation graph and the trend that those points set ends up makes your data look like the fourth ([bottom right](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Heathcote/publication/280302159/figure/fig2/AS:614021682171910@1523405585885/Anscombes-quartet-highlights-the-importance-of-plotting-data-to-confirm-the-validity-of.png)) Anscombe chart and you'd get your 0.06-0.11 R^2 value. If this were the case it could very well be that there's absolutely zero data trend for the points that aren't at the extremes, which would imply that middling PFF grades (60s-80s) are essentially random numbers.

This is why I chide all these analysts for not including their charts. There aren't that many data points here, so visualizing the data structure is critical to drawing any conclusions",3.0,nfl,t3_y89j2g,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-10-19T17:40:01Z,chibears,-0.0441374537820125

Many of these analyses at working with double digit numbers of data points, so the 0.06 we're getting isn't impressive to me. What I suspect is that the tails of the distributions-- guys like Mahomes and Brady grading elite and being elite, or Foles grading horribly and being horrible are probably pulling the data just enough to look like Anscombe's 4th plot in the quartet. If this is the case, the grading system works well for the best and worst performers and is basically useless for parsing anything in between.

One of my central criticisms is that all these guys who are trying to show correlation aren't letting us actually see the charts, and I just don't trust R^2 data without charts, although it's worth noting that the chart structure I described probably wouldn't actually get this analysis flagged anyway (Sidenote: I know you said you're assuming people looked at their residuals, but that's where I'm being less lenient)",11.0,nfl,t3_y89j2g,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-10-19T16:43:43Z,chibears,0.0068765119999999

>there's really strong evidence that PFF grades are just as predictive, if not more predictive in certain situations than these advanced stats which is a huge vote for its reliability. I've personally validated this and there's some good threads about how strongly PFF grades correlate with epa/play the next season (for QBs).

I'm glad you brought this up. I view the predictive value of PFF grades as somewhat overstated. **Below is a comment someone made about PFF grades correlating to other performance indicators**

>Again, not saying that PFF grades are the GOAT metric or are never wrong. You should take them - as with any other stat - with context and as a single data point. There is just clearly enough evidence to put weight into them. If you simply dismiss them because ""they don't know what they're looking at"", you're losing out on a very valuable data point that has substantial value.

**Here was my response**

>*First, a note: None of the ""studies"" you cite show the data shape, so when we see an R-squared value, especially a very shitty one (like the 0.06, or the 0.11 that are cited), there's basically nothing we can do with it, since those values can be easily be associated with many different data patterns. This is demonstrated by [Anscombe's quartet](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Scatterplots-of-four-different-datasets-known-as-Anscombes-quartet-99-Each-dataset_fig1_276360680), which shows four different plots that all have the same correlation coefficient, regression line, and error of fit when using the regression line ([this image](https://i.postimg.cc/s2KX4BM5/All-Dinos-Grey-1.jpg) shows the same thing even more dramatically).*

>**TjFBAnalytics:**
>
>* When we say ""correlation to next year's performance"" what specific statistic exactly are we correlating to? And what number is being graphed? Is it R-squared? The fact that it says ""correlation"" makes me think it's actually R (technically called correlation), even though the field standard is to use R-squared to understand variance and predictability.
>* You can't just say ""The only downside is he doesn't share exactly how he comes to that conclusion as that isn't the main point of the article."" Science is based on the idea that when you work with data you're required to share the rationale you use for your different manipulations, or else we can't gauge your credibility.
>* His 2020 QB rankings that he comes up with using the previous year's PFF grades are _insane_. Brees #2, Stafford better than Rodgers, Kirk top 10, Jimmy G and Carson Wentz better than Brady, Kyler at #20, Josh Allen at #25, are all terrible takes.

There are also massive sample size issues if any of these people are working with any amount of year to year data less than about 20 seasons (troublingly, none of these people are saying which years they used, which makes me think they're using a single pairing of years)

>Everything you've shown me is littered with poor data treatment, sample size issues, over-fitting, and conclusions which the data itself does not show enough confidence to make. And yet even then, it's almost besides the point: If the graders at PFF knew the assignments (or knew more about football to be able to guess the assignments the way experienced QBs can), their model would be better. Teams do know the assignments, and so their internal grading systems are more accurate. **Dilfer is making the point that those internal systems would rate Fields' performance better than PFF, which is a central piece of logic you're not addressing.**

#All said, here's how I use PFF grades:

If player A has a grade that's 20+ points higher than player B, I assume there's a better chance than not that player A played better than player B. That's it. I haven't seen strong enough correlations or large enough data sets or enough audited single-play grades for me to say anything more than that. For many people that can still be valuable, especially at positions like CB, which are a lot harder for the lay-fan to get a good feeling for performance of when they watch a broadcast. But I strongly advise against giving these grades a whole lot more credence than that",52.0,nfl,t3_y89j2g,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-10-19T14:01:17Z,chibears,0.0166316684596625
3948,11872,11872,Antitypical,"I think I was very clear with what I want them to do

1. Lead with limitations (don't bury them in a podcast no one is listening to). Most importantly acknowledge up front the large caveat that they don't know the assignments of any player they grade.

3. Establish confidence intervals amongst their many graders.

3949,11873,11873,Antitypical,"Bingo. There are meaningful transparency reasons to not trust PFF. Copy-pasted from my own comment elsewhere:

>This is part of why I deeply distrust PFF. I'm a PhD-level research scientist professionally, so it's quite literally my job to understand how other people treat their data and define their metrics. Half of what I do is dig through papers and supplementary documentation to understand data generation and analysis methods, because the slightest tweaks in data treatments that you use can result in wildly different overarching trends
>
>PFF will never release per-play grades because it would show the subjectivity of their grading that they like to claim is not a factor, and without those grades it's an in-auditable, untrustworthy, proprietary black box that spits out random numbers. Slight differences in grader consistency or slight mis-interpretations of scheme or a player's responsibility or performance on single plays can lead to massive swings in final output grades. This problem is magnified by the fact that the sample size just isn't there to assign any kind of confidence to the final grade (and PFF makes no attempt to do things that would establish a confidence interval, such as using many graders per game and publishing summary stats for the graders as a group). Not only that, we don't have good information about who their graders are, what their qualifications are, or what the grader training process teaches those graders to emphasize, because again, PFF has labeled this all as proprietary and glossed over what a huge impact this stuff has on film evaluation. The fact that they tout what they're doing as revolutionary while not letting anyone have any insight into the process makes them no better than ESPN's QBR from a few years ago, and frankly makes them a total farce from any serious scientific angles.

>One of the big red flags for any person/organization that claims to do any kind of advanced analysis is when they don't tell you about the limitations of their analysis. They need to clearly define where their analysis breaks down, or else they aren't being truthful to you. This is why I've always trusted DVOA, for example, because football outsiders is very clear about the circumstances where they're unable to draw meaningful conclusions from their data (and generally are pretty open about how they do their analysis as well). It's also why heavy skepticism of PFF is warranted-- they're deep into the game of pretending their grades are universally explanatory

**tl;dr:** At its core, every time you play with the rules that govern numbers you're generating/manipulating, you create an opportunity for a butterfly effect that ripples through your data and has sweeping effects on your conclusions.

We could have easily signed Chark, drafted Pierce/Pickens and 2x OL with our first 3 picks, and then of course our defense would've been terrible, but at least we would've had a snowball's chance in hell to actually develop Fields.

**Edit:** downvote me all you want, you know in your heart we didn't care at all about helping Justin. We assumed we'd be good because no Nagy is addition by subtraction and then called it a day.

What people are having trouble coming to terms with is how historically horrible our offseason was. Here's a run-down:

Tried to sign an injured DT in free agency instead of helping the offense, traded our best player for a second rounder, spent that pick and our other 2nd on defense, took a punt returner with dicks for hands in the 3rd, started 2 fifth rounders at tackle (PFF might grade them well, but they don't pass the eye test) and a UDFA who we already know sucks at C, entrusted a rookie OC who has only worked with a HoF QB to solve all the deep WR/OL personnel problems.

It's not a surprise we can't evaluate Fields. Poles, Eberflus, and Getsy have been a disaster.

You can argue about paying Montgomery but it’s an idiotic take to say we don’t need a back. If you let him go we’re wasting a draft pick on a back or paying a guy like Hunt a few million in FA.

Considering this franchise's systemic and repeated failures in drafting and developing a quarterback, I would have no issue at all if Poles wanted to trade for an already proven one in 2024, assuming he has a good offseason in 2023 and most other positions are in place. These trades make sense when the player you're trading for truly is the one missing piece, not just a player to keep you barely competitive or a desperation move like what Pace loved to do.

My personal dream scenario is we end up with a top 5 draft pick, Bryce Young falls to us, and we trade back to a team absolutely desperate for a quarterback and willing to give us a goldmine for him.

Im not going to pretend I know if/when hes reading it right and calling the proper alert. Im not close to that when watching film. I do like that he feels confident enough to do it, though. I think that provides things him and Getsy can bounce off of each other. Think it can help him learn coverages better, too.

Also, we heard it over and over, Fields makes a mistake once and fixes it next time. So, if hes calling alerts too much, or misreaading the coverage, Getsy is going to let him know.

Theres also Warners, Dilfers, jt o'sullivan's, and a couple others video reviews that I cant think of that I have all watched. They all agree on the points that I made. Every single one of them. 

Hes recognizing coverage, going through each progression, has his eyes to where it should be thrown (or to look off safeties) and sometimes he throws it, sometimes he holds it, gets gunshy and gets sacked and sometimes, he holds it and decides to run prematurely. But, I will say, when he recognizes man coverage and he doesnt see a lurker, or if the lurker isnt close enough, hes pulling the ball down and running. Thats what he should be doing and what is told to do. So, sometimes, it looks like hes bailing, but what he is really doing is seeing the DBs/LBs backs and then running. 

Im not going to say hes doing these things perfectly, at all, but for a young guy, where these were all of his faults coming out of college, hes doing a really good job of progressing. There are other times where he does hold it and waits for the routes to develop and it just takes too long, or the line is giving up a sack in less than 2 seconds and hes getting hit. He loves throwing the ball for 20+ yard plays. Thats just one of his greatest skills he possess. He either needs to learn to not wait as long, or wait til next year for better oline lol.",3.0,chibears,t3_y77l9m,False,0.0,Italian Beef,2022-10-18T14:57:47Z,chibears,0.0572345610869263
40098,238779,238779,dafoo21,"I appreciate the effort on this, for sure. What the pros are seeing on film is that Fields is seeing the field fine, is going through his progression fine, doing better in staying in the pocket, recognizing defenses, having his eyes where they should be. But, what he is having problems with is actually pulling the trigger when he makes the right read. The times where he hesitates, he has his eyes to the proper read, double pumps and hesitates and doesnt throw the ball and runs, bc he can trust his legs. Im sure some of this can be on the WRs running wrong routes too (Mooney has said a few times he fucked up routes) , but he is having problems pulling the trigger sometimes. 

So, on the plus side, he is progressing pretty well from his college negatives, for the shit oline (great at run blocking though) and poorthe talent on the field. 

The bad is, when he hesitates, he is creating sacks that shouldnt be happening, and taking unnecessary hits in the pocket. Also, sometimes, he still is waiting in the pocket too long, when he should just not taking the easy throw, but that has been improved over the season. 

Progression isnt linear, so hes going to have bad and good and avg games sprinkled throughout the year. He had a really good game against MIN and against WAS, kinda reverted back to a mix of MIN and a mix of the GB game. He showed towards the end of the game, hes still an NFL level QB. His game winning drives have been stopped by bad drops and poor opportune fumbles. 

Personally, this is how I expected it to go. Hes learning a new offense, 3rd in 3 years, fixed some mechanics issues, which im sure play a reason into his hesitations, and his teammates as a whole, are just not talented enough. 

If Pace can do what Miami did for Tua, get him some talented WRs and shore up the oline, Fileds is going to look alot better and has a much higher ceiling than Tua. And we saw how much better Tua looked this year. 

Lastly, i do wanna also talk about the play calling. It was very simple and very run heavy the first few weeks. I can understand why, to get Fields comfortable out there. Over the last few weeks, it has been opened up alot, to allow Fields to kind of do his things, which is great. But i will also say, theres been some questionable calls from the OC sprinkled in. He is also a first time playcaller, so i can understand. This whole season was to strip down the mistakes Pace made over the years and get a fresh start where everyone can progress together.

I know people make tons of excuses for fields but this is simply how you set up your QB for failure. 

If we do move on from him we need to have our shit together before selecting our next guy, and that’s probably gonna take a couple years because this team is just so barren of quality players, especially on offense. So even if fields isn’t the guy, we might as well keep him around and then go get our new QB once this team is actually in a place that we can develop one correctly, because they absolutely shit the bed.

At the end of the day, maybe we should stop getting excited every time a coach works with a HOF QB who was good before they worked together? Brady got McDaniels multiple chances (and Weiss, Mangini, O’Brien, Judge), Peyton got Gase in the HC convo, and this year we can see Rodgers getting Hackett and Getsy promotions. 

Maybe, just maybe, we should hire coordinators that either develop talent or can win without a HOF QB. It’s similar to hiring college HCs to the NFL when 75% of their college job is recruiting. The only college HCs I would be interested in are second-their programs who win with scheme and buy-in instead of just being able to recruit the best talent. 

I do like Eberflus. I like that he’s not calling plays and trying to control everything. He’s the CEO who sets the culture and delegates appropriately. I think Getsy is growing but the NFL is a harsh place to grow “on the job.” I don’t think we’ve seen enough from him (or this team) to really know if he has what it takes, but right now I’d categorize his work thus far as somewhere between “rough growing pains” and “doesn’t have it.” Hopefully he can show that it’s the former and we get some reason to be optimistic by the end of the year.",3.0,chibears,t3_y4qxy1,False,0.0,69,2022-10-15T12:10:49Z,chibears,0.0564206183869902

I think you can also make an argument that despite the lack of weapons and support, he’s not showing the signs of consistent improvement to commit to him and know that he’s the answer.  

The truth is likely somewhere in the middle. 

In my totally uneducated and unimportant opinion, there’s no reason not to let him finish this year… see where we draft and go BPA. If that pick is a quarterback, then that’s what it is.
