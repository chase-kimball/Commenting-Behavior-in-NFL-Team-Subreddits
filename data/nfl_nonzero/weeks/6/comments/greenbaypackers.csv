Wyatt: 28 snaps all year. D-Line is not playing physical and he can't crack more than 5-6 snaps per game? I get it, he's a rookie, Clark took a few years to develop. But the defense needs help now.

Quay Walker: this dude got torched Sunday on every big run. He has a PFF grade of 42.7, 71st out of 78 LB. Not ideal.

Eric Stokes: not playing good at all, 55.9 PFF grade. 

Darnell Savage: 37.7 PFF grade, nearly the worst safety in football. Why are they playing vanilla coverage? Because half the secondary is playing awful.

Now, did anyone expect the O-Line to regress this badly? There were quite a few plays where even a quick pass didn't stand a chance. If they can't shore up the pass protection there isn't a single QB who would play lights out.

* LaFleur's criminal mismanagement of Aaron Jones is becoming McCarthy-level at this point. *12* total touches today, if I'm not mistaken. Only difference is he's somewhat more creative with play designs, compared to McCarthy's slant-flats and nonsense iso routes

* Rodgers is always talking about manifestation and whatnot but immediately walks to the sideline and pouts after just one or two bad series, followed by death stares at his receivers. If you're want to speak wins and good vibes into existence, it starts with you dawg. I think Jaire might be right about whether or not we should worry, but only a little bit (scroll to the end)

* Time to put Newman's ass on the bench. Constantly whiffing on stunts and slants, gets bullrushed *easily*, is average at best in run blocking. Zach Tom is still pretty raw at pass pro but he can't possibly be a worse run blocker

* We can stop the run when we actually commit to it. Joe Barry just doesn't fucking want to for some reason

Every year since like 2020, this offense has looked less Shanahan and more like the Packers of old.  Relying on WRs beating their man, and frankly that’s really hard to live on.  With that the offense has looked more disjointed and off.

There is a reason Shanahan still finds ways to win with guys like Nick Mullens.  The system still works.

Motion would also help receivers, line and backs by making the defense pause for a bit allowing guys to make their plays.

he just cannot can’t throw the ball that many times. I refuse to believe LaFleur told him to huck it that many times. Rodgers has GOT to adjust to his new reality, both lack of receiver talent and his own regression. 

LaFleur or SOMEONE on the offensive staff needs to realize that they need to bump Jenkins back inside and see what Nijman can do at RT. This isn’t that hard. 

Starting to think part of the problem may also be a brain drain on the offensive staff. This offense just looks rudderless inexplicably, after being run pretty dang well the past 3 years. Hackett and Getsy may have been a bigger loss than we imagined.
