It's especially egregious when there are punts out of bounds. The sideline judge is always like, ""yeah, i think ill put it....here."" Meanwhile tennis can see if a ball going 100mph is out by millimeters.

Heck even the play clock is subjective, it isnt when the clock is at zero, delay of game happens whenever the ref decides to blow the whistle.

If you look at woodpeckers and rams, the reason why they dont get concussions all the time is because through evolution, their body forces more blood to their brains when they are doing their headsmashing tasks. The extra blood creates more padding in the brain and causes a bubble wrap effect.

Interestingly, football players have this same effect when they play at higher altitudes. The decrease in pressure and oxygen forces more blood into their brains and they have **significantly** less concussions.

Part that is technique since he keeps his legs way too straight, and part is because hes quite frankly just a kid whos still learning his changing body. Clowney had his body since like middle school lol.

I dont think this is his season at all this year, but you kinda just throw him out there and let him take a few punches knowing that he will get better over time.

His problems are recognition, technique, and basic fundementals like how to position your body to get leg power. Makes sense since he didnt start playing til late in life, and he also entered the draft early. (Probably shouldnt have)

4284,26689,26689,ClevelandOG,"It was complicated with Joe... The Browns didnt ""bail"" on him. They tried to trade him during the entire second half of 2016 to a team he wanted to go to, but they couldnt find any takers. They could have probably traded him to a crappy situation but they chose to cut him instead and let him choose where to sign.

It stung at the time, but thats kind of the best outcome you can have other than the Browns keeping him and trying to play through.

Haden had just signed a 5 year 67mil contract the year before but was waaay underperforming it. He posted a 33.2 pff grade in 2015 and a 61.3 grade in 2016. Over those 2 years he was the worst graded defensive back in the Browns roster. 

The Browns asked him to take a paycut to 7mil/yr since his production was nowhere near his salary at the time (although 7mil is still higher than how he was playing), he refused so the Browns cut him and let him go wherever he wanted. He signed with the Steelers for 3y/27m

Nobody did ""wrong"" by anyone. Joe did what was best for him, the Browns did what was best for them. That is how business in the NFL goes. It's obvious Joe was mad at the time, but it's also obvious he understands it now.

Even if Watson comes back to prime Watson, he'll need to score at least 30+ every game which will be a tough ask. 

This defense is abysmal. I don't know if it's scheme, talent, them not giving a fuck? It's broken and it won't be fixed in one off season. 

AB seriously threw the ball away for this season. We have no high draft picks, no sizeable salary cap for next year. The next few years are going to be depressing. I'm starting to not like him for the product he has put on the field. He seriously gambled and is down big time. 

I had more fun watching the 0-16 and standing outside in -5º weather for that parade than I have this season. Just the most unlikable team in a long, long time. Maybe ever?
