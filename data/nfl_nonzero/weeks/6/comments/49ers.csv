3910,33083,33083,Cardinal_Ravenwood,"Real mature way to get your point across. 

The way I run my IT business doesn't have any impact on the safety of my staff, beside the usual OHSA workplace regulations I need to adheare to, however if members of my staff suddenly stopped performing to standard then yeah their ass is on the chopping block. Why would I keep incompetent staff on my payroll? 

Ok so I'm going to run with your line of thinking for a second here just to show you that coaches don't think the way you obviously think they do. The carolina panthers are currently looking at their third head coach in about 2 years. Do you seriously think another head coaching cadidate is going to look at that and go nah not for me too much turnover there. Or will they take the opportunity regardless or prior performance at the organisation?

Do you really think anyone would have taken the Jags HC job if they thought the same way you are? 

Would Ron Rivera take the Commanders gig or McDaniel to the dolphins after the whole debarcle there with their previous coach?

Or hell even Shanny coming here after the Harbaugh/Tomsula/Kelly firings? 

Your position would fine if you are looking at a regular business, but that's not the way the NFL works no matter how much you think the optics here matter, they just don't to an NFL level coach.

I've had plenty of jobs from retail to management and work in a high turn over industry. I don't think you even know what a high turnover even means. 2 people in 3 years isn't high turnover. If we fired those two in the same season then yeah that's high turnover. I'd also like to make a point that the way the NFL works is very very different to the way a regular business operates. Turnover is part of the game regardless. 

So any coach in the NFL in any department knows they are one foot in the door and one foot out, it's cut throat and if they can't understand that then they shouldn't be in the NFL. Trying to make a comparision between a regular ass business and the NFL is just being obtuse.

The team isn’t healthy enough to fight for seeding anyways (like getting the 1/2 seed etc), but the division is weak enough where we can probably win it (helps that we are already 2-0 in division) and limp into the playoffs as a 4 seed. From there, if we’re healthy (and that’s a big if), I see no reason why we can’t make a run from there.

15896,118450,118450,MrTouchnGo,"I thought this was an interesting article from The Athletic. Jimmy talks about how he loved lifting and was able to get back into it this off-season.

> “In college I was obsessed with [lifting],” he said this week. “There was a little too much weightlifting. Once I got to the NFL, I had to tone it back a little bit. To throw every single day — you can’t be jacked up and rocked up. You have to be pliable and be able to do all these stretches and things.”

> This season, however, has been different. This is the year Garoppolo returned to the weight room. His early March shoulder surgery meant he couldn’t do much upper-body work or any throwing for the next few months. So the 49ers quarterback worked on his bottom half in a way he hadn’t been able to do in his first seven years in the league.

> “I got to lift a little more weights in the lower body, more running, dropbacks, things like that,” he said. “Yeah, I think it was kind of a blessing in disguise. I got to beef up in some areas and make the best of it.”

> The extra muscle has helped him compensate for the shoulder surgery, which has led to more soreness and arm fatigue than he’s ever experienced before. But on some throws, he said, he actually has more zip this season. He attributes that to having a stronger base.

> “Because I’m a ground thrower,” he said. “All my power comes from my legs and everything. Some guys are 6-(foot)-6 and they throw it like a baseball. I don’t have that ability. So I’ve got to transfer from the ground. So I think that does play a role. Some throws have more (zip), some have less. It all depends.”

He also talks about unexpected post-game arm soreness this season.

> Was his arm ready? After his first start in Denver, he wasn’t sure. He’d never dealt with postgame arm soreness in his career. After his start in Denver, the arm was tired and in pain.

> “I think the big thing is the amount of throws you do on game day — your warmup, pregame throws, in-the-game-throws, the sideline throws,” Garoppolo said. “Those add up. You’re actually doing almost double the amount in a game than in a practice.

> “It’s hard to describe,” he continued. “Because you’re in the game and you’re so locked in that you don’t even notice, really. But after the game, you just feel it. I’ve never been sore after games from throwing. I’ve been sore for other reasons. But now, it just feels different.”

> The arm still isn’t back all the way, he said. The good news is that there’s nothing structurally wrong with it and that it’s gotten less bothersome with every outing. Both his arm and the 49ers’ offense seem to be repairing themselves as the season progresses.

> “It’s coming along,” he said. “That’s the best way to put it.”",30.0,49ers,t3_y6ivow,False,0.0,:jerseyhome85: George Kittle,2022-10-17T13:40:06Z,49ers,0.0159188022963104
