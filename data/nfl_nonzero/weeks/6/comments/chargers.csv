Do we think that another defensive coordinator wouldn’t be able to do that with the roster we have? Do you think there would be coordinators that could do that better?

Sean Payton being an offensive minded head coach, should bring a lot more to the table.

Leaving out the 17th game possibility of playing the Ravens, it’s about once every 48 seasons for an NFC N team.

In this game we responded to adversity in a way we haven’t for a while. This team showed a toughness and unwillingness to roll over when we had little momentum and many injuries, facing an opponent whose strengths negated ours. 

This team has visible issues each game, but most every team has looked very beatable several times this year, and some teams that are probably much better than us have ended up worse off. There’s only 4 teams with a better record than us right now, and the 3 teams tied with us are teams we could probably beat. 

We have now gotten out of the bottom 5 in points allowed, now at 26th place and only a single field goal behind the Chiefs. Despite the weak offensive performance, we’re tied for 11th in points scored per game, and within a single score of 7th place. 

We’re only 23rd in rushing yards allowed per game and 18th in passing yards allowed per game, ending up at 18th in total yards allowed per game ( middle of the pack defensively). 

We’re 7th in offensive yards per game, 14th in rushing yards and 7th in passing yards over the last 3 games played for each team, a much more balanced offense than we entered the year with. 

We’re one of 11 teams with a winning record in divisional games and one of 7 teams with multiple divisional wins. We have the 2nd fewest turnovers per game, and we’re right around league average in takeaways.

We’re 4-2, tied with the Chiefs for the AFC West, and tied for 2nd in the AFC. And that’s with some devastating injuries at key positions.

All we have to do is make the playoffs and anything can happen (see: 2021 Bengals). We’re well on track to do that.
