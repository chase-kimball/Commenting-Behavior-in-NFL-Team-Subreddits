- well, I was not expecting to win that game, as I thought it would be the hardest game on our schedule.

- DJ’s playing smart football right now. Nothing flashy but nothing dumb either. He’s been very protective of the football and not forcing throws

- Saquon looks to have re-injured his shoulder. I appreciate him coming back into the game to seal the deal, but I hope it’s not at the expense of missing time next week.

- I absolutely love our play-calling on offense. Daboll and Kafka are killing it

- I thought our defense played great. I don’t think there’s any stopping Lamar or Andrews from racking up yards but we minimized their big play ability pretty well. I can’t say I expected Kenyan drake to gouge us, though

- Thibs is a force!! Several pressures, a sack, and forces the fumble to win the game.

- Daniel Bellinger, our rookie TE, should not be leading our team in receiving yards. I know we’re rebuilding and in a shit cap situation but we’re somehow winning games.
