Yes, Russ has been missing reads, yes our oline is injured, and our receivers can't get open in man coverage. But at some point this has to stop. We aren't the Joey Harrington Lions. Russ has been a good QB in the league for far too long. He has a proven track record. That puts the bullseye on Hackett. He's failed to direct this offense competently. 

Another problem I have is the receivers coach. Why do none of our receivers come back to the football or LOS or break to the sideline on QB scrambles? Not a single one even makes an attempt to break to get open when Russ runs for the sidelines. That's a basic drill I practiced as a receiver in 8 years of playing.

The thinking was more that *in aggregate* the Broncos looked better, with some assumptions made about latent talent that shitty QB play had kept back: Albert O, Jeudy, Patrick, etc. That plus Javonte Williams would be the difference.

Instead, two of those guys are on IR, Jeudy and Sutton are underperforming, Albert O. has actually regressed, and Wilson is not even looking at wide open guys who sometimes are even supposed to be his first read.

11253,69811,69811,Lieutenant_Meeper,"Yeah, that's all fair enough, never disagreed with that account, and for the record the flack you got from some fans is totally classless. I'm just saying that, from my perspective, I saw a lot of it going the other way, too. And along those lines, from the outside it sometimes looked more like this than the way you've framed it (not saying my version is right and yours is wrong, only that this was a viable perspective at the time): 

Russell Wilson finally decided to jump ship after years of putting up with poor line play and allegedly being held back (which as we're now discovering might have been more Russ camp propaganda than anything). Instead of giving him a hearty farewell for all he brought the fanbase, the fanbase turned on him in a really ugly way, which then turned into not just ""I hope he doesn't succeed"" to ""fuck the Broncos I hope they tank."" 

I couldn't say which came first, but it's easy to see how it all spiraled. There's also another context at work, I think, which goes all the way back to SB 48. I know hawks fans got pretty upset about how they perceived being dismissed by the media prior to the game, whereas the actual media narrative was probably more split. Between subs, though, it  seemed from my perspective that just normal ""I like my team and I hope they beat your team"" shit talk by Broncos fans was interpreted by some hawks fans through that prism, so they saw it as ""How dare they disrespect our team by rooting for theirs!"" So at the end of that 43-8 shellacking, our mods spent the better part of two weeks banning alleged hawks fans invading our sub just to gloat. When you lose a game like that and your sub gets inundated with that kind of nonsense, it leaves a mark. So whether or not any commentary about Russ was in retaliation or even a popular viewpoint, it was easy for some Broncos fans to use it as evidence of a fanbase that was just as classless and entitled as it seemed in 2013. 

And so now we're here: what was supposed to finally get us out of the ditch has instead dug us deeper.  And guess who's here to rub salt in the wound again?  Random Seahawks fans. 

Of course the reality is that both fanbases are just very passionate and loyal, and on the whole have had greater success than most—as fanbases we do not handle significant adversity very well, on top of ALL fanbases having a lot of dickbags who say classless things. And yet as you say: at the end of the day it doesn't really matter, and it's largely beefs between people who enter into flame wars over these subjects because that's how the internet apparently works, lol.
