2085,9669,9669,AgelessJohnDenney,"Couple issues here with today's NFL.

- You can make all the schematic changes you want, but your QB also needs to make a change in their mindset, and that can be *hard*. Guys like Allen, Mahomes, Murray, Rodgers, Wilson, etc. have made their living with this ""I'm a god who can carry a team on my back"" mentality, and switching to a check-down/high percentage/dink-and-dunk and pray for YAC mentality is foreign to them. You could see it when Miami played Buffalo a few weeks ago. Allen was ready to feast on the deep crossers and other Cover 1 beaters he killed us with traditionally and when Miami went full Cover 2 mode, he refused to change up. Sure, he was fine taking the hot throws on certain blitzes, but when he had to play an entire game with the explosive plays taken away from him you could see he was *frustrated.* Started forcing big plays and there were so many broken up passes that could have been picked. He doesn't *want* to play how you need to play against Cover 2. Neither does Russ. Or Murray. Or Rodgers. There needs to be a collective QB mindset change away from this hero ball thing that's become so popular.

- Disguises have gotten better and more innovative. Again, the Miami-Buffalo game is a prime example. Miami threw a lot of Cover 1/0 blitzes at Allen in the first quarter. He was beating them. So they changed up later in the game. They still *showed* Cover 1/0 a lot pre-snap but then they had all these exotic ways to rotate to Cover 2/5/6/whatever and *still* blitz occasionally and it was giving Allen fits. There's plenty of Cover 2 beaters out there...but you have to actually recognize the defense is running Cover 2 first. Defensive coordinators have gotten really good at hiding Cover 2, and defensive players have gotten athletic enough to be able to pull all these rotations and disguises off.",45.0,nfl,t3_y7azp7,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-10-18T22:54:46Z,miamidolphins,-0.000529817535935

So you're plan, after moving your goalposts, is to throw a draft pick at it and hope for the best? Who are we going to draft? Give me specifics.

Sanders is better than any kicker that's going to be in free agency this off-season. That was your initial fix, but you can't back it up(because it was never accurate), so now we're on to the draft.

Which kicker can we draft that you *won't* be bitching about the first time he misses a 54 yarder? There isn't one, you just need a scapegoat to whine about.

Sanders isn't ass. He isn't living up to his contract, but he's better than any other real option we have right now. He's better than a lot of rostered kickers.",0.0,miamidolphins,t3_y5xk9j,False,0.0,:CW91:,2022-10-17T13:48:59Z,miamidolphins,0.0410346101312794
2089,9674,9674,AgelessJohnDenney,"That's not how you round, he's 79% on his career(78.72%, 37/47).

Now I said tell me *exactly* who you want, and you're still hiding behind vagueness, so let's take a look.


-**Rodrigo Blankenship**: Has made one(1) 50+ kick in his three year career. 25% on them(1/4). Sanders is at 56%(14/25). He's essentially the same as Sanders in the 40-49 range at 79%(15/19). And he misses the gimme kicks more often on top of it. 95%(52/55) on XPs in his career to Sanders's 97%(148/152). 94% on 0-39(29/31) yard kicks. Sanders is at 95%(56/59). 88%(15/17) for Rodrigo to Sanders's 89%(25/28) if we only look at 30-39 kicks. **So Sanders is slightly better or the same in everything under 50, but significantly better 50+. No Rodrigo for us.**

- **Greg Zuerlein**: Greg has had a very long career, but is getting up in age. I don't think his 26 year old stats are particularly relevant anymore, so let's take a look at his last 4 years compared to Sanders 4 year career. 52%(13/25) on 50+. 73%(27/37) on 40-49. 96%(47/49) 30-39. Perfect under 30. 93%(132/142) on XPs. **Greg Zuerlein has been worse than Sanders at nearly every range over the last 4 seasons. No Greg the Leg for us.**

This is taking way longer than I thought so I'm giving up here, but that's at least two names I keep seeing as possible replacements who are statistical downgrades at worst and status quo maintenance at best.
