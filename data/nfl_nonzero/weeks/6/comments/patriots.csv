Edit: just found an article about it:
>For one, they cut Hernandez before he was booked into jail. That means they released him before he was able to commit a ""forfeitable breach"" such as not showing up to practice. Also, Hernandez's contract didn't have a ""failure to perform"" or ""failure to practice"" clause that is in almost all contracts. What that indicates is his remaining guaranteed base salaries -- totaling $2.5 million over the course of the 2013 and 2014 seasons -- should remain guaranteed.

11518,110228,110228,LoveToyKillJoy,"They are very similar not super athletic but far from stiffs, not great arms but accurate and catchable balls. both are smart guys. They are close enough that they should be interchangeable in an offense which is great if you need to win with your backup. But then again a human and a chimpanzee share a tremendous amount of DNA and the difference between the two could be just like that. I read all their scouting reports and watched what I've been able to and the difference that could make Zappe potentially better is his ability to stay calm under pressure.  Mac isn't bad under pressure but can get a flustered and it can result in bad decisions and not reading the pocket well to manuevre out of pressure or realize the futility of the play before making a bad decision. He's not bad but he could work on that. We need a larger sample size from Zappe but this looks to be a strength of his and could lead to him being better. 

There are lots of traits that made Tom Brady great and I would say the best, which is actually a group of traits is that he has a preternatural ability to feel pressure, move in response to it, have a precise internal clock of understanding when to get the ball away and make a cool headed decision of what to do with the ball when this happens.  I don't think having these traits will turn Zappe into Tom Brady but if he does have similar abilities in this part of his game he could be better than Jones and potentially be a very successful QB. There was a play Sunday where he felt pressure and moved with the pocket to step up and drive a throw to his left about 20 yards downfield.  Lots of guys float balls like that but the best get the ball down by really driving forward. Zappe did all the things you'd want in that play. It was impressive regardless of opponent. 

I'll be looking to see if he does more of that. Also I will be looking to see if he does a couple of things that are ostensibly negative plays but are good for the team. One is to realize a play is not there and just throw it away. Brady and Aaron Rodgers both are great at keeping interceptions low by throwing the ball away rather than force something that isn't there. The other is to take a sack gracefully. If he feels the pressure protects the ball and just rolls into a few sacks to live another play. If Zappe shows these kind of skills to be a strength then I can see him being a human to Mac Jones' chimpanzee.",1.0,nfl,t3_y6a3ox,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-10-17T23:53:47Z,patriots,0.024397415858477

11523,110235,110235,LoveToyKillJoy,"I'm not so sure. And to the case in point the scouting reports on Jones and Zappe are nearly identical. In fact I might say that Zappe would get a slight edge 55/45 if you were to let people read them blind,  but one guy was considered a lock for the first round and the other guy was considered a day 3 pick only because the draft is week. I think it has to do with perception issues that are independent of scouting. Scouting still falls for the same biases.
