Money. Dan has cost the owners money by not capitalizing on the market here but that alone isn’t enough to go nuclear on him. The league is a juggernaut and will continue to print money regardless of his singular failings here. Are other owners annoyed with him? Most certainly, but that still not enough to do something unprecedented and oust him. 

The only ones in control of Dan’s fate, the owners do not care about the sexual assault allegations. Their concern is his inability to get another stadium built. The ESPN article even referenced that Dan would be forgiven if he got one built. 

This franchise was my life. Watching with my grandfather, father, and friends. I’m old enough to remember the good times but they’re gone and won’t ever come back.  I think I have to bow out.
