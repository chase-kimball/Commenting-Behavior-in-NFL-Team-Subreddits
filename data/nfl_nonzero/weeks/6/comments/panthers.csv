You hear all these height and weights for these players and it doesn't really register until you're standing next to them. Cam was just a different breed.

But standing in the end zone was Charles Johnson and he was tossing a football to us normals end the end zone to throw back to him. At one point I end up with the ball and I'm like, don't under throw this.

Now, maybe it was the adrenaline but I'ma go out on a limb and say that NFL footballs are *way* lighter than the balls you pick up at Dick's (pause). So I'm tryna hit CJ in the end zone for a TD but instead it's like I'm tryna hit him on the 5 yard line.

>  
>Tepper didn’t give a specific reason for his decision to move on from Rhule when he did, though he mentioned a lack of intensity during the 49ers game he hadn’t noticed before, the first suggestion of a malaise perhaps beginning to creep in.

Personally I'd go Pro (which is what gf & me did) but the basic subscription is also quite decent IMO; the Redzone really surprised me for example. Even so; with Pro you can watch *everything* including live games. You even get to watch the Superbowl live.

I agree that Pro is kinda expensive, but at the same time you also get a lot of good contents in return; you basically get to watch *everything*. Not just the games but there are a lot of other shows and series to enjoy as well. Each to their own of course, but some are really good and enjoyable.
