I believe Watson completely stepped over the line and sexually harrased some of these women. And he absolutely should be punished accordingly and so far hasn't. Not only did he not get at the very least banned from the league indefinitely but instead getting awarded with the richest guarantee deal in NFL history is an absolute joke. 

Examples: Michael Vick served jail time and was kicked out or the league for a couple of years for dog fighting/killing. And horrendous act and torture of animals. Randy Gregory has been suspended 54 games for smoking pot. A substance that isn't any more harmful that the pills the NFL doctors feed to these players for their pain or gross negligence with diagnosing them with concussions and sending players back out with zero will power top pull themselves out. Ray Lewis was essentially part of a double murder stabbing. Simply fined $250k. A drop in the bucket. Ray Rice beat the living shit out of his female partner? At first a fine. Then the video leaked? A ban. Calvin Ridley bets on his team to win? Hahaha ha. 1 year suspension immediately.

Call it what it is. Watson legitimately pulled his dick out in front of women unexpectedly, while being massaged as an NFL player and provided them NDA's under the teams (and thus NFL shields) letter head, jerked off and came and gets just 13 games and the richest deal on NFL history. 

Animal Abuse: 2+ years 

Smoking Pot: 3+ years

Gambling: 1+ year

Murder: Money Fine

Domestic Violence Heresay: Money Fine

Domestic Violence Leaked Video: Banned 

Sexual Abuse: 13 Games and the richest guaranteed contract in NFL history 

This league has no legitimate consistent punishment system and it's baffling.
