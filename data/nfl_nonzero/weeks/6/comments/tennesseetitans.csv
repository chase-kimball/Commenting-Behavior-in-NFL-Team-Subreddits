2112,18814,18814,Bieber_hole_69,"I had a pretty similar response to the power rankings and division odds last week. My main takeaways were AFC South and Titans related, but I think it still stands across the board with how inconsistent FPI is compared to actual results.

ESPN's FPI gave the Jags a 46.1% chance to win the AFC South and the Titans a 29.8% chance. The Titans were only getting 9% higher of a chance than the Colts are at 20.8%, even though they had beaten the Colts on the road two weeks before.

I don't know what is baked into the FPI formula that is this down about the Titans. I'm not saying they're a top 10 team or a contender or anything, I don't think that, but they gave the Commanders like a 70% chance of winning two weeks ago

When the team ranked 7 spots higher in your power rankings has almost 20% less of a chance to win the same division, maybe it's time to reevaluate your FPI formula, or how you do power rankings. If the power rankings were consistent and had the teams by how FPI has them ranked, I wouldn't have an issue with it. The Jaguars are even given a 56.5% chance of beating the Titans in Nashville based on FPI right now, FPI clearly thinks the Jags are a better team. Their strength of schedule is not that different remaining either, the major difference being the Titans play the Packers instead of the Lions since the Bills game is out of the way already, Bengals/Ravens is pretty much a wash.

The Titans are one spot below the Bengals in those power rankings, but FPI gives the Bengals a 62.7% chance of winning on the road against the Titans in November. That doesn't sound like two teams that are within a spot of each other based on FPI.

FPI, like QBR, is whatever ESPN wants it to be. I don't know if they are actually tipping the scales to better serve their on-air and online discussions/talking points, but the formula isn't public so there's no way to know. They're all just gibberish numbers.

Some of it obviously factors in past performance from last season, which is why the playoff teams from last year that are underperforming are still so high, but obviously they've started to really factor in the 2022 season by now if the Jags are top 10.

Maybe he comes back on a re-worked deal with a lower salary, but it's hard to rationalize paying him $13.75 million next season based on his production this year. By APY he's the 22nd highest paid WR in the league on his current deal, but is currently 79th in yds/gm. 

Allen Robinson, Curtis Samuel, Robbie Anderson, Corey Davis, Nelson Agholor, and Zay Jones all signed contracts with new teams as UFAs in recent years and have lower AAV than Woods does and are younger. We can probably get multiple WRs on the open market that can produce at or near the 60 rec, 700 yds, 3 TD pace that Woods is tracking at so far this year.

Comparatively, NWI last year had 38 rec, 476 yds, and 4 TDs last season as a UDFA in his second season making $780,000.

It's not that Woods isn't a valuable member of the team, it's just that he's never going to produce at the value of his current contract. No fault of his own, but when J-Rob traded for him in March it was almost certainly with the intention of getting what we could out of him in 2022 and then cutting him loose with no dead money, he was on essentially an expiring deal.

And in our offense, I don't know that it makes sense to pay any WR more than $10M per year given how little we're going to utilize them.

I love how Nissan Stadium is built for viewing the game, it's very vertical in a way that there aren't any bad seats. I've been three rows up from the field and three rows down from the top, and you can get a great view of the field from either place. Honestly, being in the upper deck there is great.

The stadium itself though is falling apart. There are so few concession stands that it's taken me an entire quarter to get a drink because of long lines and credit card readers being down constantly. The seats are packed in way too close together, there's no room to get in and out of rows. Basically any amenity you can think of that makes modern gameday experience good, Nissan Stadium does not have it.

And I hate seeing a dome go over the new stadium, but I understand it. They play a bowl game there and TSU played games there last year. I would assume MTSU and TSU would want to play at least a game in Nashville every year.

The entire league saw Case Keenum step in and take a team Bradford went 8-8 with to the NFC Championship, and yet somehow the Cardinals still thought he was even a bridge-level QB and not just a backup.

It gets forgotten because of how brutally terrible and forgettable the 2018 Cardinals were, but that Bradford contract signing should get more heat for being one of the worst of all-time.

44600,256657,256657,neimsy,"Agreed on the first couple counts.

Nashville has grown a ton, especially economically in recent years. Memphis was in decline for quite a while but is definitely turning it around somewhat.

Memphis is still a huge transportation hub. It was all about the river originally, and now it's largely FedEx. But it's also the trains. BNSF, CN, CSX, and NS all have intermodal yards in Memphis [and UP has one just across the river in Arkansas], which means lots of trucking as well. Memphis is (not coincidentally) the one location where you can cross the Mississippi for miles and miles [rail and I-40 and I-55]. And river barge is still a hugely important means of transporting goods and materials. Just less important in the hierarchy of things than it once was.

International Paper, AutoZone, ServiceMaster, a couple other big corps, healthcare and St. Jude, but yeah, not a ton on that front. If FedEx abandoned Memphis, the city would go into a horrible economic collapse, I think.

There's a ton of development here over the past few years. Lots of residential and a decent amount of commercial. (A ton by our standards. Nothing compared to Nashville these past however many years.) So that's a signifier of things trending upward. One public amenity that'll be very cool when it's finished is the redo of the park along the river downtown.

Now is the part where I'll get kind of ... political? I guess you could call it. So, hopefully this is all taken how I intend it: An even-handed and honest statement that is completely uninflammatory. But this is all kind of contentious stuff, so here goes:

Culturally and historically Memphis has more in common with the Mississippi Delta region than it does with the rest of the TN. In the US South's history and present, if you're not talking about race, you're probably not saying anything worth listening to. Memphis is majority black. And in the American South, that means Memphis has a *ton* of poverty.

The red-headed stepchild analogy is apt. I guess now I am going to get a bit less even-handed, but if you look at our state legislature and can honestly tell me ""Yes, these people, by-and-large, respect black people and have taken time to think critically, uncomfortably, and honestly about the experience of being black in our society and in our state,"" then I don't know what to tell you. This whole state treats my city like shit. Whether it's from common citizens or from the leaders they elect, Memphis, a city that needs a lot of help, gets a lot of shit instead.

But also, it's not like our local leadership is great, either.

In terms of crime, yeah, there's a lot of it. But like any US city, most crime is concentrated in certain parts of town. I happen to work in a number of those parts of town, but the average tourist will *never* visit those areas and a lot of citizens who complain about crime in Memphis live out in the fucking suburbs anyway. [And the fear of and perception of crime is, obviously, very often racially-charged.] But there is a lot of crime, and the ways that we've attempted to combat that have proven wholly ineffective.

In any case, I don't think there is a *ton* to do here, but there's plenty to fill a weekend visit. And plenty for me to have come back here after college and then again after living abroad, all the while with ample opportunity to live kinda wherever.

I really like Memphis. It's inexpensive, low on pretension, doesn't have traffic (unless you live in the suburbs, which then the traffic is kinda self-inflicted), you can easily live in a single-family home with a decent-sized yard without being very wealthy, I like the weather (though I know many don't), etc. There are plenty of problems with it, and I don't plan on living here forever. But I don't plan on living anywhere forever, so that's not really a knock on it.

If you ever come back through, feel free to send me a message, and I'll send you some suggestions for stuff to do.",2.0,tennesseetitans,t3_y6dzpw,False,0.0,:Titans2:,2022-10-18T09:10:22Z,tennesseetitans,0.0121517815818265

I'm aware that these things are different, I just find myself skeptical that new stadiums have the positive impact they claim to have on the communities they're *in*. The idea that positive impacts are really going to reach throughout the state is even harder to buy.

At the end of the day, you have to do it. The teams have the governments and the people held hostage. That's the way we do stadiums. I think it's a bad system, but it's the system we have.
