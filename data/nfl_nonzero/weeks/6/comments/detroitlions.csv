In 2001 we snagged Dominic Raiola and Shaun Rogers. Raiola was a solid player who saw the Lions though some dark days, never a pro bowler, he stated 203 games for us. If 50% of the guys we drafted since in the second round could have started half that many games, we might not be as bad as we are. Rogers played in 88 games for the Lions, twice being a Pro Bowler while in Detroit. Again, had we kept this type of production, this meme literally wouldn’t exist. 

In 2007 we got Drew Stanton, and though he did basically nothing for us, he had a long career, mostly as a backup. Not really a win but also not Teddy Lehman or Titus Young. He did start 4 games for us going 2-2. His career Detroit stat line consists of 5 TDs to 9 Picks. He’s 5th in the list of top 5 second round draft picks since 2000, and it could be argued that he’s not even that good. I gave him plus points for staying in the league for multiple years and actually being good at his intended job, career backup QB.

In 2013 we got Darius Slay 2 picks before Manti Te’o, which honestly should count for 2 wins because Te’o seems like an obvious Lions 2nd rounder (but honestly probably too good for us, as he would also be top 5 on this list).
