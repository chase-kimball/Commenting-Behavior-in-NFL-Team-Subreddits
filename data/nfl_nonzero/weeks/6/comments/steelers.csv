Malik Reed is the only player i would agree has done jack shit in terms of development or production and that may or may not be directly related to Flores considering they are more involved with Karl Dunbar and the DL group.

Regardless, the ILB core absolutely has improved... Devin Bush's pre-snap awareness and his effort. Spillane looks less confused about what his responsibility as a dime linebacker is, exactly. Myles Jack has been in a good position most of the time to play the run, which is what he was brought in to do. Even just looking at the coaching up of young players such as Mark Robinson who looked great in pre-season. Thats all from a few months with one position group. 

Maybe Bush was bound to rebound and Myles Jack was going to be the player we expected him to be regardless of if Flores was coaching but they look fine out there and are far from the reason the defense has been giving up so many points the past 2 weeks. Id put that on the pass rush and DL not producing early and being tired and worn out by late in the 3rd quarter due to not being able to get off the field and the offense not being able to sustain drives and going 3 and out far too often.",1.0,steelers,t3_y4413c,False,0.0,:primantis:Primanti Bro's,2022-10-15T14:46:33Z,steelers,-0.0600624986631423

Now with his current lack of production and a contract what pays him $18m/yr he will be worth little in trade value. Its better off just keeping him now.

9376,54720,54720,Dang026,"I think this is why they tend to love drafting superior athletes rather than polished football players. Closing speed isnt really a teachable skill and when you play a ton of soft zone thats just something they need to have if they want to be special. Those are top 10 picks when you get someone who has both.

As slow as Haden was even in his prime he was the best CB we had in the past decade. I feel like they have started to shift a bit and are looking for intelligent players on the back end with guys like Cam Sutton, Levi Wallace and Ahkello Witherspoon. Obviously Minkah is a special player both physically and mentally. I think Edmunds is on his way out even though hes a physical specimen he doesnt have the mental game to fit in this evolving system (I do believe its constantly evolving, Tomlin is just incredibly methodical and slow moving).

If the team were able to get a Joey Porter Jr in the top 10 or maybe Kelee Ringo in the top 5 they need to do just that. As much as i would love a DT as an early 1st round pick it just doesn't seem plausible for this team to spend anywhere else. Sutton needs to be re-signed and the team will have 4 viable CBs because injuries happen and you cant only have 2 starting CBs in todays league. Also Witherspoon has regressed once again like he has been known to do throughout his career. He will be quality depth behind an early 1st round CB. The offense will need to make due with what they have.

- Kenny- well fingers crossed he can clear protocol and come back against Miami. Played a good, efficient game today. Wish like hell we’d take the gloves off and really let him play, attack the MOF. But he’s growing and learning, looking good this early. 

- Cam- there’s big cam. Plugged lanes, caused pressure, and just a tough man to move. Solid game for 97

- Larry O- massive, massive game for this man. Got some pressure and made big stops. Was a problem for their OL all day long 

- Pierre- he had the hold but whew he balled out today. Guy was playing tough and fearless. 

- Edmunds- first game back and he made it a good one. Dude balled out today and stepped up big time. Run fills and good pass d 

- Defense- absolutely all the odds stacked against them but they showed up today. Had no business being in this game but Austin got the boys right and figured it out. Absolutely massive performance. 

- Claypool- I give him a lot of shit but he showed up today big. Especially on third downs. He used that big body and got physical. Hell of a day

Bad:

- K Dot- honestly can’t believe he didn’t get benched today. 2 flags. Wasn’t on the field for Boz’s FG so burned a TO. Got Kenny killed. Just a terrible, terrible day for this guy 

- Sloppy O- just… sloppy. Unprepared. Burned TO’s. Guys not knowing assignments. Route concepts a mess. Canada refusing to scheme MOF. Same issues, different week. 

- Run game- what run game? Everything about it is absolutely terrible. 

- End of 1H- stuck out as a big loser for me. surrendering to gift Tampa 3 to end the half. Let Kenny throw. Instead, we hamper him with runs and truly gifted them a FG. Just pathetic. 

Massive game. Team was in the dumps and everything went against them but they showed up today. Big shoutout to Mitch, coming off the bench and being aggressive- looked sharp.
