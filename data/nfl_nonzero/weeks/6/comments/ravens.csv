31579,178099,178099,ZombieFeedback,"> People are hating on the Ravens for kicking the tires on DJax, but what better options are there in FA?

You don't need to go free agency to find a better option. You have a better option on the roster, and I am completely serious about that. ***TL;DR If you do the math with past receivers his age, then realistically speaking, DeSean's production is going to be maybe one ten-yard catch per-game better than what DeMarcus Robinson is currently on-pace for.***

Assuming he finishes the season as a Raven, DJax is going to be 36 for the majority of his time in purple. (12/1 birthday, 5 games at 35 vs. 6 at 36) Since the year 2000, there have been 39 wide receivers to play at 35 or older. They have combined to play 90 total seasons, or about two seasons each for an average retirement age of 36.

Realistically though, we should narrow our focus. Only 14 players played past 36, and seven of those 14 are either future first-ballot hall of famers like Larry Fitzgerald or current hall of famers like Terrell Owens. Even at his best, DeSean was not in the conversation alongside Jerry Rice and Randy Moss, so the odds of him being #15 seem pretty low to me. So, let's focus in on the players who played past 35 but called it a career after either their age 35 or age 36 season, and never hit 37. If we exclude active players since their story is still being written, that leaves us 24 players with 24 35-year old seasons and 13 36-year old seasons. 

During these 37 seasons, these 24 players were active for 449 total games - 291 at 35 years old and 158 at 36 - and accumulated 1,196 catches for 14,343 yards and 75 touchdowns. Dividing those totals by as appropriate to get the following per-game averages, we get a pretty unremarkable contribution:



Stat | Age 35 | Age 36 | Combined | Final season
----|------|------|--------|------------
Catches | 2.6 | 2.8 | 2.7 | 2.5
Yards | 32.1 | 32.3 | 32.2 | 28.4
Touchdowns | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.15 | 0.18

Assuming he A. plays all 11 remaining Ravens games, and B. follows the trend of every non-HoF WR to play at his age in this century, DeSean's likely season finish would be 29 catches for 343 yards and two touchdowns. That is roughly in-line with where DeMarcus Robinson is currently projecting to finish. And whereas DJax is new money to pay, a new player to learn the offense, and well on the wrong side of 30 so very likely to get hurt, Robinson is already paid for, knows the offense, and is 28.

Do our WRs suck outside of Duv and Bateman? Yes. Is a 36-year old DeSean Jackson going to help? Not really. Best case, he's going to perform roughly the same as DeMarcus Robinson.

31580,178100,178100,ZombieFeedback,">but he's still fast as hell

Is he? He only had six plays of 20+ yards last year, which is tied for 88th in the league, and none of those came after week six, so he got worse as the season stretched on, which tracks for an aging WR who doesn't have his old speed or stamina anymore. That's not the only thing that goes downhill after week six either, he only had one game with 50+ yards in that 11-game stretch, only two with more than one catch. 

Even if we expand to the whole season, it doesn't get that much more impressive; He was 133rd last year in yards after catch, and in total he only had five games with multiple receptions, one of which was two for 21 yards, and that's not that much better than what we can probably squeeze out of Robinson or Isabella.

I don't think there's much, if any, upside here. He's never been anything but a speed demon, and his speed is gone. He can toast bad secondaries for a game or two, but he doesn't have the endurance to go 11 more games, or the speed to beat actual good corners. I'd love to be wrong, but nothing about his 2021 season screams ""Positive impact on the roster"" to me.",3.0,ravens,t3_y7hy20,False,0.0, :19:,2022-10-18T18:02:54Z,ravens,0.0765695450901985

EDC and Harbs have seen the workouts and know the offense better than I do, I hope they prove me wrong, but this makes no sense to me.

31582,178102,178102,ZombieFeedback,"I feel like now is an important time to point out that traditionally teams make major adjustments during their bye weeks. It's not just a chance to rest and get healthy, it's a chance to look at your film with the same critical eye the opposing team is going to and that you normally reserve for the opposition, figure out what you do right with your current roster and want to emphasize, what isn't working as desired and pare it back, and get yourself put together for the metaphorical second half. 

Did smacking Seattle in the mouth in 2019 with Lamar's 4th down touchdown and Peters' introductory pick six invigorate the team? Definitely. But I don't think it's a coincidence that we had a bye week right after that, and suddenly we were blowing everyone out and winning our last nine games by an average margin of 21 points. The week 10 bye week is what allowed the 2018 Ravens to delete the traditional offense for Joe and install the triple-option for Lamar that got us from 4-5 to 10-6. Bye weeks matter for a lot more than health. 

The only seasons I can recall where the Ravens *didn't* see a pronounced improvement post-bye were 2021 when Lamar went down for the season two games into the second half, 2020 where COVID ruined the team for a month immediately after the bye, and 2015 where everyone died and we were starting Ryan Mallett and Kamar Playmaiken Aiken. 

Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of reason to be frustrated. Two or three smarter decisions by a couple individuals on the team - Lamar here, Oweh there, Harbs here, Macdonald there, etc. - and we're 6-0, frustration at .500 with three games we should've had in the bag is completely understandable. I'm reserving judgement until the bye though. 

If this team is still struggling to close out games and has no offensive presence in the fourth quarter once they've had a chance to self-assess and get players back healthy, then it'll be time to start really worrying, but for now, it seems like everyone in the league is struggling just as much, other than the NFC East, KC, and Buffalo.

31583,178103,178103,ZombieFeedback,"I will say it before and I will say it again, there is no reason to sign a wide receiver who is six weeks from his 36th birthday. The only receivers in the history of the sport who produced after their 35th birthdays are all in the all-time great discussion, and even a lot of guys who are Canton-bound couldn't do it. Larry Fitzgerald fell off a cliff at 35. Steve Smith fell off a cliff at 35. Reggie Wayne, Anquan Boldin, Randy Moss, Torry Holt, nobody makes it past 35 at that position. Jerry Rice, Cris Carter, and TO are basically the only guys who still produced at 35, and Flash 80 is the only one who was still doing it at 36, a birthday DeSean hits on December 1.

I legitimately would rather have James Proche and Tylan Wallace going out there doing nothing, at least they're both cheap, familiar with the system, know how much it expects WRs to block, and still have their legs under them. Hell, I would rather have Dez ""Emotional support WR"" Bryant and his six receptions on the year back. He is at least familiar, physical, and has more to his game than speed. Speed is DeSean's entire game, and it's also the first thing to go with age. There is no football reason to sign this man. Zero. None.

31585,178107,178107,ZombieFeedback,"There is no reason to sign a 35 year old WR. There is a clear and consistent cliff that WR production falls off of at that age for pretty much everyone other than Jerry Rice, even for all-time legends:



Player | Age 34 | Age 35

Steve Smith | 79/1065/6 | 46/670/3
Larry Fitzgerald | 109/1156/6 | 75/804/4

Reggie Wayne | 111/1355/5 | 38/503/2
Anquan Boldin | 83/1062/5 | 69/789/4

It is worth noting that all six of these players are substantially better than DeSean, with two already being in Canton, one being a 100% lock as soon as eligible, and the last three having very strong cases. These are some of the best to ever play the position, and none of them conquered their 35th birthday. All of them also had much more complete, well-rounded games, whereas DeSean's whole career has been built around speed, which is one of the first things to go with age. This list also does not include guys like Randy Moss and Julio Jones and Andre Johnson and Torry Holt, who were, again, better than DeSean, and weren't lucky enough to make it to 35 before age caught them.

Basically unless you are Flash 80 himself, you are done as an NFL WR when you reach your 35th birthday, especially if you are a speedster like DeSean, as evinced by him failing to breach 300 yards with any team since turning 33. Even if you disregard the antisemitism and only look at his on-field production, there is zero reason to think he will do more than 20 catches for 200 yards.

31586,178108,178108,ZombieFeedback,"It's not just about targets, it's about changing coverage. 

Bateman and Duv both have lightning speed, Robinson and Proche and Wallace aren't slow, but they do not have the same kind of 4.30/4.40 speed. That means defensive backs don't have to give as big of a cushion, because they don't have to respect the threat of getting toasted on longer routes. That means less separation. By the same token, Rashod is over six feet tall and plays bigger. Robinson is our only WR who's over six feet, and he does not have nearly the same ability in any other aspects, especially in speed. (If he did, he wouldn't have been a permanent WR3 in KC) Rashod can get more physical and aggressive with corners and win by doing so, and that translates to being able to beat tight coverage off the line, which, again, translates to separation. 

All this means that even if he's not getting the ball thrown at him, Bateman shifts how defenses have to cover him. Safeties have to respect the speed, and that changes their positioning, which opens up completely different route combinations. Corners have to respect the size and physicality, which not only changes how you line up against him, but who you line up against him, because certain smaller corners are just going to get beat off the line by a guy with four inches and 30 lbs. on them. This reduces the resources that can be focused on Andrews or Duvernay, because Bateman's physical toolset forces you to play differently than you would for Robinson or Wallace, the two primary recipients of additional snaps in his absence.",2.0,ravens,t3_y67a8a,False,0.0, :19:,2022-10-17T15:08:45Z,ravens,0.0513979999283003

I have seen LJ miss reads but not egregiously enough to say he is the problem, like any QB he has favorites and I'm sure it's more to do with ball handling skills than anything else. But he does miss some wide open shots.

Now Andrews draws double coverage a ton and he still gets his catches. With Lamar's threat to run, JK back and his threat to both catch and run, and Andrews drawing doubles.. there should be some pretty hard leverages being made on the defense on every play in 2 or 3 spots.

We don't have nearly as many scrubbing routes or clearing routes being run, GRo expects everyone to win their 1 on 1 every time, the good offenses scheme that shit open and let their receivers do work AFTER the catch.

So yeah that's the same draft Hollywood came out in.. could we have picked someone else there.. SURE.. but we didn't.. and then nobody else picked up a decent receiver that round either..

The deal is the higher you can draft a player the more years you can pay him less AND hope he contributes during that time, so you can afford superstars like LJ..
