Look, everyone is saying the Broncos on primetime suck, we all thought they would be better. True, the games with them have been disappointing if you expecting to see a shootout.

But I have gone from...the Broncos shouldn't be on primetime...to...they should be on primetime every week until something changes.

These last few weeks I have tuned in 100% to see if Russell Wilson would turn it around. To this point, he hasn't. And I am curious what the next week will hold. I know I am not the only one outside of Denver that wants to know. Will week 7 be the week? I won't know first hand since it isn't on primetime. But you sure as hell better bet I am going to be googling the game to find out how he did.

To be clear, I probably wouldn't have even watched these primetime games were some random ""good"" teams playing each other because I just wouldn't have cared. If Russell Wilson were playing up to expectations, I also wouldn't care, because it would just be business as usual.

I can't possibly be the only one thinking this.",7.0,nfl,t3_y7ver6,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-10-19T02:27:45Z,seahawks,-0.0008498586601543

Doing that it's hard not to look at Russ and see a great QB. He's careful with the ball so his stat line generally looks good, he's great at making crazy plays/throws so he shows up well on RedZone and highlights, and he's usually great in primetime. 

Even last night, in a thread reacting to his play, there was a guy quoting his TD/INT ratio over the past few years as if that tells the whole story.

What all that misses, though, are the multiple 3 and outs and drive killing sacks each game. The lack of ability to sustain drives with short to medium passes outside of the 2 minute-drill. The decrease in scrambling to keep drives alive. 

Those are things you only see if you watch most snaps of every game, and subsequently try to justify away until he's no longer on your team.

*9:55 AM*


""Hell yes it's time for football"" 

I throw on my SpongeBob tee shirt and fly downstairs. When I turn on the tube television it shakes the room like a gong. Flip to channel 7. My sister hears the commotion wants to watch Disney channel but is quickly overruled by my father.


""Sorry girl but in this house it's a democracy"" 


I high five my dad as my sister is relegated to the upstairs tv. Dad fires up the grill and starts drinking at an unreasonable hour, mom is out doing errands so we have some time to just hang out and yell at the TV. My hawks don't play until 1 pm but that leaves us plenty of time to sit through the first window of games. Dad reads the paper on commercial breaks while I eat a bowl of wheaties. We were *supposed* to go to church today but everyone was feeling a bit ""under the weather"" 



It's the after noon now, mom is home from the store with snacks and I'm fully dressed now. During a commerical break I took out the trash and earn some brownie points with mom, now she won't make me do anything during the game. 


1 pm is here, mom is off in the garden and my sister is up in her room. Now it's just me and dad and the game.

That being said, he skipped right over to the broncos without a tear shed and ripped the band-aid off the festering wound that was his footprint - one that had social, economic, and cultural impacts across all seahawk activities.


So really it's more schadenfreude than hatred at this point. It's like well, now you see what the other side of the pasture looks like and it's not all sunshine and roses despite his manifestations. I will never forget what he did for us.



That being said, I think it's time we dispell the notion that the Broncos won the trade in any facet whatsoever. Not only did we offload a massive contract that allows us to sign up and coming talent, but it granted us several weapons in addition to high level draft picks that we are slated to receive barring a mid season push by the Broncos. Geno emerging as a high level QB is like gold plated fruity pebbles icing on the cake that is this rebuild season. If he keeps this up we can legitimately build around him and draft a QB of the future when the time is right.

Sure we loved Russ, his playmaking ability and his IQ was what separated him from the others and the schemes we built around him were working quite nicely. 


Then a few things happened. 1. His athletic ability regressed, he's no longer able to extend plays to the extreme extent he once could. This makes containing him simple. 2. He is simply not built to be a pocket passer. His first instinct after feeling pressure is to escape and relocate, rather than hang in there and deliver a ball. 3. He truly did have, and still has, great touch on the ball. You can't do that on every play though, Russ will pass up short designed looks to take a home run swing. Can you really blame him? He feasted on defenses for years, he forced defenses to play two deep safeties from like 2018 onward. Now defensive coordinators know not what he is supposed to do, but what he *wants* to do. That is a fatal error on Russ's part, he has proven time and time again that he will unload a bomb over a short look/check down whenever the opportunity is given - he doesn't just have a bad poker face, he shows you his damn hand and then proceeds to go all in.
