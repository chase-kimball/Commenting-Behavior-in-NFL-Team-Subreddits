5169,31277,31277,CoopNine,"I think Lenny probably belongs in Licht's court more than Brady.   Honestly I think the turnaround for him was probably in BA's hands, because he was hot garbage until he almost got his ass cut.   

But overall the idea that Licht is bad at either FA signings or drafting is silly.   Guy is easily in the top 10% of GMs over his tenure.   The game this weekend SUCKED.   Absolutely.   But it was a whole team failure.  Brady looked like shit, OL was pretty garbage, recievers were shit, and the defense was soft and broke when it couldn't.  

We've got to learn from this and get better.   There's enough talent on both sides of the ball to make a run for it.   If there's one place I think we have a hole is our run defense, I think Suh made things a lot easier, but if Hicks can get healthy he can at least help shore that up a bit.   Honestly I think the FO knows this, and if they could go back in time they'd have paid Suh for another year, but I know their hope was Hicks would be serviceable for a  few, while Suh would have probably retired  after this year.  It was a gamble, and so far not paying off.   

Brady needs to clean his own shit up.   He's been let down for sure in parts of the game, but yesterday he just wasn't on.   I've got no ideas in my head that he's washed up, but yesterday was not a good day for him for whatever reason.  I hate to agree with Moose, but damn, he was throwing some dirt-balls, or just some balls which were off-target.   I can think of one in particular that Evans managed to reach out and snag, but it was a bad pass.  

Team needs to take a breath, and realize that they have what it takes, and  just fucking execute.

11488,75530,75530,Kreynard54,"Rewatched the game, it was hard, but damn man I dont recognize this team.

Same issues as previous weeks, except adding in out coached by a mile.

**Offense: F**

What a stinker, uninspiring play calling, poor Oline play, bad play design, predictable play calling. Goedeke looks WAY too green on the field, Hainsey just having the dumbest mental errors at the worst time. Gameplan was about establishing the run  with an Oline getting beat and us not adjusting to that fact. Too much 4 man pressure against a sub par defense. Bradys actions and behaviors all say hes not engaged with the team.

One play sums up our poor coaching in particular. Near the goaline, we run with Fournette. We had our center pull to the right to zone block a nose lined up on the guard. (Our splits made it 3-4 feet away) and pulled out left guard Goedeke to block someone non existent, because our tackle couldnt get in front of the 3 technique that was on Goedeke, the 3 technique just straight up owned Fournette. This was on a very short yardage play. 

1. Bad assignments
2. No adjustment to obvious presnap assignments
3. Would have been better off digging in man on man instead of running a zone pulling play. WE WOULD HAVE WALKED INTO THE ENDZONE. 

We probably checked into a run play, because the Gaps were given to us, we just were given a really STUPID run play option by Leftwich. (Brady can pick between the pass and run play), Brady checked into the run correctly, but the design was so flawed it was ridiculous. 

**Defense: C-**

They didnt lose us the game, but they didnt make any plays of note to help us win it. Defensive line got bullied, when we did get pressure we did well. When we didnt get pressure on 3rd and long we got destroyed twice for no good reason. Substitutions were slow, penalties for that again. David got distracted trying to get Vea off the field which led to an explosive play. We held an NFL team to under 20 points, that should be enough to win you games in the Modern NFL. Devin Whites a loan bright spot.

**Special teams:  C**

Big return, bad tackling, bad lane discipline on punts and kick offs. Thankfully we have a competent kicker. Succops our first half of the season MVP so far.

**Coaching: F-**

Playing with no attitude, playing with no desire, playcalling is ass and we are attacking their weaknesses without acknowledging ours offensively, not being in the game for feeling when a timeout is needed, not making sure substitutions are smooth, poor communication, poor discipline.

I seriously don't get why we keep trying to establish the run so hard when the inside line is weak and it would help getting some momentum passing out of the gate. Would legit take some pressure off of the lineman to get into the groove of the game. We can establish the run AFTER making the defense playing soft coverage. Sometimes you cant impose your will on another team the way you want to, you have to acknowledge weaknesses to work around them. How are we not attacking them being down 4 DBs. Come out in shotgun and nuke them. THAN run the ball.

Side rant for Brady:

**Tom Brady:** I acknowledge your greatness, but you need to be present in the locker room for this to work. Its obvious you havent been putting in the work the way you had been, its obvious that Giselle is effecting this. Im sorry you're going through that.

Licht now has the ring that McKay has, and could have at least one HOFer on his own draft record in Mike Evans. What’s interesting is that Licht is heading towards the same cap issues McKay was facing, but this team potentially has more young talent waiting.

As a whole when I watch, the OL gives TB12 a clean pocket a good amount of the time, but LG and C are our weak points for sure. 

Our run game can't get going because the OL can't win in the trenches. We're near the bottom or at the bottom iirc. The gains Lenny gets are due to 2nd/3rd effort on his part. Brady also tends to check down ALOT to Lenny. That could be a lack of trust in his OL. 

I do miss Gronk. He was valuable blocking wise, and the dude found the weak spot in opposite defenses.
