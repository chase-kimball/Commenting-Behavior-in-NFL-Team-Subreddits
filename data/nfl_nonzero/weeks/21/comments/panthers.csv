>Rhule signed an eight-year contract with Nebraska that pays $74 million in base salary along with $4 million more in deferred salary if he remains employed by the school across various vesting dates.

>Whereas Rhule's contract with Carolina had a consistent base salary of $8.5 million each year, the Nebraska contract escalates each year -- from $5.5 million in the first year to $12.5 million in the final year of the deal.

For what it's worth, this guy has it 1. Bryce Young, 2. CJ Stroud, 3. AR15, 4. Will Levis.

What I didn't like about CJ Stroud is his arm strength. Look at the balls he throws. They have a lot of air under them. I don't think those balls are as effective at the NFL level.

That's what I like about Levis. Look at how the ball looks coming out of his hands. That's a pro ball right there. The same thing is true of Young.

AR15 can throw the ball too but obviously uses his feet more. His processing speed is better than Stroud's too (as the videos show).

I think the videos above are fair to all QBs in the discussion. There's no question that there are things that CJ Stroud does well. By all accounts he eats seam routes, for example.

Both should be available in the 4-6 range. Bryce Young will be gone and I'm not a believer in CJ Stroud. If Levis is gone by 4-6, Stroud should be available. 

It's completely possible that if Carolina doesn't move up all 4 could be gone by 9, so moving up is a necessity. The #1 pick only makes sense if they feel their QB will be gone if they wait a few picks.",-3.0,panthers,t3_10qxfoj,False,1.0,Roaring Riot,2023-02-01T14:01:56Z,panthers,2.3523e-07

* The game this weekend should not alter your perception of whether or not Joe Burrow is better than Mahomes. If it does, you're being reactionary and silly.

* The Lions desperately need a QB upgrade. Goff had 29 turnover worthy plays but only 7 recorded INTS - meaning this year is lucky. Further, he throws short of the sticks on 43% of 3rd and 4th downs, which is the 4th highest rate in the league. He's also near the top of the league on turnover worthy plays on 3rd and 4th downs despite being that conservative. He's still the same guy he was that LA needed to get rid of in order to get over the hump.

* I'd be fine with Carr in CAR but only for <$25M APY and no more than $10M guaranteed beyond year one. He's not worth it if those aren't met.

* If I'm Chicago, I'm desperately trying to trade Fields for a pick in the top 20 (Jets, Bucs, Falcons, Panthers, Tennessee, New England, and Washington are all >0% chance suitors) and then drafting Young. We haven't seen enough from Fields to *know* he's the guy, and the rookie contract QB window is one of the biggest advantages in modern sports.

* Related to the last point, Chicago did themselves a major disservice by not getting any offensive help this year, because a better supporting cast would make the Fields/Young conversation easier to pick a side on.

Those goals may seem high, but the reality of the situation is that if your new HC isn't making the playoffs by year 2, the odds he ever will are relatively minuscule. There's been a ton of statistical analysis done on this.

* Take last year's coaching carousel. 10 new HCs hired last year, 5 of them made the playoffs their 1st year. And 3 of those 5 were 1st-time HCs. Sirianni was the only rookie HC to make the playoffs in 2021, and look at the Eagles now

* [Based on data since 2008](https://www.the33rdteam.com/category/breakdowns/deep-dive-evaluating-success-rate-for-first-year-head-coaches/), new rookie HCs are about *41.7% more likely* to make the playoffs than new HCs who had prior head coaching experience. Aka, the favoritism towards first-year HCs has statistical merit

* Coaches who [don't make the playoffs](https://the-cauldron.com/nfl-head-coaches-hired-during-the-last-ten-years-a-look-at-the-data-a41e2e68a1b6) last an average of 2.1 years

* I can't find a link to the exact stat, but I remember a tweet or something that said if a new hire at HC doesn't make the playoffs in either of his first two years, the odds of him *ever* making the playoffs with the team that hired him was like 9%, to expand on the above point.

Ellis Williams article from today with some interesting tid bits from a guy I think has a good read on the organization. Article specifically states that both Reich and the organization want to avoid a retread at QB and that Carr would benefit more from the panthers than the panthers would from him (I agree). The article continues the trend I have been seeing that projects Will Levis as a top 5 pick which seems to be the way things will play out.

It's worth noting that both of these QBs were on rookie contracts at the time of their Super Bowl seasons. That allowed the team around them to be substantially better because the cap space could be allocated in other areas. 
Afterward, they both signed massive contracts that they didn't even come close to living up to, which actively hurt their teams.

It's hard to argue the ROI on them was good, although the Eagles did somehow fleece the Colts for a 1st and a 3rd while dumping most of his contract. That doesn't seem like a repeatable strategy.
