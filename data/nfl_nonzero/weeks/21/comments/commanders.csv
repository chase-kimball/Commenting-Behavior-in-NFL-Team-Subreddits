NFL is a sport where you only have a short amount of time too make money so taking less money to win a championship is a bit of a tall order, you could get injured and never play again or regress to the point where you never know if you have the shot of making that level of money again. Remember the money they make is basically their whole life’s amount, most starting quarterbacks have maybe 10 years max of getting money for their entire lives.

In that light, Riveria has been a tremendous success. 

* we haven't heard squat about Snyder interfering with Football operations (beyond the cluster fuck of a re-brand)

* indeed, our biggest problem is trying to find a way to keep one of our defensive stars that seems to want to stay here (Payne). That is a big change from what happened to guys like Trent Willams who did everything he could to leave.

* the QB problems were horrible before Riveria got here. Now they are merely bad and there is a good (but not great) chance we have a QB that will prevent us from selling everyone's first child to get a higher draft pick for a QB or crush the cap to get another re-tread.

* for all the lack of success on the field we haven't heard a peep about off-field problems, cheerleaders getting pimped out, and all other things that used to crop up like dandelions.

I wish we had won more, but the franchise (with a new owner) is in great shape for a new coach / FO (without the taint from Snyder) to get to the next level.
