The FA class may end up fairly weak after players get tagged, so it's difficult to imagine they navigate the personnel side so perfectly as to make the defense even respectable in 1 year. If they trade for Rodgers, it's even less likely, but they have a better chance at making the playoffs. 

The holes that exist just aren't small enough to believe they can turn it around in 1 offseason. Gaping holes on both lines. Still no LB's. No QB.

C — Ride with Stidham while churning the roster and building towards competing in the future

D — B or C *PLUS* drafting a QB early, regardless of the cost in draft capital

E — Any of the above with a late round QB (aka the HS QB that can be turned into an all pro by none other than the wizard himself) 

Personally, B is the least appealing. C is the most appealing, because they use their assets this year building the roster, but are very likely to be picking high next year in a stronger QB class.
