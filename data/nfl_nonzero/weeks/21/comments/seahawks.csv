That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs been called a ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs Jamal Adams‚Äù throughout his career.  You can pretty much ignore this pass rush grade here though because it‚Äôs only five rushes. 

Coby Bryant looked pretty nifty on some of his nickel blitzes as a rookie, but his sample size for rushes is also low. 

One thing to pay attention to are the grades for what PFF calls ‚Äútrue pass sets‚Äù because they focus on just those plays where the player has a genuine opportunity to rush the passer.  

Darrell Taylor, while horrible against the run, had an 80 grade in true pass rush sets.  Meanwhile, Nwosu‚Äôs grade drops off to a 65 in true pass rush opportunities; in part because he was keyed on in obvious passing situations as we lacked a top pass rusher and in part because he‚Äôs not that dynamic an athlete and relies more on savvy and hustle to generate pressure. 

Woods and Harris were both significantly better in true pass sets, while Collier, Jefferson, Irvin, and Mafe were all below average in those situations when we needed them to make an impact as rushers.  

Jefferson‚Äôs grade is probably the most interesting because they rate him as significantly below average as a pass rusher despite the fact that he converted a high percentage of his pressures into sacks.  Jefferson is horrible against the run, one of the worst on the team, and grades as below average as a rusher overall and in true pass sets.

Definitely wanted to double down on the d-line in the second round. Would probably have taken a center if one was available in the 4th round, or even the 3rd round. Joe Tippmann will be a name to watch out for day two of the draft to fill the middle of the o-line. 

9.
Peter Skoronski
OT Northwestern

Best linemen in this class, will be better suited to play as a guard. Move him to the left side next to Cross and let Lewis play in his natural position on the right side. Building the team through the trenches should be the blueprint for the Seahawks this upcoming draft. 

25.
Lukas Van Ness
EDGE Iowa

Big athletic and quick off the edge, young and still learning the position. Is able to play both on the inside and outside, a versatile player who‚Äôs got a high motor and tremendous upside. Will probably go higher than 25, but if he‚Äôs available then Seattle should absolutely take him. 

37.
Calijah Kancey
DT Pittsburgh

Honestly reminds me a bit of Donald due to his build, even played at the same school. He‚Äôs a fiery player who never gives up on the play, always attacking. Not a tall DT but doesn‚Äôt matter due to his strength and lower balance while shedding blocks. He‚Äôs already getting first round buzz, so be on the look out for his combine. 


39.
Jalin Hyatt
WR Tennessee

Track star speedster that can take the top off the defense, not a technical route runner but has soft hands. Plays a lot like Will Fuller. 

52.
Mazi Smith
DT Michigan

Great strength and physicality, can shut down the run and take on blockers without a problem. He‚Äôs going to test as one of the best DTs in this draft class, would fit Seattle‚Äôs scheme and most likely start day one as a nose tackle.

For a coach that was able to bring Washington to three different Super Bowl titles with three different starting QBs, that keen eye was clearly shown to be a key part of Joe Gibbs philosophy.

Plus, it helped that JGR had an early dose of legitimacy with Dale Jarrett winning the Daytona 500 in only the team's second year of existence.

My point is that if by some miracle we get to pick 5 and not all 3 of those guys are taken, the mere prospect of the Seahawks picking a QB (which they definitely could) would most likely convince the Raiders, the Falcons or the Panthers to trade for 5. There's no way Levis' physical traits wouldn't convince at least one of those teams to pull the trigger.

And even if we took one of the QBs: He'd be landing in a great system with a great culture and a great mentor in Geno. He'd most likely have a year, if not more, to learn on the bench.
