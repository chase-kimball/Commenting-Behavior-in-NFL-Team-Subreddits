491,5263,5263,A--A-RON,"> As a general rule, do not draft a QB in the first round. The success rate is far too low and the risk far too high.

I am not saying we should draft a QB this year in the first round or even the second but I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement above.


2017: Mitchell Trubisky(bust), Patrick Mahomes(Great), Deshaun Watson(talented)

2018: Baker Mayfield(meh), Sam Darnold(Bust), Josh Allen(great), Josh Rosen(bust), Lamar Jackson(Great)

2019: Kyler Murray(Above Average), Daniel Jones(above average), Dwanye Haskins (r.i.p) 

2020: Joe Burrow(Great), Tua(Above average), Justin Herbert(Above Average), Jordan Love(Might be decent? idk)

2021: TLaw(Good), Zach Wilson(Bust), Trey Lance(Might be good), Justin Fields(I would say above average), Mac Jones(probably the median NFL QB)

Bucs and Brady right there with ya, Never been to Florida a day in my life but fell in love with this team at 13 years old in Western NY begging my Bills fan Dad to watch a little of the team with the ""Coolest Helmets"" from there I was hooked by Mike Alstott's insane runs and Sapps blocks. 

Then we won our first SB ring, Meanwhile on the AFC side Brady was becoming my favorite QB even back then.

but the thing that sealed the deal with Bucs was seeing a video on how the Tampa Community treated Mike Alstott and Warren Sapp after winning our first SB ring.

Almost 2 decades later my favorite qb of all time joins my favorite team of all time to win our second SB ring! Literally making my wildest wettest football dreams EVER come true winning our 2nd SB ring!

So he got a job through nepotism and did worse than his dad (26.9 ppg -> 25.0 ppg). So maybe he can do a better job in the future, but I don't think its a sure thing that he will be good. After his one year as OC the entire staff was fired and replaced and he went to the clusterfuck that was the Denver Broncos offense this year. 

His last name or being part of a successful coachting 'tree' doesn't mean he will be successful. Doesn't mean he will fail here, but his last OC job he was handed a transition with all the same players and scheme and didn't have to implement it himself (like Leftwich here) and then did an 'ok' job. Coming here he will need to implement the entire scheme on his own and coach up all the players here on the new terminology and playbook. I'd feel much more comfortable doing that with a more experienced coach. 

It's funny you bring up Mike McDaniel as there were concerns with him this year as the time it took to call plays and get personel on the field. It takes time to get a scheme implemented somewhere and teach it up so that it becomes a smooth operation. So a big scheme change with an inexperienced coach is likely to immediately cause issues.

I lost track of the number of times this season that Mahomes & others would run towards the sidelines then slow up like they were giving themselves up. Defender slows because they know they can’t touch the QB. Then QB takes a few extra steps AND extends the ball so you get essentially a free 5 yards every time you do it.

Kudos to Mahomes for being smart and recognizing the rule, but it’s the rule that has to change. If defenders can’t breathe on a QB going to give himself up OB, then as soon as he does that, the play is dead.

30227,180131,180131,mhall85,"Good Lord, Florio is in full bloom, and is unapologetic about it.

Look, I recognize my own bias, but I’m going to try and objectively break this down to show why this just won’t work:

- Tom’s children live on the east coast, and San Fran is one of the furthest places he could go to play… he has stated numerous times that he wants to be around his kids, so any potential divorce or “daddy day care” jokes aside, that is a huge factor (if he is being truthful).

- The Niners, and Kyle Shanahan’s offense, now show a *consistent history* of getting their QBs injured. They also need to be somewhat mobile to execute the offense efficiently. Brady is going to be 46, and is NOT mobile.

- The Niners also will have holes to fill, or decisions to make. Niners fans can correct me if I’m wrong, but while the major pieces are still in place, it just doesn’t take the core. Filling those gaps will be just as important, but may be harder to do if Brady commands a ~$25m deal.

Any one of those things aren’t a dealbreaker, but I can’t see that all three of them together won’t stop him from coming. Shoot, Shanahan hasn’t shown he can keep a QB healthy for an entire year… and on top of Brady’s cost, age, and family concerns, Shanahan would likely have to tweak his offense to make it work for Brady. It can work, of course, but then you’re risking the future of both Lance and Purdy because you’re NOT running the Brady version of the offense with those guys (so don’t say “QB x can learn under Brady for a year”…).

He’s not mobile, like those guys are (to varying degrees, of course). He’ll get rid of the ball quick, but this season showed us that it still disrupts timing and accuracy.
