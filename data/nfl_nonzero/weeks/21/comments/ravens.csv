3/4 NFC teams in the divisional round didn’t make the divisional round last year. Only the 49ers made it last year. So the AFC is dominated by the top 3 teams while the NFC is a bit more open year to year.

Edited to add: since OP asked which is my favorite, it’s probably Clark Phillips. From what I’ve read he’s a starting-caliber CB who plays bigger than his size. Close second is probably a tie between Kelee Ringo and Xavier Hutchinson, although AT Perry is pretty close to Hutchinson in terms of my favorite current WR (who I think will still be on the board when we pick).",1.0,ravens,t3_10qh2h3,False,0.0, :OLD2:,2023-01-31T22:34:36Z,ravens,0.163669024

Although there’s always a chance that we’ll be running a lot fewer 2-TE sets this year depending on the new OC. 

I guess I’m kind of in the mindset that we already are gonna have a lot of moving pieces this offseason and I’d like to keep as many guys as possible for the sake of continuity. We definitely need to make some changes to this roster but I guess I’m scared of overdoing it.

Draft 2 WR and 2 CB. We also could use an edge-rusher and a guard/tackle, and possibly another RB and DT for insurance (will depend on new OC and other roster moves). Use remaining draft picks to fill those needs, or just go BPA.

WR: keep everyone but Proche. Sign Lazard or Chark if the price is right. Bateman, FA signing, DRob, Duv, and draft picks. I’d prefer to draft two big-body boys like AT Perry, Rashee Rice, Jonathan Mingo, etc.

CB: Peters is likely gone, and Fuller’s health is a question mark. Despite our hole at WR, I think this is a more pressing need—especially if we want to move past the Bengals, Bills, or Chiefs in the playoffs. 

I like (and think we can draft two of) Kelee Ringo, Clark Phillips, Tyrique Stevenson, DJ Turner, Darius Rush, and Cameron Brown.

There is no singular reason why Lamar and the ravens have struggled in the playoffs. Each game that he’s played, there were unique circumstances that contributed to Lamar struggling.

2019: Everything that could’ve went wrong did + abandoned the game plan too quickly + Lamar forcing things out of frustration (i.e. his second interception)

2020 WC: Weird how nobody talks about this one, considering Lamar played well

2020 Divisional: Absolutely horrible day to be a QB for anyone (ridiculously windy) + the worst our OL has ever played in the Lamar era. Lamar made a *horrible* mistake on the INT, but that was his sole mistake of the day.
