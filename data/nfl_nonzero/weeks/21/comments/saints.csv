I’m biased though, after the Falcons let Shanahan walk and we watched Matty Slightly-Above Average go from an MVP back to his usual form I immediately realized how dumb it is to have a DC head coach. The fact that if your offensive head coach succeeds and your team doesn’t need to learn a new offense every year is a huge benefit to that type of hiring. A defensive guy having a OC poached and losing that system has killed plenty of teams seasons. At the time, I wanted McDaniel most then Daboll to be the HC here with DA staying as the DC so damn bad. I got downvoted for that opinion often but I definitely disagreed with it.

The inability for the head coach to select the right coaches under him to help succeed and the inability to develop young talent on the roster and new acquired talent, the fact his teams were undisciplined and underperformed… all of it just screams his Raider days were obvious failures. All you can do is look at the guy’s predecessors and successors to judge value and in that time frame he is a VERY clear outlier. 

I hope he succeeds here as the HC, but I have a close friend who is a Raiders fan who told me what to expect from a DA coaches team, and all the things he said lined up to this years performance. He is the same guy to this point. The fact you just dismiss his record for his 2 full years of coaching when the previous and next 2 years were much better without him is ludicrous to me. The guy failed to even reach a .250 win percentage there and the people before and after weren’t below .500 with the same amount of time. His raiders coaching days were not good. Period. He was not a good coach. You hope he learns from his mistakes, but last year didn’t look promising. Team was still undisciplined, not aggressive on go-for-it situations, adjustments weren’t made during the game, “keep doing what we’re doing” when what we’re doing is losing games due to boneheaded plays and penalties… I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong, but let’s not act like he wasn’t given a fair shake.

ETA: I’m not trying to argue or anything, if that’s how it’s coming across. I just don’t see it. My stance on him being promoted was the same it is now. I get things wrong all the time, one of the many reasons I’m not a GM lol. I’m just not seeing where DA defenders are coming from. Is it blind loyalty or actual homework?

It literally went:

Cable (.500), Hue fucking Jackson (.500), DA (.222), Del Rio (.594)


Look at the roster for those teams or whatever all you want, but if Tom Cable can win 8 games with Jason Campbell (7-5)  and Bruce Gradkowski (1-3) and Hue Jackson can win 8 games with Jason Campbell (4-2), and fresh off the couch Carson Palmer (4-5) then DA should have been able to win more games with Palmer, Campbell and Pryor than 4… he is what he is at this point, and that’s a coach who took over a Hue Jackson 8-8 team, and won half the games the next year.

26767,247448,247448,myxanders,"This sub is a pathetic shit show right now.

There's a lot to unpack from the Richard stuff. 

One, the co-DCs hasn't ever and clearly didn't work out this time. That solved itself when Nielsen was hired away. 

Two, Richard has been here for two seasons, and yes we've seen some great secondary play overall in that time, but we weren't exactly starved for good DBs before that. The big difference was cutting down in penalties in the secondary.

Three, DA has overseen the building of the defense, the strength of our team, for 7.5 years now. It is highly unlikely that the guy who said ""keep doin what you've been doin"" is going to make such any drastic changes to the overall scheme that would ruin our defense. It's much more likely Richard wanted to add wrinkles that don't mesh with DA's philosophy.

Just because there's shakeups in the defensive staff doesn't mean the offensive staff isn't going to get touched. Yes, Pete is returning. But it's still too early to tell the final makeup of the staff on that side of the ball.

The doomsdayers in this sub are so annoying. One breath they want to tank, the next they complain that we're the Texans despite having a stable front office and talent on both sides of the ball.

The bottom line is the team took a bunch of risks to extend the window while Brees was around and attempt to prop it open once he left. Sometimes things just don't work out. I don't think anyone anticipated that Michael Thomas had fewer than 16 games left as a Saint after his record breaking season. I don't think anyone anticipated Trevor Penning getting turf toe and a Lisfranc injury in his rookie season. I don't think anyone anticipated a global pandemic would occur and cause an always-inflating salary cap to decrease for a season.

It sucks when it works out worse than anticipated. But that doesn't mean the front office isn't trying to win, despite what some loud ones here might suggest.",21.0,saints,t3_10rce3a,False,0.0,Ruiz,2023-02-01T20:15:53Z,saints,-0.0313506934435923

Outside of a few hits here and there, his drafting was pretty shit until Jeff Ireland came on board (the Lattimore/Kamara draft).

On the flip side, I'm not sure anyone consistently got more out of what they had to work with than Payton (even if his decisions directly resulted in ""what he had to work with"").  He and Brees carried those historically bad defenses to 7-9 (bleh) records or better.  For a brief moment, he made some people believe Jameis Winston was salvageable. When Brees went down, he steered a Teddy Bridgewater-led ship to almost not miss a beat.

The Taysom as a real QB romance was obviously misguided, but even then, we had a winning record.

One thing I will say about Payton is that he was always decisive and fully committed - and never scared to take a risk if he thought it was the best chance for the team.  Even if I disagreed with something he did, I always felt like he believed in it and got his players to believe in it.  In terms of motivation, fire, having the buy-in and support of the players, he is near the very top level of coaches, if not at the top.

My friend is a Packers fan, and after one of their playoff losses, he wrote in to a mailbag basically just saying ""Mike McCarthy is scared"" over and over because of his game management and decision making.

Having watched a ton of games with that friend, his feeling with McCarthy was always ""we're still gonna fuck it up"", while my feeling with Payton was always ""we've still got a chance"".  So even if the numbers are similar, I'd still take Payton 10 times out of 10 over McCarthy.",11.0,nfl,t3_10qzvvh,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2023-02-01T12:23:04Z,saints,0.0020541885122516
