19570,135773,135773,PoogeneBalloonanny,"In offense:

* Please bring back the short passing game that Daboll made bread and butter
* We should be in 11 personnel on most first downs to start drives with a focus on more passes, provided we can have personnel that can also run out of 11 personnel (upgrading Saffold's spot should help us with that at the very least)
* Also for 1st downs in our territory, a lot more under center action along with 11p
* Layer in the runs, especially if they give us light boxes (and dependent on opponent D strengths week to week) but predominantly we should run multi level concepts vs zone, and rubs/crossers vs man
* Main priority is to get the less flashy 1st downs (10-15 yard gains), or 2nd and shorts to make life easier
* Only deviate from this 1st down principle by going for a shot play if they give us a very favourable man look on one of our weapons, and in certain situations (down a lot, or up a lot, 2min drill at end of half for example)
* The *occasional* 1st down shot (esp if we get a good look) is great, but not to the extent where it became a *tendency* for us in 2022
* 2nd and shorts are great (underrated result vs getting a short first down IMO), anything with less than 3 yards to go (that number is flexible for situations and field position too) we should be in a heavier personnel + under centre + PA and dial up proper shot plays, if nothing is open take the incompletion/throwaway or have Allen scramble for the <3yards to go
* 2nd and super short (1 yard and below) should be super aggressive, heavy AF personnel, 1 or 2 deep routes, everyone else in pass pro, and also under center + PA. If the D checks into a deep passing look pre snap, check into a run (in our already heavy personnel). Otherwise go full bonkers, I still want to let Allen be Allen, just in a smarter manner
* The first downs should be high percentage passes with Allen coached to take what is given, in the \~10% that we don't get a 2nd and short, repeat the 1st down principle with 11 personnel short passing play but layering the run in too
* I would deviate from those early down philosophies a tad in the redzone with a more balanced rush tendency where the tradeoff between pass and run is less pronounced, as well as passing spaces being tighter (but still be more pass heavy in absolute terms, dependant on the defense of the week)
* I also would rarely have us do designed QB runs outside the redzone, but have them in our backpocket for the redzone
* In general things I'd like to see more in offense: plays schemed up for Knox, more motions, more screens and designed RB passes and finally way way more middle of the field targets

Defense:

* Not much to ask, just please please be more adaptable
* Feels like our defensive coaching is just an NPC as it does not seem to change week to week according to our opponents
* More man coverage against QBs that tear up zones and/or rely on a rhythm based offense
* If a QB struggles vs the blitz (Lamar?) blitz the shit out of them as a gameplan and continue doing so if that works
* I like nickel as our base, and it depends on personnel (can we field 3 LBs?) but have more 4-3-4 looks against the run teams, only a bit.

Just a heads up, we have a first round pick (unlike the Saints or Dolphins for example). We can get Torrence without trading or cutting Diggs

>You can't have your cake and eat it to.

Again, I really don't understand why drafting Torrence in a hypothetical would mean we have to cut Diggs

>So why do you put more value on guard than WR or any other high value position

I am not, I am valuing an A grade guard over some B/C grade receivers (Flowers not included, again my first choice 1st round pick). 

Ironically the colts have spent more in original draft capital on WRs than we do. Diggs, original day 3, Davis, original day 3, Mckenzie, Kumerow Shakir etc

Colts had 3 2nd round WRs this past season on their roster

How so?

QB, check

WR in Diggs, check

DE, half check

>Look at Strange and Green.

>Horrible picks.

You keep on saying ""not this draft specifically"" blah blah which I deem irrelevant, but hey.

But then you bring up 2022's draft class where the guards were seen as thin on the top but with a lot of solid depth (Parham, Rhyan, Strange (lol Patriots), Salyer). Torrence who I use as an example is better than Strange and Green, at least in my opinion he is.

2022's WR class is also far far far far far more stacked than this year's. I actually wanted a 1st round receiver (and a CB FA) in 2022, does that sound like someone that values OG >>>>> WR?

My favourite guard prospect was Parham, I thought those 2 were overrated.

>At best, you draft a great iol, maybe even the next Nelson! How did that work out for the Colts this year? Terrible run game, awful team.

Please realise it is 2023 and we have just gone through the 2022 regular season.

Nelson has been awful in 2022 post back surgery.

The Colts also don't have a good QB or a good OL outside of Nelson even.

Of course they don't have Diggs, but I actually like Pittman and Pierce a lot (I wanted us to draft Pierce last year, funny coming from a ""person that hates WRs"" lol)

>A guard ain't putting us over the top

True, but no single position is. We need to potentially replace Edmunds/Poyer/Singletary amongst other spots needing help.

>Guard is objectively terrible first round value

Extreme example, but again why are you here

We aren't getting a Diggs/Chase type receiver with our pick, I'd argue that even with a top 10 pick we wouldn't be, with how weak this WR class is at the top

We could be getting a Zack Martin type guard at 24

QB is the most valuable position in the league, bar none

Let's (THE BUFFALO BILLS)  swing for the fences and draft Young/Stroud/Levis in an aggressive tradeup

Hmm, not a good idea? Something something needs

>We can fix the o-line without spending a first one of the league's least valuable positions. When you get deeper into the draft, drafting a guard becomes more valuable than drafting a 3rd or 4th WR.

> It's not guard. You can fix that later in the draft or via free agency or trade. I am not wasting my first on a fucking guard. 

I've said this elsewhere, value of a draft pick is position AND the individual players in question

The 100% consensus is QB >>> RB for example, would you have drafted Dustin  Krum over Breece Hall last year????

* IMO (and somewhat consensus) this is a weak WR class at the top 
* My opinion, also in line with consensus, WR depth is strong this year
* Consensus opinion: OG is the opposite, ONE blue chip prospect and bad depth (I don't fully agree, I like Vorhees)
* IMO the only blue chip prospect at WR is Addison, and he is still WR4/5 at best compared to last year. Consensus is high on Johnston, and mixed on JSN, I am not high on either.

Yes but that comes from me being higher than consensus on Flowers (low 1st rounder in my books) rather than anything negative on Downs. I'm right with consensus on Downs as a high/mid 2nd rounder.

Addison is worth the hype, and to me Flowers is just Addison minus 10lbs but also minus maybe a whole tenth in the 40 in how he plays.

Value for a draft pick is inherent to both the individual and the position, you are making it sound like it is only valuable to the position and nothing else

Yes, if Addison is there, take him

But

1. This year's WR is thin at the top with good depth (a lot of good day 2 and day 3 guys)
2. As opposed to OG, where it is one great prospect (Torrence) and kinda slim pickings after (I like Vorhees but consensus doesn't, but yea all sucks outside them 2)
3. My personal opinion is that the only WRs in a vacuum I'd take over Torrence are Addison and Flowers. And then knowing the receiving depth and non-existent OG depth, it's just Addison, who btw will be long gone.
4. If Addison, Flowers and then Johnston, JSN (the latter 2 I think are overrated) are gone in our pick and Torrence is there, I'd pick Torrence easily (or trade down)

Transcend yes, but can always be made even better with better scheme

>It's just that interior OL are more easily impacted by scheme, both positively and negatively

To an extent yes, but not to an extent where the jimmies and joes don't matter.

With the running game:

* The best run designers in the league are Shanahan, McVay and Roman (despite his woeful faults in the passing game)
* They all had inferior run games this year in comparison to the Eagles who have the best OL in the game
* Mcvay and Roman actually had some pretty lackluster run offenses this year on the whole
* There are guards in the league that cannot displace D-linemen, cannot pull, aren't athletic enough to reach block, or just all 3
* Having good personnel allows you to be more scheme diverse (if certain members of the OL can't pull, then that is one less set of plays to worry about it, if we can't run zone, then that's half of all run plays to not gameplan for, for ecample)

Now I am with you, I said that they were equivalent, not one more than the other. I really want to bring back the quick passing game that Daboll made our bread and butter, especially in first downs and occasional third and shorts.

But:

* I am not asking us to field Joel Bitonio and Zack Martin
* Just for us to replace Saffold who is both really really bad and an UFA
* I also don't want us to swing way too far in the opposite direction and become the Joe Lombardi offense, neutering Josh as one of if not the most talented passer in the league
* Guards like Saffold can't even be masked in the short passing game if they give up literally instant pressure (like he did vs Cinci) in the interior where D-linemen have a quicker and more direct path to the QB
* We still need to run the ball, in short yardages and in the redzone
* Repeating my run point, having good personnel allows you to be more scheme diverse (opposing Ds thinking, are they going to run/attack us at all levels?)

>To dismiss is and say someone is a fool is not really paying attention

Apologies if you thought it was personal, I take that back. My statement applied to all positions, not just IOL

Didn't agree with him being the hire last year because I wanted an experienced play caller, but McD made this bed and now has to lie in it for a bit. He now has a year experience and hopefully learned a thing or two and will grow. Frazier on the other hand...I'm done with. How many 3rd and 19s did we give up last year? Third and 10+yards in general? Don't care about his DVOA.Cap issues. Yes, the Bills could make some moves and free up by my tally about 60M. However, they are already 20M in the hole and I truly don't think Beane is willing to kick as much down the road in salaries as he could. We also will need about 10M to sign rookies and have a small nest egg for in season moves next year.The list of areas we need to improve is not small. Yes, we won 13 regular season games last year. So what? The Titans had the #1 seed the year before and missed the playoffs this year. I think the Bills right now fall more into the category of the '21 Titans (Solid players on defense, winning on offense because of 1 physical freak albe to will enough points for victory in Allen/Henry). The Chiefs and Bengals have created clear separation and the top 2 AFC teams.

And before saying it can't be done...go look at the Chiefs draft from the last 2 years...see home many starters they found in rounds 2-7.

26688,189468,189468,UberHansen,"Let's dive into a few of your points here.

1. You ended this point with ""Don't care about DVOA"" in an attempt to block the primary argument to your point, that the Bills Offense AND Defense were statistically elite. There are for sure concerns with recent postseason performances but the fact of the matter is that the Bills Offense remained elite in 2022, despite their QB dealing with a significant elbow injury, while their defense was one of the best in the NFL despite 10/11 starters missing games due to injury. The arguments for the Bills being elite on both sides of the ball are more plentiful than the arguments against (This doesn't mean criticism is not allowed).
2. The reason Beane has been pushing money via restructures is because of the expected MASSIVE increase in Cap coming in 2024. With the new TV Deal expected to apply to the NFL's books  by then you could see the cap increase by as much as $50m next off-season. Will the Bills restructure every deal? No. Will the Bills restructure plenty in order to re-sign and or add talent? Of course. You won't see a Von Miller-esuqe signing this off-season but don't be surprised if the Bills add a few high upside vets this off-season in order to revamp the OL and/or add depth.
3. How can you possibly compare the current iteration of the Bills to the 2021 Titans? There is a significant different between a team which was heavily reliant on a 28-year old RB to win games and one that relies on a Top-3 QB to win.  I would argue the Chiefs have separated because they built the trenches well but to imply the Bengals have clearly separated from the Bills makes little sense. I'll wait until the regular season game against the Bengals next season to make the decision on clear separation. Oh yea, and the cap issues the Bills have...the Bengals are about to have them 10-fold.
4. We were told the schedule was ROUGH coming into this season. The Bills proceeded to go 13-3 and finish the regular season with the 2nd best point differential in the NFL. Schedules year to year are impossible to analyze. Did anyone expect the Rams to be atrocious this season? I don't think so. This is all to say, the schedule going into 2023 is no more difficult, on paper, than the schedule coming into 2022. As for the division getting better, we also said the same coming into this season. The Bills would go on to win the East by 5 games, the most they have won it by in their 3-year run atop the division.
5. People's inability to look at the draft the past few seasons with any semblance of unbiased has been jarring this off-season. Yes there have been some misses but the Bills have drafted better over the past 5 seasons than nearly any other team in the NFL (Bengals & Cowboys the 2 exceptions). From this draft in particular, James Cook looks to be the Bills RB1 moving forward after posting a 5.7 Y/A, Kaiir Elam looks to have the physical prowess to be CB2 (albeit more improvements are needed), Khalil Shakir projects to compete for the Bills Slot1, and Christian Benford looks to have been a steal that the Bills may try and flex to Safety. There are just as many IFs that the Bills draft may not progress as they will progress. Historically speaking for this Bills team Year 2/3 is when their draft picks tend to take off, that trend is something they will rely on in 2023.

I understand people want to react to how the season ended against the Bengals and have this desire to scream from the rooftops that the sky is falling and the window is closed. Fact is, the Bills still will have one of the best rosters in the NFL going into 2023 and as long as #17 is on Center there is no reason to believe that the Bills can't compete for a Super Bowl. People can lower expectations if they would like however, there is just as much reason to remain optimistic moving forward.",3.0,buffalobills,t3_10pzy9z,False,0.0,:still-bill:,2023-01-31T08:38:53Z,buffalobills,0.0108926044618132

28647,199329,199329,Xplayer,"Players *want* to take a restructure for several reasons. They get money that they were (usually) entitled to anyway right away. A player's salary is paid out in weekly (or bi-weekly) game checks, but the total salary counts against the cap for the entire year. A restructure turns part or all of this salary into some sort of bonus (signing bonus/roster bonus etc.) which can be spread out over up to 5 years over the length of the contract. They would receive this money as a lump sum as soon as the restructure happens (e.g. Allen would receive his entire $21M salary for the year once he signs on the dotted line for the restructure, but it could also reduce his cap hit by that much this year). Also, of course, they free up cap space in the short term which helps their team get under the cap and sign players.

You might ask then why didn't the Bills just spread out Allen's cap hit more when he first signed? Flexibility. You can restructure contracts to move cap to future years after the fact.

The phrase was widely used by Saints fans in 1983.
A variation of the phrase was used by some Louisiana high schools and colleges in the 1970s and seems to have been used by some Saints fans in the late 1970s (probably a small number, and possibly a very small number). Is it possible that it was then copied and adapted by Bengals fans? Not clear. Did the popularity of the Bengals‚Äô chant in 1981 lead to the wider adoption of the Saints‚Äô saying in 1983? This seems likely, but also is not clear.

Now that said, ""Who Dat"" is something that had been in use in the NOLA area for a _long_ time prior, but at least when it comes to the football teams, it's not necessarily a rip off.

49999,355163,355163,von_Topic,"I was just thinking if running the ""bend don't break"" defensive scheme isn't counterproductive. We have top 3 QB in the league... Doesn't that mean that our offense should be on the field as much as possible. With our conservative defensive system and playcalling opponents often put together 10 play drives that take 5+ minutes from the clock which means 5+ minutes our best player doesn't have the ball in his hands (and God forbid if the other team actually scores on this long drive)...

Even with the woeful OL, lack of weapons and questionable playcalling and sometimes decision making from Josh, I think we can all agree that he can always make something out of nothing. As long he has that ability the opponent needs to respect our offense whenever it steps on the field (doesn't matter if the ball is on our 20 or we are driving into the redzone).

So if we have a QB like that, who can literaly make any throw and can conjure big plays out of thin air, shouldn't we give him as many possession as possible and as many chances as possible? Wouldn't it be better if we ran ultra aggressive defensive scheme to maybe gamble a bit more, try to force the issue and get big splash plays (sacks, INTs) instead of sitting in our nickel D shell most of the time and letting our opponents to kill us with long methodical drives?

If you have Josh Allen as your QB, shouldn't you try to turn almost every match into a shoot-out with as many possessions as possible and bank on the fact that at the end of the day our guy (Josh) is better than their guy?",2.0,buffalobills,t3_10p2oi4,False,0.0,:BUF:,2023-01-30T13:59:59Z,buffalobills,0.0410144134411022

Making deals with teams we see as less likely to do well in future years to aquire higher picks, trading down to stockpile picks/depth. If we can swindle an extra first or second in a following year, then trade back from our pick or that extra one, we can continue to stockpile picks/depth.

Now, does he have room to grow? Yes. Do you want to fire him and watch him go to another team and see him resurrect their franchise? Want to watch him turn it into one of the classiest orgs in the league because he hasn't learned every lesson yet? That's shortsighted. Because he will. He's a damn good coach.
