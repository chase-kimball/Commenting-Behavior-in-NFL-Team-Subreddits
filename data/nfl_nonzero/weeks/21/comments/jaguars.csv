And injuries do matter for some people when ranking the top 5 qbs. 

That's the issue: there is no definition to what the word ""best"" or ""top"" means in this context. It is subjective in many respects. 

Also, worth mentioning that my major objection to your statements is the ""it's not even close"". 


For you, it seems like the major contributing factor is stats. And that's really it. You say that Herbert has had multiple years of success... but really it's mostly just multiple good years with good stats. 

Again, I'm not discounting the talent of Tua and Herbert, but to state it isn't close as a blanket statement.. nah. 

For you, injuries don't matter. For me, and a lot of other people, they contribute. 

I find it hard to rank a guy who has never completed a full season in the top 5. Tua will not be there until he can do that. After a season with two major concussions, i just cant rank him in the top five without seeing where he is next year, and if he finishes the season. 

You can disagree with me, but saying I can't make that argument or that the argument is invalid is trying to make an inherently objective ranking subjective. 

Looking through lists, I don't see Lamar as high as he should be when he is at his best. Why? Because most people won't put him as high anymore. If we were to go by what each of these guys can do when at their absolute best and 100% healthy, Lamar should be contending with Mahomes for the #1 spot. But he is hardly mentioned in the top three, because injuries matter. 

Let me be clear one more time: you not ranking Trevor in the top 5 is five by me. I understand your arguments. I understand what you value in making your own list. 

But again, stating that there is no why to make an argument for him to be included is incorrect.",1.0,nfl,t3_10q7sxa,False,0.0,:Jaguars: Jaguars,2023-02-01T12:47:05Z,jaguars,-0.0295496618967091

17072,125799,125799,Oopiku,"""not close to being top 5 in the AFC"" is a bit rough to claim. I suppose it depends on how you look at your rankings.

Do you go off of who you think is currently, in this moment better? Is it who you believe had the better season? Is it you you believe will be better in 2023?

A lot to consider. Now lets look at who would be above him:

Without a doubt on most lists: Mahomes, Allen, Burrow.

These three aren't worth discussing. Not in the slightest, it would just waste our time.

Now you have this group to discuss for 4 and 5: Lawrence, Herbert, Lamar... maybe Tua?

Now you have to think about each one and why they might fit in the top five. You also have to defend yourself stating that Lawrence doesn't deserve to be CLOSE to the top 5.

So somehow you'd have to explain how these other 3 QBs (Herbert, Lamar, Tua) are much better than Trevor.

I'd argue that its hard to put Lamar and Tua above him drastically, when neither have played a full season the last two years. Lamar at his best is obviously hard to reach, but Lamar who can't play isn't hard to beat out. Herbert has great numbers, and it may make me sound crazy - but I just haven't seen him give me a performance where I said: That guy is THE dude.  I have seen that from Trevor. For me, the fact that their stats were similar this year but Trevor showed so much more when it mattered, in the playoffs, just means I can't accept (and I'm a fan, I get that), that Herbert is so far ahead Trevor isn't ""close"" to him.

Tua: Had a good year last season. but missed a few games while on the IR with a rib injury. In 2022, he was looking really good. The Ravens game was beautiful. But through the season he was put on concussion protocol twice, missing 4 games total (not include ones he had to leave). Even though Tua is one of the best when he is playing at his highest level, I find it hard to rank someone in the top 5 when they cannot finish a full season. He has yet to play a playoff game, as he had to sit out this offseason.

Lamar: Such a talented runner who can also pass the ball pretty well. Just not from the pocket. AP MVP in 2019, which was by far his best year passing (and running). QBR of 113.3. Simply amazing. Since then, his QBR has been: 99.3, 87, 91.1. Not bad, but a steep drop, right? It should also be noted that in 2021 and 2022, he didn't finish either season. He suffered injuries in weeks 14 and 13 of those seasons, respectively, and missed the remaining games - including missing a playoff game. He is 1-3 in the post season overall.

17109,125849,125849,Oopiku,"When he is healthy and active I would also rank him in the top five. But he might be the only one I put up there.

And again, I said arguably - which doesn't imply 100% certainty, but just an arguments chance.

For reference, this is my personal ranking:

1. Mahomes
2. Burrow
3. Allen
4. Hurts
5. Lawrence

Now, I want you to know this: I personally don't put as heavy a weight on running stats. many rate Hurts above Allen and Burrow, while they both have higher pass yard per game and TDs - though more INTs as well. Hurts does a good job protecting the ball for how often he runs.

So lets see how an argument could be made to not include Hurts in the top 5:

There are also a lot of people who might consider the talent surrounding the QBs when making the rankings. With Mahomes we have gotten to see this year that he can play with much less talent at WR and still put up the great numbers, which is why for me he is solidified as the #1 QB.

For Hurts, he currently has two of the top 10 WRs in the league on his team in AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith and a very good TE in Goedert. Last season, before picking up AJ Brown, Hurts had a QBR of 87.2. This year, with AJ Brown, his QBR is now 101.5 and he has made jumps in completion percentage, yards... everything.

How much of that is on Hurts improving in year 3 (2.5? He didn't start much in 2020)? How much of it is him having an incredible cast of characters around him? How much would his stats lower if he had no true star WR, instead of 2? Say he had the Jags WR room. Now, I love Kirk/Zay/Engram - but Kirk/Zay are not Brown/Smith at their current level.

And then, consider if I didn't put a huge weight on running stats. Maybe I believe that running as much as Hurts does makes him more dangerous, as he has a greater chance to be injured - thus he may drop a bit simply from that.

Again - I'm not making this argument because I believe he doesn't deserve to be top 5 - but just to prove that the argument COULD be made.",5.0,jaguars,t3_10oa11f,False,0.0,:JAX0:,2023-01-29T13:22:03Z,jaguars,-0.0246269352333516

In the first half of the season, up to and including the KC game, he was 14/18 for 77% FG percentage, with 1 missed extra point. In the back half of the season, including playoffs, he was 19/20 for 95% with the only miss being that one in the Meadowlands.

With the improvement in the second half of the season, he was middle of the pack at 85% for 17th best FG percentage.  


He also had issues on kickoffs, which he needs to work on. 

Next year, if he can keep up the form he had in the back half of the season, he's obviously going to be worth keeping. But he could easily regress, so you want to protect against that.

This was a lot tougher to make though because centering the Jags video around the Jocko willink speech made things easier.  I pulled all the Bengals vs Chiefs clips I could find from both Chiefs and Bengals official YouTube pages.  Lots of great stuff to pull from although the Chiefs media team should get more b-roll shots and longer takes of the stadium cause those were very tough to find.  Again, last weeks video was a breeze, the Jaguars media team is phenomenal and they obviously have a couple true Cinematographers on staff

Music came from soundstripe and I blended two parts of a song together so it wasn't a 3 minute long video.  I searched all over the web for some motivational speech quotes and movie quotes but couldn't find anything I liked that fit the bill so I did my best to do my own VO time around.  No Jocko Willink but it came out pretty good I think.
