FOH with that.  Romo did shoulder the team and carry them for years, but during those years he was called an inconsistent gunslinger who doesn't have the clutch factor and chokes in big moments and big games.  Threw a ton of picks down the stretch late in games.

Now in hindsight it's recognized that he was a very clutch qb who made something out of nothing over and over again... but don't pretend he was a ""pass the eye test"" guy while he was playing.

If you remove Romo's first two years because he didn't play, and counted his first 7 years as our QB, he threw 93 ints... Dak has 65.  And for whatever it's worth, Peyton Manning had 120 in his first 7 years.

It's all recency bias.  We remember Dak's picks a lot more because they happened last week.
