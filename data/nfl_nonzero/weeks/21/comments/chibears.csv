McGary also has heart problems. Jawaan Taylor is a good pass blocking RT but is literally the worst run blocker in the NFL. Would much rather see Braxton at one of the tackle spots than any of these guys (if we traded for Tunsil) 

Big fan of double dipping in the IDL in free agency. It’s a solid class for it. Our d-line needs so much talent. Adding Hargrave + Payne + Carter at 4 overall immediately makes our d-line a top half of the league unit.

I mean, I guess on the other side of things, at the end of the day, every player has a price except maybe Mahomes/Burrow, someone like that.  So if a team was willing to give up heaven and earth for Fields, maybe the Bears consider it.  I just think the price for Fields in a trade would be extremely high given the ramifications and basically then having to roll the dice with a rookie QB and not receive whatever compensation would be gained from trading #1, and I can't imagine another team being willing to give up that compensation as opposed to what it would cost for them to get the #1 pick.",0.0,chibears,t3_10mu2u4,False,0.0,Kyle Long,2023-01-27T15:27:58Z,chibears,0.13424921875
19708,89237,89237,Hooze,"OP, I give you props for having the balls to post this considering the negative feedback you're receiving/going to receive, but I do think the answer to if Fields would net more value than trading the #1 pick is no.

There's a lot of negative consequences that would occur if the Bears did trade him which I think affects the value he's worth to the Bears as opposed to other teams.  For starters, he's the leader and star of the team, on a team that has basically zero other potential superstars, and players in the Bears locker room would be really unhappy if he was traded.  He's also already well-regarded around the league, and it might even be a red flag to free agents for coming to Chicago.  Plus, fans would be pissed.  On top of all that, the next QB would be put in an extremely difficult situation where not only do they have to live up to #1 pick standards, but they would have to be better than Fields to justify the trade.  Poles, and probably ownership, would also take a ton of shit if they traded Fields.  Like, career-defining shit.  It's maybe good content for media people trying to give a hot take and generate content, or clown Twitter fans from other teams who haven't watched or followed Fields and base their opinion on passing yards alone, but it's nonsense as a real-life possibility.",0.0,chibears,t3_10mu2u4,False,0.0,Kyle Long,2023-01-27T15:14:56Z,chibears,-0.0570348919021678

4. Then the refs realized they fucked and rewound back to the 3rd down to give the Cougs an extra redo attempt.

What Tom Brady actually said, and it's even in the article:

“Injuries play a role in every game,” Brady told Jim Gray, “and your margin of error changes quite a bit. Obviously San Fran had, you know, really no chance to compete yesterday. That was tough just to see that happen, but at the same time, it’s the reality of the sport. Philly deserved it. They had an incredible season. They played well on defense. They forced that pass and the injury to Brock [Purdy] there on his wrist or his elbow.

“It’s truly part of the sport. It’s a contact sport, and that’s why it’s a demolition derby. And that’s why, you know, all these games are somewhat unpredictable. You go to the Super Bowl, Patrick [Mahomes has] had a sprained ankle, Jalen [Hurts has] had a hurt shoulder. Anything can happen in the first quarter of the game, and of course it’s going to affect the outcome.

Absolutely, and there are a ton of D linemen available in FA this year. Why waste a draft pick instead of using some of that cap?

Because accruing future firsts gives you options in future drafts and none of the players at the top of this draft are all that special. If the bears actually build an offense and Fields doesn’t progress, future firsts help give you the ammo to go after a QB in the future, and if he does progress you still have options.

Anderson is a premium position. You can grab a dozen good vets in free agency for defensive tackle. It’s not a premium position.

Yes. Did you watch our offense? Fields literally got sacked at a historic rate, especially when you consider that the bears had the fewest pass attempts by any team in a long ass time. As bad as the defense was, the passing game was far far worse. I don’t want to see Fields have his career ruined from constantly getting wrecked thanks to a line that can’t pass protect and WRs who can’t get open.

Aaron has made 305 in 18 seasons. Aaron constantly has been one of, if not the highest paid QB. Packers have always been competitive, but only eclipsed the mountain 1 time, vs Brady as his 7.

Hurts carves up their defense amazingly well in the intermediate passing game. Goedert leads the team with 2 receiving touchdowns. Neither team really gets momentum running the ball, which impacts the 49ers far worse than it does the eagles. 3 different eagles pass catchers finish with 7+ catches. Purdy gets sacked 3 times by Haason Reddick and is abused all day. Plays adequately at first but crumbles late into the game. Deebo is a complete nonfactor. Eagles cruise past. Score is less indicative of competitiveness due to a garbage time TD from SF, which is their only points in the second half.

Chiefs 40-38 Bengals 

Absolute chippy shootout. Multiple fights break out. Mahomes and burrow take turns tossing absolute potshots back and forth. Defense still makes plays in the game despite the high score. This game is kind of like Chiefs Rams game from 2017. Probably gonna be a better game than the Super Bowl ends up being. Quieter first half, 2nd half really kicks into overdrive start of the 3rd quarter. Two 80+ yard touchdowns occur. Bengals almost get in range to set up a GW field goal but come up short kinda like in the SB. At some point the Chiefs do a crazy trick play that is executed perfectly to gain like 4 yards lol. Ja’Marr finishes with 200+ again. Mixon 3TD but with like a 21 for 59 stat line. Mahomes ankle injury is a complete nonfactor.",1.0,nfl,t3_10mlu1q,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2023-01-29T02:23:18Z,chibears,-0.0181172987954061

It’s only important because I see a lot of people mentioning that a team like the Commanders can’t afford Payne because they only have $3 mil in cap space. 

But it looks like they can get to $47 mil with simple restructures that won’t hamper their future too much. Idk if the Bears will restructure guys like Cody Whitehair or Eddie Jackson, which are our biggest contracts, so it’s more likely we’re closer to that effective cap space number. 

Of course, we have a lot closer to $105 mil to $110 mil because we have so many future contracts at $1 mil each from players unlikely to make our 53, which is a huge reason our effective cap is so much lower than expected (not due to our draft class, it’s like a $15 mil difference from futures contracts and a $2-3 mil difference bc of us having the 1st overall pick).
