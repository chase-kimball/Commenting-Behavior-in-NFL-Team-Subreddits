662,1246,1246,0le_Hickory,"I feel bad for Ossai because Mahomes entire game is an exploit of the QB rules. No one in the 80-90s is underhand flipping the ball in the grasp. No, defenders had already murdered the QB at that point in the sack then. Basically, Mahomes is the best at making something happen in the second when he knows he is caught and the defender slowing up to not get a penalty. 

So… season on the line Mahomes is running down the sideline. You let up… Tony Romo orgasms ‘Jim, he just faked out the defense. So smart another 10 yards. Brilliant. That’s probably the game.’  

That is playing in Ossai’s mind. Don’t let up. He’s a tricky one. He probably sees that he’s out of bounds now but Ossai is big and momentum cannot stop now. An excuse me hand on the back. Trying to stop Ossai’s momentum before he crashes into the bench.  Yellow flags.

1795,18429,18429,Bieber_hole_69,"Okay, so Kleiman, (as usual lol,) is not providing any new information and is just repeating what somebody else said? From a Dr. that is *not* performing the surgery on Purdy and has *not* interacted with him?

The assumption based on prior reports from **actual** reporters, Kleiman of which is not, was that Purdy may not need full Tommy John surgery and his camp was posturing like that's the case they've heard so far.

Here's a quote from Purdy himself:

[*“I’ve heard multiple things,” Purdy said. “I think in that scenario that would be six months ready to go. I think in that scenario they said after three months, you can start throwing and getting into a throwing program and getting into a routine. I think six months would be like when you’re allowed to just go and practice and be part of everything. That’s a scenario, but I definitely have some other options, too. So definitely going to go through these MRI scans and make a decision, hopefully soon.”*](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2023/01/31/brock-purdy-weighing-options-on-his-elbow-hopes-to-make-a-decision-soon/)

We do not know definitely what repair Purdy needs or will get, and what his timeframe for recovery is. Report was he is [actively seeking second opinions](https://www.ninersnation.com/2023/1/30/23578648/49ers-brock-purdy-ucl-6-months) and the hope is he can have a similar window to return as Nick Mullens did and could be back for the regular season.

Kleiman repeated speculation from someone else and it's treated as if he got a scoop from somebody actually in the know and not just a Dr. speculating who has no actual insight into Purdy's current condition. Maybe he does miss the whole season or maybe he doesn't. Who knows? We don't, Kleiman doesn't, and Dr. Adickens doesn't either.

I am also pro-grass, but sometimes it is legitimately not feasible. And it’s not just a money thing sometimes, it’s likely going to cost the Titans more to install this turf than it would cost to just keep the grass.

Every year players constantly slip and get hurt on the grass at Nissan Stadium and people complain. Now that they try to remedy it, people also complain lmao.

They have completely re-sodded the field in December/November in recent seasons and it hasn’t fixed the issue. Five minutes of rainfall and it was back to being a slip-and-slide.

Titans are the most injured team in the league two years in a row, they think this might finally fix it.

Edit: Here's a quote from the team on the matter from a different article:

*""The move is spurred by NFL studies showing the team's natural surface may have contributed to more lower-body injuries from 2018-2021 than the six NFL venues that use the sort of monofilament fields the team will now turn to.""*

I implore anyone that thinks grass is always better than turf to watch some highlights of Titans home games in November and December, in particular games where it's cold and raining.

It is just too difficult to keep grass playable in Nashville. And with the amount of events/games that are played on that field it's always going to be beat to shit by December when the weather starts to really turn.

This is probably a move in the right direction, as en vogue as natural grass has recently become around the league and with fans.

I think the Jags overpaid for Kirk, but that doesn't also mean Woods is anywhere near the same class as Kirk now. Kirk is a way better player and is worth way more. Kirk played like a bonafide WR1 last year while Woods played more like a WR3 on an actually competitive offense.

You cannot be a competitive team and try to upgrade at WR and elsewhere when $12M that could be freed up is still tied up in an over-the-hill Robert Woods. Hell, we need that money just to get under the cap and sign our rookies, so he's a no-brainer cut in March.

You can get the production we got from Woods out of a 2nd or 3rd round pick. In fact, three of the five WRs taken in the 2nd round of the 2022 draft had more yards than Woods, and Romeo Doubs as a 4th round pick that only started seven games had only 102 less yards than Woods.

As such, you can in theory replace him with even an 2nd round talent like a Derick Hall (who's tape honestly looks identical to dupree) or Nolan smith (who imo looks better than dupree imo) and get a very comparable edge guy if we did drop Dupree. Also the dead cap hit is less relevant next year if we delay the cut to post june 1st... you are correct it is bad around $11 million BUT with the cap increase this year likely to carry or increase next year, and with as much cap space as we have its a hit we can take then and get if off our books... especially if we go cheap at QB and do a rebuild as some are expecting.",2.0,tennesseetitans,t3_10pmvwh,False,0.0,"""BIG Jeff"" Simmons",2023-01-31T13:34:58Z,tennesseetitans,0.1064037037037036

He's already said if he's cut he plans to retire (he has no interest playing for another team), furthermore there are reports he's lost a lot of weight over the season/start of the off season and doesn't appear to be keeping in NFL level shape. The thought process is he may be done and desire to pursue his podcast career. (which is why he has no interest playing for another team he can make a fine living without getting hurt every week).

IE your perceived value of him hitting the open market is irrelevant if even half of the above remains true.

>Cutting him doesn’t make the positon group better

Correct, you don't just cut him and then just have an empty spot on the field... you replace him with a long term solution. Paris Johnson would be an excellent choice. Alternatively taking Dawand Jones in the 2nd (or late 1st if we trade back) could be an equally good long term solution. As long as whoever we get to replace him is on the field and even slightly better than Daley... we've improved at the position group, and done so at a far cheaper price point overall.

This is ""better"" because having a player that isn't available half the year and takes several games to not play like ass at the start of each season (optimistically) is essentially worthless at best and an active hinderance to the team at worse (depending on cap space and what you may have given up to keep him on the roster).

I mean i get ya about the trenches but that isn't always true that they win Superbowls. Building the two takes multiple years not just a single draft .  In our case it's probably best to go OT and Center this draft and our Dline isn't our problem in anyway it's the secondary. We are probably drafting and Edge anyway since we are likely cutting Bud. 


Carr would definitely be a lateral move and I haven't seen a post for that except once. Also yes we saw what Tannehill can do in the post season and it's nothing. I mean he's been fine during the regular season, but we need to take our homer glasses off and look at the QB situation for what it is. Tannehill can sustain us but he's not going to elevate us.

But that is like asking if Tannehill is worth top 5 QB money. 

Obviously no. 

But we don't live in a vacuum. The issue is that we need to replace him for less than the money saved OR have a massive production spike if we pay more. 

The list of FAs is not appealing at all basically.

37276,197955,197955,daoogilymoogily,"1. I completely and utterly disagree with your first point; we’ve had three different coordinators and three different schemes under Vrabel.

2. Your second point is ridiculous, that’s not how good drafting works, you don’t ignore the BPA and pick based on position. For instance this is not a good draft for OT, if Paris Johnson is off the board there is no other OT worth taking over one of the top three WRs (Idt Skoronski plays OT in the NFL). And just think, one of our best DL is an undrafted free agent. So why just use picks based on position? It’s asinine.

3. I completely agree about Carr, besides the fact that it’s clear we want a mobile QB and Carr is less mobile than Tanne (who is fairly mobile tbf)

4. Nobody wants Henry gone, but it might be for the best to spend his money on a position other than RB. He’ll go down as one of our greats either way, but I think it really depends on who we get as OC. If it’s one of these guys who runs a spread option then yes, definitely keep him. If it’s a Shanahan disciple who can get a rolling office chair 1k yards in a season, then we should probably move on from him.
