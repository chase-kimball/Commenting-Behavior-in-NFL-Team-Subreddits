6435,77060,77060,Kimber80,"I think Montana's regular season stats were, for his time, better than Brady's. Not in terms of volume, Brady played far longer, but in terms of efficiency. IMO Montana's passer rating is better than Brady's, when we consider the eras that they played.

And, Montana actually improved in the playoffs - his PR was better in the playoffs than during the season. Brady, for all his clutch reputation, was considerably worse in the playoffs. Montana's playoff PR is six points better than Brady's, despite playing in IMO a much tougher era to throw the ball.

Also, Montana had Rice, but Brady had Randy Moss and Gronk for chunks of his career, arguably the two most talented WR and TE ever. And Montana won a SB with maybe the worst collection of offensive talent ever, in 1981.

To me, when I look at what makes Brady the greatest, it's basically stuff he did after Montana retired. Montana was better for the first 14-15 years of their respective careers, but Brady, to his great credit of course, and thanks to improvements in nutrition and training, was able to keep going for 7 or so more years, piling up more stats and more titles. As IIRC he said he was going to do to Manning in one of those deflategate emails, he burined all his GOAT competitors by outlasting them.
