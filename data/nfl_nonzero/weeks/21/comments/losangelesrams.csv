6435,77060,77060,Kimber80,"I think Montana's regular season stats were, for his time, better than Brady's. Not in terms of volume, Brady played far longer, but in terms of efficiency. IMO Montana's passer rating is better than Brady's, when we consider the eras that they played.

And, Montana actually improved in the playoffs - his PR was better in the playoffs than during the season. Brady, for all his clutch reputation, was considerably worse in the playoffs. Montana's playoff PR is six points better than Brady's, despite playing in IMO a much tougher era to throw the ball.

Also, Montana had Rice, but Brady had Randy Moss and Gronk for chunks of his career, arguably the two most talented WR and TE ever. And Montana won a SB with maybe the worst collection of offensive talent ever, in 1981.

To me, when I look at what makes Brady the greatest, it's basically stuff he did after Montana retired. Montana was better for the first 14-15 years of their respective careers, but Brady, to his great credit of course, and thanks to improvements in nutrition and training, was able to keep going for 7 or so more years, piling up more stats and more titles. As IIRC he said he was going to do to Manning in one of those deflategate emails, he burined all his GOAT competitors by outlasting them.

Imagine using that rationale if that was AD99. You don't leave a scrub TE2 alone on an island to block AD99. That's not even controversial. Anyone who did that would be blasted for hanging their QB out to dry.  

Reddick isn't the player/name brand that AD99 is, but he's having an AD99esque DPOY worthy season.

Shanny offenses fuck, and he knows it, but he’s so confident in them he doesn’t care who his opponent, he just lines up his guys and plays his game.

In the Super Bowl, you’re up 28-3 in the 3rd, playing against the GOAT. Run thr rock to drain the clock and keep the ball out of his hands as much as possible, right? Nope, Shanny only calls 5 run plays to close out the game. 

Last weekend, you’re going up against a pass rusher who’s having a DPOY year, you got to scheme against a guy like that right? Wrong, Shanny doesn’t give a fuck. He just runs his shit and puts a backup TE one on one with arguably the best pass rusher in the game this season. He doesn’t care.

With respect to situational awareness, you see a receiver catch a contested ball and he immediately pops up screaming for his offense to hurry up to the line…that’s sus as fuck, call a time out at the very least.

As a Georgia fan, I just watched my HC call a time out in the Peach Bowl because the punt formation didn’t look right and that timeout totally flipped the game. Shanny holds on to his time outs like he’s going to redeem them for prizes at the end of the game like he’s at Dave & Busters.
