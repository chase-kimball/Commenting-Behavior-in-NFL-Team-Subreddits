But do we have Andy Reid or Brian Daboll? No. We do not have the talent to help bring out the best in a young, raw but talented QB. We need someone with as many practical traits as possible. The ability to read a defense, go through his progressions, make the throws he needs to make, and improvise when necessary. That’s where Stroud and Young separate themselves from Levis and Richardson. They have the fundamentals. They make their reads and make the throw a vast majority of the time. Maybe Stroud can’t bomb a pass 65 yards down the field, but if he makes the right reads, most of the time he won’t have to. If we had Andy Reid, Bruce Arians, or any other elite QB whisperer, I would say let’s go for it. But the likelihood is that we’re going to end up with an HC from the opposite side of the ball.
