15904,164268,164268,hogaway,"In 2021, he was drafted at 4, becoming the highest drafted TE ever. At 6'6 250, he ran a 4.4 40 dash, earning the nickname 'the Unicorn'. Became the second rookie TE in NFL history to surpass 1000 yards. Made it to the Pro Bowl. He had a rough season last year due to a mix of poor play calling, chemistry with Mariota, and lack of effort on routes not immediately going to him. He got a knee injury and only played 10 games.

He has fluid route running and quick after the catch. Good hands and he's a fucking albatross. He's an underrated blocker--no Kittle, but he's not a liability and does a lot despite his frame. Great character--he seems quiet but a leader by example. Overall, he has the potential to be the best TE in the league, but it's a case of putting him in positions to succeed and him improving his effort when he's not immediately getting the ball.

Highly recommend watching his [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDFisPo_No); when he gets targets he's really fun to watch.

19533,215777,215777,ueeediot,"From the Colts perspective, If the Cardinals could take Young and Stroud off the board at the same time, then this would make sense.

So let's say the first 4 picks are Anderson, Stroud, Young, and Carter.  Who needs what?

If the Bears are open to trading the pick, then they aren't taking a QB.  Which is not a need for them and if they took one, it would create a big rukus in Chicago.  Yes, Fields hasnt been great, but putting Young or Stroud in the room, it would harm his development.  Fields deserves another year of development before passing judgment.  Opposite view: they want Stroud or Young and are willing to turn around and trade Fields (this throws a wrench at things) but then why trade the pick?

If CHI actually does want to trade the pick then they aren't taking a QB, AT 1, and they arent taking one at 2 either.  So Anderson or Carter is off the board.

So, if I am TX, why do I need to trade with them?  I can stay at 2 and get the QB I want and if CHI surprises me, I still get Stroud.

Now, at 4, if I want a QB, which I desperately need, I only need to worry about TX and AZ.   AZ is tied to K Murray, even though he is injured.  It makes more sense that they sign a FA QB and take Anderson or Carter.

So, now, at 4, unless CHI surprises everyone, I still get Stroud, or the remaining of either Anderson or Carter, without losing my draft capital, and I can still go sign a vet QB.

19534,215778,215778,ueeediot,"Why?

At 2, the Texans can get a franchise player.  Who are the Bears taking that the Texans are locked in on?

The Texans want a QB, right?  Are the Bears expected to take a QB?

Why doesn't TX just keep their draft capital and take the next best QB?  They wouldn't be wrong to do this.

So. What really is going on here?

Is it possible, at all, that the Bears GM is putting out this trash so the Colts will think they need to pay more to get to 1 than they really do?

The Colts definitely want Bryce Young, because if they wanted Stroud, they can probably get him at 4, unless AZ takes him, which wouldnt be a bad idea, but it would be smarter of them to take J Carter or W Anderson and sign Jimmy G or Jacoby B.

So, sitting at 4, you will have a choice to get a high-quality player, and there are enough quality free agents Matt Ryan can back up.

Tl;dr: The Bears are not getting the trade traffic and offers they were expecting, so they put this propaganda into the universe.",0.0,nfl,t3_10njrfj,False,1.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-28T12:58:40Z,falcons,-0.0202475584708831
