Second of all, we didn't need to pass you dumb dumb. Why would we risk throwing the ball when the game was effectively over with 7 minutes left in the first quarter? We only passed 25 times. We rushed 44 times. If you can do math, which I suspect you can't, that's 63.8% rush. Conversely, the 49ers with their injuries to the QBs, rushed 57.1% of the time.

It's amazing morons like you can't acknowledge that we knocked their QB out because our DL was very good. We had 70 sacks this season; the Chiefs were second and had 55. The team's previous record was 62. 70 sacks is the third most in NFL history and only the 2006 San Diego Chargers, with 61.0, and the 2000 New Orleans Saints, with 66, have had more than 60 sacks in a season since the turn of the century.

Coming off the Vikings win, everyone was saying how Daboll was the COTY and Jones had turned into a good QB. Then we ass blasted them and we got ""lucky"".

Shanahan is also in the COTY running. This fantastic scheme he has put together led him to put a TE against our Pro Bowl DE coming off a great year that led to their QB getting hurt.

The Eagles wore down the vaunted SF run defense when it was clear that Hurts was off target and slightly missing opening receivers that could have made the rout even worse.

On the Smith ""catch"" he should have thrown the challenge flag. Yes, everyone (even the guy covering Smith) thought it was a catch. We needed a specific camera angle, zoomed in, in slow-motion to see that it wasn't a catch, so I don't fault the refs for their initial call. But the way Smith signaled and hurried? Hello!? McFly! On 4th and 3 you throw that red flag. Best case? Catch overturned and loss on downs. Worst case? You lose a timeout that should have been used anyway so you could substitute your defense for an effective red zone stand.

Not throwing the challenge flag was a boneheaded call on Shanahan's part.

The second one? Not scheming to block Hassan Reddick. He's an elite edge rusher who was 2nd in the NFL in sacks. And the 49ers repeatedly set their backup TE one-on-one with him. The result? Through one and a half quarters, he had 2 sacks (both knocking out a QB from the game), a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery. Blocking him keeps Purdy upright, prevents two turnovers, and takes 14 points off the board.

Shanahan's mistakes above fronted the Eagles 21 points and killed the 49ers offense. He choked. He lost this game for the 49ers.

Shanahan again. If we had chosen to block Bosa with a backup tight end, Jalen Hurts would have taken some hits. Obviously, our coaches wouldn’t do that. 

Hassan Reddick was #2 in sacks. And for some reason Shanahan thought it was a good idea to block him 1-on-1 with a backup tight end. It didn’t work, and Purdy got hurt.

It's just nowhere near as egregious as Bengals' fans made it out to be, and it's totally understandable for it to fall into the realm of a judgment call or be missed entirely. It's also very brief, where I had to pause what was already a slow-mo replay in order to see it.

To me, this outcry is like the outcry over the non-catch in the Eagles game. From every initial angle it looked like a catch. We didn't know for sure that it wasn't a catch until the replay AFTER the commercial break following the TD and XP. In fact, even the defender covering Smith thought it was a catch, so he didn't motion for his coach to challenge.

15397,130555,130555,OverlyOptimisticNerd,"Brady is a bad example of a QB on a mega deal. He usually took a smaller contract to help the team remain competitive. He was typically in the 10-15 range in terms of average annual value relative to other QBs. He'd break the top 10 on a new deal, and that would quickly subside as other QBs signed their details.

https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/tom-bradys-patriots-contracts-through-years

Examples:

* In 2005 he took a 6 year, $60M deal, while Manning was already playing through a 7 year, $98M deal. Not listed, Donovan McNabb was either on the verge of or had recently signed his $100M+ deal.
* His 2010 deal of 4 years for $72M was, thanks to its guaranteed amount, the largest contract in history. It didn't last long (they rarely do).
* In 2013 he signed an absurdly weak contract to give the Patriots room to compete for a few years - 3 years for $27M (extension of current contract). Counting the remaining current contract, it was actually worth $57M over 5 years, which was still CHEAP.
* 2016 saw a 2-year $41M extension, which was still team friendly.
* And in 2019 he signed a 1-year extension worth $23M, right after Kirk got his fully guaranteed ~$30M annual contract.

Aside from one contract, Brady's deals have been beyond team friendly. He's the poster child for what OP is suggesting, and it played a large role in his accomplishments.",291.0,nfl,t3_10nklp6,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-01-28T14:29:52Z,eagles,0.0269013022917522
15398,130556,130556,OverlyOptimisticNerd,"It used to be that a QB taken in the first round could get a monster contract. Sam Bradford was the last to do that before the new CBA took effect, and now the contract is pretty much based on draft slot. And if you're taken in the first round, it means you can be held on a 5th year option at a good but not great salary.

With the average draft age at 22, these guys don't get their first year of a big contract until age 27. As a result, they want to cash in (current trend is $40M-$50M annually for 5 years). That puts them up to age 32 where Veterans who haven't won a SB suddenly become more agreeable to pay restructures to allow for additional FA help.

The current big contract craze following their rookie deal is a direct response to the lack of a big contract coming out of college. It's an over-correction, essentially.

As an Eagles fan, I look at Jalen Hurts as an example. He was taken in the second round so, luckily for him, no 5th year option. However, his first 4 years with all earned incentives will put him at just shy of $9M earned. And nearly half of that comes in year 4. Through 3 years he's earned $2,576,616 (base salary) + $1,941,944 (signing bonus, paid up front) + $75,000 (workout bonus) = $4,593,560.

That makes him arguably the second best value in the entire NFL (see [Brock Purdy](https://overthecap.com/player/brock-purdy/10307)). He's going to expect a mega deal for years 5-9, most likely.

If the Eagles win the SB this year, Hurts is getting the mega deal to the tune of ~$50M annually. However, if they do not, I suspect that Howie will try to convince him to shave off some of that to allow for more room for free agents to help him. I see a floor of $38M annually, but more likely $44M-$45M annually and HEAVILY backloaded.",2.0,nfl,t3_10nklp6,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-01-28T14:15:01Z,eagles,0.0027361345757095

NFL is littered with some very sad careers. Wentz played well enough to get 2 teams into the playoffs, and many of us who were big Wentz fans believe that that dirty hit actually did damage his brain to where he no longer could function at the highest level needed to be an NFL QB.

There was a play late in the 2020 season, where the design of the play was absolutely masterful. Play action to the left with a bootleg to the right, and a WR crossing the middle of the field right in front of the QB's face. On the play, the WR, Greg Ward, was more wide open than I have ever seen an NFL WR on a crossing pattern. The defense was completely fooled, it was maybe the easiest read ever.

Wentz stops his feet, then looks completely across the opposite way across the field, throws to a very tightly covered WR, almost gets picked, falls for an incomplete.

Right there I knew he was done. That isn't just someone who can't make a read, or who can't throw the ball, or who has lost a step. That's someone who has completely and totally forgotten how to play football. Most 7 year olds could have made that throw.

I feel for the guy because he was so good as a rookie, and head injuries are just shitty. But that's what it is. Honestly I hope he retires because I am convinced his brain is scrambled and I don't want him or his family to have to suffer through greater amounts of CTE than he already likely has.",2.0,nfl,t3_10ntadv,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-01-29T06:51:47Z,eagles,0.0499440713005414

Lurie feels the QB position is the most valuable in sports, and therefore he always wants resources devoted to that position. If you have a starter, then you find and/or develop a second one.

This philosophy won us a Superbowl and it's generated massive value on trades and having backups win huge games multiple times.

This goes back to the bedrock economic concept of scarcity. When you identify a high demand extremely limited supply asset you want to aquire it for cheap whenever possible. Those assets don't lose value. The price of a quality QB is always high and they always bring value.

That's how the Eagles operate. Unlike most of the league, they don't see their QB position is ""set"" once they have a franchise guy. They keep trying to find a second starter.

26563,245736,245736,devonta_smith,"> Lamar Jackson had a passer rating of 113.3 with 3,127 yards, 36 touchdowns and 6 interceptions in 15 games in 2019.

And Carson Wentz had a passer rating of 101.9 with 3,296 yards, 33 touchdowns and 7 interceptions in 13 games in 2017. 

(Since we're recapping stats from guys who peaked in year 2, numbers that have zero bearing on the current NFL in January 2023... )

Wentz topped the 100 mark (102.2) again the next year after breaking out, 2020 Lamar almost did too (99.3). Neither has come particularly close since (Lamar 87.0, 91.1 - Wentz 93.1, 72.8 [lmao], 94.6, 80.2).


Wentz in Indy had a 94.6 rating and was memed to death as a washed-up has-been (which he is). He was singled out as THE reason Indy missed the playoffs and is, to this day, a punchline. But we're supposed to just assume that a guy fresh off a worse passer rating than that is on the same level as Hurts, who just took the biggest developmental leap any of us had ever seen outside of Josh Allen... ?

My question: 

With that context, why is it so controversial to say that Lamar isn't as good a passer as the [guy that's been doing stuff like this all season? ](https://redd.it/10pix3t)

ETA - I'm not here to defend Wentz or trash Lamar. But I predict this sub is going to do a 180 on LJ over the next 12-18 months...

If nothing else, it's disrespectful to Jalen to just outright assume that LJ can do what he's done, which I'll remind everyone was considered ""impossible"" until he went out and followed in Allen's footsteps of nearly-unprecedented development as a passer. Lamar has more arm talent, no question.

Lmk when Hollywood plays a pivotal role on multiple Super Bowl-winning teams. We'll even keep the discussion to on-field only, it wouldn't be fair to Hollywood otherwise. 

Torrey Smith thru 4 seasons: 213 catches for 3591 yards, 30 TDs, 1 Super Bowl ring, 1 iconic MNF game 

Hollywood Brown thru 4 seasons: 262 catches for 3070 yards, 24 TDs, most notable for being Antonio Brown's cousin 


Torrey was a WR 2 or 3 for that time, whereas Hollywood was the clear #1 WR outside of the 6 games DHop played to end this season.

Kelce came back for another year and looks better than ever. He even got his own podcast started with his brother, which is amazing for him and all of us. Lane is still fighting the good fight. Mailata can be a grizzly bear or a teddy bear depending on if he’s on the field or not and it’s freaking awesome. Cox and BG are going out with a hell of a bang. Sanders has been through some rough years with the team, but now he looks like he’s having the time of his life. AJ and Slay have been hilarious in press conferences all season. Whatever swagger is, CJGJ has it. It feels like Skinny Batman doesn’t say much- he lets his games do the talking.

And of course…there is Jalen. He is HIM. The dude is cooler than a fucking ice cube. Vein temperature of absolute zero. Forget Mahomes, forget Burrow, all of them. There is no one else in the *entire world* I would rather have as my team’s quarterback. Remember all his doubters preseason? Many of whom were fans of this team?

It's pretty damn remarkable how the Browns franchise miraculously lost all its sympathy in rapid a 2 step process:

1) After decades of trash tier, they draft Baker, have one mediocre year, then immediately proclaim themselves super bowl contenders. The entire rest of the NFL was rightfully annoyed at how far you had gotten ahead of yourselves & were underrating how difficult reaching a SB is (when you would think they should understand that the best).

3) I know its not recent, but it wasnt until the late 2000s that teams stopped thinking of RB as being a premium position that required elite talent. 'Disposable RBs' is a relatively new thing, the first 50 years of American football held RBs on a pedestal not far below QBs. The rookie wage scale definitely had something to do with this.

37934,347268,347268,tag1550,"The one thing I don't get at all is Shanahan saying in his postgame presser, when asked about running plays out of the wildcat in the 2nd half, that ""yeah, we had those plays and thought about calling them, but couldn't sustain drives long enough to use them."" I don't think it would have saved them, but McCaffery looked like he had plenty of arm, if not great accuracy, on the one pass he tried. At the very least the wildcat would have given them an extra RB to help out blocking on the runs & maybe threatened the safeties enough to get them to not crowd the line as much. I get that they probably hadn't practiced it much all season, but at some point, since its already desperation time, don't you have to just give wildcat a shot? 

Will say, 49ers actually had decent success running the ball in the 2nd half even with everyone knowing that's all they were capable of doing on offense.
