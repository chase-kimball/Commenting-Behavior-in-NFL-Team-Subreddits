13924,75180,75180,Ephan,"An actually reasonable mock for the lions, unsurprising since Nick is on the lions beat and actually understands the needs. 

For those without a subscription:

6: Tyree Wilson, Edge

15: Devon Witherspoon, CB (trade 15 for 18+48)

55: Mazi Smith, DT

His blurb on the Tyree pick is interesting: 

""Detroit’s in a weird spot and probably wants some equally weird stuff to happen in the top five, so that either Carter or Anderson falls to No. 6. The Lions could take a cornerback here, but I’m not sure Christian Gonzalez is defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn’s cup of tea. Are the other corners worthy of this spot? Tyree Wilson’s length, agility and motor made him one of the most productive pass rushers in America last season. Pro Football Focus actually had him graded slightly higher than Anderson in its pass-rushing productivity stat (albeit on fewer attempts).""

Ideally trade down or Carter/Anderson slipping is best case scenario. If those don't happen, Tyree definitely makes sense since he has the versatility to play SDE and slide inside on passing downs. Would give the d line a healthy rotation of pass rushing monsters. The pick would still maintain positional value. Getting Witherspoon and Mazi too, that would be a sweet haul.",15.0,detroitlions,t3_10p5afr,False,0.0,Welcome to Detroit!,2023-01-30T09:23:46Z,detroitlions,0.0408319687165151

His performance as a DC is TBD. He took a 2021 defence that was probably considered the worst into the league heading into the season, and made it like... 29th. 32nd to 29th is an improvement, but still pretty rough.

2022 came a similar poor defensive unit but at least with guys like Hutchinson added. The defence started like, generationally bad. And then it rebounded to become one of the better units in the league for a couple weeks. Then it all balanced out.

Really it's to say, I don't think I can definitively say that Aaron Glenn is a bad DC. I can't really say he's a good DC either. It's more likely that Aaron Glenn is a HC candidate due to his personality, where this locker room LOVES him. This archetype is what got Mike Vrabel hired despite being a pretty awful DC for the Texans. Hilariously, it's also what got Dan Campbell hired for us despite not even being a coordinator.

I saw that he had been prior successful, and with a great 2nd half I went into 2022 thinking ""he could be good"".

And he was good. I've seen it statistically and visually that Jared Goff is a good QB. I don't really see any logical argument that Goff can't be a franchise QB with historical arguments too. But it just seems like people can't get Rams Jared Goff narratives out of their head. If Goff has a bad season next year, I am totally willing to change my opinion.

16oz fresh mushrooms of choice 

2 boxes of stovetop (or your favorite stuffing)

1 cup chicken stock 

1/2 cup white wine

1/2 cup sour cream

1 bulb of garlic 

Preheat your oven to 350. Mince the garlic and sauté for about two minutes on medium heat, add sliced/chopped onions and mushrooms. Cook until the moisture is gone from the mushrooms and the onions are starting to stick to the bottom. Add wine and chicken stock. Render down until the liquid is at about a quarter of a cup, remove from heat. Add soup and sour cream with salt and pepper to taste, mix throughly, set aside.

Prepare the stuffing 

Take your preferred casserole pan, chop up the raw chicken into large bit sized pieces. Line the bottom of the pan with chicken until covered. Pour soup concoction over the chicken and top with stuffing.

Bake uncovered (or cover the casserole with tinfoil if you rather not have the top crunchy) at 350 for 45 minutes.

36216,217888,217888,Wiggymaster,"That one was pretty good. Goff actually had a few like that this season. 

Here are the plays he made that impressed me the most:

[TD pass to St. Brown vs. Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HNa8IQRNw#t=1m21s). Goff was under insane pressure and had to wait for the play to develop. He had to scramble a bit to his right to evade defenders and wound up eating two of them as he threw. Kept his eyes downfield the entire time and did not flinch. He kept his feet planted until the last second and ended up throwing off his back foot on the run. The throw was a bit wobbly but still had some good speed on it and not a very steep arc for a pure arm throw on a scramble. 

[Escaping and running for a first down against Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HNa8IQRNw#t=6m55s). This was a great scramble. He straight matador'd the blitzing cornerback, Kyler Gordon, still paused a bit for a receiver to develop, then saw he had nothing but green grass infront of him and ran for the first down. He wisely dove out of bounds and drew the flag after being pushed into the bench (not clear whether or not he was really pushed that hard but if he wasn't, that's an even more heads-up saavy play on his part). 

[Red-zone TD to Chark vs. Bills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HNa8IQRNw#t=7m31). This was straight-up his most impressive throw of the year as far as I'm concerned. That was a Stafford-esque absolute laser to a receiver under fairly tight coverage. He put that ball where only Chark would have been able to get it, and he did it on a developing play that wasn't his first read. Beautiful pass. 

[Touchdown to Swift vs. the Bears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9HNa8IQRNw#t=14m07s). This was Goff basically lampooning himself. He pump fakes a screen a second after the ball is snapped and continues to drop back to more than 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage, waiting for something else to develop. I believe the screen was the likely call here and that Goff actually audibled out of it after seeing the LB on St. Brown. Needless to say Swift gets open right around the LoS and the audible got the linemen in just the right position to give him some help. Result: a play that may well have only been a 2-3 yard gain ends up going for a touchdown.",1.0,detroitlions,t3_10q3n5f,False,0.0,90s logo,2023-02-01T10:33:57Z,detroitlions,0.0351316970454751

I feel like this is where Goff and Stafford are both super similar yet different in approach. During the first four or five years of his career, Stafford would get a bit panicky under pressure, too, and try to find his safety valve and open it whether it was a true safety valve or not. Usually this meant taking a sack or throwing an interception. With Goff, the approach was to throw the ball away even though there might be a guy wide open on a route development that wasn't anticipated. Goff was too quick to dump while Stafford was too squirrely and would hold onto the ball too long. I saw Goff make some huge plays this year that obviously developed from breakdown, which shows some promise. He had quite a few hit-as-he-throws scenarios where he made a spectacular read to a receiver in space which wound up going for 10 or more yards. That's the kinda stuff Brady is a master of, and it's what I'm hoping continues to track for Goff.

36236,217912,217912,Wiggymaster,"People did this to Stafford, too. ""Stafford is only good because Calvin!"" <-- Remember this? 

People will do it to any Lions quarterback, basically. Eventually, the narrative shifted after the trade, and Stafford became ""too good"" for Detroit. He went from him being portrayed as another Phillip Rivers or Derek Carr to being portrayed as Peyton Manning, held back by a terrible team. Nevermind all the interceptions he threw. Nevermind that he really didn't start to understand defenses or become cool under pressure until the later part of the 2010s. 

Don't get me wrong - from 2016 onward, Stafford was fantastic. He started getting creative on the field. But that comes down to veteran awareness vs. his natural talent. Bear in mind that I'm not discounting Stafford's arm talent here - from that perspective, he's better than 90% of the quarterbacks in the league, including Goff. But we have to be real about him. He has the arm talent of Mahomes, but nowhere near the athleticism.  

Goff was scapegoated for a Rams team that didn't know how to move the ball without an all-pro running back. When Suh was calling Goff ""the best quarterback he ever played with"" in 2018 and the collective sports media was riding his dick along with that of McVay's, I scoffed. I saw what Goff was at the time - an efficient and accurate quarterback who had not yet developed into a true difference maker like Stafford was. That team was UTTERLY EXPOSED by Bill Belichick, and they didn't lose because of their quarterback. They lost because they were thoroughly outcoached. Bear in mind that Goff wasn't extended until AFTER that Super Bowl. 

Over the next two years, as McVay ran out of creativity for his over-85%-11-personnel-schemes, as more and more defenses caught on, the offensive line became weaker and the running back room never even came close to having someone as talented as Gurley, Goff became the convenient target. He looked more like he did in his rookie days then, panicking under pressure. The fact of the matter is that McVay's schemes were too stale for a guy like Goff to effectively run them. Rather than accept that his schemes needed to evolve and deviate from his ""genius"", McVay lamented that he didn't have a veteran quarterback like Stafford, who could audible his way out of an obvious jam that Goff hadn't yet learned to recognize. Cue the trade.

Goff has every chance of becoming an even better quarterback than Stafford. He's Tom Brady like in both efficiency and quickness to get rid of the ball when he's in a jam. This is something Stafford never did and would cause him to eat dozens of unnecessary sacks. He'd also try to do Favre-esque throws across his body off his back foot and wind up tossing pick six after pick six because of it. Most of Goff's interceptions, historically, have been on underthrown/overthrown balls or miscommunications with receivers. We're seeing less and less of this as Goff matures. Goff has improved his footwork, pocket presence and ability to make plays out of the pocket, too. Moreover, we're seeing what he can do with a REAL offensive mind, who gets creative not just with 11 personnel but with tackles as tight ends.",2.0,detroitlions,t3_10modiw,False,0.0,90s logo,2023-01-27T18:46:55Z,detroitlions,0.0002983471222338

Teams hiring head coaches have to abide by the Rooney Rule and must at least interview one or more minority candidates for positions. 

The incentive is basically “invest in your coaches and if you do a good job you will be rewarded with comp picks”. Teams have to have these coaches on staff for at least two years to get the picks, so it’s not like a team could just snag a guy like Bienemy, pay him a shit ton to be a position coach for a week, and then have him walk off to a head coaching gig and that team reap the benefits. The incentive for the hiring team is that they get a new head coach.

Those comp picks are added at the end of a round. So for an HC hire you would get two picks in the third round extra (one for that year, one for the next). A normal draft has 32 picks per round, but now with the comp picks those later rounds (3-7 I think) have comp picks added on, so guys like Kirby Joseph who was our comp pick for letting Kenny Golladay go in FA was pick 97, which would be the 33rd pick of that round.
