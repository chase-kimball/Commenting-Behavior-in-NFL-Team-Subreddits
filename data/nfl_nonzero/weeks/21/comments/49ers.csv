1. That the QB injuries for us weren't caused by bad reffing, nor were they caused by the Eagles playing dirty, they weren't. 

2. That this in no way means we should have won.

So that would correct the score to 21-7. 

1. The roughing the punter call that kept the drive alive. Mason was pushed into the punter. Sorry, that's not a penaron Mason.

The Eagles themselves run motion only about 32% of the time (the least in the NFL), while the 49ers use it 71% of the time (2nd most in the NFL after only Miami. In the rest of the Eagles division, the NFCE, Dallas uses motion 49% of the time, NYG uses it 41% of the time, and Washington uses it 56% of the time. The Eagles have also played the AFCS and NFCN, as well as the Saints, Cardinals, and Steelers. Outside of Tennessee (56%) no team is more than 50% in the AFCS. In the NFCN, all teams except Minnesota (47.5%) are between 56-60%. The Saints, Cardinals, and Steelers all use motion 44% or less.

Conversely, Shanahan offense-style teams are all heavy motion teams, with Green Bay, Miami, NYJ, San Francisco are 56%, 75%, 63%, and 71% respectively.

I think we'll be able to sign Moseley cheap due to his injury this year. A 1 year loaded with incentives.  

Assuming Brock Purdy will be good to go 100% healthy for training camp, JimmyG walks. If purdy needs surgery and will miss time into next season... We might try to 1 yr JimmyG again.  

I think we re-sign Glinch. He's a beast of a run-blocker. I know his a liability in pass protection, but we run the ball. He won't be in high-demand so I think we can get him for a reasonable price too.  

I'd love to see us keep Jauan Jennings, but he's a really talented guy that I think can pick up really good WR2 money on another team. His stats aren't there, but the talent clearly is. Crazy good hands especially on contested catches. He is crazy clutch on 3rd down. Outstanding run-blocker. I think he'll be able to get a nice contract elsewhere that we can't compete with.  But, can't we just offer him a tender that he either takes or sits the year out? I can't remember how that stuff works. He's complicated I guess.

Robbie is a wild card. Last time his contract was up, he talked a lot about going back to Chicago. I could also see him retiring. My gut tells me he will want more money to stay than we'll be able to give him.  

I know he's not on this list, but I can see a world where Trent Williams hangs it up this offseason. He is still at the top of his game, but call it a sneaking suspicion for me.   

I feel like we lose Azeez to a big payday from another team. The guy is good enough to be THE guy on some other teams in this league.  

We sign Gipson to a new deal with Ward walking. We don't have to pay him Ward money, but he's solid in that spot.

Kroft walks. Dwelley gets a new contract.    

We probably offer deals to most of the D-linemen, but nothing big, they might do better elsewhere.  

Ebukam. Man I'd like to keep that guy, but who the hell knows. He's a damn good player. I can see us losing him.",99.0,49ers,t3_10oqjr5,False,0.0,:deebo: Deebo Samuel,2023-01-29T21:23:47Z,49ers,-0.0102963885071461

One comparison I make is when all of us play Madden. We call a passing play and we prepare ourselves to make every read, not throw unless our WR is truly open, watch for lurking LBs and safeties, have a contingency plan if pass protection breaks down, etc. Still **somehow** our brain sometimes panics and we let the ball rip even though we see a LB lurking and we get picked.

P.S.

Check this quote from Crabtree on that type of play, namely the SB corner fade on last play:

 * ""Crabtree appeared to have a mature response, but he didn‚Äôt stop there. Crabtree decided to say what he believed would have helped get the call ‚Äî a better throw from his quarterback. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even want to say this, but if the ball had been a little lower, giving me a chance to make a play, I‚Äôm sure they would‚Äôve called it,‚Äù Crabtree said.""

Kaep has no skills as a pocket QB and we saw how that affected our passing game in that era. In passing situations during Kaep's reign at QB, more often than not, it was the crudest of pocket skills exhibited by Kaep. The coaches have to take the blame for having Geep Chryst as his QB coach and the power run cult, with 0 emphasis during those three/four years on working on the craft of quarterbacking.

And passing on Mahomes by Lynch/Shanahan is still a huge ding in my book. Although, only Reid and Payton actually attended his workout. But, if they had decided to build on offense first in 2017, would Kyle have attended Mahomes workout? Or would they have zeroed in on Watson?

it never ends...the speculation. But I have lived it and am none too happy with that stupid play call yesterday @7:03 1Q.
