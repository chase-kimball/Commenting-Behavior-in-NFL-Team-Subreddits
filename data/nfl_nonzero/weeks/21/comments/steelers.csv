All of this being said... the hype was too big and too fast for a guy who's passer rating was 76, good enough for second to last among starters if you even want to count Zach Wilson as a starter. 

Mason Rudolph's passer rating was 82 his first year as a starter without any preparation for him to be a starter and no possible WR1 or even a solid receiving TE (Vance McDonald was decent at best).

---|---|---|---|
December 18, 1982 | ""Maneater"" - Daryl Hall & John Oates | 4 weeks | Included the first two weeks of 1983 | 
January 15, 1983 | ""Down Under"" - Men At Work | 4 weeks | Three consecutive weeks and a fourth non-consecutive week | 
February 5, 1983 | ""Africa"" - Toto | 1 week |  |

May 28, 1983 | ""Flashdance...What A Feeling"" - Irene Cara | 6 weeks |  | 
July 9, 1983 | ""Every Breath You Take"" - The Police | 8 weeks | The #1 song of 1983 | 
September 3, 1983 | ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)"" - Eurythmics | 1 week |  |

December 10, 1983 | ""Say Say Say"" - Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson | 6 weeks | Included the first two weeks of 1984; the #1 song of 1984 | 

Note that Billboard ""chart years"" run from December-November, which is how ""Say Say Say"" ended up being the #1 song of 1984 even though four of its six weeks at #1 occurred in December 1983.

Also note that some songs with short durations at #1 spent several weeks at #2, waiting for a long-duration #1 above it to fall. ""Let's Dance"" climbed to #2 when ""Beat It"" was in its final week at #1, then spent a week at #1 before getting pushed back down to #2 for three more weeks by ""Flashdance...What A Feeling."" ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)"" spent four weeks at #2 behind ""Every Breath You Take,"" then spent a week at #1 before getting pushed back down to #2 for another week by ""Maniac.""

Some big hits never made it to #1 because of the dominance at the top. ""Electric Avenue"" by Eddy Grant climbed to #2 when ""Flashdance...What A Feeling"" was in its final week at #1, but got stuck at #2 for five weeks when ""Every Breath You Take"" jumped from #3 to #1. ""Shame On The Moon"" by Bob Seger climbed to #2 when ""Baby, Come To Me"" was in its final week at #1, but got stuck at #2 for four weeks when ""Billie Jean"" jumped from #4 to #1. ""The Girl Is Mine"" by Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson climbed to #2 when ""Maneater"" was in its final week at #1, but got stuck at #2 for three weeks when ""Down Under"" jumped from #4 to #1. ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"" by Culture Club spent three weeks at #2 behind ""Billie Jean."" ""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All"" by Air Supply spent three weeks at #2 behind ""Total Eclipse Of The Heart.""

Other big hits got stuck at #3. ""Uptown Girl"" by Billy Joel spent five weeks at #3 behind ""All Night Long (All Night)"" and ""Say Say Say."" ""Hungry Like The Wolf"" by Duran Duran spent three weeks at #3 behind ""Billie Jean"" and ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me."" ""She Works Hard For The Money"" by Donna Summer spent three weeks at #3 behind ""Every Breath You Take"" and ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)."" ""Union Of The Snake"" by Duran Duran spent three weeks at #3 behind ""Say Say Say"" and ""Say It Isn't So.""

Alualu was not a decent run stopper in 2019 and 2020. He was one of the best. Look at the Steelers defense YPC allowed with and without him during those years.

When he was healthy in 2020, the Steelers only allowed 3.8 YPC on each run play which was the third best run defense in the league. 

When he got hurt in 2021, coincidentally the Steelers run defense was ranked 31st, giving up 4.8 YPC. 

That doesn't scream ""decent run stopper"" to me. 

> DL that don't get 10+ sacks literally don't exist

Well I literally gave you an example of one, so try to get in reality. The Steelers chose to keep Tuitt and it paid off. He had 45 tackles, 11 sacks, and 25 QB hits. Which for a defensive end is a very solid stat line. In 2020 did anyone predict Tuitt would lose his brother, get injured and retire? 

So with these three as your starters, and Javon Hargrave only getting around 45% of defebsive snaps when the other three were healthy, how the hell do you justify paying him a starting deal when he doesn't even play half the snaps on defense?

Pittsburghs taking a patient approach to win which obviously sucks for fans, but our defense is better than theirs, our offense is just very far apart. We had a rookie QB and 2 NFL caliber receivers, they drafted #1 overall to get a QB, and have 2 #1 caliber receivers. There’s your difference.

There's not a chance in the world that if he and Tomlin disagreed on whether or not Matt Canada should be retained that Tomlin would get his way.

He didn't get his way with Bruce Arians right after they won a Super Bowl. He's not getting his way now.

The officials didn't have anything to do with that. Burrow failed to even get 3 points on the most important drive of the game.

>Every Steelers fan loves Hines ward, James Harrison, Joey porter.

I don't. Hines was a whiner and a bad teammate. But he wasn't a dirty player. His hit on Keith Rivers was clean and legal at the time. He wasn't trying to hurt Rivers. 

Harrison sucks as a person too. But he wasn't trying to hurt people either. The two hits in the Browns game that lead to the rules changes were both 100% legal and clean. In fact, both hits would have been hard hits to the chest if the opposing players were standing still. Is Harrison supposed to stop in mid-air to avoid contacting a player whose momentum is taking his helmet into a direct path with his own?

Your listing of Joey Porter proves that you're insincere and simply naming players you don't like. Porter wasn't a dirty player nor was he ever accused of being one. He was a mouthy asshole on the field and he once tried to fight the entire Ravens team on their bus, but he wasn't a dirty player.

Kimo was a clean player too, by the way. You can literally see how upset he was that he hurt Carson Palmer immediately after he realizes what happened.

44834,328266,328266,steelbydesign,">  The question from Tomlin doubters is if this is a good Super bowl strategy for the franchise.

I AM a Tomlin guy, but I'll admit after the past few years I've started to wonder if a re-boot wouldn't be best for the franchise..

But I always thought, if not him, then who? And never really came up with a great answer. Sean Payton would've intrigued me somewhat but I always thought; look around the league. Look how many just awful coaches there are. It could be *so* much worse.

This year when the Ravens lost I started seeing people ripping Harbaugh pretty badly too. Started talking about his lack of playoff wins recently. It was sort of eye opening..

What coach lasts 15+ years and DOESNT have lulls like we've seen with Tomlin? It's happening to Harbaugh, Carroll, Belichick right now too. McDemott might be on his way. Andy Reid looked pretty pedestrian with Alex Smith. Bill Cowher went through it. Honestly, Tomlin's non-losing streak is part of what's held him back. It's harder to rebuild when you're riding the middle every year. Zac Taylor gets a lot of credit, and kudos to him for picking the right guys but I think if you gave most coaches Joe Burrow and Jamar Chase in back to back drafts they'd fare pretty well.

My point is I've been right there with the ""fire Tomlin"" crowd until I started to realized this is just the natural order of things. This team is at a crossroads right now, if all goes well this is the start of the climb towards being a contender and I feel better having a coach that's been there before than one that hasn't personally.",1.0,steelers,t3_10q461y,False,0.0,:sh::h2::h3::sh: Joe Haden,2023-02-01T07:00:14Z,steelers,0.0354882599072329
