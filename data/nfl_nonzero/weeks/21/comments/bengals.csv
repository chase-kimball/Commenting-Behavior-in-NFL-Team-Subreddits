Throw into double coverage for one of the best wide receivers in the league.

Most recent game that a blow out happened in a conference championship with a close point spread was 12 years ago. In 12 years the skill and general talent of the NFL has significantly increased. The Colts where the worst team in the AFC and out of 14 losses only 4 were one score games. They lost a game 62-7, in that season.  Houston the worst team in the AFC this year 3-13-1. Lost 7 games by a TD or less including a OT game against a completely healthy Chiefs. So point I’m making is we aren’t in the 2011 league where the difference in 1st and Last is undeniably great. We’re in 2023, one or two players, the right coach, and a little hard work and any team can be competitive and considered a threat. Now you take that with the fact that we played a bills team averaging 2.5 sacks per game with our back ups and they allowed 1 sack, and Joe had like 3 seconds of pocket time on average per drop back, and your going to tell me the offensive line is the issue? Sure the chiefs average 3.24 sacks per game but we’re talking Joe Burrow who got sacked 9 times last postseason and we found a way. I think Nick Wright is one of those talking heads that needs to just be ignored.

It's what he does.

He will talk shit at every opportunity. He's done it with the Giants, the Saints, the Panthers and now with us.. probably in college too. Not us the fans, the coaches, or even his own mother will stop him from doing that.

I don't know what it is about corners like him and Jalen Ramsey that just breed infamous shit talkers like them but it is what it is.

I get where the the hate is coming from although I personally don't see how one tweet was a dig at DeMar Hamlin (especially since [he made a follow up](https://twitter.com/EliApple/status/1617944718444490753?t=ajl-5ZNOUwiBawxu-PZFtg&s=19) to clarify that it was not), but I do see how it could be seen that way. Obviously the loss in Buffalo didn't help smooth things over either. 

I have no doubt that Coach Taylor wrung him out out after those tweets, which is probably why he's so quiet now.

But after all the shit both our teams and cities have been through, I'm asking, don't let a known shit talker convince you that his opinions represent those of the city, organization, players and fans.

48782,363968,363968,uglydeepseacreatures,"The grounding was the right call, I don’t think it got back to the LOS and no back in the backfield. They could’ve called Jones for roughing because his weight was centered over Burrow, but he didn’t drive him down as much as fall down on Burrow’s thighs.

The block in the back would have been a softish call but it was absolutely a “callable” penalty. Especially after the PI on Hilton. 

The hold on 91 looked egregious to me on the tv angle but I haven’t seen a good replay of where the hands were, could’ve just been 91 selling a bit. 

I’m sure a chiefs fan could rattle off a few counterpoints but it seemed like the 50-50 calls favored KC overall, with there being few flat out bad calls.",10.0,nfl,t3_10oqvda,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2023-01-29T22:16:25Z,bengals,0.1062648748285322
