13710,98190,98190,NYJKNJD,"The AlterG anti-gravity treadmill contains NASA patented technology that allows you to reduce your body weight by as much as 80%. Military, professional sports teams, universities and leading medical facilities across the nation all use AlterG treadmills. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill helps a broad spectrum of people – top level athletes, orthopaedic and neurologic patients, pediatric, geriatric, and those looking to lose weight or to achieve their personal health and performance goals!  
  
AlterG treadmills offer an unique unweighting process utilizing a differential air pressure technique that NASA developed. The original use was to help astronauts exercise and maintain conditioning while in space. The air pressure comfortably lifts the user and allows him/her to walk or run at a fraction of their body weight.  
  
**AlterG treadmills allow patients to rehab from a lower extremity injury or surgery with less pain. Allowing for early weight-bearing exercises without the risk of injury to the healing tissue, the AlterG is ideal for joint rehab.  The AlterG assists in correcting gait mechanics and promoting a normal range of motion by reducing the demand on the affected joint.
Athletes of all sports and ages find the AlterG to be ideal. The AlterG creates a low impact, pain-free environment that allows athletes to increase their training volume, decrease downtime, and reduce the likelihood of training injuries that will cause a delay in getting back to their sport. The athlete can then return to their sport sooner and in better condition.
Lower body conditions that benefit from the use of the AlterG:
Total Hip or Total Knee Replacements  
Meniscectomy (Meniscus Repair)  
ACL Reconstruction  
Achilles  
Bunionectomy  
Arthritis (OA, RA)

13905,99467,99467,NannigarCire,">How many truly gifted and talented coaches have been overlooked in the NFL for 50+ years for somebody connected?

I would guess also that the extent of nepotism coaches in the league also means there's a heft of talent that never gets any chance because none of these coaches have any willingness to take risks. Guys from the day 3/UDFAs who are just parked in as rotational players permanently because the coaches don't want to make a real decision on playing them over someone ""more deserving"" until they have no choice (due to injuries, usually). 

Hackett ran the Jaguars offense that had Keelan Cole, one of the most impressive UDFA WRs of the last 10 years, who only got onto the field as a rookie due to injuries and exploded for 400 yards in 3 games. And after he had 300 yards in his second season through 5 games, Hackett was likely part of the decision to bench him in week 8 because the Jaguars went on a 3 game losing streak where Cole wasn't playing well in favor for 4th round pick Dede Westbrook -who put up 300 yards over the last 8 games total, and is now out of the league. While Cole is still in it. Man might've ruined a promising UDFA's career entirely.",2.0,nyjets,t3_10mi70e,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-27T12:37:05Z,nyjets,-0.0154507913976562
13906,99468,99468,NannigarCire,"replying to myself because this is a different a second point: i genuinely don't think there is a difference between most coaches. they are managers of the talent, and the talent make an actual difference. most coaches are not stupid enough to get in the way of their talented players. 99% of them are probably the exact same because of that. But another reason they are probably all indistinguishable from each other is because like half of the league is just nepotism guys. People whose fathers or other family members were there before them and got them in the door. Occasionally you get a Bellichick or Rex Ryan through it, but the majority of them are just nothing. Even Rex's brother sucked ass. They have no new ideas. They are there because they are friendly with all the right people.

Hackett can not be picked out of a fucking lineup. There is probably nothing noteworthy or different from what he knows/does than any of the other coordinators they could've chosen.",3.0,nyjets,t3_10mi70e,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-27T12:26:18Z,nyjets,0.0002685024185959
13907,99469,99469,NannigarCire,"The amount of cope coming off of people trying to talk themselves and others into Hackett reminds me of how stupid the NFL is. Hackett is in the NFL to begin with out of nepotism, and his career has only shown someone who doesn't stand out amongst the league in any way at all. There is no unique scheme, no unique ideas, the only unique thing he's done is cause one of the most embarrassing displays of resource mismanagement and player usage ever with the 2022 Broncos.

I think it's disgustingly stupid to hire someone who is only in the NFL out of nepotism, after they have just shown a massive failure in their hands when the majority of these coaches can't even be told apart from one another in a significant way. If someone can find a real difference between Hackett and any other potential OC, i'd be surprised. All of these people bringing up 'offensive ranking', Rodgers MVP season- none of them can say what makes Hackett perform any of these tasks in a standout way. Hiring him after what he just showed is a disgusting display of how the NFL's insiders club operates, there is no punishment for only being there because of your father and then fucking up.

also, not really playing around, unless he changed something, every 1st down is a run off tackle from the backfield that nets you either 2 yards or loses you 4.
