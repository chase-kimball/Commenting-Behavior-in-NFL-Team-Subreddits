His absolute worst case scenario this season is he plays on the tag and makes $32M, why would he agree to anything less than that?

Because you're not going to believe me when I tell you this, here's Ralph Vacchiano saying the same thing:

> Their ""business"" issue is that quarterbacks are expensive. Considering the contract Ryan Tannehill signed in 2020 pays him an average of $29.5 million, and Derek Carr makes an average of $40.5 million on the deal he signed in April, the idea of Jones getting $40 million per season isn't crazy. It might even be likely, considering there are multiple teams hoping a quarterback like him hits free agency and that the franchise tag is expected to be $32.5 million.

> The Giants would rather sign him than use the tag on him, according to a source, but it depends on whether they can get him at something close to a reasonable price.

*A reasonable guess is that Schoen does not want to go much over $30M APY for a player he didn‚Äôt want to take a risk on for $22M eight months ago, with a Year 1 cap hit in the $20M‚Äôs. That APY would be close to the estimated $32.45M non-exclusive franchise tag number for Jones, which gives Schoen some leverage. If Schoen is forced to something closer to $35M APY to get a three-year deal, he might agree to it if the details are favorable. That means a low 2023 cap hit and an out after Year 2 that makes the guaranteed amount only 60% or so of the total, so that the inflated salary of Year 3 only happens if the Giants have risen to the elite tier of teams by then. Something along those lines should be the walk-away number for Joe Schoen.

8525,74558,74558,Ghost_of_P34,"Top flight QBs are getting 50MM so DJ getting an AAV of 40 isn't crazy, especially after next year when Google money hits. Having said that, the Giants max for this one year is the tag amount, so about 32MM. If they are feeling generous when they sign him, they can go over, but in that case, the actual cap hit this season will below 32MM since a new contract will likely come with a signing bonus, which gets spread across the entirety of the contract length, usually combined with a low(er) first year salary.

So, for example, let's say DJ signs a 3 yr, 120MM contract. That may include a 30MM signing bonus combined with a $15MM salary in year one, making his cap it in the first year about $25MM (30MM/3 + 15MM).

The Jets have [TWO rookie of the year candidates](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-honors-finalists-announced-for-select-awards-from-2022-season), one on each side of the ball and one of them is a WR.  Breece Hall had that OROY on lock before his injury.  Plus, you know GB isn't going to draft an offensive weapon for Rodgers (why start now?) and Lazard (his leading receiver - a number 2 on most other teams) is almost certainly gone. 

You are right about the NFCN being an easier division.  No question.  And GB had a losing record (only 1 more win than the Wilson/White led Jets).  Also remember, Rodgers is driven by ego.  You think he wouldn't LOVE the chance to beat Josh Allen and Tua twice a year to prove he's the best?

With that said, I'm obviously with you in that I recognize that there is a possibility (likelihood?) that this *doesn't* go our way and we do have to let him walk due to salary.

The one thing I disagree with is your assessment of RB as a commodity position.  I think we *need* a guy like Barkley to take/keep all of the pressure off of DJ.  I love DJ's development and I think it would be a mistake to undervalue how much of that growth is due, in part, to having an electric playmaker in the backfield with him.  So if Saquon walks, \*I\* think we still need at least a Saquon-lite back there as opposed to a warm body like Brightwell or even a slightly warmer body in Brieda.
