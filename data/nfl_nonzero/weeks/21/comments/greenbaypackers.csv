Don Hutson Poem Legend


Timothy Lund
Tell me a poem about packers legend Don Hutson 


2 / 2

Don Hutson, a Packer legend true,
A receiver like none other, he knew
How to make the ball fly,
His hands were quick, his moves sly.

With speed and grace, he'd run the field,
His opponents, he'd always yield.
He'd catch the ball with ease,
A touchdown, he'd always please.

Through storms and sunshine, he'd play on,
His passion for the game, never gone.
He'd make the crowd roar and cheer,
His name, forever etched in Packer's gear.

Don Hutson, the first of his kind,
His legacy, forever in our mind.
A Packer legend, he will always be,
A true football hero, for all to see.

C) He is guilty of playing the will-he or won't-he game that people hate, but people give Tom Brady a pass (and would probably tongue his bum) when he literally retired for a whopping 40 days, only to come back. 

D) Rodgers is currently more concerned with the Pebble Beach pro-am than making a decision at this moment. And, like he said, you would think reporters would wait until the off-week between the conference championship and superbowl to start fabricating headlines for clicks.

Well said. I honestly think the best thing for our team would be to move on from Rodgers at this point. He's better in a McCarthy/Heroball type setup and LaFleur wants to run a system that isn't dependent on this type of QB. When we had the O, we had no defense. If we're not paying a super star QB, we can spend money on a designated kick returner... FA defensive players.. 

Mahomes has a top 5 defense. It definitely stings having MVS go over 100 in the championship round, but that's not the whole story. The Chiefs are the team we always wanted the Packers to be. In his prime, Rodgers was as dominant as Mahomes even if the play style is diff and Mahomes is almost definitely a better talent.",0.0,greenbaypackers,t3_10p6ivm,False,0.0,:92:,2023-01-30T14:15:32Z,greenbaypackers,0.0853821617746

Games are not won and lost with one single play. The Packers defense that day got 4 turnovers and ST 1

GB - Possession 1 : Rodgers intercepted

Seattle possession 14 : ball on the 50. Touchdown

GB Possession 14 : Field goal

Seattle possession 15 : end of regulation. OT

Seattle possession 16 : Touchdown end of game.

Rodgers putting up 178yds 1td 2 picks.

Wilson putting up 209yds 1td 4 picks.

Cobb was awesome and a fan favorite, but he is not in the same tier as those other WRs. 

Jennings was only with Rodgers for a few seasons and they were in the twilight of his career. 

Jordy was elite for a while, but it was usually just him and Cobb. You need more than just a elite QB and an elite WR to win a SB. 

>Whether it be his coaching or his defense…

Yeah that’s about it. Having a great WR or two is now where near enough to make let alone win a super bowl. 

After 2010, the Packers defense was religiously underwhelming or straight up awful. Look at the DC’s in the Rodgers era; Dom Capers-Mike Pettine-Joe Barry. Outside of 2021, and maybe 2014, could you argue the Packers have ever had a championship caliber defense following the 2010 championship season? 

I’ll always love Mike Mccarthy for his longtime commitment to the team but he should’ve been fired way before he did. I’m not gonna say he “wasted” Rodgers’ career, but he certainly didn’t optimize it. Does Mike Mccarthy belong in the same conversations as Bill Bellicheck, Bruce Arians, Andy Reid, Pete Caroll, and Sean Payton? As for Lafluer, as much as I loved him in 2019-2021, I have always had questions about his decision making in clutch scenarios. He has had a lot of question marks in the playoffs. And with this most recent season, he made mind boggling decisions at times because he couldn’t rely on Rodgers/Tae to supplement the entire offense. 

So for a vast majority of Rodgers’ career, he’s had underwhelming coaching, defenses that range from average to awful, suspect running games outside of these recent seasons of Aaron Jones, very few TE’s to compliment the passing game, etc.

In weeks where there are byes and not 16 games, distribute the full time refs accordingly.  They need to do something to bring consistency to the games.

I am talking computer chips in the football, sensors in the stadium calibrated to the field, computer algorithms calculating what is physically possible levels of technology.  I want replays to view like the World Cup had available.  The sky judge can make any call at any time, or reverse any call at any time.

Third, revamp the review process.  If coaches want the sky judge to have more time, they call a time out.  If a call is changed during the timeout, they get their timeout back.  As long as they have timeouts, they can use them.  Also, personal fouls should be reviewable.  It is easy to see if a defender grabbed a facemask or avoided landing with his weight on the quarterback, or was blocked into a punter.

\- Retain Rodgers, try to go all in again, but there is very little wiggle room in cap space.  Could they try the Godwin thing and make it work?  Sure.  However, we would be Saints level screwed for a few years and not be able to sign anyone for 2-3 years with the additional Rodgers cap hit coming due and now Godwin.

The big question is how close is this team?  Are they a Godwin away from contention?  I would say no.  There are more glaring needs than WR right now.

After White, Sean Jones, Santana Dotson, Don Beebe, Andre Rison, and Desmond Howard signed in the following years, all of which were closer and closer to the Super Bowl Runs in the 90s.  I would argue that it was a championship caliber team and Ron Wolf's ability to sell that vision more than Green Bay becoming a Free Agent destination.

After those signings, Green Bay wouldn't see another significant signing until Charles Woodson, and that was more about money and position than anything else as he was seen as an aging corner that couldn't keep up with the new wave of receivers coming through.  They caught lightning in a bottle.

Since then, there have been big names that have signed, but all had needed to show they were still worthy of playing in the NFL.  The Packers hoped to duplicate the success they had with Woodson.

46530,333951,333951,sonofabutch,"Sports agents. 

Red Grange had an agent in the 1920s, but Grange -- one of the most famous and popular men in America as a huge college football star -- was sort of a cottage industry unto himself, with a movie deal, a barnstorming tour, a candy bar, and even a [Red Grange doll](http://sep12.hugginsandscott.com/cgi-bin/showitem.pl?lotno=363). Most athletes didn't have an agent until the 1960s, and would negotiate deals with the teams themselves... and as you can imagine, often not getting the best terms.

By the early 1960s, some players began to get agents. Supposedly it started after the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, and agents who were representing actors started looking at athletes. Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley told *Sports Illustrated*: 

> ""We can't give into them. There are too many agents hanging around Hollywood looking for clients.""  

In 1963, seven-time All Pro center Jim Ringo walked into Vince Lombardi's office to negotiate his contract for the 1964 season. For the first time, Ringo walked in with an agent. Lombardi stood up, excused himself, and walked out of the room. Five minutes later, he walked back in. 

""I can't negotiate with you,"" Lombardi said.

""We haven't even started yet,"" Ringo replied.

""I can't negotiate with you, because you've been traded to the Eagles!""

Now, of course, all players have agents... it's weird if a player *doesn't* have an agent. [(In 2022, there were only 17 out of more than 2,000 players.)](https://www.whas11.com/article/sports/nfl-without-agent-lamar-jackson-dj-humphries-bobby-wagner-kaiir-elam-football/417-cd5fcc4c-58f3-4682-8eb2-028ec8b18e34)",2.0,nfl,t3_10mltg3,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers,2023-01-27T11:20:58Z,greenbaypackers,-3.621005495623871e-05
