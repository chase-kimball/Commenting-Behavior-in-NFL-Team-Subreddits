Sean Payton's teams have been successful from Week 1 - 18, but there are significant struggles in the postseason.

Is it possible the NFC South was just a weak division during many of those years and his division titles are over-rated?

So if a player had 20 catches for 250 yards then anything less than that would be considered likely, and count against the current cap, then you'd get a cap refund if not earned.

We make chit chat and I'm trying to be nice because he's new and all. Turns out he just moved from KC so that's cool. Except he says something about not actually being a Chiefs fan and usually rooting against them, which is fine and all you don't have to be a fan.

Well the whole time he's making snide remarks and being a tad smug, nothing overly egregious but mildly douchbaggy.

7975,56092,56092,Darkagent1,"Yeah, most officials I know have said, besides the big blunder (that ultimatly didnt matter and they got correct after the confusion), the game was decently officiated. There were a couple of things I personally saw that wern't great but nothing game breaking.

1) Marginal block in the back no call on KC return (really tough to tell with the angle everyone is passing around)

2) Soft PI on Cinci (met the letter of the rule but ehh)

3) Holding on KC on the first long punt return (again met the letter of the rule but ehh)

4) Late hit on Burrow (I personally don't see it as a must call. It looks way worse because of the angle. But I am a homer so I will defer on this one)

I have a really tough time seeing the officiating impacting the game one way or another. They let the linemen on both sides do what they want, and wern't getting caught up in rough secondary play (besides the one PI).

I know ill get flamed for this, mostly because of my team, but I really really don't think the narrative around this game should be on the officiating, and I hope the people who watched that game and thought ""I am never watching again because the officiating is so bad"" to just actually do it and get it over with already instead of constantly threatening it on social media.

In the picture he ripped with his right arm under the blocker's right arm and it failed, so the blocker is legally allowed to now block him like that because there's no other way he could possibly block him.

Ideally, the pass rusher would rip the blocker's arm up and go around the blocker on the outside in a successful attempt. It puts a pass rusher in a position where they're essentially attacking one side of a blocker, so the blocker is at a disadvantage (one arm versus the rushers two) so the blocker is allowed to use this otherwise illegal technique to stop the pass rush.",13.0,nfl,t3_10p53i6,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2023-01-30T10:42:26Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.1140369726899506

""It is a foul for intentional grounding if a passer, facing an imminent loss of yardage because of pressure from the defense, throws a forward pass without a realistic chance of completion.

The passer initiates his passing motion toward an eligible receiver and then is significantly affected by physical contact from a defensive player that causes the pass to land in an area that is not in the direction and vicinity of an eligible receiver""

- A RB being ~8 yards off the ball is not in the vicinity & you can see this called throughout the regular season. Especially when the the QB is *inside* the pocket. In the area does not mean they were both on the field. There was no realistic chance of completion. 

- Secondly, to your point about *being hit*, please read the rules carefully. ""And then significantly affected by physical contact from a defender"". Burrow threw the ball where he was going to throw the ball. It saved a sack. That's why it was intentional grounding. On the reply, you'll clearly see Burrow nearly complete his throwing motion & finish it as he's being hit. Compare to the Mahomes throw where his throwing motion ends as he's halfway to the ground.

29288,193725,193725,Scaryclouds,"The point of analytics shops like PFF are to provide a deeper insight into what happens on the football field than what you might see from raw metrics. Two QBs have an interception apiece, however one comes from throwing a ball right at a defender, the other from a pass that bounced off the hands of his receiver. While passer rating would grade these plays the same, clearly the QB isn't equally at fault. That's where places like PFF should could come in, to provide more context and analysis. 

So with the above said, I can see how you could come to the conclusion that Burrow played better than Mahomes. Yea Burrow had much better targets than Kelce by the end of the game, but you could also say Burrow trusted his receivers to be able to come down with those 50/50 passes, and that was needed to win the game. I don't necessarily agree, but I could see how you could arrive to that conclusion and not be a clown or a troll.

However, while you could make the case Burrow played better, it would only be a bit better. If you give Mahomes a 71, fine I can see Burrow at 75, but Mahomes was a 71 and Burrow an 86? L oh fucking L. By their own scoring that means Burrow played at an elite-level and that's absolutely in no way the case.

It's always absurd how both have ""only one turnover worthy play"" and both have ""three big time throws"" but then you just see a huge discrepancy in their final grades. It reminds me of start of the season when PFF gave Mahomes an absurdly low score while giving Allen an amazing score, and would then harp on the one TWP Mahomes had as though that one play justified the ridiculously low score, while Allen *also* had one TWP. 

I think they do it for engagement. They'll eventually re-evaluate their scores once they ""go through the all-22"" and it will almost certainly result in Mahomes score going up some while Burrow's down some and they'll pretend like it wasn't obvious that wasn't going to be the result and not question their system at any point.",12.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_10q5nrx,False,0.0,Arrowhead,2023-01-31T16:38:43Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0379756455656276

there was a bitb/holding called on the chiefs that negated a big run back. (the one at the end that was a ""no call"" looks a lot like that dude flopped to me: https://youtu.be/lKKiEhem3V0?t=102)

The people whining about the chiefs getting away with holding, A. are stupid and like half the retired O-linemen on twitter are correcting them, and B. aren't going around taking still shots of all the time Chris Jones was getting ""held"" and not getting called. 

The mahomes late hit was 1000% a late hit. The dude hitting him was flying so far out of bounds he injured himself running into the bench. Then they point to the ""late hit"" on Burrow that didn't get a RTP: https://twitter.com/i/status/1619888752230559744 - A. that angle doesn't even show what Clark did, and B. if anything it shows Burrow flopping like a soccer player. I can't stand how everyone is like ""we hate refball"" but then turns around and complains there's not 15 more ticky-tack penalties that go their way. RTP: ""NFL is so soft"", weak hit not called RTP: ""RIGGED!""

The 3rd down do-over was the correct call. And if Mahomes had done some magic on that play, it wouldn't have counted. Imagine if we convert it and then they make us do it over... that's just some random shit that can go either way. And we got no points on that drive anyway. 

Burrow 100% intentionally grounded it. The similar Mahomes play that whiners point to is not even close to the same thing (it's not intentional grounding if you are impacted on the throw and that makes it off target, or if you just throw it poorly). Burrow intentionally spiked it behind his line of scrimmage. 

And let's remember:


Bengals benefited from a whistle blowing a play dead...but then Burrow threw a TD AFTER THE WHISTLE, and they LET IT COUNT...in the playoffs. 

[Bengals benefited from an OBVIOUS penalty no-call in the super bowl that gave them a free 75 yard td](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyCCcjT4H9Q)

The rule was abolished for the 2011 season, when the NFL increased the roster size to allow 46 players to dress for a game.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_quarterback_rule#cite_note-drops-1)

>In 2010, the last year the rule was in effect, teams could dress 45 players for game day. If they had two quarterbacks dressed for the game, they were allowed to dress a third quarterback who did not count toward that limit. However, if the third quarterback entered the game at¬†any¬†[position](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(team_sports\))¬†before the third quarter ended, the starter and backup quarterbacks became ineligible to play for the rest of the game.[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_quarterback_rule#cite_note-2)¬†The third quarterback, however, could play in the fourth quarter while preserving the eligibility of the starter and backup.

So they had 45+emergency qb. Then they just expanded to 46.

Iirc part of the reasoning was that teams were using backup qbs as wildcat qb or other positions. So if say you had qb1, qb2, and a mobile qb3 who can do other stuff, then you'd use the emergency roster spot on qb2. So then if qb1 was hurt, and you didn't want to have your wildcat qb take every snap now, you bring in qb2, but since you used him as the emergency spot, it meant the wildcat guy was also out of the game. ...unless it's the 4th quarter... got that?

53369,370063,370063,scorcherdarkly,"Here's the first part of the rule:

> It is a foul for intentional grounding if a passer, facing an imminent loss of yardage because of pressure from the defense, throws a forward pass without a realistic chance of completion. A realistic chance of completion is defined as a pass that is thrown in the direction of and lands in the vicinity of an originally eligible receiver.

The first exception to that rule discusses two things.

> Item 1. Passer **Or Ball** Outside Tackle Position

Here's the passer specific portion of the first exception (part of which you quoted):

> Intentional grounding will not be called when a passer, who is outside, or has been outside, the tackle position, throws a forward pass that lands at or beyond the line of scrimmage, even if no offensive player(s) have a realistic chance to catch the ball (including when the ball lands out of bounds over the sideline or endline). 

Here's the ball specific portion (bold emphasis mine to correspond to the play in question):

> **If the ball crosses the line of scrimmage (extended) beyond the sideline, there is no intentional grounding**. If a loose ball leaves the area bordered by the tackles, this area no longer exists; if the ball is recovered, all intentional grounding rules apply as if the passer is outside this area.

If either of those things are satisfied there's no intentional grounding.  Mahomes's throw out of the back corner of the end zone clearly meets the criteria of the second clause of the paragraph.",5.0,nfl,t3_10p405b,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2023-01-30T12:39:59Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0458751639302174
