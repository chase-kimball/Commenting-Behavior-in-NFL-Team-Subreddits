Poles choosing Chi over MN only adds to **THE MANDATE** theory. Meanwhile Kwesi in the same link:



> “I think when people look at teams, they sometimes do it in a very binary way,” he said. “They ask, ‘Are you either all-in or tearing down and rebuilding?’ And I don’t really look at the world that way.

2635,7445,7445,Ajax_Malone,"# THE MANDATE



Ownership has a macro mandate to be as competitive as possible every year. Always trying to win as many games as possible without a longer outlook beyond the current year. Not even a soft rebuild allowed. **THE MANDATE** drives the GM’s decision making. Which is why Rick and Kwesi so far look like they have a very similar GM style. Also why there was so much talk about having a “collaborative” front office. 


This theory is backed up by pretty much every professional reporter who’s followed the team and you saw it with Mark Wilf’s comments before they hired a new GM. 


And example of a horrific move caused by **THE MANDATE** is the Ngakoue trade. The GM knew Hunter was out for the year. He knew we didn’t have a contending team yet he still traded a 2nd round pick in a desperate move to keep the team more competitive. All made worse by the cap situation of the team because they needed all the high draft picks possible to find good players on cheap rookie deals. 



So while they’re not meddling in today to today decisions they are meddling in the direction the GM takes and it keeps us in the current cycle of mostly mediocre, occasional good but never close great. 



If you accept in the reality of the theory our outlook looks pretty capped while **THE MANDATE** still exists. Which might be why there is an angry opposition on this board to ever acknowledging **The MANDATE**. It forces the board to defend moves like the Ngakoue trade (to this day) or the Bradford trade.

With a tandem of rookies at CB in Jeff Gladney and Cam Dantzler, Zimmer was counting on reliable pass rush to aid their early development. Faced with a sudden void at the edge and lackluster backups of Odenigbo, Wonnum, and Holmes paired with only run stuffers at DT, Zimmer and Spielman turned their search external. Yannick Ngakoue had been franchise tagged by Jacksonville and was holding out, but no buyer had met Jacksonville’s demands. With one week to go until the regular season and a massive need that had not been planned for, Spielman negotiated a salary decrease for Ngakoue to facilitate the trade to try to save the Vikings’ defense before the season started. Instead, Ngakoue was a poor fit in Andre Patterson and Mike Zimmer’s scheme, accumulating sacks as a speed rusher but abandoning his assignments as a run defender. By the time it was clear he was not the solution and the defense was far worse than imagined, Ngakoue was only under contract for roughly half a season, and Spielman was forced to sell him for less than he bought him for, a huge red flag that he and Zimmer’s time in Minnesota may be short-lived.",1.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10q3ens,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2023-01-31T23:04:17Z,minnesotavikings,-0.0489870369571496

On the other end of the spectrum would be the Marvin Lewis Bengals years - constantly making the playoffs but never even winning a playoff game. This philosophy typically gets fanbase buy-in year after year, which is appealing to owners as you pointed out. 

Conversely, some teams go the tank/rebuild route, sacrificing years to reset and stockpile resources at the cost of fan support and revenue. Only the most patient (or disinterested) owners tend to green light this approach. The gamble here is trusting the GM/HC to be the right decision makers with these resources - using them poorly could set a franchise back for over a decade.

Off the team, Cousins will still cost 19 or 34M against the Vikings cap depending on when the trade goes through, spread out over at most 2 years, so the savings isn't going to be huge. Cousins is also a ""proven"" QB, you know what you're getting with him, and the whole reason the 49ers would want Cousins is for someone who's ""good enough"" but never seems to get hurt. Arguably the Vikings need draft picks more than they need a lottery ticket at QB going into his 3rd year, so the value Lance brings to the table isn't huge unless he really hits the ground running.

But the 49ers also dumped a ton of draft capital into getting Lance. So they aren't going to want to give him for cheap.

We can't tell you how to conduct yourself on reddit, but there is a general understanding that if you go into the sub of a different team and act very poorly, you might get banned from there and might incur a ban from /r/minnesotavikings if your behavior is bad enough (ie rooting for injury, excessive insulting, etc) or repeats after being warned.

Best bet for you is to keep your trolling out of other teams' subs and keep it in /r/NFL.""

37306,241668,241668,nomaam05,"Let's clear up this AT contract info:

Cutting him does save over 6 million this year (more than double that if we do a post June 1 cut designation, but that's a different conversation). However next year it saves over 21 million, not 14. 

You're adding dead cap numbers together. If we cut him before June 1st of this year, we eat dead cap for '23, '24 and '25 signing bonuses, and his '23, '24 restructure bonuses. That total dead cap is 13.55 million. With his cap hit for 2023 set to be just under 20 million, that would save a little over 6.4 million this year. 

But that's it. His dead cap is all gone after 2023 and his cap hit for 2024 becomes 0.

Edit: Also, for Hunter, trading him costs us an additional 5.7 million for 2023. We go from having Hunter on the roster with 13 million cap hit, to not having him and eating nearly 19 million in dead cap.",13.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10ofw7k,False,0.0,Daddy Smooth,2023-01-29T13:55:17Z,minnesotavikings,-0.0655043273286799
