We had the guy who made ""The Catch"" as the GM who was going to get rid of all our Cleveland curses.

We had the number 1 pick with an absolute cant-miss consensus #1 QB that had all the physical and mental ability to truly be an NFL legend. Arm like a cannon and pinpoint accuracy.

We had one of the best linebackers in the NFL, former OSU legend Chris Spielman signed up for the team ready to spearhead the new Browns defense.

And we had owners both majority and minority that really actually cared about the city of Cleveland and were invested in the success of the Browns because of their love of the game and the city, they werent just money mercs.

Sam Snead was quiet, reserved, standoffish at times, and didnt smile much.

IMO, Snead was the better golfer, but Hogan is the one that gets remembered by the public.

Johnny Unitas looked like the stereotypical all american quarterback. He was who women wanted and who men wanted to be. Otto Graham was more quiet and preferred playing instruments in his spare time instead of going to social parties. And, no offense to Otto, but his face wasnt the most handsome one on the planet...

Unitas in his time was a legend... Not metaphorically, Like a real american hero legend... Like Paul Bunyan. And people couldnt get enough of him. He was an absolute idol in his time.

So whether or not he was better than Graham is debatable, his legacy will be remembered by the public at a much higher level.

That was the storybook end. That was the walk-off. That was his legacy cemented permanently. The amount of titles he has in the modern era, nobody is touching that. It is so hard to make 1 Super Bowl, let alone 10, let alone win 7 of them. Peyton Manning made 4 and won just 2. His brother won 2. Roethlisberger has just 2. Brees, Rodgers, Stafford, and Wilson each have just one. Guys like Ryan, Rivers, McNabb, Hasselbeck, Palmer, Luck, they have none. In two weeks Mahomes will get the *chance* to get his second in 3 attempts.

13431,97593,97593,OptimisticRealist__,"Let me preface this by saying, that nowadays not just in this sub but football fans in general suffer from a sense of grandieur, everybody always thinks they would havd done everything better. My favorite around here is the perpetual ""should have run the ball / why didnt we pass the ball?!"" conundrum.

""Analysis"" is so focused on the outcome, that the process is completely disregarded. The past 3 years in particular ive spent as a ""baker hater"" i constantly complained about a lack of execution in many important situations, yet the more popular narrative was that Stefanski was obviously a clueless idiot. Down & distance, personnel, game script etc etc didnt matter. The play didnt work thus Stefanski was an idiot. As simple as that.

And i see a lot of this in regards to Berry as well. In hindsight, everybody wouldve drafted 10 All Pros in each of his drafts, easily.

But again, context matters and the context is that no two players develop at the same rate. Every player has his individual learning curve. 
For every Rashawn Slater, who was elite the second he stepped onto the field, is a Kolton Miller, who was labeled a bust after 2 years only to have developed into one of the premier OTs in the league in years 4 and 5.

Furthermore, because many seem to think that drafting is as easy as playing madden connected franchise, i want to stress that the real life NFL draft is a genuine crap shoot and i think many people underestimate just how much of crap shoot it really is.
A generally adapted meassurement for draft pick success is whether a player gets a second contract in the league.

https://www.dailynorseman.com/2022/4/26/23042105/nfl-draft-pick-bust-rate-remains-very-high

Take this analysis of draft picks between 2010 - 2017 for example. Out of all the 1st round picks selected in that time frame, only about 30% of the players signed a contract extension with the team that drafted them. Thats about 77 players out of 255 first round picks in that time frame. And again, thats first round picks. So you can get a sense for how difficult it is to hit on mid to late round picks.

Furrhermore i am an avid believer that you cant really judge draft picks, for the most part, until at least 3 years in the league preferably 4 years due to a developmental curve.

So that was an unneccessary long introduction, mea culpa. I just wanted to give some context to the insane difficulties that drafting a player brings.

Now regarding Andrew Berry:

2020 brought Wills, Delpit, Elliot, Phillips, Bryant, Harris and DPJ. 

We got 3 starting caliber players in Wills, Delpit and DPJ. One good depth piece in Bryant and 3 questionmarks. Especially the value for Bryant (4th) and DPJ (6th) was tremendous tho.

The difficulty with Harris is, that he was meant to sit behind Tretter and then take over. He had a great game in his start at C against GB, then blew out his knee in preseason. Again, context matters.

Overall that class is an A- to B+ in my books.

2021 had Newsome, JOK, Schwartz, Hudson, Togiai, Fields, LeCounte and Felton.

Newsome and JOK are again two very good starting players. Hudson is a promising developmental piece and Fields is a developmental player as well with ST abilities.

Schwartz (3rd) and LeCounte (5th) are clear busts at this point. Togiai appears to be heading this way as well.

Overall, i would give this draft a B- to C+. The starters we got in Newsome and JOK outweigh the bust of Schwartz imo. 

2022 is way too easy to grade, however Emerson was a terrific pick. Yes, i am biased because i was a big fan of Emerson pre draft, but i think it is save to say that he looks like a hit. The rest is too early to tell. It also has to be noted that Berry didnt have a 1st round pick, which is still the highest probability pick in the draft. So considering that we didnt pick until round 3, its still somewhat impressive that we got quite a lot of production out of the rookies per espn:

https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/insider/story/_/id/35463411/ranking-nfl-rookie-classes-2022-teams-most-production-value-star-players

But again, too early to tell.

So overall i think Berry gets a strong and solid B to B+ for his drafting so far, all things considered.",23.0,browns,t3_10ndji4,False,0.0,:orange_pants:,2023-01-28T09:57:44Z,browns,0.0137522780355882

23689,176124,176124,deviden,"> It happens in soccer already. It's not a perfect system, still needs some tweaks.

I'm inclined to think it would work better in the NFL than it would in soccer. Many rules in soccer that are enforced by custom or vibes/feel rather than as written (in part because the sport can easily be made unwatchable through tactical fouls or constant stoppages for fouls, etc), and the introduction of VAR has resulted in a lot of frustration for fans as games get swung on calls which are wildly inconsistent from how the game has previously been played or understood. 

One case in point: Southampton may be relegated this season (losing hundreds of millions of $$¬£¬£) because of a goal ruled out by VAR, where a possible foul that occurred off the ball which had no effect on the goal itself was identified. In the past this never happened, the goal stands and the team is no longer in the relegation spots. 

As a fan in the stadium you genuinely don't know whether you can celebrate until a minute after a goal is scored. 

With the NFL the ""sky judge"" concept can work because every play is a discrete moment that can be called back, or have a timeout, etc. Fans are trained to look to the replays between plays, TV does that for you. Soccer at its best is a constant ebb and flow and the current implementation of VAR can be highly disruptive of that (it also takes way too long).

The danger of ""sky judge"" in the NFL is on highly subjective calls, like our old favorites: pass interference and holding. You could render an otherwise competitive NFL game unwatchable, or swing a one score game with these calls. Adding another layer of subjective human judgement isn't necessarily adding further accuracy (and this is at the heart of the problem in soccer - many of the refs don't understand the ""clear and obvious"" part of VAR). 

But again... much NFL fans like to rail against Team Zebra, compared to soccer it's very well officiated and has very clear and objective rules. A sky judge with the ability to intervene on strictly ""clear and obvious"" missed or blown calls. There's also improvements made like the fast review process that's come in this year which makes me think Sky Judge would work better, faster, than VAR's laborious, stressful and painful introduction to soccer.",1.0,browns,t3_10n6897,False,0.0,:crazy-joe:,2023-01-28T05:09:42Z,browns,0.009786218882812

1) We hadn't drafted/signed a franchise QB.

It would also help if we could find a way to get more out of less with coaching. The reason the Bengals are thriving, for example, is not just Burrow/Chase/Higgins.
