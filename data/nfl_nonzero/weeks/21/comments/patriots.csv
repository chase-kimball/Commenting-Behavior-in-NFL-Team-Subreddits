This doesn't have anything do with Cincinatti being cheap. It's basic math. Cincinatti *objectively* doesn't have the cap space to bank roll all three of Burrow, Chase, and Higgins.

It is in Cincinatti's best interest to trade Higgins this off-season, probably before the draft or on draft day.

Plugging holes in the draft is, always was, and always will be how bad teams stay bad. You address holes on the roster in free agency. You add talent in the draft. Also doesn't really take away from the point? We are losing far more than we have the cap to replace. There's a bizarre sentiment that we're postured to be major players in FA and we'll be able to leave it with a stronger roster than we had this year. That sentiment is patently untrue.
