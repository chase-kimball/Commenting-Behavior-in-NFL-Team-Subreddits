This doesn't have anything do with Cincinatti being cheap. It's basic math. Cincinatti *objectively* doesn't have the cap space to bank roll all three of Burrow, Chase, and Higgins.

It is in Cincinatti's best interest to trade Higgins this off-season, probably before the draft or on draft day.

They had less than 40 signed before the season ended and we gave futures deals to the whole practice squad. 59 players, sure, but far less than that were ever on the active roster. 

>Are you familiar with the NFL draft?

Plugging holes in the draft is, always was, and always will be how bad teams stay bad. You address holes on the roster in free agency. You add talent in the draft. Also doesn't really take away from the point? We are losing far more than we have the cap to replace. There's a bizarre sentiment that we're postured to be major players in FA and we'll be able to leave it with a stronger roster than we had this year. That sentiment is patently untrue. High cap # is not the same as flexiblity. Realistically we'll sign a tackle, a few depth pieces on defense, and that'll be it.
