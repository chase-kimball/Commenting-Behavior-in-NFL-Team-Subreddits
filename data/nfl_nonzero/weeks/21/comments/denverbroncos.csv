It seems strange to me that people people Tucker the GOAT because of his accuracy metrics and disregard Vinateris playoff and super bowl clutching moments, however, they'll turn around and label Brady the GOAT because of his playoff and super bowl accomplishments but not Aaron Rodgers even though he has the highest career QBR at 104 (the only QB to hold an >100 career rating) while Bradys is 96. 

It's contradictory but mirroring. Brady also had a higher QBR until his old age seasons dropped his average. 

Either Brady and Vinateri should be considered GOATS at their positions or Rodgers and Tucker should be otherwise you're not judging off the same standards.

EDIT: Also, Tucker has only been in the league 10 years. Vinny played over 20. Let's see how Tuckers career finished before we slap that label on him.

Get me the teacher first, worry about the students later.

EDIT: Not even Simmons. He was drafted in 2016. Broncos haven't won a playoff game since 2015, which means the last guys we drafted who won playoff games here (were on the team) were: Shane Ray, Ty Sambrailo, Jeff Heuerman, Max Garcia, Lorenzo Doss, Darius Kilgo, Trevor Siemian, and Taurean Nixon (we also drafted Josh Furman in 2015 but he never played an NFL snap)",12.0,denverbroncos,t3_10mnw5s,False,0.0,2-Star Mod,2023-01-27T10:13:27Z,denverbroncos,-0.0115562490369475

Yeah, I do think Payton and Russ working well together is more likely than Ryans significantly improving a defense that was great in a 3-4 but will be switching to 4-3. Best case scenario is they're still really good.

But so what? the Broncos have had a really damn good defense every year since Super Bowl 50, and every year since Super Bowl 50 they've proven that having a really damn good defense doesn't matter. We need to fix the offense, and Sean Payton is unquestionably the best option to do that this offseason.

He took a good Drew Brees and turned him into a Hall of Famer. I'd be happy if he could take a bad Russell Wilson and turned him into a good one. And if he can't fix Russ, then at least he's proven that he's capable of coaching up a QB for 2 years from now when we can move on from Wilson and draft a replacement.

Ryans might turn out to be a great coach, and I'm not gonna act like the world is ending if we do hire him, but Payton *has proven* to be a great coach.

He left them. He doesn't want to be there anymore

> Why wouldn't he be the first coach hired

Because the first team that hired a coach is a division rival of the team that owns Payton's rights. Two other teams potentially interested in Payton have notoriously incompetent owners. That leaves two teams who are, as far as we know, still planning to conduct second interviews with him.

> 1 Championship (14 years ago) Sure, that's nice, too.

How many coaches have won more than 1 championship in the past 14 years? I'll answer that for you: it's *one*. Let's not hire anyone because only one guy has won more than one Super Bowl in the last 14 years, and he's not on the market!!!!

> 9 W 8 L .529 W% = NICE Playoff record

Andy Reid: 20 W 16 L .556 W%
