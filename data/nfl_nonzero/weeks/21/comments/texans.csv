If Caserio gets pieces and they still suck then he should be fired. You'll have way bigger problems then not taking a QB from this year. The point is there isn't anything here currently on this roster or coaching staff that inspires hope about a young QB developing here. That's why I said if you get established players then you could make this situation good enough to take one this year. 

And to your point about Collins, I thought he took a nice step up and that pep should have started to feature him more so I know what you mean but there's 2 problems: 1. He isn't consistent enough and 2. He didn't stay healthy.

Sure we can hope for growth but that's a lot of hoping and wishing for a squad that just showed you that they were bad. The WR room doesn't have a player that would start on most teams. Let's stop with the hopium. If you want a rookie QB, your best bet is to actually spend some of that capital on established players. Tee Higgins might be available. You may need to trade for a high quality receiver. You need to go get a vet center and then another guard because I'm not putting my eggs in the basket that is Kenyon Green. Then you may need a vet TE who can do more than a few catches every now and then. I'm sorry but if I want a QB I need to be better point blank period, not hoping I get better off of players who were bad last year.

22403,176524,176524,bingmyname,"Tackle is fine but I'm looking at it from a unit perspective since that matters more than individual positions. For example, yeah the tackles look good but it doesn't matter because the IOL was legit one of the worst I've ever seen this year. And yes we have the capital to fix it but the thing is that it's not established- hence, we don't know if even attempting to fix it will pan out how we hope. We have 1 RB and having such, really hurt us this year. Again, we need a unit of a running game not just one person. I don't think any of our WRs have proven themselves yet. Chris Moore has solidified himself as a solid WR4. Collins is inconsistent and hasn't maintained health. Even when he was healthy, you'd be hard pressed to call him a WR2/3 compared to other WR2/3s. That doesn't mean he can't get there, but again... It isn't an established thing. Our best TE is on the verge of 30 and had just a few splash moments. I would not bet on him being a foundational piece or even good enough as a stop gap. TQ showed promise but then again so did Brevin Jordan his rookie year and that didn't work out so well this year. We have no known, guaranteed good units on this team which is why taking a rookie QB is DOUBLE gambling. It's already taking a chance when you draft any given player but when you draft a QB in particular, to a bad environment, you are increasing the bust potential.  
 
Considering all of this plus the fact that we don't know if our OC will be good, average or just bad just really doesn't bode well. The chances and percentages aren't high. We'd have to either get a known brilliant OC or spend money/draft capital to build the team up with known quality commodities outside the draft. However there just aren't many good FAs at the skill position this year so you're talking about spending draft capital at that point in a trade.

Troy Walters enters his third season with the Bengals and his second as wide receivers coach. He leads a talented unit which features veteran Tyler Boyd, third-year pro Tee Higgins and 2021 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Ja'Marr Chase.
In 2021, those three combined for 3374 receiving yards, the most by any receiver trio in the NFL. Chase, the team's first-round draft pick, had the most receiving yards by a rookie in the Super Bowl era (1455) and 13 receiving TDs. Higgins added 74 catches for 1091 yards and six TDs, and Boyd added 67 for 828 and five TDs. In the team's run to Super Bowl LVI, Chase recorded a team postseason record with 368 receiving yards while ranking second in receptions (25).
Walters served as assistant WRs coach in 2020 and helped guide the group through a transition to rookie QB Joe Burrow, despite no in-person offseason program. He also helped oversee a rapid ascension for Higgins, Cincinnati's second-round draft pick who caught 67 passes for 908 yards and six TDs.
Before the Bengals, Walters was offensive coordinator at the University of Nebraska from 2018-19. He helped the Huskers' 2018 offense average 456.2 yards per game (No. 2 in Big 10), 71.2 yards better than in the '17 team (385.0).
From 2016-17, Walters was offensive coordinator at the University of Central Florida and helped guide the offensive-powered Knights to the greatest two-year turnaround in NCAA history. He inherited the FBS' 127th-ranked offense (268.4 yards/game) and 125th-ranked scoring offense (13.9 points/game) from 2015, but by '17 had the Knights ranked fifth in yards/game (530.5) and first in scoring (48.2). UCF finished the 2017 season with a 13-0 record that included a win over Auburn in the Peach Bowl. Walters one of five finalists for the prestigious Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top assistant coach.
From 2013-15, Walters served as receivers coach and recruiting coordinator at the University of Colorado, where he tutored the program's top three single-season receptions leaders and top-two receiving yardage leaders. One of his prot√©g√©s, Nelson Spruce, left Colorado with 41 school records, and another, future NFL second-round pick Paul Richardson, became the first CU receiver in two nearly two decades to earn all-conference honors.
Walters spent 2012 as WRs coach at North Carolina State, where he helped the Wolfpack rank 18th nationally in receiving yards per game, and helped two players break the 50-catch mark.
From 2010-11, Walters served as wide receivers coach at Texas A&M, where he worked alongside current Bengals head coach Zac Taylor, who at the time was the Aggies' TEs coach. While at A&M, he helped Aggies WR Ryan Swope set school records for catches (89) and receiving yards (1207).
Walters broke into coaching at Indiana State University in 2009, where he served as offensive coordinator while also coaching quarterbacks and receivers.
Walters had a record-setting career as a receiver at Stanford University, where he played four seasons (1996-99). He ended his collegiate career as the Pac 12 conference's all-time leading receiver with 4047 yards. He set career records for receptions (244) and 100-yard receiving games (19), as well as single-season records for catches (86 in 1997) and receiving yards (1456 in '99), and a single-game record for receiving yards (278 vs. UCLA in '99). In 1999, he won the Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the nation's top receiver.
Following Stanford, Walters was selected in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. He went on to also play for the Colts, Cardinals and Lions, and over eight NFL seasons totaled 98 catches, 1135 yards, nine TDs and more than 3800 return yards.
Born Dec. 15, 1976, in Bloomington, Ind., Walters attended Consolidated High School in College Station, Texas. He holds two degrees from Stanford ‚Äî a bachelor's in communications (1999) and a masters in sociology (2000). He and his wife, Josephine, have two sons, Tate and Wynn, and two daughters, Faith and Landri.",5.0,texans,t3_10qctcq,False,0.0,:johnson3:,2023-01-31T16:58:15Z,texans,0.0140504209181322

Three write ups about him from his past. First, from the middle of his Chargers run, before the decline of Rivers, the city move, and his mistakes caused a bad enough season to get him canned.
