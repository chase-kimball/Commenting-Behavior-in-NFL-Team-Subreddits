Darnell Washington is really raw as a receiving threat but the potential is all there. I love his blocking ability, especially after last season how bad our TE run blocking was. Washington and Parham in 12 personnel sets would give us a huge size advantage and blocking boost. 

Dalton Kincaid looks like a great receiving TE but I don’t see a guy who is gonna get the dirty work done in the trenches. Plus he’s older and coming off that injury. I’m a little confused about why Daniel Jeremiah and the GAC guys are so infatuated with him.

Mayer looks rock solid everywhere but doesn’t flash the elite physical tools you want a first round pick to have. Very polished though, which is something you have to like in a position that often takes forever to develop. 

Washington is an insane blocker but there’s not much there as a receiver right now. You’re banking a lot on developing him at a position where it’s already tough to develop players. He also doesn’t have great lateral movement skills which lowers his ceiling a bit. Love his size and blocking ability though. 

Kincaid is old, coming off an injury, and not a great blocker. He probably has the most potential as a receiving threat of the 3, but if I’m drafting a receiving TE in the first round I want to see some Kyle Pitts like talent. Most other TEs that go round 1 in the NFL are of the mold of a TJ Hockenson where they can do it all. I don’t see Kincaid ever being a plus in the run game.

12253,66662,66662,HustinJerbert,"**1.why do you want to be a moderator?**

I would like to be conducive in maintaining a user friendly experience, a welcoming atmosphere for positive discord between fans of the team and other team fans or new fans in general, and be a positive role model, maintaining composure in even the most catastrophic of team decisions, injuries, or games.

**2. Do you have prior experience as a moderator?**

I do not, this would be my first experience as a moderator. I do carry other life experiences that I think would be beneficial to this role, such as people skills and the ability to get along with essentially anyone. It's better to be a decent/good worker that everyone wants to work with than an exceptional worker that no one can stand

**3. What time zone do you live in?**

Central Standard Time

**4. How long have you been a fan?**

My family wasn't really into football whatsoever, so I didn't really watch or indulge in the sport at all growing up. After high school I joined the workforce and my coworkers at the time were very into football, and asked who my team was, and the only thing I had to go off of was my youth football team that my coach named the ""Chargers"" because it was his personal team. 

tl;dr I've been following and watching since around 2014, and it's been a hell of a ride

**5. Why should we pick you?**

I understand that I don't have very many technical skills or moderating experience, but I do however spend 98% of my time on Reddit in this sub, and I feel like I would be able to properly moderate the daily operations and help observe and keep the peace between us and the other football subreddits. This team gives me weekly heart attacks for half the year, made my hair turn gray in my twenties, and routinely makes me defend us at my workplace from the jokes and general tongue lashing I receive from the other football enjoyers, but damn it that's just Chargers football. I can't see myself rooting for another team, I'll be doing this until they bury me with ""Family, Trust, Respect"" on my tombstone

But we can have this made up argument if you want.

I believe the biggest piece we've missed from every coach over the years is the ability to call a complete game. This is obviously a nuanced issue with multiple layers that are impacted by the staff, the players and more.

 I can't think of a single instance in the last few years where we didn't drop the ball (figuratively or literally) in one or multiple facets of the game, at least a couple of times a game, every year.

Lynn, had HORRIBLE clock management. He also was dealt the unfortunate hand of not being adept at public speaking in difficult/stressful situations. Causing him to experience a lot of foot in mouth, scenarios. 

Staley has scripted some truly genius plays and sequences over time. But has fallen apart in the second half numerous times and made some truly questionable decisions in his second season. I'm inclined to cut him some slack for this season as I believe we (slightly) outperformed expectations based on our injuries. (Sans the playoffs). I also really blame Lombardi for how fucking bad our offense was.

> Kellen Moore spoke with the media Wednesday for the first time since agreeing to terms with the Chargers to be their new offensive coordinator.

> Here are my takeaways.

> (1) The Chargers and coach Brandon Staley focused most of their offensive coordinator search on the Kyle Shanahan-Sean McVay coaching tree. They interviewed three assistant coaches from McVay’s Rams staff in Thomas Brown, Zac Robinson and Greg Olson. They interviewed Vikings assistant quarterbacks coach Jerrod Johnson, who coached under Shanahan with the 49ers in 2017 and spent last season under former Rams offensive coordinator Kevin O’Connell. Moore, of course, does not come from that tree.

> Moore was asked about the focus Staley had on that specific tree — something Staley spoke about explicitly at his end-of-season news conference. And Moore explained his core beliefs and philosophies in the context of that tree.

> “From an offensive perspective, you take bits and pieces from everyone,” Moore said. “And I think that’s the beauty of it. We’re going to build a 2023 L.A. Chargers offense.”

> He added later: “Naturally, just because you haven’t coached with certain coaches, it doesn’t mean you’re (not) influenced greatly by those guys. Certainly, the younger offensive head coaches have had a huge impact on this league and are guys that I watch each and every week, and I love watching those guys and studying their offenses and hopefully being able to incorporate some of that.”

>  (2) We heard similar projections after the Chargers announced Joe Lombardi as their offensive coordinator in 2021. Quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator Shane Day, who was fired along with Lombardi last month, had coached with both Shanahan and McVay. Tight ends coach Kevin Koger had spent two seasons coaching under Matt LaFleur, who coached with both Shanahan and McVay. Staley talked about building a blend and incorporating some of those elements.

> That never really materialized. The offense more or less operated in Lombardi’s image with a heavy dose of shorter-developing routes and concepts. The Chargers got Justin Herbert on the move periodically on bootlegs — a staple of the Shanahan-McVay style of offense — but it was never at any point a backbone or major element of the scheme. What was missing, most notably, was what Staley referred to as the “marriage of the run and the pass.”

> So I am in wait-and-see mode when it comes to incorporating some of these elements into the offense, considering Moore’s background.

> (3) Moore mentioned two systems when discussing his core philosophy. One was the Air Coryell system, developed and made famous by former Chargers head coach Don Coryell. The other was the West Coast system, originated by legendary 49ers coach Bill Walsh.

> Moore has ties to both systems.

> He spent the final three years of his NFL playing career as a reserve quarterback for former Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett. Garrett adopted the Air Coryell system from Ernie Zampese, an assistant for Coryell from 1979 to 1986. Zampese was the Cowboys’ offensive coordinator from 1994 to 1997, and Garrett was a backup quarterback for Dallas during those seasons. Moore then coached under Garrett for two seasons in Dallas, first as a quarterbacks coach in 2018 and then as the offensive coordinator in 2019. The Air Coryell system is very much a downfield passing attack.

> Moore then learned the West Coast system from Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy. Moore was McCarthy’s offensive coordinator and play caller for the past three seasons. McCarthy coached under Paul Hackett for almost a decade, first at the University of Pittsburgh and then with the Chiefs. Hackett coached under Walsh for three seasons with the 49ers.

> The West Coast offense, which is rooted primarily in shorter horizontal timing routes, has a rich history in the league. Lombardi, in fact, is a descendant of Walsh. Lombardi learned the system from Sean Payton, who learned it from Jon Gruden, who learned it from Mike Holmgren, who learned it from Walsh. The system, of course, goes through different iterations and variations as it is passed down and molded by different coaches. But this connection feels worth mentioning, especially since there might be some overlap between what Herbert learned in the previous offense and the West Coast concepts Moore is going to bring in.

> “Will you be able to see the Air Coryell-Jason Garrett side? Absolutely,” Moore said. “Will you be able to see the West Coast and Mike McCarthy? Absolutely. We’ll keep things that are in place here that Justin feels really, really good about. And then we’ll be willing to explore.”

> (4) This marriage of the run and the pass is a crucial piece of what Moore needs to build. The Chargers lacked a certain level of intention when designing and preparing their running game, and there was a lack of synergy and cohesion between the running game and the passing game in Lombardi’s offense, particularly in 2022. Moore was asked about this Staley phrase — the marriage of the run and the pass.

> “It’s alignment, and so much of it is about the presentation,” Moore said. “Certainly, the run game and the play-action pass and the movements on first and second down, when those two are in sync, the presentations are similar, it puts defenses in conflict. I think that’s something that we’re really excited about building here and developing certainly in the first- and second-down game. And it will allow you to be more aggressive, to get the ball downfield. Certainly, it doesn’t mean you go crazy with it, but you can build those marriages. And we all know the top offenses in this league and the beauty. When those two things are in sync, it’s a beautiful thing.”

> This sounds like a good start and overall approach. We will see if Moore can put it into action.

> (5) Moore referring to pushing the ball “downfield” should be a welcome sight to Chargers fans. Over Lombardi’s two seasons, Herbert ranked 35th of 38 qualified quarterbacks in air yards per attempt, according to TruMedia. With Herbert’s arm talent, there is no reason he should rank that low. Some of it is Herbert’s propensity to move through his reads quickly and get to his checkdown. But ultimately it is up to the coaching staff to put Herbert in positions where he is encouraged to make those types of throws.

> A big part of this conversation, too, is personnel. The Chargers need to add more speed at receiver so they can access these areas of the field more consistently and dangerously. Moore spoke rather refreshingly about what speed can do to an offense.

> “Speed is always dangerous. We certainly have seen that throughout this league, and when you do have speed, it certainly is a huge advantage,” Moore said. “You hope that you can find a way to create those opportunities still from a schematic standpoint. But speed, you can’t coach. Speed’s very special. Certainly, you want some of it. Every guy doesn’t need it. There’s plenty of ways of playing football. But certainly when you do have it, it’s a nice little advantage to be able to utilize.”

> (6) Moore and Herbert got a chance to connect last summer when they made a commercial for Kendall Auto Group, a car dealership chain in the Pacific Northwest. Moore said the two spent “a few days” together making the commercial. “It’s amazing how life can come full circle here on you,” Moore said. Moore is from Prosser, Wash. Herbert is from Eugene, Ore. Moore played at Boise State. Herbert played at Oregon. Moore said he and Herbert have some “crossover relationships” from their Northwest roots.

> “He’s an awesome, awesome person,” Moore said of Herbert. “Awesome player, certainly know all the physical talent. But I’m just really, really excited to work with him.”

> (7) The process of hiring Moore moved rapidly for the Chargers. Moore said he had conversations with the Cowboys on Friday and Saturday about his future. By Sunday morning, they had agreed to part ways. Moore said he then had a conversation with Staley “rather quickly” and things moved from there. Staley and Moore spent time together in August when the Chargers and Cowboys held joint practices.

> “Anytime you do one of those, you kind of get to know the other staff pretty well,” Moore said. “Spend a lot of time just getting practices organized, schedules and scripts and all that sort of stuff. And I really, really enjoyed my time with Brandon during those couple days.”

> Moore said he and Staley kept in touch over the season via text, and those joint practices set the stage for how quickly the Chargers were able to make their move and bring Moore aboard.

> (8) As far as the rest of the Chargers’ offensive staff, Moore made it sound like that group will stay mostly intact.

> “Brandon and I have been able to talk through this over the course of the last few days, and I just love the way he really likes this offensive staff,” Moore said. “Every interaction I’ve had I’ve really, really enjoyed. So I’m really excited to work with these guys.”

> The Chargers have an opening at quarterbacks coach, and that should get filled here in the next few weeks. I could see the Chargers making a change at offensive line coach. Brendan Nugent was hired last offseason to replace Frank Smith, who left to take the offensive coordinator job in Miami. Nugent was brought in from New Orleans, where he had previously worked alongside Lombardi. That connection is obviously gone. And with so much emphasis being put on improving the run game and building that marriage between the run game and the pass game, an offensive line coach who has familiarity with Moore would make sense",1.0,chargers,t3_10raaxi,False,0.0,Chargers,2023-02-01T17:54:40Z,chargers,-0.0005489421084736

>The Chargers offense put up a middling performance in both halves of the Jags game. That side of the ball probably doesn’t deserve credit for building up a 27 point lead, nor does it probably deserve credit for blowing it.

Why doesn't the offense deserve credit for blowing it? Just because they weren't good in the first half either? Our offense is too talented to not score more than 3 points in a half. Given that doing so would've dramatically increased the likelihood of a win, it's hard to not consider it a failure. I think losing Deandre Carter in that game, especially with Mike Williams already out, was a bigger factor in that failure than we tend to talk about, but ultimately the scheming, playcalling, and clock management failed the talent.

42977,246623,246623,nobabeimnotonreddit,"**1.  Why do you want to be a mod?**

I'm active on the sub daily (whether I comment or not). I'd like to be a mod to help the sub be as welcoming and open for healthy discussions as much as possible, while ensuring the sub content fits the wants and needs of the community. There are different types of fans here - the longtimers, San Diego natives and faithful, LA natives, Herbert-era (2020-present) fans, etc. The sub should be a melting pot of all of the above, and the sub content (and frequency of it) should be determined by said fans. A unified and healthy moderating team could achieve just that.

**2. Do you have prior experience as a mod?**

On two discord servers, each with a few thousand members. Both servers dead now.

**3. What time zone do you live in?**

PST

**4. How long have you been a fan?**

2006

**5. Why should we pick you?**

Longtime fan, active on the sub, almost always available due to my job being WFH. Have a football knowledge, sense of humor and can see through sarcasm. Would still continue to engage with the community, but would likely cut out my 'anti-whoever is sucking for the last month of the season' stuff. My IRL job requires effective communication and decision making skills, so that comes naturally.

Got to find my wife and head to PF changs

Ok now that my qualifications are met:

1. Been in this sub since like 10-15k and love how much and the rate of growth we’ve had, and would want to be apart of the team to keep it going and keep the new fans in check 

2. I’ve worked with kids , it’s pretty much the same thing 

3.PST

4. Since 05-06 

5. I bring solid B+ memes, super active all year long, always keep a level head (check my comment history in this sub), want to make this sub grow both online and would love to coordinate in person events , I have a genuine passion for the this team even through all the heartbreak they put us through, and lastly, I have solid football knowledge + keep up to date with a lot of football outside of the Chargers.

6. Listen fam everyone’s going for the generic Fuck the raiders which is great, I 100% hate them like the rest of us but, gahdamn if sometimes people realized just how dogshit their team and fans are. I often get asked if I love the Chargers more or hate the raiders more, and it’s a close one to be honest . I have a dedicated raiders bucket I place all my dogs shit into, there’s levels to this ..

**To apply to be a moderator, please reply to this post answering the following:**

1. Why do you want to be a mod?

I’m active on the sub pretty much everyday. I probably have gotten into some arguments often in the past season or so, but I’ve never let my emotions get the better of me. I don’t believe I’ve ever broken a subreddit rule even though I’ve been in a number of discussions about a variety of topics. I like to think I’m level headed and reasonable regardless of the situation. I feel as though I am on this sub so often I could help out with whatever is needed. 

2. Do you have prior experience as a mod?

Yes, I’ve been a moderator with r/angelsbaseball for 4 years now. I also have experience on discord.

3. What time zone do you live in?

PST

4. How long have you been a fan?

2006 was the first year I truly remember, but I started becoming a die hard around 2012. I think I’ve watched every game since then, I even am able to schedule my work around game days. 

5. Why should we pick you?

I’m active on this sub everyday for multiple hours a day. I love this team and I’m an advocate for healthy discussion. I have moderating experience with r/angelsbaseball and I’ve never let my person afflictions affect my moderator duties. I’ll enforce the rules as they are written and won’t let my personal feelings or beliefs influence my decisions.

It’s 27-7 with like 8 minutes left in the 3rd quarter. You just got a huge sack on 3rd down to make it 4th and forever. The Jaguars either have to kick a FG which does nothing or go for it on 4th and 30ish.

49254,286776,286776,xool420,"Hyatt is fast and we desperately need speed, but he only has one-dimensional speed.  He runs straight really well, but doesn’t have (or at least hasn’t shown) much ability to throttle down and play with nuanced speed.  Furthermore, he’s reallllly skinny and has only faced 31 snaps against press coverage.  Tennessee schemes him open using motions, stacking, etc.  Whenever he has been isolated in press coverage, he gets erased from the play.  If we could get him in the 2nd, I’d be happy with that, but speed kills and there’s not a huge chance he drops out of the 1st.  But even in the 2nd, I might take a guy like Tyler Scott out of Cincinnati instead.

All this is to say, we need speed, but Hyatt isn’t the no-brainer 1st round pick he’s being hyped up to be.
