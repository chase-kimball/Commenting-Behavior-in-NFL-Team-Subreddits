15505,115209,115209,RelentlessRogue,"Honestly, the fixation on having a generational talent at QB is what's killing this franchise. (Looking at you, Jim Irsay)

Look at the Titans, Seahawks, and Vikings: The Titans have owned our asses with Ryan Tannehill, who was widely considered a bust before he got the job in Tennessee. Seattle has Geno Smith, the very definition of a journeyman QB. The Vikings are 7-1 with *Kirk Freaking Cousins*.  

More examples include Dak Prescott, who was a 4th round pick. Daniel Jones was absolutely a reach by the Giants when he was drafted, and yet they're 6-2. 

The Packers have had 2 generational talents at QB back to back as well, and I'd argue they suck just as much as we do *in spite* of still having Rodgers under center. 

Having a generational talent at QB makes winning easier, sure, no argument there. But even if we drafted another Andrew Luck next spring, it doesn't solve the other issues; including the fact we have *no fucking clue* who will be the head coach next season, the fact that our offensive line is overpaid and underperforming AND we have holes to fill at left tackle and right guard, the need for more pass rushers that can successfully pressure the QB, and the glaring problems at cornerback: Gilmore won't be around forever, Kenny Moore is trash in coverage, and outside of Isaiah Rogers, we have no long-term pieces at cornerback.",3.0,colts,t3_ypu3kv,False,0.0,COLTS,2022-11-08T19:05:34Z,colts,-0.0667036735199619

32006,233538,233538,voyagerx420,"Roughly 12 hours after the Colts‚Äô befuddling press conference Monday night to introduce Jeff Saturday as the interim head coach, owner Jim Irsay called me and Fox-59‚Äôs Mike Chappell to get a few more things off his chest:

‚Ä¢ He took issue with the narrative that the Colts, who benched their starting quarterback, Matt Ryan, fired their head coach, Frank Reich, and hired an interim head coach with no coaching experience, are tanking to secure a better draft position.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the most absurd thing I‚Äôve ever heard, that we‚Äôre tanking,‚Äù Irsay said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bulls‚Äî. We‚Äôre in this thing; 9-7-1 get us in, no question about it. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre not tanking the season. Whoever says these things, that we‚Äôre not playing Matt because (of an effort to tank), that‚Äôs all bulls‚Äî. That‚Äôs not true. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre going to do what it takes to win. I don‚Äôt know who people think we are, they don‚Äôt know us. We don‚Äôt tank in Indianapolis.‚Äù

‚Ä¢  A few weeks ago, Reich said the Colts were committed to starting Sam Ehlinger the rest of the season.

Irsay said Tuesday night that‚Äôs not going to be the case moving forward. He is open to the idea of playing any of the three quarterbacks ‚Äî Ryan, Ehlinger or Nick Foles.

‚ÄúWhen Chris (Ballard), Frank and I decided to go with Sam, Frank wanted to name him quarterback for the year, but I told them, ‚ÄòLook, we have three quarterbacks; we need to use them all to win this year,‚Äù Irsay said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ If we decide to make a change, we‚Äôll make a change. It‚Äôs not something we‚Äôre locked into. We‚Äôre going with Sam with his mobility and his playmaking ability since we‚Äôre struggling in (pass) protection and moving the ball, that‚Äôs what we all decided to do.

‚ÄúThere was never a notion that you wouldn‚Äôt go to Nick or Matt later in the season when (Ryan‚Äôs) shoulder is healthy. They‚Äôre all available to help us win, bottom line. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs always been about whoever can help us win going forward. We‚Äôre going with Sam, and if there‚Äôs a notion for Jeff to make a change ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs Jeff‚Äôs prerogative, and it was always Frank‚Äôs prerogative. It‚Äôs wrong to say I mandated it (the move to Ehlinger) and it‚Äôs wrong to say they can‚Äôt go to the other guy.‚Äù

‚Ä¢  Irsay offered his appraisal of Ehlinger through two games.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen a lot of potential, a lot of movement,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe should have won the Commanders game; we let that slip away, up nine (points) at home with 9 (minutes) to go against someone who hasn‚Äôt moved the ball much. Defensively, we had a chance to put the game away. But again, we have the ball with 2 ¬Ω minutes to go and we sit on it (punting rather than going for a fourth-and-1) instead of being aggressive.

‚ÄúSo you can see the plays Sam made against New England, we didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ give him a chance. We‚Äôve got to get the blocking schemes down. We can‚Äôt block their best rusher (Matthew Judon) with a backup running back (Deon Jackson). We can‚Äôt pick up stunts inside, I mean, John Elway wouldn‚Äôt have stood a chance in that game.‚Äù

‚Ä¢  I asked Irsay if this season has convinced him it‚Äôs time to grab a quarterback in next year‚Äôs draft.

‚ÄúWe have to see what materializes with how Sam is playing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat sideline throw he made to Jelani Woods (a drop against New England), that‚Äôs a big-league throw. That‚Äôs a guy with a strong arm.

‚ÄúBut if someone is there next year, sure, most likely we would probably take (a quarterback), but it‚Äôs too early to say. There‚Äôs no question that‚Äôs on our radar. Even if Sam‚Äôs playing well, you‚Äôre looking for an opportunity if there‚Äôs one, because quarterback is such an important position.‚Äù

‚Ä¢  Irsay was asked why there‚Äôs been such a dramatic regression in the offensive line play this season.

‚ÄúI think there are a number of reasons, and I feel very confident Jeff can ‚Ä¶ make strides to get us playing great ball there,‚Äù Irsay said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why Jeff is there. We know we have the people to do it, and we have to get it done. When you‚Äôre struggling, why, I mean, it‚Äôs a number of reasons, but in the end, you have to depend on your head coach to get those problems fixed. Bottom line, the head coach is your man. ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs the guy everyone follows, so we have to get it right. Why it came apart and all those sorts of things, no one can really know. I have my feelings about how things have gone since the Raiders game last year and us being 1-4-1 in the division, not being able to generate any offense early in games. Who would think we‚Äôd go into Houston and give up seven sacks? But I feel confident we have the people up front to get it fixed.‚Äù



‚Ä¢  The reason for Irsay‚Äôs call, though, was to take issue with his former head coach, Tony Dungy, who offered his thoughts on Ryan‚Äôs benching on Tuesday‚Äôs Dan Patrick Show:

‚ÄúMatt, I guess it‚Äôs the fact that it‚Äôs contracts and he plays so much, then you pay this money next year,‚Äù Dungy said to Patrick. ‚ÄúIf he gets hurt, this much is guaranteed. So you think, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre not going to make the playoffs, and we‚Äôre not going to win the Super Bowl, so we‚Äôre not going to do that (play and pay Ryan).‚Äô‚Äù

Irsay insisted there is nothing in Ryan‚Äôs contract that is tethered to the amount of playing time he receives.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how people report these things falsely. There‚Äôs no playing-time thing for Matt Ryan to get his $17-million bonus in the offseason,‚Äù Irsay said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing. They‚Äôre all available to help us win, bottom line. There‚Äôs no bonus if Matt plays a certain amount of time, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Tony talking about it, it‚Äôs been mentioned in other columns, it‚Äôs ridiculous and completely false. It‚Äôs always been about whoever can help us win going forward.‚Äù

For the record, Dungy had more to say about the Colts‚Äô situation. A lot more. He was asked what he would have advised Irsay, had the owner called him and asked.

‚ÄúAs a fan and former Colt, I would have have said, ‚ÄòHey, Jim, you‚Äôve got as many wins as the Rams, the defending Super Bowl champs,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚Äú‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no super teams out there. Get this going. Stay with Frank. Let‚Äôs see if we can win a few games here, get back in the race. You make the playoffs, you already beat the Kansas City Chiefs; everyone is saying they‚Äôre going to the Super Bowl. You already beat them. So if you get in, who knows what‚Äôs going to happen? So stay with the best course of attacking to get you in these playoffs.‚Äù",47.0,colts,t3_yq797b,False,0.0,:colts:,2022-11-08T21:33:46Z,colts,0.0045538802374605

You can‚Äôt absolve the players who are just bad this season and only blame the coach. They‚Äôre playing like matadors. Do you think Strausser is coaching them like that? Or, perhaps, are they just bad? Ballard is 99% responsible for the players on the team. There‚Äôs no doubt Reich and co have some say but they don‚Äôt negotiate the contracts.
