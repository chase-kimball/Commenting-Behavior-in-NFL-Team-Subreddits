>Why does he dislike the Cowboys these days?

Agreed on Aikman as an announcer. From a Cowboys fan perspective, he goes out of his way to avoid praising us and tends to be over-critical. I know it doesn't appear that way to other fans, but we know. And that a aside, Buck and Aikman are just boring to listen to.

He dislikes the Cowboys because he feels he was slighted at the end of his career. He hated that Jerry hired Switzer and felt like the rest of the players were given free reign. He was a spoiled malcontent when Chan Gailey was the coach because he didn't like the new offense, even though we were winning. Jerry acquiesced and fired Gailey, hired Campo, and Aikman still wasn't happy. He plainly stated he wouldn't have retired if he'd had his way: ""I felt that I had worked hard to develop some level of credibility and respect within this game. And I felt like that was being jeopardized by decisions that were being made beyond my control within the organization. And I didn't want to be a part of it anymore.""

To top that off, he also flirted with playing for the Eagles and once said during a broadcast he considered that organization more of his home than Dallas. So screw him.

>Ha... didn't know Flus came from the Cowboy tree, thanks for that!

He was our linebackers coach and passing game defensive coordinator for years. Rob Ryan brought him here and Marinelli kept him. I was not happy when Indy hired him away instead of us promoting him over Marinelli. Flus called our defense his last couple of years here anyway. I think you have a good one.

And dude, I am so tired of the 90s Cowboys. I wish our fans could stop living in the past and stop constantly comparing our current guys to the 90s. 

I *hate* Troy Aikman. I think he was probably one of the most accurate passers to ever play, but he was also an absolute selfish tool of a human being and it got masked by the leaders around him. I'm so glad I only have to listen to him once a year now, because he hates our organization too. I get the Emmitt issues, but I think it's fair to say it was a 50/50 credit between the OL (including Moose) and him. You have to admire his endurance. I bonded with my dad over Emmitt, so that's something I'll always be attached to. Moose and Michael Irvin are my favorites from those teams and remain so today. 

Sorry about Wanny. I always thought he *looked* like a Chicago coach, though. We gave you Eberflus, too, btw. I'm a fan and hope he's successful there.

Agreed on Eagles fans.

Thanks for being cool with me making an attempt. I like our current players and coaches infinitely more than the 90s crew. I think they're more humble and stand-up guys. Maybe that can help ease the hate.

A few teams have had really good luck with QBs throughout the entire franchises existence, and a recent team that comes to mind is the packers, but I also think the cowboys have also had some pretty good fucking luck with QBs as well:

Of the cowboys existence since 1960, the starting QBs that i mentioned to begin the seasons were:

1. Don Meredith (62-68)
2. Staubach (71-79)
3. Aikman (89-2000)
4. Romo (2006-2015)
5. Dak (2016-Present)

If we want to, we could throw in Danny White (Round 3, Pick 53), who was, as far as I’ve been told/read about okay after Staubach. (Also kinda sucks having to take the reins of one of the greatest QBs of all time). White was a starter for Dallas from 80-87, so if we look at it like that, 11 of Dallas 62 seasons have had at least a not shitty starter.
