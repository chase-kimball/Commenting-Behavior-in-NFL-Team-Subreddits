Cardinals - Keim and Kliff have underwhelmed. Cardinals with Payton and Kyler would sell tickets

Long shots:

Browns - stefanski unfairly looks bad without Watson, but Payton paired with Watson would be an immediate super bowl contender. Would only be 2nd rounders though 

Colts - Irsay is pissed. Adding Payton would make him happy 

Broncos - Hackett looks bad and was hired by the prior owner. Adding Payton would make Walmart owners happy 

Broncos could trade 2023 2nd and 2024 1st, which is more likely since future years devalue by a round",1.0,nfl,t3_ym4aq4,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2022-11-05T00:38:27Z,saints,0.0944145854766803

Chargers

Colts

Texans 

Cardinals 

Panthers

Lions 

Cowboys 

Commanders

And that’s not including the possible ones of raiders, broncos, bengals and the long shots of browns 

Of those teams, the Chargers, Cardinals, and Cowboys have the quarterback, but the Lions, Texans, Commanders, Panthers have either multiple first round picks or high first round picks 

Finally, the Colts have a good org and probably a decent first round pick.
