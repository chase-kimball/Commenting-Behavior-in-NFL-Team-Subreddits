A bandaid situation with the older guys (especially Munchak) feels admissable in this situation considering a young QB needs brought along slowly and with some consistency.

Build around the OL. Let Mike Sullivan work with the QBs and have a strong voice on what type of plays he sees the most effectiveness within the current offense but let Munch fix the run game. I know it would be a soft rebuild of the offense rather than an overhaul which some may see as half-assed but i think Kenny has shown some good things this season and all of his mistakes cant be solely placed on the current coaching staff.

No matter how bad we all hate Matt Canada. Mitch showed us he is still the same guy he was in Chicago and im sorry but its not Matt Canadas fault he was missing wide open receivers during his progressions. There is something to be salvaged out of this offense even if I fully agree its time to move on from Matt Canada.

Najee needs to find his lane and hit the hole hard and the run blocking needs to be better especially on the interior.

They're going to go draft others or trade back for more picks. He hasn't played completely dogshit terrible. That's the reality of the current situation.

I don't think sticking with a mediocre prospect is a good thing, but I'm a numbers guy, and his stats (besides the interceptions), are not all that terrible. Idk what hatred you have driving your soul against Kenny but it's obviously there because you are completely judging someone after 5 games which many NFL coaches and scouts believe is a small sample size. If coaches and GM's had this mentality teams would be ass for a long time, so it's very good they're not as reactionary as reddit. 

I'm not saying Kenny is going to be good. I'm not saying he's going to be very bad. I'm literally saying I want us to try to build around him and see what happens, so again... If a new QB comes in we have a supporting cast already there and don't just throw him in a shit situation.

Anyways, my Browns comparison is because they were bad. Needed quarterbacks, linemen, needed defensive players, and had very bad teams all around. They continued to draft high quarterbacks and not have success. Riding the musical QB chair is not a great idea until we know for certain a guy can't play (this requires more than 5 games and trying to build a great OL). It seems pike if you were the decision maker of the Bears, Jaguars, Jets, Eagles, etc. you'd have been letting go of Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, Justin Fields, Jalen Hurts, etc after their first few games / season struggling.",1.0,steelers,t3_yocfkk,False,0.0,:sh:21:sh: Amos Zereoue,2022-11-07T21:07:31Z,steelers,-0.0393893225165509
31242,217628,217628,YooTone,"Yeah I mean if that will for sure help us do better then I'm okay with it. Unfortunately again I just strongly believe we have other areas to fill, after drafting who the front office and coach believes in. 

I'd say QB is a need as in backups next year. Again, we do not know his full potential and this team is rebuilding. They're growing together. They're not gonna just jump ship and shouldn't. We aren't the Browns...

It does logically track and make sense in these ways... Teams liked Kenny. They did. They just didn't think he was worth that high of a draft pick, and that's okay. It happens all the time. 

Your last paragraph doesn't equal my stance or thoughts. I don't know, you don't know, Tomlin doesn't know, nobody knows if he will develop into a great QB but there is only one way to find out. And you're assuming I'm pro Kenny when I'm really on the fence. I did not want them drafting a QB at all this draft. I would have waited. Regardless what we think, we need to build a fuller team on all sides of the ball, see what our young QB can develop and form into, and if it doesn't work out then get that other QB. 

You are coming off as the type to complain about Stroud or Young or whoever, and if they don't do amazing right away you want to make significant changes again.

I mean to be honest with you, I wouldn't even go for Bryce Young or CJ Stroud this year. I'd wait for Caleb Williams next year, although it's likely we don't draft high enough lol.

Unfortunately for you, the Steelers tend to give players and coaches chances and time to develop. So they're not going and shouldn't draft a QB with all the other needs we need.

Teams did like Kenny during the draft. And obviously the Steelers thought and think he's worth the chance. Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, Fields, Tua, etc have all struggled early in their careers but their teams are allowing them a chance to develop before a significant change at the position. That's what we will and should do.

But nah, that's a made up scenario we don't know will or will not happen. Give me a top 5-10 OL with Kenny, which should also in theory open up the run game, and let's see what happens. That way, even if he still is bad then we'll have a good OL for the next QB. Again, we'll be filling up areas of need where I mentioned or trading back for more picks.

Also, nah it's not really a similar situation at all. Rosen had a 55% completion percentage his rookie year. Hurts had a 52% and then 61% completion percentage in year 2. Kenny has a 68% completion percentage. 

Rosen literally couldn't complete passes lol. Kenny is showing he can at least be a decently accurate thrower for now. He needs to improve on the INT's though. Anyways, most professional analysts say Kenny looks okay right now, he just is in a bad system right now with not great playcalling and still needs a better OL. Rosen looked like ass. Big difference, and the point I was making is that the Eagles allowed the team to get weapons, get the OL situated, and gave Hurts a couple of years to come to fruition with the system built around him. That's what we need to do.

We need to build a line around Kenny and see how he does the rest of this year and all of next year. Then there will be a QB discussion if he does poorly in 2023.

We have played a very tough schedule with an extremely dysfunctional offense. Young guys snagging tons of flags. And maybe a bottom to mid tier o line. 

We also added to that dysfunction a rookie QB who is going to make rookie mistakes. 

We have also asked Kenny to throw 50 times a game to try and keep us alive since our run game is still atrocious. 

Kenny for the most part has taken it on the chin well. If he can grow and improve I think he can very good.

If our offense can become efficient. Meaning doesn't take a ton of penalties or turnovers, he can be great. He has the accuracy and poise to grow into the ability to shred teams from the pocket underneath. 

Needs to work on his accuracy on the move and down field. As well as his ability to extend plays and make the right decision.

Seeing the field is another one, but I think some of that is confidence to stick in the pocket and make reads. Right now I've seen him do top tier caliber stuff but then I've also seen him just miss wideouts because he has defenses closing in.
