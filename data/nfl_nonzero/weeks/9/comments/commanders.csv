Sam Howell was projected to be the 1st overall pick of the 2022 draft after his sophomore season. He lost all quality talent on his team at UNC and that hurt his draft stock big time when he couldn‚Äôt repeat the success of the previous season. He was still expected to go in the first round even on draft day. He was projected that high for talent and potential alone. He has more arm talent than Heinicke and he has shown great instincts.

I think what you‚Äôre saying is that you want us to continue to focus on getting our franchise quarterback through the draft every year. And my response to that, with all due respect, is no shit.

34303,273731,273731,ninjagruntz,"‚ÄúI want us to draft a qb every season until we get ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù‚Äù

Jalen Hurts was not ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù the first season in Philadelphia. Jalen Hurts was not ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù the second season in Philadelphia. Jalen Hurts is now ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù the third season in Philadelphia.

By your logic, we would draft Hurts and then get rid of him after the first season.

Tua Tagovailoa same story in Miami. Josh Allen similar story in Buffalo. Geno Smith arguably the worst story here. Joe Burrow struggled his first year.

By your logic, we would draft any of these studs and then get rid of then after the first season due to performance as we need to go back to the draft to find ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù.

The exceptions seem to be Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, and Lamar Jackson. And it seems like your approach is to endlessly dump the Tua, Hurts, Allen, Geno, Burrow guys in hope of finding a Mahomes, Jackson, or Herbert guy.

Although the QB is arguably the most important position on the field, it‚Äôs still a team sport. Sometimes even the best QBs can‚Äôt make a shitty team competitive. But what‚Äôs becoming clear this season is that coaches need to create a plan around the players they have today, and not stubbornly implement a strict and complex system that doesn‚Äôt cater to the strengths of your current roster. That means sometimes a great staff can put a great product out on the field despite not having the best QB.

With your logic, you could forever be searching for ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think you need to be that cutthroat. I think you draft a good QB and build your scheme around him.

And for the record, Smith is the best QB we‚Äôve had in a long time‚Ä¶ 11-5 record.

Heinicke is very limited, is not the long term answer at quarterback, and threw a horrendous interception that cost us the game.

Heinicke has an intangible level of moxie that this team feeds off of. He gives us a better chance to win than Wentz. His mobility hides the many faults of the O-line.

Taylor looked fine apart from that last throw, he takes risks (Samuels TD), but we wouldn't have been in the game without him doing so. We know what he is - one of the best backup QBs in the game and super cheap for us at $4.75m/2 years. There's no doubt in my mind he'll go somewhere else for double that in the off season and end up starting a bunch of games to boot.
