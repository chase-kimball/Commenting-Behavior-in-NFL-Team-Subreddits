With Tua, the Dolphins's offensive EPA/play is a league-leading 0.18. Without him it's a league worst -0.11. Hill and Waddle are a huge, huge part of our offense, but we're a completely different team when it's Tua feeding them the ball.

When Mahomes won his MVP in 2018 throwing to Hill and Kelce who were two top ten receiving leaders (4 and 10 respectively), he didn't get knocked so hard for it.

It's not just that Tua ranks more highly in these stats, it's that in many cases he's blowing Mahomes out of the water in actual values as well. His EPA/Play is a whopping 0.404 to Mahomes's 0.310, for example. There's usually only one or two quarterbacks each year who post an EPA/Play over 0.3. Nobody has posted an EPA/Play over 0.4 since Rodgers did with 0.411 in 2011. Tua's current 9.28 ANY/A ranks third all time behind 2004 Manning and 2011 Rodgers. Mahomes's ANY/A is 7.62. Tua's DVOA is more than double Mahomes's at 51.0% to 25.2%.

I don't think there's any argument that Mahomes isn't the more talented quarterback. Physically there's no question; he's more durable, has much better arm talent, and adds more with his legs (even if that's not really his game most of the time).

Once again, we won a game that we would have lost in years past. A lot of flukey things happened that prevented us from taking off with the game. Much respect to Chicago though. They are figuring out how to play to their Qb's strengths.

I've been very supportive of Boyle with everything that's happened to our defense injury wise this year, but this was his worst game of the year, maybe worst since he's been here. The failure to spy Fields with a db when anyone sitting at home could see what change needed to be made was..... Hilariously bad. I hope he learns from this before we hit Buffalo again or kc potentially later on.

Overall this win was a solid B effort. If a couple small things go differently, we probably win 50-35.

1. Injuries, and
2. Performance in cold/windy/rainy games

I'm confident that he can fix the latter with more reps and more experience. I mean the guy grew up in Hawaii, went to college in Alabama and now lives in Florida, so it's understandable that he's less comfortable in bad weather at this stage. Unfortunately the injuries though aren't something that can really be avoided or fixed.

As far as McDaniel goes, again I mostly like what I've seen, but one thing I haven't loved is overly aggressive in-game decision making, like not kicking that FG to go up 2 scores in the Steelers game.
