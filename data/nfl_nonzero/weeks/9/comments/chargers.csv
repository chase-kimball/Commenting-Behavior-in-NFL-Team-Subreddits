Also, what Tua has now is better than anything Herbert has had up to this point. Keenan and Williams are great and I'm not knocking them but Tyreek and Waddle are in a different tier as a duo.

Edit: Here's some fun facts:

From 2020-2021, Tua had a .066 adjusted EPA/play (min 800 passes completed because Tua had 818) which ranked 20th in the NFL.

He threw over two TD's once and over 300 yards three times in 23 games.

In 2020, Miami had the 11th best defensive DVOA and 10th best in 2021. The offense was ranked 18th and 24th respectively.

It seems to me like it is. Remember the hail mary he tried to throw before halftime against the Broncos? Shit landed like 10 yards away from the endzone.

So he now mostly lives and dies by the O-line which is already not good.
