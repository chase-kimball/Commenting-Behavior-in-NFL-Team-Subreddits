The per game credit only goes to the season ticket holder, it will never transfer with resale of the ticket.

Saints game is a night game so heat/sun isn't an issue about where you sit. Club seats are ideal for when it's really hot so you can go indoors for relief.

Depending on how close to the stadium you're staying, an uber may be better than driving to the stadium yourself. The club gates open an hour before the regular gates so if you have club tickets you can get in earlier and go to the team store or eat/drink there. I think club is 2.5 hours before kickoff and regular gates 1.5 hour before. something like that.

But in this video, it looks like the right side has a nice space to run.  Hainsey quickly gets to the second level.  Mason and Wirfs handle Floyd and Donald.  Kieft bangs the DT.  Now I'm sure the Rams may have had more guys flowing to that side as they read the play.

Also, on another look, one could also maybe make the argument that it was Otton who should have gotten to 45.  I don't know.

As for the coaching and play calling specifically.


Here is a quote from Harold Goodwin the other day.  Sounds to me that Leftwich isn't calling plays to the strengths of the team.

>  'It’s in there. I can’t control what the play-caller calls,” Goodwin told Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times.  “But it’s in there every week. It’s basically our base play. You start with that to create everything you do in the run game, from play-action passes to what we’re doing running-wise.""

> “We have it in there,” Goodwin continued. “We have a lot of runs. It’s just whether we get to them or not. It’s how the play-caller is feeling. It’s my favorite play by far because we’ve have a lot of success with it. It just depends on whether Byron is feeling like calling it that day or not.

If we had played the ball there (which would be ridiculous to not have taken the spike to just get an idea of what to play), would that have been a legal move? Like they're not lined up at all, we would have been able to like bowl them over essentially, get wide open, etc.

Would that be legal? is that allowed? Have other people done that before?",1.0,buccaneers,t3_yo9ie4,False,0.0,:winfieldPeace: Winfield Jr. ✌️,2022-11-07T08:37:06Z,buccaneers,0.0011193287037037

Rodgers said he legitimately SAW our plays on the jumbotron. In OUR stadium.

Like every star in the universe is aligning to make us the worst possible team. We already are predictable, but on that 2pt conversion they showed the play we were going to run on the jumbotron.
