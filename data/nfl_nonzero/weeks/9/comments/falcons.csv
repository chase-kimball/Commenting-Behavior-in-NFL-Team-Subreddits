Wasn't really into football at that time but my step father liked the Patriots and my mom likes the Bears. Being from out of the area and a weird kid I had few friends those I did have all liked sports so I soon took a liking to football. 

My friends liked the following teams the Vikings, Chargers, Lions, Titans, and Rams. 

Being in Northeast PA I had to deal with many Eagles fans, Giants fans, and Steelers fans as well they were almost all quite a bother.

That eliminated so many teams to pick from. I then narrowed it down more from there and decided between the Falcons, Ravens, and the Texans. 

I liked the Falcons colors and being a weirdo I thought the Ravens being a spooky bird was cool as well. The Texans being the newest team in the league also made me think twice about them as they would be forever the underdog and everyone loves a good underdog. Almost made sense being a new fan to pick the newest team so no one could call me out for a bandwagon pick.

I chose the Falcons.

He's not toxic, or a troll. He posted this in the discord and a bunch of us laughed, so I told him to post it here.

>posts a low content post

This is not something that would fall under low content. Low content is to prevent stuff like title only posts or things that would be better suited as a comment in a GDT or PGT.

>calling one of our own players a clown

Bro if I removed every comment that could be taken as a personal attack against a player, there wouldn't be a subreddit. We have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/yo4iyk/i_fucking_hate_jonathan_vilma/) which could be taken as a personal attack against Vilma. We have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/yo2q78/mf_fumbled_a_fumble/) which is also making fun of Graham, and also has tons of comments going after him. And lord knows theres 87 posts about hating Mariota, shit there's even been posts specifically calling him a clown. 

This was something made in jest, not an actual attack like most other posts.
