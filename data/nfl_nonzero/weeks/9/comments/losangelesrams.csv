The defenders assignment depends on the route being run. So while the Rams play soft zone to prevent the deep pass they're also trying to give their secondary more time to see what route is being run. If you rewatch the game from this weekend you'll see that Troy Hill and Jalen Ramsey both played closer to the line of scrimmage on several plays but Kendrick didn't.

A QB is more valuable than a coach. OP said anything more than a 3rd would be insane.

I guess I’m also harsher towards him because we traded up to draft him in the 3rd round and drafted him out of Oklahoma.

So yeah, that’s why i’m so harsh towards him. Because of that + the way he plays. It’s one thing to just be outclassed talent wise, but when you find yourself in that situation, the least you can do for your teammates and team as a whole is to put in as much effort as you can to try and somewhat balance out the massive difference in talent. 

But the effort he puts forth is always just so piss poor that it’s pitiful.

Now i’m one of those that acts like the 40 yard dash is the end all be all, i’m simply using it as a piece of evidence to back up my point that he doesn’t have the speed or athleticism to play corner in the NFL. 

I also think Raheem Morris is utter dog shit. He seems like the type of guy in madden who runs the same scheme every play as well as only runs one of the 3 plays that show up on the screen at a given time. And seemingly possesses zero situational awareness. Say it’s 3rd and 5 on a must have it down against a team that’s incapable of running the ball and in a situation where everyone in the stadium knows the opposing team is going to run the ball. And he will still choose to play his corners 10-15 yards off the LoS. 

He’s just god awful. I don’t want to hear anything about him helping us win a Superbowl. The defensive personnel he had at his disposal is what helped win us a Superbowl. We won a Superbowl in spite of him, not because of him. 

And we held the Bucs to 9 points yesterday because of the Bucs anemic offense, not because of anything Raheem did. Perfect example of that being what we did on that final drive. He plays the exact same defense every game, in every situation, no matter what the personnel on the other side. Not to mention he doesn’t do a good job putting our defensive superstars in a position to succeed. Anytime a guy like AD, Jalen, or Von/Leonard Floyd last year made a play, it was because of them.

That’s a completely different point from the one you’ve been making. The point you’ve been making is that the Bucs ran the ball, which let the clock run, which shortened the game, which is the only reason they scored so few points. But that’s not true. They didn’t run the ball (only 20 attempts) and couldn’t run the ball (2.5 yd avg).

Now you’re changing your argument to “the threat of the run”? The threat of running doesn’t magically make the clock go. Even then, your new argument doesn’t work. The Rams consistently DIDN’T respect their ability, or lack thereof, to run the ball. They stayed in a two high shell the whole game. They didn’t bring any extra men into the box to prevent the run because it wasn’t needed.

The Bucs couldn’t run the ball (see previous), couldn’t convert on third down (42% conversion) and didn’t even have a high level of success throwing the ball (Brady QBR = 59). Despite this, they were given two possessions with two minutes left because our offense couldn’t gain more than 5 yards in the whole fourth quarter or get a single first down when needed.",2.0,losangelesrams,t3_yo8jhu,False,0.0,Blue & Yellow #28,2022-11-07T05:46:05Z,losangelesrams,0.02955081290139
