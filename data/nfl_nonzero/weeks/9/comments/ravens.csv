21748,126693,126693,PickAnApocalypse,"The Ravens are in a really good spot right now and I want to point it out because our blurb didn't.


They got a decisive victory over a decent team, broke their bullshit curse about losing when up by 2 scores at half, and enter the bye strong.


But further, they look like they have rectified the errors that plagued them early on.  The defense, with the addition of Roquan and the emergence of Hamilton as a stud, has become a fearsome unit, seeing production at each level on the field.  When Marcus Williams returns to the lineup and Ojabo makes his debut, this could easily be a top unit in the league.


But even further, Lamar looked much better last night than he has recently, making good decisions and reads, evading pressure, and generally looking more like his MVP self.  And that's with an offensive unit depleted by injury.  Which leads to my next point...


*Even further* the Ravens offense should scare the shit out of everyone, because they're good already and getting healthier.  The offensive line, with Stanley looking like he never left and Linderbaum looking like an anchor piece for years to come, has quietly become among the best in the league.  Some of our best offensive weapons - Dobbins, Andrews, and Edwards - are due to return from injury soon.  Bateman is unfortunately out but with the line playing the way it is, our healthy RBs, Likely and Andrews forming a formidable TE duo, and a scrappy set of receivers remaining (Duv is a legit WR2), this offense could also be a top unit very easily.


And the icing on the cake?  The Ravens have one of, if not the easiest remaining schedules.  I don't believe a single team on the schedule other than Bengals has a winning record rn, and that's the season finale.


The Ravens are well positioned to go on a hot streak,  claim the division, and enter the playoffs with momentum.  With many of their flaws exposed early on, they seem to be doing well in the course of fixing them and they could easily be a nasty problem in the AFC bracket.

I'm honestly wondering if he injured his throwing arm.

Balls he's hit with ease for four years are sailing wide. Lamar having a banged up arm would explain a *lot* about the last couple months imo.

2019 Chiefs 28.2PPG (5th)
2020 Buccaneers 30.8PPG (3rd)
2021 Rams 27.1PPG (8th) 

Average PPG = 27.2
Average position in scoring = 7th

I’m not saying you have to score 30 points per game. What I’m saying is on AVERAGE you need to score 27 points to win a super bowl. 

And on AVERAGE you have to be in the top 25% of scoring in the league.

Yes - there is Denver 2015, but excluding them everyone else is essentially 25PPG+ and top 10 minimum in scoring. 

Ravens are currently at 26PPG - which is 1PPG below the average needed to win an SB.

I have no doubt with our easier schedule that this number could increase. I’m just emphasising the importance of offense in winning a super bowl. 

It’s not a shitty take. Look at the stats.",8.0,ravens,t3_ylz7bb,False,0.0,Poor Mans Taysom Hill,2022-11-04T13:36:12Z,ravens,0.006760629822291
