The Oilers fined Williams and deducted $111,111 from his pay for the missed game, and Oilers owner Bud Adams publicly criticized him for having misplaced priorities.

22862,177191,177191,bingmyname,"1. I mean one of the points in this post is to bring in a veteran QB but you would do that with the intention of having Mills or your rookie start. The only reason to bench them is if there's regression/lack of applying what's being talked about in the room. But if you have that issue then yeah you already know you're guy isn't it. However, I don't see that being the issue with Mills here. I believe even if there was a competition at QB, he'd play at the same level. He's really gotten better and improved from week 1 till now but had so much to learn to begin with. No competition is going to suddenly make that go away and it's also not going to suddenly make the talent around him better. Texans should go about this as if they're trying to foster a friendly environment for a YOUNG QB. I actually think threatening to bench Mills would have the inverse effect of what you're intending which is why the Texans aren't doing it. You'd see way more frantic play. They took the pressure off with the intention of getting through some ugly so the process can result in a quality QB. Next year is a bit different now but I'd rather just go ahead and give Mills next year because you won't spend unnecessary capital to get one of the guys who's going to give you less than what Mills would.  Jimmy G, maybe, but I doubt he'd want to be a backup again and Baker is an absolute no. Doesn't fit the profile.
