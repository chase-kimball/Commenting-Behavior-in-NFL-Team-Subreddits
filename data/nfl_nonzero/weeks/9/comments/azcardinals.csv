So today at work I walked into the breakroom while some of my coworkers were having a conversation, and the first thing that I heard when I walked in was a female coworker saying ‚ÄúYeah, my keys are in my car.‚Äù

Thinking that she had accidentally locked her keys in her car, I asked ‚ÄúOh, do you need some help getting them out?‚Äù Everyone just glared at me silently for a moment which was really confusing. She eventually said ‚Äú‚Ä¶excuse me??‚Äù in a concerning tone.

Turns out that I misheard. She did NOT say that her keys were in her car. She said that her keys were in her *bra.* And I had just walked over and offered to help get them out.

IMO this roster is not very good. Its built mostly off of expensive injury prone vets. Even with Murray on his rookie contract, we had to lose talent last off-season because our cap is a total mess.... with a rookie QB contract. That mess got us a playoff exit. 

Keim did get us 1 playoff win but he also got us 2 failed HCs and a 1st overall pick. His drafts are terrible, and the only defense against that is a handful of players who really haven't been around long enough to crown.

Keim has been the constant here and along with him has been a constant theme of missing on picks, massive holes in the roster, poor oline, and injury prone players backed up with little depth. He cannot draft well enough to fill a rebuilding roster and because of that we never to through rebuilds. Instead we fill the roster with aging vets and get 1 year boom or bust windows between retools.

26611,234450,234450,xIILuLu,"Have people actually considered that might actually be a big reason why we suck? Have people actually considered that Kliff and Keim know way more about football than anyone in here and there is more to it than just these two persons?

I only see people here calling for Kliffs head because he calls a screen but the only explanation I then hear is ""It doesn¬¥t work"". But listen people just because something doesn¬¥t work doesn¬¥t mean it was the wrong call. Not only in football. It¬¥s always easier to say something was wrong in hindsight.

A lot of offenses are struggeling this season. Most defense protect the big plays with two-high defense for example forcing short and intermediate throws, like screen passes. So a screen could actually be a good playcall but there are good football players on other teams aswell and they might do a good play or we just execute badly which could be partly because we are heavily injured.

Lately I have a hard time reading this sub because people are so negative about everything it¬¥s so frustrating and demotivating. I think this team is in a big slump of form and needs to figure it out. Not Kliff or Keim alone is responsible for this and firing them has no guarantee in fixing it. In fact it could even make it worse.

It feels like I¬¥m the last one here that actually believes in this team, Kliff, Vance and Keim. Last season was the most fun I had watching an offense in a long time and it should be better with Hollywood which unfortunately we won¬¥t see for a while. But that offense was a Kingsbury offense.

The Defense is exceeding expectations for quite a while now and is a big play machine since Vance took over. Lots of game savings plays in the past seasons.

And this might be a shocker but I actually think Keim drafted well the past few seasons. I don¬¥t know why the fans demand one Aaron Donald in each draft class but have they actually looked at other teams drafts? The draft often is just a crapshoot and it often comes down to just luck. The Seahawks drafting players in the first noone ever heard of for years, the Browns drafted Baker Mayfield #1 and so on.

While it might be true that the most successfull teams over a period of time are the best at drafting by no means they find elite talent in every single draft or in the late rounds. Keim got us Humphries, Kyler, Budda, Byron, Jalen who are all top players on their positon. They might not play like it lately, but they are. Simmons and Zaven look like they could become a LB-Duo like Lavonte David and Devin White during Tampas SB run. Zach Allen plays like a stud and is gonna get extended. Rondale has enormous potential. Rashard Lawrence and Leki Fotu are contributing and are tremendous value for late round picks. Look what Eno is doing for a 7th rounder and I¬¥m sure I¬¥m forgetting some here.

And now you could argue ""Oh mimimi Keim drafted Isabella over Metcalf"". Yeah guess what... Easy to say in hindsight. Every team would¬¥ve drafted Metcalf higher if they knew before...

Sorry for my rant under your comment but I¬¥m just tired of this absolute negativity lately in this sub and game-threads. I get you guys are frustrated, I am too because deep down I know this team has the potential to go all the way eventually. But don¬¥t make yourself sick of it. At the end of the day it¬¥s just football. Don¬¥t get mad about things you can¬¥t change in life. Find something else in life that brings you joy and where you can control the outcome so your mood is not reliable on the outcome of a football game or a person getting fired. Oh and lastly I¬¥m pretty sure every single person on that team is not happy about the results and they would change it in a heartbeat if it would be as easy as people in this sub make it out to be.

And with that I¬¥m out.
