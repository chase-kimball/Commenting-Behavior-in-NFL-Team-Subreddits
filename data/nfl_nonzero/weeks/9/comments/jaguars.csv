30139,208350,208350,ddscience,"I've been working on a metric similar to what you described. The NFL provided some physical traits (height and weight) in the `players` dataset on Kaggle, which I've been trying to use in conjunction with their speed/acceleration on a given play's player tracking data. 

My goal being to represent OL vs DL matchups as two competing vectors of ""force"", with the ball/QB location as the origin or frame of reference that the DL is trying to get to and the OL is a force trying to act against it. A DL with nobody in their way can be used as a baseline for the time until they reach the QB. Adding in an OL on their directed path and then comparing the differences in time can help measure their ability. 

One thing I'm still trying to figure out is how ""non-physical"" aspects (e.g. ignoring biomechanics of leverage, height, weight, etc.) come in to play, because I know it does in real life (obviously). But it's hard to quantify. I'm assuming that two players with similar physical traits will cancel each other out when 1v1 in a basic scenario, but if one is winning at higher rates then it's time to look at other features they provided (like the PFF data with the named techniques used by a pass blocker or rusher to win).

One blown coverage for a deep bomb down field can swing the chances of winning a lot more than an individual ‚Äòplay‚Äô in basketball, hockey, and baseball where a team usually needs to be consistently outperforming their opponent in order to win.

In general I think all stats- when looking at matchups- should be able to be conveyed from both sides of the ball (start strength technically can, but DSR is much more valuable IMO). 

As for the layout, I think some sort of matrix/grid would work best, where each row would be a specific game/matchup and your stats would be in each column. The values at each intersection would be the difference between the home team‚Äôs offensive stat and the away team‚Äôs  defensive stat. 

The magnitude of this difference could then be visualized as a scale of colors with the far ends of the scale showing which team has a highly favored matchup, opposed to the radial diagrams here where the user has to perform the mental comparison for differences in scale in their head.

Taylor is the best on the OL right now tbh and he's absolutely benefitting from Scherff next to him. With the amount of draft picks we have and our WR move already made, it's not crazy to think we cut a few players like Shaq Griffin, maybe Agnew and sign Taylor.

Baalke has mentioned a desire to keep homegrown talent and the OL is Doug's baby of course so its not unreasonable to think Jawaan gets a payday. I'd do it",8.0,jaguars,t3_ym98yi,False,0.0,Jamal Agnew,2022-11-04T19:54:14Z,jaguars,0.05051015625
