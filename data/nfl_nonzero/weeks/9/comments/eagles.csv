Daniel Jones x2  
Heincke  
Elingher  
Dak  
Fields  
Dalton

Obviously, this isn't the cream of the crop and people are already saying Rodgers is washed so the only real QB they have left is Dak? Playoff picture as it stands is  
Geno  
Daniel Jones  
Dak  
Marriota  
Cousins

&#x200B;

The disparity between NFC Qbs and AFC is drastic, the Eagles can only play whom they have on their schedule but it looks like this thread can go into 2023 and the only ""real"" QBs they can play are Dak and whomever is in the SB.

I love relegation but i dont think it would ever fly in the states. Way too much money influence, owners would not be OK with the prospect of their $5 billion franchise losing 95% of its value because it had a bad decade. Had it been decided 50 years ago maybe, but it's too late to go that route now IMO.

It's also a problem for roster sizes & talent depth, considering american football teams have over 70 players instead of ~20, and average career lengths are ~5 years instead of ~15.
