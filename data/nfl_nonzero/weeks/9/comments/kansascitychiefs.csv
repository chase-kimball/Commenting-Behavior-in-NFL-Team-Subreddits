https://www.nflpenalties.com/drive-extending-penalties-all-time.php

Since 2009 the chiefs have been... average. Both in benefit and harm.


EDIT: I love this site.

Just to make it feel even more average, 
https://www.nflpenalties.com/automatic-first-downs.php?year=2022&view=total_for

This is the automatic first downs for just this year. KC seems to be high on this list. But looking at the details, KC is actually tied for second to last on 3rd and 4th down with only 2 this year. And only one in ""desperation"". So this year KC has gotten a lot of early down automatic first downs, but not many ""drive extending"" first downs.

EDIT 2: Even more looking around
The year 2021 https://www.nflpenalties.com/automatic-first-downs.php?year=2021&view=total_for

Hey look KC is number 1! This must prove it! 3rd down they are 5th with 10 first downs. Digging a touch deeper, they are mid on third and long and bottom tier on getting bailed out of ""desperation"" plays. So they get a lot of first down penalties but not many ""drive extending"" first down penalties unless you count an auto first down on 3rd and 4 a ""drive extending"" penalty.

Their numbers look a lot more average too if you look on a per game basis instead of absoulte.",57.0,nfl,t3_yoxncd,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2022-11-07T13:43:37Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0027958387655686

Maybe Tennessee should have kept running the ball, and continued to gash the defense like in the first half. Or maybe they should’ve not allowed Mahomes to convert a 3rd and 17 by running. Or perhaps they should’ve stopped the Chiefs on multiple fourth downs when our run game was awful.
