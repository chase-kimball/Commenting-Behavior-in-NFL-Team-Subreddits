A lot on people on this sub have ignored his crappy drafting because he drafted Jaire, Gary and Elgton. Well, outside of MVS every other pick in 18/19 produced negative value or didn't make the team. Not good.

2020 was really bad. Even though I love Dillon, it still seems like a waste to draft a RB in the 2nd when you have Jones. Runyan is the only other decent player and his PFF grades are not kind ( honestly, he's probably better than his grade but not by a lot). Then trading up to get Love.

Stand out moves through their FA signings of Amos, Smith, Smith, and finding some diamond in the rough guys (Campbell, Douglas). Drafting wise, they've done a decent job. Due to a myriad of things, it just didn't workout. You can argue they should have been more aggressive or ""all in"" going after trades during the run, or not drafting Love in the first, and could certainly make an argument. But it's undeniable: we were maybe one Bahktiari ACL tear away from another Lombardi trohpy.

You can add criticisms on Gute (the Love pick being too early to find a successor, not planning for this black hole of a WR room, etc.) But hey. They gave it as good a shot as you can ask for, and it just didn't happen. That's the fate of the vast majority of the league over the span of the last 4 years.

The *problem* though, and where it's ok to heap VALID CRITICISM on the FO, is how they have responded to the championship window [closing.You](https://closing.You) say just sit back and wait for 2023, but hate to break it to you: this run is *over*. With Rodgers contract, we are going to have a whole myriad of cap casualties so the roster on paper will be much worse. Rodgers will leave Green Bay with one ring.

What Gutenkunst has done is now try as much as he can to squeeze as much potential window out of this squad when it's largely in vain, in favor of planning more for the future.

THAT'S what many people are pissed about. We are still pussyfooting around the inevitable, which is that this team is neither in soft or hard rebuild mode, but also aren't in a win-now or even win eventually mode. Gutenkunst has kind of led us into football purgatory by signing Rodgers, and also neglecting the WR cabinet for years. If you trade rodgers and maybe even another piece or two over the off season, guess what: you can retool again, hope that love pans out, and if not still have a bunch of picks to find the next successor. At least there would be a plan moving forward. Now, we paid rodgers, his cap is going to just continue to go up, and you still have a bunch of other back-loaded contracts that puts us in cap hell next year.

Gutenkunst didn’t have the balls to do what was right for the future. Now he has us stuck in football purgatory for perhaps the next 5 years

edit: To be clear since evidently what I said was so black and white to you people and I have to fucking spell it out: Multiple things can be hindering us at the same time. Rodgers can be holding this franchise hostage for the next 2-3 years with his contract. Should have traded him. That doesn't mean everything gute did was gold, either, he shares a whole HEAP of blame here for him not having a clear rebuild or prolong that window as long as possible strategy. That's the thing with the team: there's not one thing or person to point the finger at.

The point I'm making, Rodgers on this team does nothing for us except prolong the inevitable, and puts in football purgatory. Sure, there's a *chance* we retool, get healthy, make the playoffs next year, but after that what's the point, highly doubtful we sniff another super bowl as Rodgers cap hit goes up even higher starting next year. Especially tough to reach another super bowl because we will have to gut this roster to get us out of cap hell starting next season, partly because of that Rodgers extension, partly other big contracts. So, the best thing for the team was trading him when his value was highest, it was the clear right move, that's not even debatable anymore. It would have given us SO much more leverage for the future, and it's what Gute should have stuck to his guns and done, because he had a clear path forward if he just had some balls. If we go through with the trade this past offseason, start Love the next 2 years and he sucks, oh well move on. 2020 draft is indefensible at that point, but hey we are rebuilding. Fire Gute whatever at that point, but look at all these picks the next GM can use. We still have a shit ton of top 100 picks to play with from the Rodgers trade where we can build the roster and hunt for another QB.
