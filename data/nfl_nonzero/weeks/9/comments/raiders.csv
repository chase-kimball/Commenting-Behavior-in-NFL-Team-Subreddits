>Okay, so you expect me to believe that you were the very best that your generation of Navy SEALs had to offer? I highly doubt that. If you were as good as you say you were, i don't think for a second that you would be browsing reddit. This is mostly a place for jobless neckbeards that still live with their parents, and nerdy high school kids that don't have any friends. It really isn't the place for highly-trained assassins to be hanging out in their spare time. Even if it was, something far worse than a troll being mean to you probably would have set you off a long time ago. What about the slew of gore and child pornography that gets posted here on a regular basis? Isn't that something that deserves a person being hunted down and made to regret their actions? Yeah, you're just not the reddit type. Sure, there's a wide variety of people that browse here, but you're far from the core demographic if you are who you say you are (which isn't the case). Even if it were true that you're an incredibly talented soldier, I think all the military discipline would prevent you from getting mad enough to murder some random idiot on the internet. I also doubt that even the best SEALs have a 'secret network of spies across the USA'. Why would all of the most expanisive Big Brother network in the world be willing to help a troubled PTSD-sufferer hunt down some random kid on the internet? That doesn't even make sense. If you're gonna try to scare somebody make it more believable than 'IM A SUPER SOLDIER HURR DURR'.

It makes waaaaaay more sense to start his reads to the right in that situation, especially with the offensive line the way it is.

McDaniels deserves a lot of criticism, but I think everybody misunderstood those quotes McDaniels/Carr gave to Vic, including Vic himself.  He’s not in Carr’s ear during the playcall saying “throw it to Jacobs, don’t look elsewhere.”  Instead it’s probably more of a “if it looks like cover 3, read the strong side linebacker.

42176,290272,290272,sergibby,"One “blessing” we have is it’s a pretty solid draft for all of our positions of need except maybe safety and linebacker, but those shouldn’t be taken in the first round anyway.  Some prospects we should take a look at with a top 5 pick (not in order):

QB:  Bryce Young is amazing and Alabama’s scheme is quite similar to what we run with McDaniels.  Downside is he’s like 5’10 185 lbs.  CJ Stroud from Ohio State is another great looking QB, athletic but mostly tries to stay in the pocket.  Checks all the boxes physically.  Downside is Ohio State’s receivers are so good he doesn’t have to make the difficult throws often, and he doesn’t look at good as Bryce Young when he is pressured.

O-line:  There’s a left tackle from Penn State that’s an absolute monster.  I can’t remember his name and haven’t looked into him much (obviously), but he’s getting a lot of hype in draft circles.  Downside is he plays left tackle and it’s always risky moving to right tackle, which either him or Kolton Miller would have to do if we drafted him.

Edge:  Will Anderson from Alabama is getting Von Miller comparisons.  Downside is he’ll sometimes miss tackles in the backfield, but he causes so much chaos that it’s not a big deal.

Interior DL:  Jalen Carter from Georgia.  He’s been injured for most of this year, but assuming he can show some good tape the rest of this year, you can lock him in for a top 5 pick.  Personally, this is who I would want if we don’t go QB.

It’s kind of early in the season to really project where most of these guys will go.  Normally after the bowl games and college playoffs are over we’ll have a decent understanding of who the top guys are.

42183,290283,290283,sergibby,"A few things.  First, the Saints defense, while not playing great this year, is built to stop an offense like ours.  They can stop the run despite having light boxes because their two linebackers (Demario Davis and Pete Warner) are ridiculous when it comes to moving downhill and taking on blocks.  Second, Davante dealing with whatever bug he had completely neutered our most effective weapon.  The rookie corner played fine against him, but something wasn’t right with Adams and I think that messed with our intended gameplan.  Third, our offensive line was shit.  I think the pressure rate was about the same as it was against the Texans and Chiefs, but not having Davante and also having more yards to gain for first downs because of the ineffective run game meant longer dropbacks and passes to Mack Hollins and Foster Moreau.  Playing from behind most of the game also allowed the defense to “pin their ears back” and not even have to worry about the run.

There’s probably some schematic issues to dig into but I don’t want to review the game that closely lol.  I think more than anything this game shows how important it will be to have Waller back on the field.  Those linebackers might be more hesitant to crash the line to defend the run if they think Waller might be behind them - and if they did sell out on the run, Waller is taking a playaction pass over the middle and gaining an easy 25 yards from it.",2.0,raiders,t3_ymbbl2,False,0.0,:96:,2022-11-04T21:09:41Z,raiders,0.012474945270211
