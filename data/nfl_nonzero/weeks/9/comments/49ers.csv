I think that‚Äôs what a lot of people are doing with the Seahawks this year.

Probably true that their competition has been weak, but so has ours ‚Äî some would say that their wins over the Chargers and Giants are more impressive than any of our wins since the Rams are just not very good this year (the caveats you have previously mentioned for those Chargers/Giants wins notwithstanding).

I think the point about the Gordon/Williams fumbles is kind of silly just because so, so many games comes down to a small set of plays like that, and (1) you should give credit to teams that make plays to pull out wins like that and (2) you‚Äôre speculating on what would have happened in the absence of those fumbles anyways. Like, if you‚Äôre going to discount wins that come down to singular plays like that, then the 2019 Niners were a fraudulent #1 seed since if the Seahawks did not delay of game at the end of our Week 17 matchup, they probably win that game.

Also, ‚Äúonly 2 times they have faced a good defense they have shut down‚Äù? I don‚Äôt see any game this year besides our win over them where they were shut down by a good defense. They scored 23 and 32 points in their other two losses.

I think you are also still not acknowledging other points I‚Äôm trying to make here like the very legitimate talent that the Seahawks have. I don‚Äôt get how you can see that team and what they‚Äôve accomplished despite being a young team with very low expectations this year and not have at least some small amount of trepidation.

As an aside I have to say it‚Äôs always very frustrating in these sorts of Reddit discussions when people cherry-pick quotes from comments like you‚Äôve just done without responding / acknowledging the majority of the points I made (e.g. their high-caliber rookies and improvements on defense).
