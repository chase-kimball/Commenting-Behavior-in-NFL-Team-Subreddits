For QBs, that applies far more to standing in the pocket for too long, than being a runner. See all the examples I gave.

That is why I have always been adamant in upgrading our OL (plus the benefits in our run game)

I can even add Tua to it:

His big injury at Bama was from scrambling and looking to pass, where he was protecting the ball and reading the field, not being a runner where he can protect himself

His unfortunate injury vs us was from shuffling in the pocket and passing the ball, he wasn't trying to run over Matt Milano

And yes, the wear and tear is cumulative. No where did I say the opposite, but you were trying to compare his mileage to a running back (workhorse or committee member, Allen still takes far far less abuse than a running back).

You just aren't as fast/agile in your 30s (without the physical abuse) as your are in your 20s.

Same reason why CBs fall off a cliff too (athleticism dependant position)

Old WRs get by on savvyness/route running and still having their elite contested catching skills (if they had them to begin with)

I do feel like that will happen to Allen but seeing as he can still be a good QB but without relying on his legs too much, it's not that big an issue.

Not the only reason, as there is the wear and tear argument but:

2.) It's all perspective

* And yes that is 10 more than a typical QB, who takes zero

Do QBs somehow just have different physiologies?

You aren't protecting/bracing when you pass the ball, your focus is on your reads/targets and throwing the ball and you can get hit without knowing it

(Discounting non-contact and wear-and-tear injuries, which factor into neither scenario)

To respond to your corresponding tone:

If your options are stand there and get hit, or go out and hit others. I'd rather do the latter.

20023,136512,136512,PoogeneBalloonanny,"1.) I wasn't on the OBJ camp to begin with but that game was the tipping point

Davis has been healthy for a good while now and has not shown he can be a great and *consistent* WR2 aside from the occasional explosive plays.

He has had costly drops and mostly been silent vs GB and NYJ now.

2.) Dorsey needs to get less cocky with his late play calling in close games.

We had a bad (but luckily in the end meaningless) 3 and out vs Baltimore, we stopped running and spreading the ball in the short passing game vs GB and last night that horrendous pick after Von got us the ball happened on a deeper long developing play on 2nd and 10.

Go for shot plays when we are up 2 scores please.

3.) The specific offensive gameplan didn't make sense to me

NYJ have 2 great outside corners, and yet we were tunnel visioned to Diggs and Davis. Should have been spreading it out more to Shakir/iMac/Cook and Knox. I know they have a tought front but we should have been doing more unconventional runs (iMac sweeps, toss plays etc).

4.) I get the Hines usage but the ONE target baffled me.

New back new system, not expected for him to be getting big usage. But why why is his ONE target a deep sideline go ball on tight man coverage???

Having no snaps and no targets makes more sense than one snap to do your best Randy Moss impression on a key 3rd down.

5.) Broadcasters/refs were weird

Thought Edmunds had the Ball but understand that call

Dion's holding penalty that erased a beautiful 20ish yard gain that killed to clock on the final drive was massive. Not tin foil hatting, but come on at least show the hold?

6.) Beane is good but NOT PERFECT and there needs to be a *tiny bit* of accountability

I have always maintained Beane is good not great and have gotten flak for that. IMO his best demonstrated skill is contract negotiation and pulling off the impossible with shrewd moves. I maintain that he or his team is a below average talent evaluator.

It is really showing this year, in a draft where we are top contenders: Elam has a bright future i hope but is only a contributor out of necessity, Cook is coming into gear but still meh for a 2nd rounder, Bernard is just a backup and looks like a reach for his draft position. Granted we have some late round ""steals"" like Shakir and Benford. 

But the usage of our day 1 and 2 capital hasn't been great. And outside of Allen, Diggs and maybe Rousseau and Motor. His early draft record is above average at best but not spectacular.

Josh cannot miss December if we are going to be a top seed in the playoffs. 

We can ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù as it says November imo. 

I think a far majority of reasonable Bills fans can agree that if you were going to pick a month to be without Josh between November 2022 and December 2022, November 2022 would win in a landslide.

This is not absolutes. It‚Äôs not easy or hard.

We needed him with the brutal schedule before the bye. 
We need him to close out the AFC East in December and January. 

The rest of November, the Bills should be able to pull 2 wins and let Josh rest.

That will only flush him out of the pocket. 

They were clearly trying to rush four and get to his hand. 

This is a different approach that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve seen before. 

They want him in the pocket. They want him standing tall and they are changing their rush point to get to within arms length of his hand. 

Defensive tackles have some pretty long arms. 

The O-line needs to be aware of this and do something to counter. They need to keep the arm close to Josh engaged in a fight not let them hit Josh‚Äôs hand.

You're referring to [this](https://twitter.com/PHLEaglesNation/status/1588161574442704898) tweet, right?

Something seemed... off about those rankings (especially KC's), so I dug into the link that's referenced from that tweet, and happened upon [this image](https://phlsportsnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.13.28-AM.png).

Those numbers aren't right. 

Doing the math for the record of who the Eagles have played so far:

- Lions 1-6
- Vikings 6-1
- Commanders 4-4
- Jaguars 2-6
- Cardinals 3-5
- Cowboys 6-2
- Steelers 2-6
- Texans 1-6-1

That's a combined record of 25-36-1. Which gives around a .403 win percentage. Again, that's for games played so far.

I did also find this although personally without seeing how they're getting their stats I'm skeptical: 
https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/ranking/schedule-strength-by-other

I do like this one a bit more especially with regards to how it treats past and future SoS:  https://www.sharpfootballanalysis.com/nfl-stats/strength-of-schedule/

TL;DR - Eagles are good. Not arguing that, but I do agree with the sentiment that the schedule they've had so far has been easier than the average based on win percentage. Second half of the schedule looks tougher, and I'm interested in seeing how they play against the Giants as well as the Cowboys with Dak healthy.

Edit: Ah shoot, I just saw /u/ndkjr70 's comment below. They're right, that record referenced by the tweet comes from [here](https://eatdrinkandsleepfootball.com/schedule/strength-of-schedule.html).
