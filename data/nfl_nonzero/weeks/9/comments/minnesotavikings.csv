Our wins haven't been blowouts, but all that ultimately counts is winning. It should be a testament to our defense that we've been able to win even when our offense has been stagnant. Our one loss came week two against the only undefeated team, and that's with an entirely new FO, scheme on both sides of the ball, and coaching staff. I think 7-1 for a team with a clean slate isn't too bad and should be a good sign for the future
