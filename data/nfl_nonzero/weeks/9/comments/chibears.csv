And if we had to lose a game, it's better for it to be one like this where Fields played out of his mind (and made history), and put the team in a position to win the game at the end. It's better that we lost because of the refs and a drop by EQSB instead of Fields forcing an interceptions or losing the game, himself. In the end, these types of close-losses still accomplish many of the things we need to be set up really really nicely in the future. 

Hardest thing is to get the QB position down. We potentially have a franchise QB on a rookie contract, who continues to ascend each and every week with minimal talent surrounding him.

50412,316739,316739,qb1avellini,"I’m really hoping Skoronski in the first round. 2nd round WR, 3rd round DE. From there, more shots at DL and C.

Edit: fuck it, I feel like throwing more of my unknowledgeable opinion in. I think Skoronski is a great pick if we’re drafting in the later parts of the top 10. Likely, Anderson, Carter, Murphy will be gone by when we pick (I’m thinking we’d pick around 7-10) and I doubt we grab Young or Stroud. 

Skoronski is one of the top OL in the draft, and is projected to go right around where we pick IMO. Pace’s reputation as a former OL and his purported strength is identifying good OL players to rebuild a line with, as evidenced in KC. Peter is a hometown kid that has a lot of great measurables and smarts and has been great at pass pro. While he may not be stick at LT wherever he lands (some scouts have him as a better fit as guard), he’s got the potential to like Slater. Add in Pace’s affinity for Braxton Jones, where it gives him the flexibility to put him at RT or swing tackle if he doesn’t progress to his potential and I would think that Pace sees an opportunity to potentially grab a franchise tackle to add to some already great young pieces. Shout out to Tev Jenkins who is an absolute stud at guard. It also allows us to potentially put Borom at swing tackle or backup where I think he probably lands on a SB caliber team. 

Adding another layer, I think the trade for Claypool at the TDL let’s Pace breathe a little when it comes to finding talent for Justin to throw to. While a stud WR would be huge (and by no means am I opposed to grabbing Addison or JSN), I think Pace sees that you’ve got two #2 WRs in Claypool and Mooney for Justin to target but should probably take a shot at a high potential guy in the second round. It’d be great to have our own second which would allow us to grab someone for our DL with one of our second, depending on BPA and the other at WR. 

Anyways, those are my thoughts on the draft and how Pace might view things. Please keep in mind, I’m an idiot so who knows how wrong I’ll be when the time comes, but I think it makes sense.",1.0,chibears,t3_yn17le,False,0.0,FTP,2022-11-05T17:14:09Z,chibears,-0.0217121477770722

I think back to games like the recent colts packers game where they were granted 6 penalties on a final drive (AND STILL LOST). I think of almost every single lions game in recent history where they should have won a majority of them but were absolutely screwed. I think of TDs being taken away from the bears on questionable calls, I think of holding calls not called, I think of extremely soft RPI calls that would never get called for anyone else. And the most important part people do not realize is two calls are not made the same. A drive extending penalty on a third down vs a first down are not the same. A penalty that cancels a 3rd down conversion for the other team vs on a 1st are not the same. Every time I watch a packer game I always see questionable calls in their favor. Things that are super obvious where bias does not play a part. Never see it that consistently for other teams.
