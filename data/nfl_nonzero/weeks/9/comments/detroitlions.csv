If you guys somehow win the super bowl I won't be mad bc he deserves to feel what it likes to win. Lol As for the trade, he's injured a lot, and at least the past two years, when he's not, he's not top 3 of our teams passing Focus. He's getting older and so contract negotiations would be coming up. We just drafted the rookie te and I think the coaches see him as the future. And a young team definitely has potential. So I hope that pays off. But only time will tell on that, as well as the people we get from the draft picks. I think its a bit of a bummer to lose him at this point bc he can be a comfort throw for Jared. And it hurts to go to in division. But if the coaches so see paying him and/keeping him, might as well leverage that to get Something. So I'm ok with it.
