I've really changed my opinion on Saleh, he was playing the long game while a lot of us were giving reactionary, emotional takes (I include myself, not throwing shade at others). I thought he was too soft but the way Moore has been put in the doghouse shows me that behind the scenes he does have a bit of a savage side.

Is the best corner someone who is a lock to erase the teams top WR from the game, or someone who is also unbelievable in coverage, in addition to creating more turnovers?

Like I think it’s fair to say he’s the best lockdown corner. He would just erase a teams top WR. That being said, he also didn’t get as many turnovers. Perhaps if he baited QBs more to throw he would have had more picks, but he also prob would have give up more yards.
