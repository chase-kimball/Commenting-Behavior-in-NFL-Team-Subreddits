**Biggest strength:** Interior defensive line. Leonard Williams got his big-money extension, and Dexter Lawrence may very well be next in line, with his 90.1 grade the sixth-best mark among interior defenders. Lawrence‚Äôs 90.5 pass-rush grade is a career high and second-best among interior defenders so far this season. His 16.2% pass-rush win rate ranks seventh. 

**Biggest weakness:** Wide receiver. New York signed Kenny Golladay to a four-year, $72 million deal over the 2021 offseason and then used a first-round pick on wide receiver Kadarius Toney. Neither scored a touchdown for the Giants since, with Toney now a member of the Kansas City Chiefs. Second-round pick Wan‚ÄôDale Robinson has become more involved each week and has the speed to take the top off opposing defenses and the short-area quickness to get open early for quarterback Daniel Jones.

**X factor for second half:** Edge defender Kayvon Thibodeaux. He‚Äôs had some pursuit tackles that make the pre-draft concerns about his lack of effort seem ridiculous in hindsight, but he hasn‚Äôt quite become a difference-maker as a pass rusher ‚Ä¶ yet. However, it looks like he very well could end up as the best edge defender of the trio taken in the top five of the 2022 NFL Draft.",87.0,nygiants,t3_yp42a1,False,0.0,:Helmet_Catch: Helmet Catch :Helmet_Catch:,2022-11-07T17:11:45Z,nygiants,0.0713157303621828
