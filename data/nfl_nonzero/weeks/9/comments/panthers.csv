6485,40318,40318,DarthLordDonkey,"Short answer is Madden, Steve Smith, and my dad.

Long answer is when I was around 10 I was playing Madden (I believe 06/07) and when you start up the game, it asks you who your favourite team is. At the time I had only ever played the video games with my brother, and had only watched the CFL. So I didn't really have an answer. 

I defaulted to the Dolphins since I liked their colours, but didn't like their roster so I went and asked my dad who I should cheer for. He was watching an NFL game and they showed a Panthers highlight, and he said ""I dunno, but Steve Smith just made a nice catch for the Panthers."" I immediately went to the game, went to the Panthers roster, and noticed Smith was highly rated, plus I loved the colour scheme. They bacame my defacto favourite team, and I used them in Madden from then on.

I didn't truly follow the NFL until I was about to enter High School and play myself. I chose to truly start cheering for the Panthers and loosely follow them in 2010 (Clausen year). The next year, I started to watch more games which was Cam's rookie year and I fell in love with his play. The next year they drafted Luke, changed the logo, and I haven't (intentionally) missed a game since 2012.

You could probably go through every championship in every league and give reasons why a team didn't deserve to win. I've never understood people that diminish championships. In any league, to be the top team at the end is incredibly difficult. 

Guys like Tom Brady have skewed the narrative, and made it so if a QB doesn't deliver multiple Super Bowls, they are somehow failures. On one hand you can criticise Rodgers and the Packers for only having one ring during his long, successful tenure. But on the other hand, he's helped guide a consistent contender for over a decade, and delivered a championship for the team that drafted him, while putting together an unquestionable Hall of Fame career.

Even if the Rams won the super bowl, the Panthers have had good luck picking at the bottom of the 2nd round with Moton and Chinn.

Listen - if you’re talked about as an MVP candidate for the majority of the season, you’re an MVP candidate. The year Lamar Jackson won MVP he was the ONLY one who got votes. Does that mean he was the only candidate ? Obviously not. So there, in that one example, it’s clear that votes =\= mvp candidacy. Last year Derrick Henry was an MVP candidate until he got injured, but no votes in the end. 


Do you think there wasn’t a reason why the Broncos gave up so many assets to get Russ? You think there wasn’t a reason why NOBODY criticized them for doing so?
