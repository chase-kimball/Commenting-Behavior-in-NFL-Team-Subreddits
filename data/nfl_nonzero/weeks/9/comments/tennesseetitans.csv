He was already on the roster bubble coming into 2022, and at this point with his availability concerns it seems too risky to just roll him back next year. It made sense for 2022 to give him another year, but relying on him in 2023 is just setting ourselves up for disaster.

I don't think Vrabel has said anything about him being a possible activation from IR either, and he's at least said something about most of the other guys on IR with a chance to come back. Jones may have just quietly had a season ender that we didn't get full confirmation of.

He's been a month and a half without practice, he would need a week of practice at minimum to ramp up for a game, so you're looking at...idk December before he can play if he gets healthy soon?

He didn't light the world on fire at camp, so much so that the Titans traded for Daley to get some better depth at tackle. That doesn't inspire confidence to me that they think he could be an upgrade over even Daley.

We also have the limited IR activations to consider for this season. We're already used two of our eight now and I count three guys (Philips, Ola, and McMath) that I would rather activate than Jones. I have my doubts McMath will be healthy to play in 2022 at this point though, so Jones may be number three on the list, or the fifth hypothetical activation of eight, and we've got nine weeks of season left to play

A lot of people could be better than Daley, but there's plenty of reasons to think Jones may not be one of those guys or may not be available for us in 2022. I think at this point Radunz is the only serious option we may have inside the building to get better at LT.

2013,18700,18700,Bieber_hole_69,"We already have an elite run defense.

Literally the only thing Abram is good at is run defense. We don't need him. He'd be a special teams player for us. Adams has shown more than enough to warrant being on the field as well, we have great depth at safety.

Putting Cunningham and Abrams on the field at the same time is a recipe for death by play-action lol.

If we moved Hooker to slot corner, where do you propose Molden goes when he is activated? We play those big nickel looks with Molden as the 5th DB, and Adams can be the 6th DB for dime packages. 

Our best combination of DBs is Fulton, McCreary, Molden, Byard, and Hooker, with Adams as the 6th guy. Abrams just would not factor into the conversation as even a rotational piece. He'd be on the bench or on special teams over Kalu. I don't think Abrams would be willing to accept a role like that when he can probably see the field somewhere else and try to get another contract this off-season.

Even then, Molden and Hooker have missed multiple games this year and we haven't really missed a beat with guys off the street at safety/nickel. I think the Vrabel/Bowen scheme just lends itself to good safety/nickel play. Remember when Buster Skrine came off the street and played great for us?

2023,18714,18714,Bieber_hole_69,"I typically avoid this subreddit as much as possible after losses. There is just nothing to gain and it's pretty hard to say or make an argument for anything reasonable.

Everyone should be fired/cut/benched after every loss and the season is over, etc. You would think the season was over at 2-2 last year or 0-2 this year.

I guess it's a product of the success, everybody loses their minds after the team loses any games because they're only losing five times a year in the regular season now. This place was more reasonable when we were 2-4 and the season legitimately seemed over during the 2019 season before Mariota was benched. But we've lost 16 times in the last 51 regular season games, it's an anomaly to deal with losses now and that's a pretty crazy thing to think about.

Would anyone have been upset yesterday afternoon if you told them we would go to OT with the Chiefs while our backup QB started and completed single digit passes again? I don't think so, I think most would have been pretty impressed by that outcome, but the reaction after watching how painfully the game slipped away causes irrational thinking.

When we look back on this game in 5 months, I think everyone will have a more reasonable perception of what happened. You can't win them all, so you can't let every loss feel like the sky is falling. 

The f'ing Bills are 0-2 in the AFC East, every team is gonna have a bunch of losses that sting. At least we're still in total control of the AFC South, have our QB coming back soon, two WRs coming back, and two great pieces in the secondary returning (hopefully) this week.

2025,18718,18718,Bieber_hole_69,"[Downing called pretty much exactly what you were talking about here](https://twitter.com/noflagsfilm/status/1587134514559582209?s=46&t=9zQ4RKrMWSL4YBmuBe7IUA) 

I-formation, play-action, 10-yard dig and 10-yard out. Both receivers wide open and Malik just didn’t throw the ball. 

Malik did the same thing in the pre-season and got pulled early for it then. [His interception on Sunday was a throw over the middle that was way too late.](https://twitter.com/mikeherndonnfl/status/1587239505416916993?s=46&t=9zQ4RKrMWSL4YBmuBe7IUA). Pretty much exactly what you suggest there too, literally a 15 yard flat post to Hollister. It’s open if Malik can just get the ball out on time and doesn’t hesitate.

[Then that corner to Chig](https://twitter.com/noflagsfilm/status/1587137809965514752?s=46&t=9zQ4RKrMWSL4YBmuBe7IUA). Nobody within 5 yards of him, but Willis holds on to the ball. Hesitation lets the rush get there and he can’t set his feet so he overthrows what should have been a TD if he got the ball out on time.

Todd had a couple duds on Sunday, bit you can’t scheme for a QB that’s like 3 seconds too late on everything. Malik just cannot process his reads as quickly as he needs to and even then is hesitant to throw when he gets to the right read. He never had to do any of this stuff in college, so of course it’s all a learning experience, but there’s not much a coordinator can do to help that when he gets put on the field and has to play.

The game is just way too fast for him at this point. The same stuff he was struggling with in preseason is still there. Play calling and scheme can only fix so much unless you want to install a whole new offense the week before a game.

If Tannehill had a long-term injury and Willis was the starter for the rest of the season, then yeah, they need to install from the ground up as much as they can during the season to mold this offense for Willis. But Tannehill will be back sooner rather than later and they can’t really do a mini-training camp in prep for a spot-start or two. They were not confident in Willis and tried to put as little as possible on his shoulders, and he still couldn’t handle that much.

I don’t think Downing is a great OC or anything, but he’s gotten better as the season has gone on and he’s been dealt a pretty shit hand when it comes to personnel. On the left side of the line there’s a turnstile on the end and the smallest lineman in the league playing guard. Any offense is going to have a failure to launch when blindside pass protection has both of those things going against it. What more can he do?

Now he’s got a rookie QB starting that simply cannot run an NFL offense. Short of getting Willis a helmet radio that doesn’t shut off during the play so he can yell “THROW THE BALL” in his ear, how can he put the offense in a position to succeed other than running 40 times into stacked boxes?",11.0,tennesseetitans,t3_ymge6t,False,0.0,11,2022-11-05T00:35:14Z,tennesseetitans,0.022789047204181

The Titans don't often give rest days a ""NIR - Rest"" designation, most of the time for vet rest days they list something as an injury.

Passing needs to be quick, efficient, and accurate. Essentially it should be used to obtain ""easy"" yards with yards after catch emphasis. It must be a consistent threat even if not the primary point of attack.

But the run game should be the focus with an Oline strong enough to open gaps for our runner and can at least delay any pass rush a few seconds.

We are struggling because we really have neither. Our passing game isn't very efficient or consistent. Often nabbing 2 or 3 yards shy of what we need if we connect at all and usually requiring more time than the QB has before he's sacked.

The Oline is raw in places and outright awful in others, both in opening gaps consistently and keeping the pass rush managed. This negatively impacts the run game but even more so the passing game which allows the defense to more aggressively focus on stopping the run.

And he just can't compensate the scheme to promote the strengths of more limited talent.

Maybe if we switch to mostly TE's instead he could make better use of it. Historically though the Titans haven't used their TE's very effectively, Jonnu Smith is a great example of a very talented TE that maybe only got used 60-80% of what his potential was IMO.

Everyone was certain he was the problem--I saw convincing film breakdowns of how bad his playcalling was, people raging about how misused certain players were, etc.

Then in the off-season JRob invests heavily in rebuilding the defence and we go on to have one of the best defensive seasons in the league, and it turns out that at least in part the players actually WERE the problem, and Bowen had been working around their limitations all year. Yes, I know we also hired Schwartz, but it would be churlish to suggest that our improvement was all down to him. Hell, I've even heard a couple of off-hand suggestions that Bowen could be considered for some HC jobs.

I do think Vrabel is stubborn about sticking with his guys, and I also think that JRob's whole philosophy means we're unlikely to see any effective reconstruction of our offence like we saw with our defence.

So far, I like the 2022 draft but it’s too early to fully evaluate it like you said. I agree that people bashing Bud are incorrect and ignore the effect he has on the defense. I’d even add Autry as a great addition, but the only drawback with him is that he’s 32 as a physical DE/EDGE guy and may or may not contribute to the team beyond this year or next. 

It all comes down to young talent acquisition. This team needs several more guys who have some experience but are still developing and getting better. It’s really hard to win long-term with an offense full of replacement level players, unproven youngsters, and older guys who may have lost a step.

McCreary, Chig, and a couple other rookies look promising so far, but their long-term outlooks remain to be seen. When you look at acquisitions (FA, trades, draft) from 2020 & 2021, there are just so few guys who have panned out and are still contributing just a couple years later. 

It’s really hard to have sustained success when you have back-to-back years of failing to add playmakers to the team. I’m not calling for his job by any means, but he and his guys really need to take another look at how they evaluate talent and try to figure out why they’ve struggled recently to get impact players.

Where AJ is concerned, I feel like JRob got kinda worked over by Brown and his agent which looks pretty bad on Robinson’s track record. However, I won’t roast him too much for that unfortunate circumstance because he’s mostly been good with keeping guys he should keep. I will, however, be very critical of him if we are sitting here a year from now and the WR corps is still as destitute as it looks right now.",4.0,tennesseetitans,t3_ypt4vp,False,0.0,:Titans2:,2022-11-08T16:21:20Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0421570455580628
