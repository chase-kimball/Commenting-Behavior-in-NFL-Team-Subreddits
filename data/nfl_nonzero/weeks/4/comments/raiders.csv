It hasn't been a highly requested item on /r/NFL (at least while I was a mod). If anything there's been more pushback around it since ""why would people root for multiple teams"". 

Also, differences in CSS can cause different issues to pop up. It's not a huge deal, but some small differences for us with dual flairs broke our CSS pretty significantly, which we had to work through. 

So, basically, a combination of it being a low-priority item for users, negative feedback around it, and some difficulties getting it implemented made it take longer than we would have liked.

My teams didn't have 3 numbers for runs, so this answer is going to be a little ""fuzzy"", but basically

- First word is likely the formation. ""Blue"" is a common formation name in West Coast Offense systems

- The numbers generally refer to which back is running the ball (for us it was 1 for QB, 2 for back behind the QB, and 3 for the HB if we were in I formation) and then which hole they're going to hit. So for example, 29 Sweep in a Singleback formation would be the sole RB receiving the pitch and running to the '9' hole. If you aren't familiar with hole numbers, basically 0 is the center, then even numbers are the spaces between OL from the center out (so 2 is between Center and Guard, 4 is G/T, etc). Odd is to the left

- BuckSweep basically designates what the play itself is and how it should be run. A Buck Sweep is a toss play where both guards pull to the toss direction. 

So basically ""Blue [9]29 Buck Sweep"" means ""line up in the Blue formation, and the sole RB is going to take a pitch to the left, aiming for the 9 hole, and both guards are pulling in that direction while everyone else blocks play-side""",39.0,nfl,t3_xtez8x,False,0.0,:Raiders: Raiders :Jaguars: Jaguars,2022-10-01T23:32:58Z,raiders,-0.0253164129863285
