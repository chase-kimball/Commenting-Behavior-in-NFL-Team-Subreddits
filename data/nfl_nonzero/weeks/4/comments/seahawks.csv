At the time, I was heavily into gaming, and football (soccer) and really wanted the 2016 Seattle Sounders Kit, as the sponsor was Xbox, and the colours looked cool. As my parents were going to Vegas to celebrate the birthday, I asked if they could try to find the kit for me. When they came home, they told me that while they couldn’t get the Sounders kit, they did happen to pick up an (American) Football jersey instead. My dad handed me a crisp new Richard Sherman Hawks jersey, and I thought if I’m gonna wear it, I may as well learn about the game.

8684,64906,64906,Esuu,"Going through the lineup:

* Julio Rodriguez(R): a 21 year-old rookie CF who has been absolutely electric, and will very likely win rookie of the year. He also just signed a super long(and complicated) contract to essentially be a Mariner for life. Probably the best player on the team currently.
* Ty France(R): plays 1B and was acquired from a trade with San Diego in 2020 as a prospect/compensation for Austin Nola. He broke out last season and was a big part of the playoff push last year and continues to be one of our best hitters.
* Mitch Haniger(R): plays RF/DH and has been one of our best players since getting him in a trade with Arizona in the 2016 offseason. His problem has always been staying healthy(he missed about half the season). Last season after barely missing the playoffs he wrote a Players Tribune article that is definitely worth the read.
* Eugenio Suarez(R): plays 3B and was a part of a trade with the Reds. He was originally meant to be a salary dump but has ended up being the best part of that trade. Power hitter and great fielder. Good Vibes Only.
* Carlos Santana(S): Plays DH/1B. Got him in a midseason trade from Kansas City. He's the wily veteran on the team. Solid power hitter and has had some clutch hits throughout the season.
* Cal Raleigh(S): Primary catcher and has become a great power hitter. Midway through May of this season he was sent down to the minors for about a week because he was just plain terrible(hitting .065 at one point). After he came back though he's been one of the best hitting catchers in the league. Also very solid defensively. He's who hit the game winning HR to win clinch the playoffs last night. Also known as Big Dumper.
* Jesse Winker(L): Plays LF/DH and is slow as shit and kind of lazy in the field. The primary piece in the trade with the Reds that brought Suarez but has been a bit of a disappointment. Despite that, he's still awesome because the turnaround this season(we were 10 games under .500 at one point) is almost directly correlated to a huge brawl that happened because Phil Nevin(Angels manger and overall piece of shit) made a last minute change to use an opener just to throw at our players, which ended up being Winker. He hasn't been hitting very well but has been good at drawing walks.
* J.P. Crawford(L): Plays SS and is pretty solid overall. He's also been on the team longer than most. Hitting wise he's a contact hitter and has been kind of meh but he started hot while everyone else(but Ty France) was cold, which kept us from starting off even worse.
* Adam Frazier(L): Plays 2B. Acquired from the Padres in a trade this last offseason. Another contact hitter. He started super cold then picked it but a bit throughout the season but hasn't been quite as good as hoped. Pretty much just a guy. 2B is probably one of the most likely places we address in the offseason.

Depth:

* Dylan Moore(R): Speedy runner and a true utility guy. He's played every position but 3B and C. Pretty solid hitter.
* Sam Haggerty(S): Fast base runner and mainly an outfield utility. When he first got called up this season he was on an absolute tear but has regressed back to the mean a bit.
* Abraham Toro(S): Infield utility guy. Acquired from the Astros in a trade in the middle of last season. He basically never makes contact with the ball unless it's in a super high leverage situation.
* Luis Torrens(R): Temp Back up catcher. Acquired in the same trade that brought Ty France. Pretty meh hitter at best and only alright defensively.
* Curt Casali(R): Normal back up catcher. Acquired in a trade from the Giants mid season this year. He's been a solid fill in for Cal during his off days or when injured. Currently on Paternity leave.
* Jarred Kelenic(L): Hooboy where to start. He's currently OF depth. He was Acquired from the Mets as the main piece of a huge trade and was at one point considered the best prospect in baseball. He was projected to be an all-around great player but since coming up last season he's been...disappointing. For some reason, though, he starts to mash in September so hopefully that continues in October.

There are other noteworthy players that have cycled through the team, or have been optioned down to the minors but could be on the playoff roster but that's unclear at this point.

Starting Pitchers:

* Robbie Ray(L): Last years Cy Young winner. Signed a 5 year contract in FA. He's regressed back to the mean a bit but is still a very solid starter who routinely goes deep into games. His one major problem is the occasional blowup inning. Throws a mid 90s fastball with a good 2-seam/sinker and good slider.
* Luis Castillo(R): Likely our best starter. He was the most desired pitcher at the trade deadline this year and we sent a huge haul to the Reds for him(think Russ trade level). He has since been very solid though his last couple starts were a bit shaky. Compares a bit to young Felix with an upper 90s fastball with power change and good slider. Signed a 5 year contract a week or so ago.
* Logan Gilbert(R): Drafted by the Mariners in 1st round of the 2018 he debuted last season. He was solid last season and has seemed to take the next step this season. Upper 90s fastball with a great slider and curve. His one flaw is giving up a ton of HRs.
* George Kirby(R): Drafted by the Mariners in 1st round of the 2019 he debuted in May of this season. To be honest, he very well could be our best pitcher over the coming years. Mid to upper 90s fastball with nasty off-speed pitches. Ray taught him the 2-seam/sinker midseason and since then he's been especially good. Beyond that his control is insane. He's near the top of the league in BB%.
* Marco Gonzales(L): Acquired from the Cardinals in a trade in 2017. Think modern day Jamie Moyer. He will likely be a long reliever in the playoffs.
* Chris Flexen(R): Signed with the Mariners in the 2021 offseason. He's been solid but is ideally a 4 or 5 in a rotation. Since we traded for Castillo he's been put in the bullpen as a long reliever/Kirby workload reducer.

Bullpen:

* Andres Munoz(R): Acquired in the same trade that brought Ty France. One of the best relievers in baseball. Throws 100+ with an insanely nasty low 90s slider. Basically unhittable this season.
* Paul Sewald(R): Another great reliever. He struggled early in his career but changed his pitch selection when he came here and has become one of the primer relievers over the past two seasons.
* Erik Swanson(R): *Another* fantastic reliever this season. Acquired from the Yankees in a 2018 trade he bounced around the minors for a couple years. He was pretty solid last season but has been great so far this season.
* Penn Murfee(R): Drafted by the Mariners in the 2018 draft(33rd round). Been in the minors since then but was called up this season and has been solid all year. He's a change of pace reliever who rarely breaks 90 with his fastball. Induces a lot of soft contact.
* Diego Castillo(R): Probably one of our worse consistent relievers but he's still been decent. Acquired from Tampa Bay midseason last year.
* Matt Festa(R): Drafted by the Mariners in 2016. Bounced around the minors since then with a couple short stints in the majors. Similar to Castillo he's been one of our worse consistent relievers but has still been solid. Also induces a lot of soft contact like Murfee.
* Matt Brash(R): Acquired from the Padres as a PTBNL in a 2020 trade. 2022 was his first season and he started the season as a starting pitcher. He struggled a bit with control and was sent down to the minors. Since being brought back up as a reliever he's been fantastic. High 90s fastball with a nasty slider and curve. 
* Matt Boyd(L): Hometown guy. Acquired in the same trade as Casali. He's been very good in the limited time since he's been here.

Again there are a few other guys who have bounced around the bullpen but these are the primary current guys.

You should probably know where you are getting the ball from… left, right, toss, etc. Also, pass blocking is important.l, arguably most important.

Broncos need a RB out the backfield to catch passes, so it’s important to know where to go.

Obviously those are all ideal scenario he will know that by next week, but 2 days is tough. Plus you gotta learn the actual calls, audibles, etc. Offenses at this level are so complicated
