I think we bet the farm on a rookie expecting Vita to step up more, theirs a risk reward there. 

Vita seems a step slower this year. Im not sure what it is in particular but he just lacks the explosive push hes always had.

I think Hicks was doing OKAY. Not amazing but okay, and once he went down everyones solo blocking Nunez/Logan Hall/ Gholston. Theyre not exactly world beaters, you can argue Gholstons amazing against the run but Nunez is a career backup for a reason and Hall is developmental.

11513,75632,75632,Kreynard54,"# Offense: Grade B (Showed our Potential but not there yet)

Decent output through a very weirdly undisciplined game. In reality this was our first game with the majority of weapons back. We were down in a hole and we had to pass our way out of it. I feel like prior to our Oline injuries we were going to be a run first offense with Lenny, but it seems like we just cant get a push against defenses running the ball right now. Our first down offense is ridiculously predictable, always a hand off. For the love of god run a play action every once in awhile on first to keep people on their damn toes. Play calling felt very vanilla and lacked creativity. Brady was efficient, only a few bad throws. DUMB PENALTIES. Just not a clean game. 

**Good**: I liked White out of the backfield, the dudes got speed and makes our offense FEEL more explosive. Lenny just doesnt have that speed and quickness. It seems like we should be using guys situational way more. He is an AWESOME checkdown back, and we moved the ball down the field so much faster. Our receivers looked good without practice squad guys in. Only a handful of drops. Rookie TEs looked great too! We scored, we moved the ball, and it still felt like we had a shot to come back until we had to punt with 8 mins left. Besides a couple of missed 3rd downs we actually moved the ball down the field with ease, sometimes in 2 minutes-4 minutes. It was awesome. 

**Bad**: Oline still missed some key blocks, bad pass pro at times, Brady had to move around a lot more than im used to seeing. NO push up the middle on run blocking, barely attacked the edges. We did some screens and it worked out alright instead of the run. But Jesus relying on the screen game to open up the mid and deep pass doesnt feel good. If theirs a unit that deserves a C or D this game its our Oline. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, it seemed like they were rotating 1 rb per drive and barely rotating out. Lennys a great downhill runner when theirs a hole, but he doesnt have the speed to create yards in space. Its unfortunate. 

# Defense: Grade F

**Mostly bad:** Poor situational adjustments (3rd and 1 against a borderline goal line offense and our LBs were 5 yards back). Refs not calling PI as aggressively and we still played 10 yards off with corners, and of course Kelce lit us up. We were ridiculously bad in run fits against a weak Oline. Pass rush was there, but it seemed like we couldnt contain Mahomes at ALL. 

Vea doesn't seem to have that explosiveness that could lockdown 2-3 guys, we definitely miss JPP and Suh on run defense, those dudes were underrated for us in that department. Logans just not ready, giving up nearly 200 yards against a weak oline is such a freakin bummer. Bad tackling. Dline was getting Pushed around so much that even White struggled to get angles on plays he usually makes. 

Same story as last week, come out in zone, get crushed in the middle until we finally make an adjustment. Due to slow adjustments though it effected us BIG TIME. First three drives it felt like Kelce was wide open over the middle constantly. 

Pass rush was there, just doesnt and hasnt been getting home enough to put the DBs in position to make plays. We just lacked any playmakers stepping up to make a play last night. 

**Good:** Dean is getting a reputation, hardly any passes were thrown to guys hes covering.

Also - considering that the Rams got absolutely bodied on MNF by the Niners - and failed to a score a TD, I think us scoring four of them against the Chiefs is a good sign offensively.

Defensively - I think they just need to regroup. They got cocky and got smacked for their trouble. I think Atlanta will be a much easier time next week, and a good game for them to regain their sea legs.

And then overall picture - the Bucs and Falcons are both 2-2. If we win next week, that makes us 2-0 in division, and the only team in the NFC South above .500.

Logan Hall looks like he is going to be a star but we aren't going to get much from him for another year or two. Plus, he was straight up TARGETED when he was on the field.. they literally just ran into his gaps since Joe Thuney exposed him early on and they attacked it all game. I'm not sure we should worry too much about that given that Orlando Brown and Joe Thuney is not light work against the run on that side.

A bright light has been Joe T's ability to drop back (honestly on the ball linemen/linebackers dropping back all year has been interesting to watch). We are just running/building a different type of defense than I was expecting and it looks like it will be one of the best defenses I've ever seen in a year or two but we won't have Brady then. 

With that said.. we have dealt with a ton of injuries and just played two of the greatest quarterbacks in the league and are still at the top of our division. I'm not panicking in any capacity but the Bucs D isn't who I thought they were. I think if Joe T and Logan Hall improve year to year and we can retain Dean and Devin White then I think we have the makings of an all star modern defense.
