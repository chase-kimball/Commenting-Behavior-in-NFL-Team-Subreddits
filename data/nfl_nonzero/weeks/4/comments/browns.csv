Deshaun doesnt miss those downfield reads and in this type of game where every throw matters, Deshaun is the difference maker. Plus, with Watson you can open up a whole new part of the playbook.

That RO where mariota kept it was insane to me. Whoever was the edge in that play went so far upfield, that mariota, (who made a terrible decision to keep it) just casually got the first down while looking at all green. Dude was 3 yards past the QB, get him a map or something... It is really rare to see a read option in the NFL where both the back **and** QB have gigantic running lanes ahead of them.

Obviously having a green player with the green dot is a bit of an issue, but I just watched a defense that was just flat out of control.

4327,26736,26736,ClevelandOG,"The issue isnt going for it. The thinking is that you have a 70% chance of getting the touchdown, but then if you dont get into the endzone, teams that are backed up on the goal line have a much higher chance at a 3 and out. Which after the punt would put you into field goal range right off the bat anyway.

Statistically, if you are anywhere near the goal line you should ALWAYS go for it. Unless you are greater than 10 yards (actually that isnt technically true. The numbers are kind of insane, i think the cutoff is like 4th and goal from the 20 or something is where you kick.)

Some nfl statisticians will tell you that you should go for it on 4th down anywhere on the field at any time unless it is greater than 20 yards. I personally dont think coaches should do that for fear of losing their jobs, but Stefanski's 4th down decisions are very conservative compared to analytics. And, it is refreshing to see a Browns coach finally going for it.

Life is too short to punt and kick field goals.

The above combined with a defense that's performing in the bottom half of the league (about 15-16th for efficiency but that doesn't fully account for severity of the big play busts at critical moments, for which we're absolutely terrible) means that even in our offensive best performances we're always only a couple of missed opportunities, special teams fuckups or coverage busts between victory and defeat. 

All our wins and most of our losses will be by fine margins, and we'll undoubtedly have a few games where some opponent's elite offense just runs up the score on us and the Jacoby offense cannot keep up and we get blown out.

It's just gonna be this way until Watson is the QB (and shakes off the rust, which may not happen in time to save this season) and we get ourselves a new defensive coordinator who can make us at least a league average defense that doesn't have embarassing 4th quarter performance and egregious coverage busts.

23961,176545,176545,deviden,"See /u/Daviroth's comment re: PFF.

Due to how their system grades plays/players, it is heavily weighted towards efficiency and the rate at which plays are successful. Stefanski calls correct plays at a high rate and the offense moves the chains very reliably. 

We have arguably the best coached and, with Chubb and our line, the most consistently effective and varied run game in the NFL. All of our explosive plays are either a play action shot or it's Chubb busting a run or occasionally it's Njoku/Coop receiving a layup pass then making a play. The offense - as it is currently being called - hides the QB as much as possible within its structure and gives the QB a lot of easy pre-defined reads to work through when they throw.

What our offense doesn't do, and flat out can't do with a Jacoby/Baker type QB, is reliably score fast. It also can't consistently make gains through a straight dropback pass game. Jacoby reliably hits the layups, unlike Baker, but he can not be relied on to create explosive plays out of structure.

With Watson you would expect much of the above to change because that's what high level QBs can do - win with straight dropback passing from the pocket, present a consistent threat of scoring fast because they can be trusted to make full field reads and throw 40-50 times a game, and create plays out of structure when the defense takes away the pre-defined reads.

Anyway - that's why our offense grades highly despite not scoring highly.

You're not wrong at all... but this life of close wins, close losses and a few blowout losses every year is the same life we've been living since Stefanski came in and put together his staff, it's also our most reliable path to being a consistent and competitive team until we have Watson up to speed (which may not even happen this season, and may not happen in time to get us to the playoffs). 

It's the life of a team that doesn't have a high end QB - the kind of guy who makes coaches right even when they're wrong (hence why even the boy genius of the NFL Sean McVay said ""I can't finesse this any further - just get me Stafford"" and he's never had to work with a QB as limited as Baker or Jacoby; ditto Shanahan re: Jimmy G).

Stefanski and the staff know what we have with the roster we've got and every year they've put together an offense that makes the most of our strengths... it's just that in the modern NFL, if you're mostly only winning through the run game and clock control, and you can't trust your QB to score points fast and take over a game, you're ALWAYS vulnerable to losing to a couple of bad decisions or blown coverages or a missed kick or a special teams botch. 

Plus - even the best teams with the best QBs and coaches lose games they shouldn't (KC vs Colts, etc). It all comes down to us stealing a few wins back, then going on a run... or else it's ""we're on to 2023"". It's a long season, it's not over until it's over, but folks need to manage their expectations a bit. If your only path to victory is for your HC and DC to both call a perfect game that's gonna put a ceiling on any coach's W/L totals - players play the game and have to make plays, and it's a high variance sport, even the worst teams in the league are gonna score some points every game, plus we don't have a D-Line that's good enough to completely wreck games.

Realistically, we're only ever going to be competitive in close games because that's what having a competent but backup tier QB and close games are always just a couple of plays/moments between being a win or a loss. Sooner or later we'll play an opponent who shuts down our offense early, runs up the score and beats us in a blowout because we're never going to be a fast scoring offense with Jacoby Brisset as QB. 

The difference between making the playoffs and not making the playoffs is going to be whether we steal back a few of these close games from teams we're expected to lose against before Watson is able to play.

The eye test is pretty damning on the offensive coaching - it should not look that difficult for Burrow to operate when he's working with a top 5 WR and a group of other legit stud receiving options. Not when you compare it to what other coaches are achieving in the pass game with inferior QBs and far fewer weapons. So many drives are entirely dependent on Joe pulling an outstanding precision pass out his ass to somehow beat the DB who's got a receiver perfectly covered on 3rd and long.

Joe being clutch in big moments and Lou Anarumo's genuinely excellent coaching and game planning on defense has the only been the path to victory since the last few games before the playoffs... and it's not like this is a talent-deficient roster on offense, there's multiple studs on the field incl. a rookie contract top 5 WR.
