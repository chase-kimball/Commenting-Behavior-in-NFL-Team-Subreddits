Holy rough first half Batman. Those drops were absolutely frustrating to watch.

Milano is that guy. Edmunds is that guy. Poyer is that guy. Miller is that guy.

Lamar is annoyingly good, is that what it feels like when other teams play us?

That hit that knocked McKenzie out should have been a penalty. That Poyer no-call should have been a penalty. That RTP was textbook, dude hesitated then went in on Allen after the ball was thrown, easy call EVERY time. My stream was fucking up all first half so I can't really speak to the amount of missed calls in the first 30 but it seemed to be a lot.

Hopefully a less stressful game against Pittsburgh this week, our secondary should be able to feast on Pickett. Go Bills!",38.0,buffalobills,t3_xufb3c,False,0.0,:clap:,2022-10-03T06:51:19Z,buffalobills,-0.000533099430881

The Bills are 26-10 since the start of 2020 in the regular season, and 3-2 in the playoffs. They're 0-7 in games less than 1 TD of difference. So in a total of 41 games since 2020, the Bills have only lost 5 games by more than 1 TD. And on the reverse side, they have won roughly 29 games by more than 1 TD. How is that a bad thing?
