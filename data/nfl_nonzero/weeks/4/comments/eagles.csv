2. Improvement from returning players.

Take LB, for instance. Our LB corps was a joke last year. It's why we gave up every underneath pass in the world. At one position, we upgraded from Alex Singleton to Kyzir White. At the other, TJ Edwards took a huge step forward and is playing so well that they can't get him off the field. Better coverage underneath means that QBs have to hold the ball, which means that the pass rush is getting there with more consistency.

You'll see the same pattern up and down the roster. S? Replaced Anthony Harris with Chauncey Gardner-Johnson, and Marcus Epps is still playing well. CB? Slay is still Slay, and we upgraded from Steven Nelson to James Bradberry. WR? Jalen Reagor and Greg Ward were replaced by AJ Brown and Zach Pascal. Last year, we had a checked-out Ryan Kerrigan taking DE snaps; this year, we have Haason Reddick with 3.5 sacks and 3 forced fumbles already.
