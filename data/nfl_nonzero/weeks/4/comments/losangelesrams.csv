546,9489,9489,Baconbac28,"I was watching videos about what happened to the super bowl winners every year because it interested me to see how things went considering we just won the super bowl.

Every since the salary cap was introduced in 1994,(I think it‚Äôs important to go from this because we can relate it to how teams are managed today) only 4 teams have went to the super bowl 2 years in a row, and the patriots did it twice with Tom Brady. Out of those teams to go back to the super bowl the following year, only 2 have won it back to back.

What I‚Äôve noticed is that it is very common for the super bowl winning team to struggle a little bit after a super bowl win. Some struggle in the regular season and never even go back to the playoffs but this is typically teams who lost most of their players due to retirement, like the Broncos winning then losing Peyton Manning. But even for the teams that still have many of their stars and do well in the regular season, a lot of them lost in the playoffs and many of them didn‚Äôt even make it to the championship game. 

Just looking at history there will be a very low chance we will just make it back to the super bowl this year. To me I think the likely outcome that we have is that we will probably get back on our feet later in the season and make it into the playoffs but will probably lose in the divisional round.

So yes a team who has played 3 out 4 games against Qbs who are ranked  in lowest 3rd of the league at their position. I would expect a team to be playing much better than just top ten having played that. Also never said the QB was the teams weakest link simply when compared to top QB these are not them.

But as has been seen if the game is put soley on his shoulders he chokes more often than not. Goff needs a supporting cast. This also isn't some new start for Goff or even the first time he has been at the top of the league and in MVP talks but he was still and is an average QB. It's as if there is more to being a QB than just a stat line.

2nd game against the Vikings they are playing Mr. Monday Night himself Kirk Cousins who is one of the worst Prime time QB's in NFL history. They stifled the rest of the Vikings as well which is nice but again it was Kirk Cousin on prime time who is know to regress during those games for some reason. 

They then played Carson Wentz  who has not been able to stay on a single team. Not sure much more needs to be said.

The most recent win a new and (kind of ) rookie QB in Taylor Lawrence. Isn't his first year but his first year was trash due to the issues with his coach not sure any QB does well during that time. So Taylor is still learning and will have bad games still again not a top QB. 

I mean had these been those other QBs mentioned then yes I think we could start claiming how good that defense is but it really it hasn't been tested once.

18812,166509,166509,admiralnel,">I am being particular here because Raheem Morris is having heaps of disrespect thrown on him by these reports and comments like yours.

I don't know where you got disrespect from, but I don't see it. If you've ever read her stuff or listened to her podcast you'd know she's very complimentary of Morris and defends him often, as do I.


>Staley did not invent the 3-4 (Ram's base, if you want to call it that): any competent defensive coordinator can run any front with any coverage attached. DC's stick with what they have been running because (supposedly) they are experts in their system. The Rams run a 3-4 ""base"" and coverage principles (of Fangios creation) that Staley used when he was with the Rams. 

>Staley runs a Fangio based defense: he ran this when he was with the Ram's and he runs this with the Chargers. Any elements left over in Morris' defense are from Fangio (Rams even hired a former Bronco's defensive assistant). Cover-6 is Fangio's brainchild in today's NFL. Post-snap rotation also called disgusing coverages has been around for a very long time. Lightbox, I'll take the term, but a 3-4 by its very nature only has a 7-man box: it is just a numbers game. (""Light box"" is a smart-sounding term that football coaches do not use: plus-one (which you always want) or even are the terms. Anything less than even in a run situation is an inexperienced coach.)

Again who said anything about inventing the 3-4? Are you aware that the Rams switched to the 3-4 when Wade Phillips took over? Yes I'm well aware of where Brandon Staley came from and where he went and who he got his scheme from. Thanks for the lesson that I already knew and definitely didn't ask for. BTW you do realize that for the past 2+ years the Rams have barley played in a true 3-4 base (they played it more against SF the 2nd + 3rd game), they have a 5th DB on the field 90% of the time or more. The ""light box"" was widely reported on, 6 man box and and one of the safeties crashes down if it's a run. Basically baiting teams to run, which can and did backfire (see games against SF and GB) but overall has worked out, top 10 rushing defense the past 2 years. Oh didn't realize I was getting lectured by an NFL coach. Are you Vic Fangio?

>My point, nothing you (and reporters) ascribe to Morris keeping is exclusive to Staley. (Staley has not been around long enough and done enough, to have an entire defense attributed to him: Fangio has).

Yeah I don't really care, sounds like a you problem. You can take that up with the dozens of articles and reporters and everyone else. 

>Morris is sending 4-rushers a lot this year, that's a four-man front even with 3-men down pre-snap. He is calling the 3-4 like a 4-2 coach. He is a top 10 defense against the run, passing woes aside he may get this defense rolling by the end of the year, especially if the secondary gets more comfortable with route reading and coverages. They also need the linebackers to learn their pass responsibilities, I don't want to leave out how god-awful Ram's linebackers are at doing their job in the passing game. All that aside, Morris isn't far off from getting this bastard defense rolling. 

>TL;DR Morris is running a bastard version of Fangio's 3-4 and Lovie Smith's 4-3 which right now looks a lot like a 4-2. All out of a 3-man front. He is defending the run well. Getting shredded in the passing game because pass concepts are not well understood.

Yeah you're not telling me anything new here. You must know what sub packages are right? At this point in the NFL most teams play in some sort of sub package than actual base defense. In the Rams case, it's usually a 4 man front either 2Dl and 2 edge rushers or 3 to 1. Wait a minute,  4 + 2= 6, that's a light box. For the rest of what you're saying, again Jourdan has covered and I agree. Neither of us are putting this on Morris. I don't know if you've ever been around these parts but there's a lot of ""fire morris""  chants anytime the offense makes a play, I'm usually pointing out the lack of player execution.


IDK dude, my initial post might not have been clear but I definitely think you misread some stuff and the tweets as well. Also you kind of come off as a lecturing douche.

Allen Robinson made sense at the signing because he WAS a great 50/50 ball receiver and stafford loves just throwing it up for a receiver to go get, and he was going to be cheaper (money wise not pick wise) than trading for amari Cooper or other options out there because of his lackluster last year in Chicago. 
 
The Wagner signing was a little over hyped but you have to understand how miserable the middle of the field was for us last year with Troy ‚Äúnever made a tackle in my life‚Äù reeder.

We won‚Äôt beat teams with even an average pass rush with this make shift offense line. They can‚Äôt run block worth literally anything and the pass blocking is below average. 

The defense regardless how much Jourdan Rodrigue defends it is just not it.

I could scream seeing Ramsey near the LOS because it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs blitzing.

For one thing, scheming is the big issue here. Robinson is getting sent on a lot of intermediate/deep routes, and those take time to develop. With how decimated our o-line is, Stafford can‚Äôt wait for those routes to open up or else he‚Äôd be sacked every single play.

For another, he and Stafford just aren‚Äôt in sync yet, AND THAT‚ÄôS OKAY. People seem to act like Matthew had instant chemistry with *everyone* last year: he didn‚Äôt. Through the first 4 games this year, Robinson has 18 targets. Through last year‚Äôs first 4 games, Woods had 25, Higbee had 18, and Jefferson had 18. Odell (pls come back) in his first 4 games here had 25 targets, meaning he averaged 1-2 more targets a game than Robinson currently does.

Between o-line problems, scheming problems, and the fact that A-Rob and Stafford have literally played 4 games together (2 of which have come against some of the best defenses in the league), the idea of the Rams giving up and eating $45 million of money to ship off a receiver for someone who‚Äôs coming off a torn ACL is close to 0.",9.0,losangelesrams,t3_xwuisi,False,0.0,Blue & Yellow #10,2022-10-05T22:42:54Z,losangelesrams,0.0470586778347932

Like a lot of other teams, we spent to get two or three guys in free agency like Wagner who was cheap, and ARob who was a little bit more expensive. Now this team is really not that different from the start of last season except for the loss of Woods (replaced), Big Whit retiring, and the O-Line looks a little different. I think you're missing the point that our goal was to win the Bowl with the roster we started with last year before we hit a massive skid. Had we not won, we would still be in championship mode with this roster, and acquire a few guys for depth as the season goes along.
