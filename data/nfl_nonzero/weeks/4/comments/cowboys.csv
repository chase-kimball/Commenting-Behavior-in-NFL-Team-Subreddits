If Dak plays like shit by all means let’s go back to Rush time, Rush showed a few instances of why he’s a backup, ignoring the possible INTs, y’all see him completely under throw our receiver because dude was about to get hit. How many times has Dak taken the rough hit to finish the pass? Not trying to sound like a Dak D rider, he hasn’t been amazing all of the time, but he’s shown the capacity to play at high levels. 


To summarize, Dak has played one game this year and the entire offense played like ass.

I still think Dak is a better QB, playing calling has been vastly better in the last two games than anything I saw since like midway last season till now. Definitely loosing hope that Dak is gonna be the one to bring us out of our drought, Rush definitely won’t either like you said. 

Another thing we can agree on that it’s all on our Defense lol!! Personally, I think Dak is decent, Rush is a good backup but hasn’t shown me anything more, I’d be curious how he performs against a complex/competent defense.

I don't remember many bitching about the Jaylon Smith contract when he signed it.  At the time it seemed like a very team friendly deal for an up and coming linebacker.
