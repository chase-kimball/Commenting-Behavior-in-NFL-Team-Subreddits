27066,203312,203312,bbq62,"Close.  I think Houston might be the only team I would hesitate to pick against us right now.  

We are not crawling back.  This team is fundamentally broken b/c there are different philosophies pulling in different directions.  We went out to get a big arm QB who holds the ball and has little pocket awareness for a team with a weak O-line, smaller body receivers, and a scheme that wants short quick passes.  

Well defenses have figured out they can stack the box, press the receivers to throw off timing, and bring an extra rusher since the QB doesn't feel it and the OL are having their own problems.  They are not just surrendering the flats and the middle of the field like ours does.  They are forcing us to earn every yard b/c they are not scared of our offense.

Turner can make a good gameplan when he has 9 months to prepare - but since then it looks like he's calling plays from a set list of what he wants to do, not what the individual matchups and game flow dictates.  

Defensively we are playing zone like we have prime Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis watching the middle of the field.  We went out and signed a man corner to play zone.  Once again, the gameplan on this side of the ball does not seem to change based on individual matchups and game flow.  

Square pegs, round holes all over the place.  I'm just glad the mental gymnastics to defend Rivera are done.  Little faster then I thought even as someone who was playoffs or bust for him coming in.  You guys came around fast.  

Most decisions he made backfired.  Skipped a QB in his first draft despite a couple legitimate 1st round prospects that have turned out to be way better than anything we've had.  Gutting the OL to bring in washed up Panthers, gutting the coaching staff to bring in washed up Panthers, gutting the front office to bring in...washed up Panthers.  

His plan of putting a strong roster together BEFORE a QB has totally collapsed.  He's on record saying that's what he's trying to do. Aside from WR and mayyyyybe RB depending on Robinson - the roster is absolutely weaker or the same than when he took over.  Also we still don't have any QB progress.  If by the end of this year it hasn't improved, you would have to say his goals were completely missed and it has been an abject failure.",64.0,commanders,t3_xuk07m,False,0.0,🧀 Cheeseman 🧀,2022-10-03T09:12:35Z,commanders,-0.033049674644326

First of all, what coaches are getting 5 years to produce a winning season anymore? Especially established coaches. Maybe a young hot shot coordinator, but an established coach with a mediocre record coming in - it’s unusual. 

The recent franchises turning it around lately have taken 2 years max. 

So if I’m owning a team looking around the lg, it’s foolish to give 5 years to a known commodity if the results aren’t promising by the end of the 3rd year. To this point - do we actually feel like we are building something positive? And answer that in relation to the rest of the lgs performance not just looking at this team. 

Plus, in his introductory press conference Ron said himself that no one including the owner had patience for a 5 year plan. 

Like it or not, coaches and QBs don’t get more than 2 years anymore. 

The main reason why he wouldn’t be fired after a 3rd bad season is off the field turmoil. Rivera is a respected persona and signs a lot of our press releases.
