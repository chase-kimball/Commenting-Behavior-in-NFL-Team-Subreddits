I think there's potential to package Clark with some picks to get a quality player in from somebody.

D fell apart and offense couldn‚Äôt produce anything all 2nd half. Definitely a team loss, I agree there.

Making a field goal tie it for them would have given the D a lot more comfortability in closing out the game. We put the Bills in the perfect position to just throw a bunch of short out passes and then drain the clock to win with a FG.

Even with help though, you have to hold your own with a guy like Miller. Not as much as you do solo, but if you're playing sloppy, he will beat you and then eat the RB alive.

Biggest positive takeaway to me from this game is that Faalele is a starter. He's not there yet, there's a reason he'll be back to the bench once we've got either Mekari or Stanley back, but he is going to have a job in the starting five very soon imo, probably at RT but depending on how close/far from his old self Stanley looks when he *does* come back, maybe it's at LT. You'd need a lot of development to feel comfortable letting him go solo against premiere rushers, but it's not out of the question if this one game as a fourth-round project is anything to go by.",22.0,ravens,t3_xutje9,False,0.0, :19:,2022-10-03T18:07:26Z,ravens,0.1300585369513031

I'm not shitting on people who do go to games and do enjoy the experience, but like other people have said, attendance is down across the league.

31617,178159,178159,ZombieFeedback,"Acting like it'd be ten seconds left when Lamar gets the ball is extremely disingenuous. 

As I said before, a field goal there completely changes Buffalo's decisionmaking. Sure they'll kick a field goal if our defense gets them to a fourth and long inside of their range, but if they enter that drive down by three, they are absolutely playing for a touchdown to end it, not a field goal to tie it, because if you kick a field goal and there's time left, you're betting on stopping Lamar from getting into Tucker's range, which is basically the entire DMV, good chance you lose 26-23, and if you kick a field goal with zeroes left and go to overtime, your fate comes down to a coin flip, and if I am Josh McDermott I like my chances much better in the hands of Josh Allen than I do in the hands of ""Tails never fails.""

This means the Bills are taking downfield shots on instead of draining the clock, because they're looking for the end zone, not FG range. Sure they'll grind some time, but A. they're going to need to conserve it somewhat to give themselves time since they need to have a gameplan for the entire length of the field instead of just the distance to Bass' range, and B. Given Allen was barely above 50% passing(52.7%), good chance you get at least a couple incompletions that stop the clock. Both of those mean that more time is left, maybe even a Ravens timeout so you can use the middle of the field more aggressively when Lamar gets the ball back. Hell, even if everything else goes the same way until they get down to goal-to-go, since they're taking shots to the endzone instead of kneeling the clock out because a field goal isn't a win anymore, good chance Lamar gets the ball with at least 1:25 or so left.

Those three points change the entire philosophy of Buffalo's final drive, and I don't see a realistic scenario that doesn't wind up with Lamar having at least a minute to try and win the game.",1.0,ravens,t3_xtyd3h,False,0.0, :19:,2022-10-03T02:33:37Z,ravens,0.057457262248461

[Look at this!](https://twitter.com/nfl/status/1576651633613627392) [He should have Josh dead to rights!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/514914322502385679/1026275827379343400/unknown.png) Yeah Josh is fast and elusive but whatever complaints we have about Queen, he is an insanely fast, insanely athletic linebacker. With nine yards between Josh and the LoS, he can *absolutely* make up that distance and push Josh out of bounds if he goes all-out.

What does he do instead? He slows down! Maybe he figured Marlon or one of the DBs would make the tackle, but he slows up, Josh gets the first down, then PQ has an ""oh shit"" moment after seeing Gabe Davis has driven Marlo out of position to make the tackle. That catch-up speed finally shows itself, but by then it's too late, and instead of setting up a third down, he's riding Josh into the end zone for a touchdown.

I can forgive mental mistakes. Even if they shouldn't happen, even if you deserve criticism for them, I can understand them and accept them as part of humans being humans.

Not to say it's a whole lot better than up top, but you just feel closer to the game down in the 100s, you know. I only started going to Ravens games back in 2019, and over the last few seasons, I've developed a love for the last row of any of the 100s(which is usually cheaper than lower rows). You're still close to the field, but a bit higher up so you can see more of it. Plus being in the last row, you have a wall behind you, so you can lean on it and stand up the entire game if you want(without obstructing the view of others). 

[Here's my vantage point from section 103, last row for the Dolphins game](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNbGNiKP0lURGsXpEb0skeiOGJy6br6WN5lsIUQnBOA6A9I5DbJkabFpLF8bWwwnQ?key=ZTNJOWFCeTcwYm9jcm5tZUx4NVl4NkZTWll2RnFB). However, the last rows of the 100s on the away side, you're under an overhang, so a bit hard to see the video board. 

And [here's my vantage point](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOjmv4XA9h2pKORMed14DnaTFo4YJ1hAG5ZjmZdGF_ONISCNJ4ZV3IjAUInPXRqwg?key=cVpEZnBMTDl1MVdWWVNveGtueVY4TnJaZ2dkeU5n) my personal favorite section, 123/124, last row, right under the press box.
