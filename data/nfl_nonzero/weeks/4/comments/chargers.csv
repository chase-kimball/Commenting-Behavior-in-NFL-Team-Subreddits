Slater - out for season with a torn pec? (may return for the playoffs) If not the best overall left tackle in the league, definitely on his way. Can already make a claim for the best pass protector.

Salyer - rookie 6th round guard, currently filling in at LT. Somehow managed to earn the best PFF grade in the league in his first start this week. Need a larger sample size but early returns have most of us convinced he's first ballot HOF.

Feiler - great FA pick up from the Steelers a couple years ago. Might have suffered from the absence of the next guy on this list. But, a solid NFL caliber starter nonetheless.

Corey Linsley - Deserves his full name. Garry Kasparov in Hakuhō Shō's body (where my chess/sumo fans at?). Best center in the league. Calls our protections. Kind of a big deal.

Zion - rookie, dog RG, first ballot HOF. 

Pip - complicated relationship with this sub. Was a trash developmental swing tackle when we drafted him. Worked his ass off this off-season and is looking like a solid starting right tackle. 

Backups: Jaimes (meh), Clapp (ironically is ass), Norton (so ass we don't use his first name anymore and he has an awesome first name)

The best counter to this is that clearly Justin is the reason we win *any* game and without him it’s pretty much a lost cause.  

My refutation to that is that especially while Justin is injured, both QBs seem to be necessary to give us a shot at a win if he misses time, at least the way I see it.
