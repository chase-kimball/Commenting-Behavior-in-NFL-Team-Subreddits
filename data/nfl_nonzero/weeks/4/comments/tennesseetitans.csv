2140,18847,18847,Bieber_hole_69,"Point differential is going to be a nearly useless stat for the Titans this year because of a blowout like that.

A similar thing happened to us in 2017 after we got demolished by the Texans in week 4, 14-57. Ended that season with a -22 point differential and still made the playoffs because they were a good team, but not one capable of blowing anybody out. They also had a bad loss to the Steelers on TNF, 17-40, that didn't help matters in 2017.

I could definitely see something similar happening this year because we are so far behind the eight ball in point differential after week 2. Vrabel teams have been better about winning by larger margins than Mularkey teams, but I still don't see this year's Titans team beating the breaks off anybody to offset that -34.

I think they'll pretty much for sure beat their Pythagorean wins expected for the year though, so every article predicting regression candidates for 2023 that will come out in March will have the Titans near the top of the list again haha.

Generally under Vrabel we've overperformed our Pythagorean expected wins, averaging a +48.75 point differential over his four seasons as HC. You would expect about a 36.51-28.49 record over Vrabel's 65 regular season games coached going into this year, when instead the Titans have gone 41-24, over a full win better than expected each year. This would often signal that the Titans are bound to regress at some point, but four years of this is a pretty decent sample size that may show Vrabel coached teams do just preform better than point differential would indicate. Vrabel has a great record in one and two score games in his first 4 years, going 26-17 (.605,) when you would probably expect him to be closer to 22-21 (.512.)

Cowboys traded him in essentially a salary dump, then like a month later WRs started holding out for massive contracts and getting traded for multiple 1st Rd picks. Of course Cooper isn't in the same class as those receivers demanding premium money, but a massive increase in the cost of WR1's should have also increased the value of a guy like Cooper on a contract that now seems much more reasonable after what everyone else got.

The issue is that he can't be on the field for passing downs, really limits his value in the modern NFL.

For our needs though, especially with Cunningham hurt, he's perfect. And the Run D took a positive turn in a huge way with him on the field.

We'll see how he fits in the future when Rice comes back, but for now it lets Cunningham take as much time as he needs to get right. Our depth at ILB was horrific, and had the potential for disaster if Long or Cunningham were out for significant time.

They can handle it however they want, if they want the $9 mil to use for the first wave of free agency, or if they want more money for the later waves, to sign the rookie class, to make trades later, or to ear-mark for extensions. I do still think either way they want to do it, they probably get more value from that money than from having Bud on the team.

They would need to prioritize getting a more athletic EDGE guy for early downs to replace Bud's plus run defense, but I think Weaver can take over all of his pass rush snaps no problem once Landry is healthy.

Bud definitely does make a major difference on the defense when he's out there, it's almost night-and-day. The attributes he contributes though are not things that carry a premium price tag like Bud does. We're paying Bud to be a 10+ sacks a season guy, and he's just not that.

2150,18857,18857,Bieber_hole_69,"I was at the game yesterday, made the 2.5 hour drive over from Ohio to be at a game for the first time since the Divisional Round in January. This game at least provided a decent enough experience to wash away some of that game that was still lingering. Seeing Colts fans booing their team when we were up three scores was a treat, and seeing them shuffle out of the stadium en mass at the two minute warning lol.

I didn't encounter any Colts fans that seemed all that mad with their team or with the Titans, they just seem really resigned to the season being over a couple days into October. Great to see in person!

The Colts also shoot off confetti after every Touchdown they score...seems pretty pathetic lol.

Walking up to the stadium, I thought I was so nervous I thought I was going to throw up. Way, way more nervous than I was walking into the playoff game in January. And I thought I was going to have a stroke by the start of the fourth quarter, but a win is a win.

I haven't had a chance to watch the game again, so I can only recap what I saw from field level:

Schobert seemed like a real godsend this week, huge play with the forced fumble that went a long way to deciding the game. Get him off the field on passing situations of course, but it seems like he can really thump still.

Run defense as a whole was much, much improved this week. Taylor was met at or behind the line all day. Colts fans were booing on basically every first down run that went for no gain in the second half. Don't know how much was the D-Line getting on-track or the linebackers playing better, but it did feel like Long Jr. had his best game of the season. Would have been great if he got that pick, but I thought he played well otherwise. Even Cole seemed to be all over the field, heard his name credited for what felt like very other tackle.

The biggest thing defensively I wanted to touch on was Farley, boy did he look out of sorts that entire game when he was on the field. I was listening to Football and other F Words on the drive over to the game, and Zach said something along the lines of, ""We know Terrance Mitchell is bad, so why not play Farley? It can't get any worse."" It can get much worse. Mitchell is at least a competent NFL player that has been around a while and knows how to play the position. I am not confident that Farley knows how to play cornerback at an NFL level. All the athleticism in the world cannot make up for a guy that doesn't know what he's doing out there. When a rookie out of the AAC is making Farley look silly and spinning in circles on a catch that put the Colts in a position to tie the game late, he can't be on the field. When he's letting receivers streak down the field totally uncovered and Byard has to come over to cover for him, it makes the rest of the defense worse. In the backend, everyone else is going to be thinking about if they need to bail out Farley, and it's going to make them do their assignment worse. This defense wants to do high-level and complex things in the backend with a veteran safety pairing, but that all gets derailed if a guy on the outside doesn't know what he's doing. Mitchell may get burned in coverage, but he's not going to be so far out of position that it breaks the entire play.

What's the solution for Farley? I don't know. It seems like the game is too fast for the guy. I don't know what he's like in practice, so I don't know if this is just an issue when the lights come on for gameday, or if he's doing this stuff all the time. When thinking about other corners who have rebounded after bad starts to their careers like Fulton or Okuda, one thing to consider is that those guys played corner for much longer than Farley and at a higher level than Farley in college. Farley played corner in college for what, two years? Then took a year off in 2020 and missed almost the entire season (and all those practices) with the ACL tear in 2021. Fulton and Okuda played corner in the top conferences in college for longer and weren't new to the position when they got there. I just don't think he's confident or capable enough at the position to be out there for long.

Maybe the solution is to make him a healthy scratch when Amadi, Molden, and Hooker are back? Let him take time on the bye week to get his head right and get the basic stuff drilled down. Put a headset on him on the sideline and let him just process the game better. The athletic talent is there, so we don't need more proof of that. I know what Fulton said about needing to be on the field to get confidence, but I don't think putting him out there to get embarrassed is helping his confidence either. Maybe that's a good strategy for an SEC West caliber corner like Fulton, but Farley just doesn't have that same high-level experience. I still believe Farley can be a good player, but it seems like the game is just getting ahead of him quickly.

On offense, Henry is back. Great game from him, and on only 22 carries. Throwing him the ball opens up so much for this offense and brings the linebackers back down away from the intermediate stuff across the middle. It's been a godsend for this offense, and even though Henry's going to drop a fair bit of them, you just gotta force feed him those targets to keep the defense honest.

Tannehill looks good still. Wish he could have completed that outside throw to Burks, he had him for a TD. Needed just another half second before getting hit and he would have gotten it there. The one boneheaded play was the scramble to end the first half, but I can see where he got ahead of himself with some daylight in front of him. I though he was going to make the first down too, so I can't blame him all that much for running it even when the smart play was to throw it away. They still have to drill that in his head pre-snap though, that it's his reads and then throw it away. Seems more on coaching than him in that instance.

Loved seeing Chig get more looks, will have to look up his snap count and routes run in a bit. If Burks is out for an extended period, we absolutely need to get Chig more involved. This offense lacks that YAC and explosive ability if Treylon is gone, but Chig can at least provide some of it. Dial up some of the plays Jonnu had in 2017 and 2018 for Chig and I am sure he could make something happen.

Daley still seemed to have some issues here and there. That rollout to the left was a dumb miscue by Downing to run, Daley could not handle that playcall and Tannehill got lit up for it. Remember last season when Downing had that fascination for naked rollouts the first few weeks of the season? Tannehill got lit up several times in the first few games by totally free rushers that didn't bite on the PA handoff. Finally Downing seemed to just scrap those from the playbook when he realized they wouldn't work. I think he needs to do the same with rollouts to the left side for the time being.

The hope I have with Daley is that he's had what? 5 weeks in this offense? He has time to get better footing in the scheme and get better. And he's gotten better already. The guy also had Rivera and Rhule as his head coaches in Carolina, maybe he can benefit from some decent coaching to get more out of him too. 

Downing can really draw them up with the best of them, some of his play designs are just great to see on the field. Even the cute stuff worked this week with the Burks end-around on third down and the last playcall with DH at FB and handing it off to Chig. Terrific misdirection there, and when it works the cute stuff seems genius.

Looking forward to next week, I think it's an interesting decision on what to do with some of the banged up guys. A game against a sub-par NFC team heading into the bye week. If you were going to pick a game on the rest of the schedule that it's okay to lose, it's this one. Almost like that Week 16 game against the Saints in 2019 that Henry sat out.

I don't think it would be a bad idea to give the week off to anybody nursing an injury, like Cunningham, Molden, Ola and Dupree. Give them a week off and then the bye week to get right before two straight divisional games, the first one being a chance to stick the final nail in the coffin of the 2022 Colts.

Going in to the bye week on a three game win streak and at 3-2 seems like it would be ideal, but I think maximizing the early bye week could be better for the long-term outlook of the season. And hell, the Commanders look bad enough that we might be able to beat them down a couple starters still.

Edit: Also wanted to add on one more note, turnovers were the difference maker in this game. Being +3 in that department and not turning over the ball, or even putting the ball into harms way much at all, is winning football no matter who is injured or if we can't make big plays. 

Last year when AJ, Julio, and Henry were all out in a few games, we were in a position to win all of them. Against Houston, New England, and Pittsburgh, three of our five losses last year, we would have won all those games if we could have just been -1 or 0 in turnover differential. I made comments about it back then and would have to go back and find them, but we were something spectacularly bad, -10 or something, in turnovers over those three games. We averaged like 3.5 turnovers a game and didn't force turnovers on defense.

No matter what playmakers aren't on the field, this team under Vrabel and Tannehill has shown they can win with anybody if they can avoid possessions lost to turnovers. I'd have to look it up, but have we lost a game with a +2 or greater turnover differential since Tannehill took over?",13.0,tennesseetitans,t3_xuhart,False,0.0,11,2022-10-03T08:18:50Z,tennesseetitans,0.0008655941053102

Remember, the Titans are the Oilers.  The franchise dates to 1960.  We are an initial AFL team and won the initial two AFL championships.  We hate most AFC teams as a result as we clashed with them in playoffs or our division (the old rough and tumble AFC South).  Therefore our historic prejudices are that we are anti:

Steelers  
Browns  
Bengals  
Raiders  
Broncos  
Bills

(last three the most notable that disrupted otherwise promising playoff runs throughout the years)

As the Titans we have grown to despise the Ravens and renewed our hatred of the Bills.

We dislike our division rivals, but mostly the Colts.  FTC.

So you add it all up and we don't like 9 of the AFC teams.  Some of the youngin's here will care less about the old rivalry, but even Eddie knew ""Steeler week"" was a thing...

51525,298481,298481,trick96,"What the defense did yesterday while missing 5 starters (Landry, Bud, Molden, Hooker, Cunningham) was truly impressive. I thought the Titans would have to score 30+ to win the game after Bud left the game. They gave the Colts their worst rushing performance since 2015 (38 yards), despite the Colts having 23 attempts. While the Colts TE’s ran wild, the WR’s were held in check. Michael Pittman, the supposed best WR in the division, was basically invisible all game. The Titans defense also did this in Lucas Oil, where they are supposed to be really good because their geriatric QB historically plays much better inside than outside. I would expect we’ll get at least Molden and Hooker back this week, which will be huge for the secondary in a game against a team with a lot of good pass catchers and a big arm QB. No clue on Cunningham and Dupree, though I don’t think they technically ever ruled Dupree out yesterday which could be a good sign. This team is unsurprisingly in desperate need for the bye week already, could get a lot of guys back in time for that second Colts game.

Offensively, all I really have to say was Tannehill was great once again. 17/21 and 2 of the incompletions were drops by Henry. Stat sheet says 3 sacks, I don’t remember all 3 but I definitely don’t think any of them were his fault. 2nd half woes need to be fixed obviously. As far as injuries go, hopefully Burks isn’t out too long and Kyle Phillips gets that shoulder better.
