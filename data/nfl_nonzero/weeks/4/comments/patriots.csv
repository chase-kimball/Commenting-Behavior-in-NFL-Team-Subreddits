3837,24853,24853,BeastlyMandible,"I have no issues with the way the team played today. We should not have been in that game come the second quarter, let alone in OT with them. 

But the fact of the matter is you have the ball in Green Bay territory in OT, a field goal wins it, it's 3rd and 5. You pass for some reason, it's almost picked, and then you punt to Aaron Rodgers with 6 mins to go.

You run it on third, you get 2-3 yards, you get a fourth and 2, which you go for.
If you don't get it, oh well. At least you put your team in the best position to win the game.
Punting on the opposing side of the field in OT on 4th and <8 is stupid as fuck
And for a coach that constantly sings the mantra of ""doing what's best for the football team"" he sure as fuck continues to put the team in situations where the easiest road to victory is thrown away in favor of a far more convoluted and difficult venture.

Rodgers added approximately two inches and 15 pounds as a senior, according to Souza, and even though he also excelled as a student, he still struggled to attract attention as a possible Division I scholarship athlete.  
""Our society in sports, especially football, is so driven by the 'eye test.' At quarterback, they want you to look a certain way. I'm sure that definitely deterred some people from giving him an opportunity,"" Jackson said.

Last year they had the least amount of concussions they’ve ever had. They implemented the concussion protocol 10 years ago. They now have medical experts who will pull players from games that appear to have been concussed regardless of how they test. They won’t let said player go back in no matter what. They’ve changed the helmets 5 times in the last 12 years that are much safer. This year they added concussion helmet pads that go over the helmet in training camp. Concussion numbers were lower than ever in camp.  

Ultimately Tua made the decision to go back out there and play last night. He easily could’ve reported symptoms to the team and sat the game out.

Patricia isn't doing that bad at oc actually. It's fun for everyone to hate on him but he's called decent games and learned from the previous ones.
