This is demonstrated by [Anscombe's quartet](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Scatterplots-of-four-different-datasets-known-as-Anscombes-quartet-99-Each-dataset_fig1_276360680), which shows four different plots that all have the same correlation coefficient, regression line, and error of fit when using the regression line ([this image](https://i.postimg.cc/s2KX4BM5/All-Dinos-Grey-1.jpg) shows the same thing even more dramatically).*

>* You can't just say ""The only downside is he doesn't share exactly how he comes to that conclusion as that isn't the main point of the article."" Science is based on the idea that when you work with data you're required to share the rationale you use for your different manipulations, or else we can't gauge your credibility.

Every single Bears season for the past and next 40 years: Bears fall behind the league due to inept passing play and failure to modernize, but the defense and run game do just enough to keep the team mediocre, grind out a few easy wins, and avoid a high draft pick. Eventually coaching and FO changes are made and we all hope that things are looking up, only for an exact clone of previous regimes to follow.

Every single year it's the same exact issues that never get addressed. The same exact positions that never get filled. The same mind-boggling front office moves. The same poor game management and failure to adapt. The same primetime beatdowns against the Packers.

You want the QBs eyes where they are supposed to be, after the snap, and if the throw is not there, then scan the field, to go through his progressions.

The problem before the Giants game, he would get ready to throw, but then stop, because he wasnt trusting himself. That wasnt the case for the Giants game. He played alot quicker, while also playing slow at times, but still improved a lot, and played more decisive. He was recognizing Man vs Zone and the different zone coverages. 

When you watch the tape youll see everything he has to deal with while trying to read the field; Poor interior oline play, receivers making small errors in routes which make a big difference for the whole play and receivers sporadically getting open. 

Also, hes dealing with an OC who isnt calling a fluid passing game. Alot nice/big throws were then met with back to back running plays. Fields does best when his vibin and that just kills it.

Yes, Justin needs to play better, but he did a much better job today.

But, listen to people who actually know how to watch the all22. They will admit Justin needs to play better. But they will also say, he's making the right reads and seeing what needs to be seen. Problem was he wasn't trusting himself to pull the trigger, probably being told to not make mistakes, as well. 

Also, play calling has been repetitive, conservative, and predictable where it leads him with no options to throw sometimes. 

What we saw today was a great step in the right direction. He threw with much more confidence. Obviously, he needs to keep moving on from this, but the oline was baaaad today. Fuck anyone who said he needs to throw faster. The entire 2nd half, and even the end of the first, Fields was getting lit up, hit or pressured way before he could make decisions. He made shit happen with his legs. 

We gotta remember, this kid is fixing his mechanics, learning his 3rd offense in 3 years (college is 1), perfecting mechanics and dealing with a shit pass blocking oline (fair run blocking tho) and all but 1 wr he doesn't have chemistry with. 

Not every qb is going to be a Herbert (who has been good and meh even this year). Most qbs need 2 years in an offense at the beginning of their career.

In the last couple weeks, Fields was making the right reads, but holding the ball and not throwing it and played it safe. That's bad for sure. But at same time, he's in the beginning of a new offense, again, after 3 years (college included) and getting his mechanics straightened.

50482,316833,316833,qb1avellini,"That’s not how that works. There’s so many factors you’re not considering. 

For instance, say your growth is exactly $65,000 every year and you withdraw it at the end of the year and leaves you with just principal. Well, maybe one year (perhaps it’s 2022) your investments don’t grow at that same rate. Say one year it only gains $50,000 and you still take $65,000 at the end of the year. Well, you still got the money but now not only are your investments down $15,000 from their original value, but now it’s going to have to perform even better than usual to make up for that. 

Say the following year, the SP50 rebounds but is still down. You take another 65,000, because that’s what you’ve decided you needed to live. Well now, you’re down even further and need to have even better returns to make up for it again. 

Adding in inflation, assuming 2, halved your 2mm in 36 years. As I’m sure you’re aware, inflation YTD is much higher and will be higher for a while. So again, there’s so much to consider. 

Also, you brought up a pension as a source of income so that absolutely matters. A pension is extraneous in your original comment.

Edit: add in again ordinary tax on all your gains. So your 65,000 gross is less net and then with inflation your buying power is less.

DOUBLE EDIT: I’m enjoying our conversation and I’m not trying to argue. All of the aforementioned to say that if he worked and lived off of his income until 55, he could probably retire comfortably. But 2mm does not stretch to life expectancy for someone at, what, later 20s?

50483,316834,316834,qb1avellini,"Index funds aren’t paying 10%, they would potentially appreciate by that much. In order to access that money, you would need to sell some. You’re reducing the amount of your investment in order to access that money, which reduces your long term growth and lowers the amount the person has access to each time they need money. 

Investments in businesses are illiquid investments. 

Real estate is the same, illiquid. You might be able to buy a REIT that pays 5% but it’s risky and also illiquid. 

Pensions were not part of your original statement (nor are they that common any more).  In this example, yes, an NFL player gets a pension and is part of their overall financial plan but they don’t get access to it until 65. And if they do it early they’re getting a much much smaller amount annually because they haven’t contributed as long and are younger. 

I mean I get what you’re trying to say. But this dude can’t take 2 mil and live off of it for the rest of his life at a young age like that.
