You could throw in some very strange plays, but if the teams screws up just one because someone isn‚Äôt familiar, it only takes about 3-4 turnovers to equate a loss.

So because we have a new QB and lots of new pieces to the offensive line, we run vanilla pass plays and power runs.  Until you can trust all parts of you O-Line to block you can start running some sliding runs like Q mauling a LB, but we aren‚Äôt there.

Honestly, the team is in its head.  There‚Äôs no trust from player to coach, player to player, coach to player. The hope is that the cohesion and repetition will allow the playbook to open as the season goes on, which is what happens.
