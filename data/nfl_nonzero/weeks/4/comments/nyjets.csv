* Mobility in the pocket was next level, the way he bought time and avoided pressure that would have doomed the average QB was excellent.

* The confidence to let it rip was something that is great to see. Not only does that mean he mastering the offense, it means he trusts his abilities and that of his recievers.

* Getting everyone involved. All the WRs got involved, Conklin and both RBs. If this continues to happen, defenses aren't going to be able to focus on any one target, and it opens up the play book for more creative playcalls and unique looks.

* Zero confidence loss after throwing a few Ints. They happen even to the best QBs, and not having to baby him with conservative playcalling is what keeps the pressure on defenses.

A few things to clean up:

* Those short passes are still quite an adventure. Even some of the completed ones can be better. The WRs bailed him out of a few, especially Davis, and being able to get Wilson/Moore/Berrios/Hall passes in stride will give them tons of YAC potential.

* Wilson was a magician in this game saying some broken plays, but I am afraid that might get him injured again. I hope he get a bit more comfortable just bailing on them earlier, for his own sake.

* Not a fan of the Griddy, needs more reps or a team celebration, or I think he can pull of an Vanilla ""Ice Ice Baby"" dance.",5.0,nyjets,t3_xuf4v0,False,0.0,":PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya",2022-10-03T09:21:04Z,nyjets,-0.0135839657986665
