I remember reading Mike Smith's reaction to the Gary pick, seems he was right.

&#x200B;

>Smith raved about the Packers getting rookie outside linebacker Rashan Gary, who he thinks is a unique combination of Dee Ford and Justin Houston, the two edge rushers he coached up close last year with the Kansas City Chiefs.  
>  
>“It’s unbelievable,” Smith said Wednesday. “A guy that size and that speed and that athleticism, I’ve never seen it, and I’ve been in the league for 11 years. You can do a lot of things with him. In Kansas City, we had Dee Ford, he’s smaller, great get off. Justin Houston, who is a big strong guy. Get a guy like Gary, he’s both of them.”  
>  
>Smith said he scouted all the top edge rushers in the draft and came away most impressed with Gary, the 6-4, 277-pounder with elite athletic testing numbers. He left the combine knowing with certainty that Gary loved football and was the right character fit, and then found Gary to be a highly athletic rusher who consistently disrupted and affected the quarterback on film.  
>  
>When the Packers took Gary with the 12th overall pick, no one in the building was more excited than Smith.  
>  
>“I knew we had a chance. I honestly didn’t think he was going to go at 12. I thought he was going to go way before then, based on how I evaluated him,” Smith said. “I’ll throw it out there, I thought he was best in college football at outside linebacker. I had him No. 1, because I believe in that, and I believe in him. I was very excited when we got him. I was running down the hallway. I know what he has, and I know what he can do, and I’m excited to work with him.”",6.0,greenbaypackers,t3_xuiiff,False,0.0,:GB:,2022-10-03T12:36:41Z,greenbaypackers,0.0170500724699889

24512,165643,165643,ShowGoat,"Notes:

Jenkins had another rough outing getting beat with speed around the edge. I know Yosh is a better LT than RT, but would he be that much worse than Jenkins right now (not to say he looks unplayable)? Not sure if it's because he is still working his way back from injury or he's being left on an island to give Bakh more help, but it looks like he could benefit from being moved inside for a game or two.

Doubs, going back to Preseason, has really struggled with finishing plays. His game looks great other than hanging onto the ball through contact. Teams have definitely seen this on tape as defenders are immediately going for punching out the ball when he catches it.

The DL has continued to lose at the point of attack. I noticed KC pushed way downfield a couple of times yesterday. Packers desperately need to get that figured out. 

Rodgers was straight ass for the first half. He needs to be more consistent.

Amari has to be in immediate danger of losing his roster spot. He looks so slow in both his decision making and his game speed. Only upside I've seen from him is being sure-handed when catching punts, other than that fumble out of bounds the other week. I think the only reason he's still on the team is his draft status.

Was Nixon even targeted in the passing game? Don't remember his name being called much during the game. He needs to be in the running for a special-teamer Pro Bowl spot with his second game in a row downing of a punt at the goal line.

A young Larry Fitz put up 11 catches for 172 yards. The Cardinals returned the opening kick for a TD and also had a 99 yard fumble return for a TD. Meanwhile Brad Johnson went 27/41 for 271 yards and 3 TDs while Chester Taylor had 27 carries for 136 yards and a score to carry the Vikings to a 31-26 win.

Nothing from the box score really explains the lack of rushing attempts, aside from the fact that the 6 carries led to only 17 yards. The Cards also fumbled 5 times, losing 3. Two of these seemed to be muffed punts but it's not clear in the box score.
