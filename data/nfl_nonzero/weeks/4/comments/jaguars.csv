I'm going to assume they know something the fans don't because it does not make much sense to not lean on your run game when the weather is complete ass.

That said, it's difficult to put too much stock into a game like this considering the conditions, most QBs who played in the rain yesterday posted less than inspiring numbers, although they were at least able to hold onto the ball.

Walking to our seats the whole section chanted asshole at me while pointing. Once in my seats I had various things thrown at me. Beer, French fries, cups, all kinds of stuff. A security guard actually came down and had to stand by me. One thing that always stuck with me is some guy called me a two legged cockroach.
