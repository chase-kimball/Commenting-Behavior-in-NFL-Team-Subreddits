9386,54733,54733,Dang026,"Safety and off ball linebackers are so devalued in recent years especially in terms of the draft which is what made the trade up to get Bush even worse. There likely wont be an ILB or safety worthy of a top 15 draft pick in 2023 unless the word generational gets thrown around as it tends to. Either way Kyle Hamilton still went 14th overall and hasnt even lived up to that billing so far.

Also Kendrick Green should still be viewed as a developmental center prospect IMO based on his metrics. It was so ridiculous he was anointed the starter and thrown into the fire the way he was but if he can develop as a combo guard/center he will be quality depth in a couple years which is what you should expect from a late 3rd round pick who was undersized entering the league.

I wouldnt mind an OL to replace Dotson it Green at LG but i just dont see it happening in all honesty. They dont like to spend on OL in the draft as much as they like poaching practice squad players and trying them out. Leglue looked okay last season so im not sure if they still like him for depth but the offense has become so strange as of late im not sure what is going on or how to actually judge performances or potential future roles.

Im okay with just stacking the defense by going DT/CB would be ideal. Let the offense go through all if its woes and let Kenny take the reigns.

I feel like they will continue to struggle at left guard but if they decide to draft maybe they go with a high ceiling type of developmental player the same way they did with Chuks as a 3rd round pick.

CB has got to be the biggest need as a 1st round pick  maybe SS in the 2nd if they decide to move on from Edmunds or just cant strike a deal. 

Personally id really like to see them go CB or possibly DT considering Cam is on his way out in the next couple years. Jalen Carter is likely a top 10 pick but if hes available he could be a solid fit at NT as well as having the ability to play 2i or 3 tech.

- Alex highsmith- his breakout year. The sacks are landing and the pressure is there. He disrupted a big Wilson pass that would have converted a first. Man should absolutely feast when TJ returns. 

- Boswell- ice in his veins. Our offensive mvp. 59 yard record kick just incredible. 

- Tomlin- He says we don‚Äôt live in our fears and he showed it today. Pulling Mitch at half took balls and it paid off. Well done coach 

- Minkah- star players make star plays. Nothing else to say about this man but give him that DPOY

- Muth- what a game for the big man. Got open, blocking looked clean up. Made himself available and it paid off. 

- MOF- we actually did it! We used the middle of the field! Well done canada!!!

- Kenny- man got put in a tough spot with no first team reps but mama. Fearless and tough, faced pressure and delivered. He will not be perfect so you all need to be patient. There will be lumps just like he showed today but I thought he stepped in well given all circumstances. 

- Pickens- first 100 yard game and came up big today. Got open and took advantage of his opportunities. 

Bad-

- Diontae Johnson- drops. Don‚Äôt wanna beat him up too bad but that drop from Mitch lead to that pick. Gotta bring those in. 

- Spillane- everything that went his way today seemed to just go poorly. Very forgettable day. 

- Offensive penalties- absolutely must clean this up. Stuff like they showed are drive killers and that proved to be true today. OL performed well outside of this- get more discipline and the rewards will come. 

- 3rd down conversions. Speaking for Mitch. Garbage. All year long. Glad to see KP cleaned up. 

- Gunner- honestly surprised coach didn‚Äôt yank him before Mitch. This dude is not gonna last long at all. Stop fucking fumbling and field the kicks. 

- Harvin- not a great punt day for PH3. Berry looking over that shoulder so gonna have to pick things up. This offense needs good field position and it‚Äôs up to him to cut the field in half

Overall, the store here is Kenny Pickett. I think Tomlin did the right thing, it provided a very obvious spark to the whole team which was MUCH needed after looking so flat 3 1/2 games in. Again, let‚Äôs give him time, it won‚Äôt be perfect, but this was one hell of a game one showing with no prep at all. 

Shitty ending and blew a ten point lead which is beyond pathetic. Have to turn this thing around quickly. Give Kenny first team reps and figure this shit out. Feels weird but I have hope.",200.0,steelers,t3_xtypha,False,0.0,Ben Roethlisberger,2022-10-02T15:19:30Z,steelers,0.0112471374032143

3. People‚Äôs Gas Holiday Market: a fun pop-up holiday shopping village in Market Square. There are very cute holiday-themed shops. You can get apple cider, hot cocoa, and baked goods here too. They typically have lots of unique tree ornaments to shop from. 

4. Point State Park- there‚Äôs a gorgeous lit up Christmas tree at the park that I think is worth a visit.
