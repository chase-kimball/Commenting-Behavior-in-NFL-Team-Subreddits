Of those the Jags was probably their toughest matchup and you can say it was the Vikings but it’s not just a meme that Kirk is horrible on MNF the dude has a plenty big sample size to show he just struggles under the big lights 

Then they’re schedule to finish the year is Cards/Cowboys/Steelers/Texans/Commanders/Colts/Packers/Titans/Giants/Bears/@Cowboys/Saints/Giants

Like holy hell, Cards have been nothing but a disappointment, the Cowboys defense is top tier because of some studs but the first one is most likely going to be against Cooper Rush but they could still win potentially with him, nothing to even get into about the the next four, each one is an anemic team in their own way - Packers are a tough out even with their offense struggling but that’s 7 weeks from now so plenty of time for things to change.

Very similar complaints about the offense happened to start that year even with Tyreek. As usual, the team found their grove eventually. Nick Wright said that the game-winning first down against the Packers was the turning point of the season and I agree. You could see in the Cowboys game that everything started clicking on both sides and then we kicked the Raider’s ass in primetime the next week by 27 points. We only scored below 24 points once the tests of that season (including playoffs). 

We knew these offensive struggles were likely to happen. We had a near complete turnover in the WR group and chemistry isn’t instant. The gameplans are much different now with spreading the ball around and not having 1 guy on the outside as the main WR threat. The guys will find what works for them in the context of the defenses they are playing.

31875,213082,213082,SylvesterTaurus,"Yep, the pass rush will be the most important factor in this game, especially against Tampa. With all their injuries on the OL, our D-Line and blitz schemes should (hopefully) feast on Brady all game. Brady’s likely going to get the ball out really quickly, so Bolton and the other LBs need to play contain well in the flat and middle of the field. Depending on who’s defending Evans, Godwin, and Jones, I expect Brady to test our CBs with jump balls and back shoulder throws. Playing the ball will be more important than ever this game, and I hope that the coaches have been emphasizing that all week.

The thing that worries me most though is the gameday coaching and gameplan. We saw a complete offensive coaching shitshow by Reid last week. Not Bienemy, Reid is the one who should get the blame for how the offense ran because he calls the plays. Being able to take what Tampa’s defense gives us and see what adjustments work well is critical to beating a team like that. That’s how we won 9 of our last 10 games last regular season and how got back to the AFCCG. We didn’t do that against Indy and that’s the biggest reason we didn’t smoke them like we should have.

31876,213083,213083,SylvesterTaurus,"Agreed on most points here. However, Chase and Jefferson were both high 1st found draft picks and generational WR talents coming out of college. They had a much different situation as Skyy. Mecole has also shown that he’s best as a gadget receiver, so I agree that Skyy is a more complete WR.

As for his playing time, my frustration is with the most common reason I see cited by people for that: “Andy’s playbook is very complicated for WRs and hardest for rookies to learn completely”. I understand that the Chiefs have a super versatile and deep playbook, but that doesn’t mean that Coach can’t call plays that Skyy can be involved in to make an impact (like the Cardinals game). Spags has a similar mindset about playing rookies in the secondary, but he’s been forced to make it work and we’ve seen great things from that group. Maybe your right that it’s a fear from Andy to play him fully. I hope he gets over that real quick because we need offense wherever we can get it.
