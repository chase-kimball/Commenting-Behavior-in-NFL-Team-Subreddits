* 16th Ranked Special Teams

If you're not familiar with DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average), there's a good explanation on the [Football Outsiders website here](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/methods#dvoa). Basically, every snap is looked at for each team and compared to a league baseline.

Weighted DVOA is the default measurement, which more heavily weighs later games as the season goes on. Some teams, like the Jaguars, have played way better than expected so far, so the DAVE stat combines DVOA with their preseason forecast to try for a more accurate projection for the rest of the season.
