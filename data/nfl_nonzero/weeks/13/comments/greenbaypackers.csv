I don’t think he is as hobbled by the thumb as a lot of people are making him out to be. Yea he has missed throws, but then look at the first touchdown to Watson against Dallas and the dart to Cobb in the endzone against Philly. He can still put the ball where he wants, and I think the thumb injury has gotten better over time. With the rib injury, who knows. We’ll just have to see what happens on Sunday. Hopefully the O line can keep him upright and limit any shots to his ribs. Plus, Rodgers typically plays especially well against Chicago, and he’s not going to pass up an opportunity to own them again and take away their all-time wins record.

Gute failed to draft and develop that position, as well as others.

>Davis chatted with Rodgers and Green Bay wide receiver Randall Cobb in a hallway inside Fiserv Forum just before sitting down for his postgame news conference.

>When several L.A.-based reporters popped their heads outside the conference room to see what was holding Davis up, the Lakers big man pointed out the reporters to Rodgers and Cobb as a group who have ""talked a lot of s---"" to Davis all season about the Packers' woes.

>As Davis said his goodbyes to Rodgers and Cobb, he wished them luck the rest of the season -- starting with the Chicago Bears on Sunday. He then entered into the postgame interview room to talk about the biggest win of the Lakers' season.

>Before leaving the dais to head to the locker room to change for the team's flight to Washington D.C., Davis had one last message for the reporters assembled.

>""Go Pack Go,"" he said.

Just get yourself your guy and you will always be in the hunt if you have a GM that can build a team around said QB, which I think Gute is.  Winning it all is a combo of skill, players, coaching, and ultimately luck.
