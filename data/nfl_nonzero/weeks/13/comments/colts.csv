23046,158044,158044,bjaxkal94,"2023 QB takes

1. Bryce Young - comp for immediate impact - Alex Smith. Young shows hesitancy to throw the ball down the field. Seems to try too hard to aim passes downfield. A KC/ Alex Smith/ Andy Reid style offense that utilizes the screen game and quick passing would work best early on to help him get comfortable with game speed and hopefully develop into pass that’s will to push the ball as needed. Floor- Alex Smith: starter level QB that wont be a detriment to a franchise but also will have questions if “he’s the guy” Ceiling - Tony Romo: multiple pro bowler that will flirt with all pros mobile playmaker
2. Will Levis - comp for immediate impact - Carson Wentz. Levis has all the tools, size and athleticism that’s wanted in todays NFL. Entire field is in play with his arm talent. Needs time to develop more similar to Josh Allen. Processing issues show up on film and footwork needs cleaning up. These could be related to scheme and play design. Mechanics show he’s capable of firing bullets and the deep ball but struggles to layer passes. An early Philly/Wentz/Pederson offense that uses the RPO and play action game would suit Levis best for early success and give him time to develop his field reading and tighten up his mechanics. Floor- Jake Locker: struggled to stay on field as hits pile up due to slow processing and hesitancy. Ceiling: Justin Herbert: dynamic passer that threatens all parts of the field, perennial pro bowler, all pro considerations. 
3. CJ Stroud - comp for immediate impact - Ryan Tannehill. Interesting athletic profile that has every tool but doesn’t necessarily use every tool to its potential. Good arm, not elite. Good athlete, not elite. Prolific college passer that uses the entire field but tends to make throws harder than they need to be. A Tennessee/Tannehill/Vrabel offense that utilizes heavy run and play actions to limit reads and create one on one ones down field will be best suited for early success. Getting better with ball placement and leverage on throws is key to long term success. Floor- Jared Goff: inconsistent performances that show flashes but often disappoints. Long time starter that teams are looking to replace with the “right guy.” Ceiling - Joe Burrow: dynamic field general that distributes the ball over the field with uncanny accuracy. Pro bowler with all pro considerations. 
4. Anthony Richardson - comp for immediate impact - RG3. Hardest eval for me. Similar to Will Levis with more athleticism however does not play in a pro-style offense. In a true college spread system that is heavy in favor of the run out of the gun. Makes throws that make you go wow, both good and bad. A Washington/Shanahan/RG3 offense the runs a lot boot action and half field reads would help translate Richardson’s talent best for immediate success. Half field reads and the ability for him to use his athleticism would go a long way in building his confidence as he continues his development and learns pro offenses. Floor - EJ Manual: gifted QB that never catches on and disappears. Ceiling - preinjury Cam Newton: dynamic playmaker that’s either throwing bombs over the defenses head or running past the defenders. Perennial pro bowler.",6.0,colts,t3_zdqgw5,False,0.0,Pimp Luck,2022-12-06T06:59:29Z,colts,0.0003800550889096

We can keep Jeff Saturday and he can be the motivator/calling people out type of coach with that hard nosed coaching style to make sure a fire is lit under peoples asses. Barring the 4th quarter of the Dallas game, the squad has fought HARD for him and have been competitive against two really really good teams, even a third team with how hot las vegas is getting.

If we keep him though, it's going to make the offensive coordinator position more important than it has been. We basically need another ""head coach"" at that position but a head coach who only focuses on the offense.

Or, we hire an offensive minded coach who will leave his imprint on the offense similar to what Frank did, and it's more of a head coach-offensive coordinator tandem approach.

I'm gonna be honest. I like the Saturday pick, and that's because he reminds me of another coach we had. Tony Dungy. Dungy seemed like he was a very hands off type of coach and didn't interfere too much which is OC or DC, and trusted the X's and O's to them. He managed the game more or less, and focused on supporting the players after a big play or talk them back up after a mistake.

Saturday is a bit on the opposite spectrum as being loud and calling people out, vs Dungy's style of quiet, talk individually type of talks though, but I think we need a more hard nosed coach after Franks timid coaching.",20.0,colts,t3_zf69xm,False,0.0,33-0,2022-12-07T12:29:14Z,colts,-0.040855109038347

You build an offense around the QB's strengths. If he has a big arm, then you draft tall speedy wide recievers who can either burn their guy or go up and get the ball at it's highest point. If he doesn't have a big arm and leans more on accuracy, then you get slippery route runners who can get open with their technique and fundamentals to get open, or the intelligence to expose a zone play.

When you try to plug and play a QB, you have to hope that someone who is coming up in Free Agency or the Draft has the traits to fit the team you have created.
