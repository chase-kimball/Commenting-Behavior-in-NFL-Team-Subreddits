Using EPA we are pretty much league average on both offense (15th) and defense (18th). That is against the 6th hardest strength of schedule mind you so I would expect our EPA ranks to improve over the last 5 weeks. So basically we are more than capable on either side of the ball but not elite. Combine that with good special teams, staying pretty healthy, clutch drives and stops, coaching decisions (4th downs, aggressive play calling as needed) and of course, some luck.

Overall, I'd say we are a good, not elite team that has put ourselves in position for a playoff run. If we get a great Kirk game in the playoffs plus homefield for 2 weeks we have an actual shot of going to the Super Bowl. Do I like our chances against Dallas, Philly, or San Fran in the playoffs?
