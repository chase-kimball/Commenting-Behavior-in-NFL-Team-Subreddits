14197,118177,118177,No_Arm_6781,"Would it really be that difficult to measure? It seems fairly simple to me if you have a win probability model. 

Analyze every game where a team has the ball late and is losing by one score. Look at whether that team’s defense just forced a stop, or just gave up a score. Are the teams that forced a stop *more* likely to win that game than the team that just gave up a score, all other things equal? 

If momentum truly has a tangible effect on the game, then the answer should be a resounding yes. But generally, and as the article points out, these models don’t see that kind of effect. And these models are mostly trained on past games and just aggregating how often teams win in certain situations.

If we lose to the Cowboys then we'll definitely want to beat the Giants to get the bye and home field throughout. Regardless of how we do against the Cowboys, the likely best-case record for the Eagles is 15-2. (though Minshew could still beat the Giants, I guess!)

I think the MVP is Mahomes’ to lose, but if Hurts keeps putting up games like the last 2 weeks and Mahomes and Allen play like their last few weeks, we’ll see that gap thin and I could imagine Hurts credibly taking it from Mahomes over time. But I do believe that if Hurts keeps putting up games like the last 2 weeks and Mahomes keeps being Mahomes, dominating games, making amazing plays and winning games, he should likely still get the MVP.

If Jalen keeps playing these outstanding games, but Mahomes spends the rest of the season being Mahomes and throwing up amazing stats while controlling games and decimating opponents, I still think Mahomes gets it.

I think it’s Mahomes’s to lose, but he took a step down this week with the loss to the Bengals, whereas Jalen took a step up with his masterful performances showcasing completely different skills against the Packers and Titans",2.0,nfl,t3_zcvj57,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2022-12-05T00:25:23Z,eagles,-0.1149999999999999
31868,287686,287686,kahenson,"Edit: tl;dr: the last 2 wins proved that Hurts has both outstanding passing and rushing talent and the wisdom to know how/when to use that talent to win games. The mvp is still Mahomes’s to lose. Even if Hurts keeps playing the way he has these past few weeks, the Chiefs will need to lose a few games due to Mahomes’s missteps for Hurts to really overtake him and win the MVP. But I do think Hurts distinguished himself as the unassailable #2 in the race over the last two weeks.

Hurts just put up two back-to-back statement wins against the two non-division teams left in our schedule who presented some difficulty for the Birds on paper. His performance single-handedly won us those games. More impressively, he won against Green Bay by relying on an anomalous and truly outstanding rushing performance (while also passing for 150+ yards, 2 TDs, and 0 INTs), and then won against Tennessee by posting an anomalous and truly outstanding passing performance (while also scoring a TD on the ground). Those back-to-back statement wins that clearly highlighted both his longtime skill as a runner and newfound skill as a passer, in addition to demonstrating his significant increase in game IQ — knowing when to pull out which skill set to achieve the best results and win games — is, in my opinion, uniquely impressive. 

Further, he improved tremendously (with some credit due to the Howie Roseman building a really great team around him this year as well) from
Last season to this season. It’s night and day. Maybe that’s not exactly relevant, but I find his trajectory of improvement and his humble attitude to be somewhat relevant factors here as well. He stepped up, did the work, got better, and became the leader that the Eagles needed to win games and we’re winning them. 

All that is to say that Jalen has had a great season, which nobody really disagrees with. In terms of the MVP discussion, it’s been said many times here (and I agree) that Allen’s performance over the last few weeks has knocked him back a few rungs. I think he’s lower than Hurts now. Similarly, I think the Chiefs losing to the Bengals has knocked Mahomes back. Between Mahomes and Hurts, I don’t think there’s a particularly credible argument to be made around Hurts being a better QB than Mahomes. Mahomes is the better QB. But the way that Jalen went from “are we even gonna sign him next year?” To “we have a top 3 QB in the NFL and he has a unique, specific, unmatched talent that defenses don’t know what to do with. This uncommon and unique play style still have led the Eagles to their best start  in franchise history,” has, in my opinion, solidified Hurts’ status as the clear #2 for the MVP if the decision were made today. 

The last 2 wins against the Packers and the Titans were big for us, but they were also good wins, where the team controlled the game well and looked very strong. Those games proved that Hurts is the best rushing quarterback in the league and one of the best passers in the league. Buffalo’s recent losses are at least partially attributable to Allen’s missteps. And Mahomes should’ve led the Chiefs to victory against an inferior Bengals team. (Same for us and the Commanders to be fair), but I really don’t think a player who has grown leaps and bounds in a single season, (again, with the help of great talent around him) proven himself to be  a unique, anomalous, league-leading talent as a rusher and top-5 talent as a passer should not be taken very seriously as a candidate, even against an obvious legend and generational talent like Mahomes. Jalen’s also won 2 more games than Mahomes and Mahomes has only 3 more TDs. It’s not a huge disparity, but Mahomes rarely runs, which demonstrates that he has a more limited toolkit in situations where he has to make a game-winning or game-saving play (referring to Jalen’s superior ground game and its ability to come through in the clutch for us). Hurts has provided more value to the Eagles this year than Mahomes has to the Chiefs this year by stepping up, doing the work to get better, and then executing every Sunday. 

Mahomes may be the better QB, but this year, I believe that Hurts us more more adept at single-handedly making game-winning, creative, exciting plays that single-handedly win games. If the MVP does go Mahomes, I will accept that as a quite reasonable choice. He is a generational talent operating at the top of his game in a way that’s admirable and fun to watch. But but I think because Hurts exceeded expectations so tremendously, and established himself in that elite-QB tier this year,he provided more value to the Birds than Mahomes has done for the Chiefs, especially if the Chiefs have another off-game or unnecessary loss. Conversely, if the Eagles start losing like we  did to the Commanders and Jalen starts faltering, I think Hurts will likely (and should) lose his seat at this conversation. But I really think that with the degree to which Hurts has improved in the off-season, the Eagles superior record compared to other MVP candidate teams, and the Bills and Chiefs recent losses to teams that they should’ve should’ve beaten. Hurts absolutely deserves the #2 spot over Allen and/or Tua and is quickly catching up to Mahomes who I believe still is correctly valued as the frontrunner.",7.0,nfl,t3_zcvj57,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2022-12-05T00:11:18Z,eagles,-0.0017860436689461

>**The Commanders had an eight-minute drive that didn’t cross midfield yesterday, could that be an NFL record?**   

It could be.  


>**If not, what is the record?**

Listen, I'm not sure. I Googled it and asked Siri, neither of them knew. This could be the case of you having an absolutely original, unique question that nobody has ever considered before. Or maybe they have but the answer is buried so deep in a book, database or old Reddit thread that it's just not going to be uncovered anytime soon.  


>**Also, what is the record for most time-consuming drive of all-time?**

*Based on the NFL records, the longest drive was by the Tennessee Oilers on 11/27/1997 against the Dallas Cowboys - the drive lasted 13:27. 99 yards.*  


>**Lastly, what is the record for most time-consuming non-scoring drive of all-time?**

A six year pursuit of my goddess crush Meredith that resulted in zero scoring at all. :(
