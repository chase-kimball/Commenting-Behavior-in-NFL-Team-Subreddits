4134,26495,26495,ClevelandOG,"Referee: **Land Clark** the landshark.

Hold on to your butts. He is super inconsistent between weeks. Calls a lot of holding and false starts but impossible to predict him week to week. Some games he goes crazy calling them, sometimes not. If you are looking to get a betting edge based on the referee, this isnt your game.

He originally came from the SEC then mysteriously was promoted to head referee despite never doing an NFL playoff game and within a year of showing up to the league.

If the name seems familiar, you are probably a Bills fan. Hes the guy who called a crazy game last year against the Jags where he was calling penalties on the backup QB (who wasnt dressed for the game) and called an illegal shift on the kicker somehow... Not great.

He is known as a referee who *will* call taunting penalties, so both teams know to be careful.

Basically this is a lot of info to tell you that literally anything can happen.

The four cases that remain active are:  
  
►A woman who accused Watson of sexual assault at a Houston spa in August 2020, when she said he asked her to perform oral sex on him and tried to push her head down to his genitals. Her lawsuit states he applied pressure to her upper body to prevent her from being released from his restraint and masturbated in front of her.  
  
In a previous encounter that year, her lawsuit states he groped her. But she took him again as a client in August 2020 because she didn't realize it was him after he gave a false identity on the first occasion stating he was ""an entertainer,"" according to her lawsuit.  
  
►Another remaining plaintiff is Lauren Baxley, one of the first two women who came forward publicly by name to accuse Watson of misconduct in 2021. She is a licensed massage therapist who said Watson exposed himself to her and caused his genitals to touch her in June 2020. Watson’s attorneys noted Baxley responded to Watson’s messages 19 times after their encounter, suggesting she wasn’t troubled by whatever happened between them.  
  
Baxley’s attorneys, Tony Buzbee and Cornelia Brandfield-Harvey, responded to that by noting that Baxley’s counselor “explained that it is not uncommon for victims to keep in contact with their abusers.”  
  
►A third active plaintiff is a woman who said Watson came to her mother’s house for a massage in Manvel, Texas, more than a 30-minute drive south of Houston. He came to that house with his own personal towel and a non-disclosure agreement for her to sign, according to Watson’s recent deposition testimony. Her lawsuit stated he exposed himself and ejaculated on her in her second encounter with him in November 2020.  
  
A grand jury in Brazoria County, Texas, declined to indict Watson in this case after the woman testified there. A Houston police detective who investigated 10 criminal complaints against Watson still said this woman’s case was one of the strongest.  
  
“That was a really powerful and compelling account,” detective Kamesha Baker testified in a recent pretrial deposition in the civil litigation against Watson.  
  
This is the same active plaintiff who also recently sued Watson’s former team, the Houston Texans, accusing the team of enabling Watson’s behavior.  
  
►The fourth remaining plaintiff is Ashley Solis, the first plaintiff to sue Watson in March 2021 and the first to come forward publicly. Baker said in her deposition “the strongest suit to me was Ashley Solis.”

Watson texted her an apology after the massage in March 2020 and admitted in a pretrial deposition in May 2022 that she was “teary-eyed” at the end of their encounter but he didn’t know why. She said she was crying because she was scared by his conduct, which she said included him exposing himself to her and touching her with his genitals.

Never mind the rationale, those are simple yes or nos but you seem a lil bit chafed so I figured I’d simplify it for you.

Naming one guy like he speaks for the majority of players, versus being chapped about an active player (who does not speak for all but is definitely in the over 70% that prefer grass) telling you his playing preference. Really?  That’s not corny?

Leaving that answer for a more appropriate forum, older turf fields especially the ones I grew up using were awful. Modern rubber infill ones while better in terms of potential injury have different potential problems as well: toxicity due to the recycled materials used, in addition to less give at fairly low temps. 

Is there an inherent risk playing football regardless? 

Yes. But it’s not my workplace. If the employees who use it are stating it’s not a preference in order to minimize (even perceptively) the potential for injury, what’s the problem with it?

33818,231875,231875,randobot456,"So most people have said a bunch of the points, but ill attempt to list them here

1. Absolutely dominant defensive mind.  The giants under his tenure, and the first half of the patriots dynasty are defined by an insanely strong defense, not just because there were great players there (although there were), but because they were well coached and able to change their scheme to fit their opponent.  Bill prioritizes intelligent players who can think on the field and fill the role they need to.  There's a reason why his game plan as DC in the 1990 giants superbowl [was inducted into tbe HOF.](https://www.giants.com/news/belichick-s-gameplan#:~:text=To%20stop%20the%20K%2DGun,hold%20Buffalo%20to%2019%20points)

2. If you remove the best qb MOST of the greatest coaches had in their career, their record gets worse....not a shocking revelation.

3.  If you parse those numbers a bit more, you realize that the .500 without Brady is incredible.  Let's look at those seasons.

>Browns: 1991-1995.  Took a 3-13 browns team to 11-5 in 3 years and won a playoff game.  The team dipped to 5-11 the following year, but a large part of that can be attributed to Art Modells decision to sell the team leading to massive outside distractions; something Bill has attempted to guard his team's against since then.

>Patriots: 2000 the pats went from 8-8 the year prior and took a 1 year dip to 5-11.  The following year they won the ship and began the dynasty.  2008, Brady tears his ACL.  Bill continues steering the ship fresh off their 16-0 season to a comfortable 11-5 with Matt Cassel at the helm.  2020, Brady leaves for Tampa Bay, and the Pats are left in total disarray.  Not just because they don't have a QB, but because they sold out the team for success toward the end of Bradys run.  They now are in a total rebuild.  Despite that, Bill has lead the team to records of 7-9, 10-7, and now 6-6.  Masterful, especially considering how tough the AFC East has become.

4.  Cajones.  Bills career as a coach and G.M. is also characterized by his ability to make, and stick by, incredibly difficult decisions.  With the browns, Bill decided to bench Browns hero Bernie Kosar for Vinnie Testaverde.  Vinnie would go on to lead that team to the playoffs.  Without the pats, Drew Bledsoe had just signed an (at the tjme) record setting NFL contract to be the highest paid player in the league.  When Drew got hurt, even when he was ready to come back, Bill benched him for Brady.  Brady got hurt, and Drew had to play in the AFCCG.  He played well and everyone thought he'd re-earned the job, but Bill stuck with Tom.  We all know how that worked out.  Those are the big ones, but there have been other times where he's made controversial calls that went on to be amazing for the team.",3.0,nfl,t3_zcbjql,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2022-12-04T09:18:20Z,browns,0.018009934136723

This isn't a BAD approach, but here are the issues.

- We have GREAT boundary CB talent, but we're wasting some of it by playing Newsome in the slot.  Emerson seems legit outside, and we know Ward is.  Newsome was great outside last year, but also seems to be the best slot corner.  Either our scheme or his talent makes him a mediocre slot corner.

- Anthony Walker went down early.  Aside from being a veteran voice and stabilizing force on the defence, he also wore the green dot.  Since then it's bounced around, causing communication issues.

- Analytically, building from the corners, edges, and safeties in makes sense - limit passing bc its what does the most damage.
