The Titans got boatraced by the Eagles and they have even more injuries on defense. The Jags have shown to have randomly great games against teams they should lose to and they are healthy. That could be a really interesting game to watch.

I can’t stand hearing discussions about whether a guy is a “Spags fit” based on their body type. The glory days of Spags’s time with hall of fame D-lineman on the Giants is long over and it’s impacting us today. 

I firmly believe this along with Veach’s Achilles heel being evaluating pass rush talent in the draft, has been the root of our pass rush struggles. I think Cullen has done a great job with what he’s got to elevate this unit from last year, but we won’t take a leap forward without a philosophy change to evaluating pass rush talent. This is how we’ve ended up with nothing-burgers like Kpassgnon, Speaks, and Kaindoh. I get that we won’t hit every draft pick, but we have to do so much better at pass rusher.",1.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_zd4xxi,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2022-12-05T08:58:37Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0771421988690949
31605,212686,212686,SylvesterTaurus,"To be more specific, why can’t we draft big body WRs? If the Chiefs had their own guy like Mike Williams, Higgins, Davis, etc. then our offense would be on an even higher level. Hell, look at Alec Peirce in Indy and how well he’s doing despite his QB situation. We need a dude who’s big, physical, and and out-athlete corners and safeties. I think MVS was supposed to be that role, but he’s been streaky at best so it’s hard to tell if he’s the answer.

I just get pissed every time I watch the Colts and Bengals and am reminded we could have drafted Johnathan Taylor, Higgins, or Pittman in 2020. To this day, I don’t understand why the front office didn’t see how a Tyreek/Tee Higgins duo would be a matchup nightmare for defenses or how Johnathon Taylor wasn’t the better player by a mile as a Heisman finalist and the nation’s leading rusher. If things had worked out to Veach’s other plan, we would have also had JuJu a year early. In another timeline, our WR core is Tyreek, JuJu, and Higgins in 2021. Or, more realistically, we could just have Higgins or Taylor in our current team. 

Oh well, what’s done is done and CEH didn’t pan out the way we hoped.
