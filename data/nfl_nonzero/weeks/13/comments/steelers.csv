I didn't love the pick, but I understood it. Many would say that RB is a devalued position group not worthy of a 1st round pick but the metrics say that they have the best boom/bust ratio of any position outside of kicker. 1st round WRs are one of the worst position groups in that metric but go top 10 all the time and nobody bats an eye because the position group is so overvalued its considered to be reasonable.

I wished they would have traded up and got Christian Darrisaw after re-signing James Conner but that didn't happen.

16379,100724,100724,ItsYourBoyD,">the Steelers need to take their medicine 

I once again ask… who has been shit recently or “tanked” and turned into a contender…

Philly? No… a great GM making phenomenal trades and actually making FA signings.

KC? No… traded up as a playoff team to get Mahomes. 

Buffalo? No…. They were a playoff team when they went to draft Allen.

The Vikings? No….

Maybe Dallas? No….

Baltimore? No…. Traded back into the first at 32 to get Lamar.

Has to be San Fran right? Nope.

Cinci? Maybe. Helps when you draft a guy first overall, then lose him for the season. That’s not really tanking, that’s a garbage team losing their best player. 

Miami? Yes, openly. And we saw how good they are when they managed a nice 16 points on us, in a game they should’ve lost. Very good.

The Bucs? No.

The RAMS? No. Bought a SB team, but went 9-7 or better each year from 2017-2021.

So basically one actual contender who hasn’t ever won anything had a “bad season” (two back to back actually) where they took a QB first overall and that QBs top receiving option in college the following year. 

Losing to get good doesn’t work. Of the last 10 Super Bowl champions, NONE went worse than 7-9 in the 4 years leading up to their Super Bowl victory (4 years = a draft classes full contract).

2. Bengals aren’t going 9-8. I see them dropping MAYBE 2 more along the way. The North is theirs.

3. This is the key point if we want to make the playoffs IMO. Looking at who’s ahead of us and who has tiebreakers over us, assuming we go 10-7:

- Jets need to lose 3 of the last 5, potentially @Buffalo, @Seattle and @Miami

- Pats need to lose 2, I don’t see them as a playoff team anyways. They still have Buffalo, Miami, Cinci, a short week into Arizona this week with them coming off a bye and a game in Vegas. 

- Chargers need to lose 2, potentially Vs Dolphins, Vs Titans… they have a fairly soft schedule tbh it’ll be tough. 

- Raiders are one of the teams we need to beat, and they only need to lose 1 more.

- Browns need to lose one more and again, we play them and Cinci plays them. We’re probably more likely to make it than they are.

All those teams get to 8 losses, we end up as a 7th seed, potentially even a 6th seed depending on what happens with Baltimore down the stretch here. In this case, we’d likely travel to Arrowhead again, or to Cinci.

4. Bengals can and will reach 10 wins. We should be more concerned over what the Ravens do, assuming we beat them twice.

20517,140709,140709,Ooziez,"Good:

- Najee/Run game- very solid showing for this unit. The 5 upfront, especially James Daniels, cleared some big holes and pushed people forward. Najee was running hard, bouncing off contact, and hitting the hole. Strong showing. 

- Pat- project pat. Big catches and great YAC. clear that he’s Kenny’s third down go to and that is completely fine by me

- Wright- not always pretty but another great day for Matty Wright. Gets the job done by keeping the ball away from Patterson. 

- Sutton- outside of those ugly sleeves he had a great game. Followed London around and really didn’t let anything happen.  

Bad:

- Diontae- 2 drops. False start. I understand he’s a good player who wants the ball, but you gotta make your opportunities count. Never been one to tag him too hard for drops, but today he had to pull this in. 

- Sims- muffed punt. Out of bounds first down conversion. Dropped pass. Fair catch when it was returnable in the 3q. Very forgettable day for him 

- Redzone offense- we just…. Crumble. Way way way too many field goals. We have to convert there, FG’s will only win you so many games against awful teams. 

- Pickens- not really Pickens himself but Definitely needs to fix his body language and sideline tantrums, but not getting him Involved is mind blowing. Most dynamic guy we have and a total game changer; get him the ball. So I guess this is coaching 

Yet again, tale of two halves. Hard to understand how we keep falling apart in the second half but we do. It’s often times ugly but we lore sneaking out with wins so it’s hard to complain.

31572,219499,219499,Zane_Flynt_boyo,"I think this decade is proving the extent at which capitalism, maybe unfettered capitalism, is valuable on the world stage. Not to say capitalism isnt useful, but we placed too much hope and aspiration in wealth prosperity and assumed it was a panacea for all societal woes. 

The era of Reagan and Thatcher told us “the more capitalism society is, the more society would be better off”. This usually meant a reduction in government oversight and an increase in privatized sectors. Characteristic of the 1980s was the Gordon Gekko quote “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good”. 

More too this point, the concepts of Urho Kekkonens peace in Europe fostered a central concept that if Europe was so economically dependent on each other, war in Europe would never happen, for fear of sanctions and being removed from the world market. 

But this decade has shown us two great things that push back on those central ideas. 1.) That the private sector cannot be unrestrained with it being clear that wages are not keeping up with productivity - a decisive blow to Reagonomics. and 2.) That if countries are too spineless to react to atrocities, removal from the world market is not a sufficient threat to keep Kekonnens peace, because the world market is also dependent on the aggressor, this point proven by Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

Not only did they beat all top three AFC seeds in the playoffs, on the road, they also beat the top two NFC seeds. They had to win out the last four regular season games just to qualify for the sixth seed. A single loss in any of those games was instant doom. The Steelers absolutely dominated each and every one of those eight games. Not one was close. If not for Bettis fumbling at the very end in Indy, the Steelers would have won all eight games by at least ten points. That is so fucking unreal.

In contrast to this, the Seahawks shared a division with teams that won 4, 5 and 6 games. They played against a total of *two* teams in the regular season who ended up over .500 for the year. One was an overtime win against a Giants team that ended up being shut out in the playoffs, and a Colts team that rested it's starters. Literally as underwhelming and overrated a playoff team as has ever existed. And their playoff opponents? A 5 seed and both 6 seeds. Literally the easiest possible path to a championship you could ask for. 

If Roethlisberger had played a game as good as any of the other three postseason games, the Steelers probably win by four touchdowns. As it stood, Ben played one of the worst games he ever would play, and the paper bird team still never seriously threatened to come back or do anything.

Anyone who thinks I'm being a homer can go look at all the numbers.

Also, if you put this guy in more situations to create splash plays, instead of having him run comebacks and curls, his production could outweigh the negative of those drops.
