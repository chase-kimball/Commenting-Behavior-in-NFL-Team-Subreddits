1. Russell’s contract is huge, so we would be looking at allocating a lot of money to the QB position, which would prevent us from filling much bigger holes elsewhere on the roster.
2. I think he has a good chance to start next year if he went to the Jets, Steelers, Texans, Colts, Giants, Commanders, Falcons, Bucs (If Brady retires), or the Saints. He could even start a game or two this year if a QB ravaged team like the 49ers or Rams wanted to sign him as a rental.
