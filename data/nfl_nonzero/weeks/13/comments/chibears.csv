Do his passing stats, qbr, etc. all look like shit on paper? Absolutely.

Does he have the worst bunch of WRs to throw to? It's not even close.

But he's not immune to any blame. Part of his issue is he refuses to check the ball down and play it safe. He reads from touchdown to checkdown far too often. A lot of that is his WRs are trash at running routes so the easiest thing for them to do is try and just run by someone deep. 

Forget him having someone like a Chase, Higgins, Hill, Waddle, Diggs to take over a game.....he doesn't even have someone like a Cole Beasley type to rely on when it's 3rd and 4 and you need someone to win underneath. We fucking suck hitting any type of underneath routes on time and in rhythm.

28460,150198,150198,PwnzillaGorilla,"Get real, guy. If we ever get a good OC, Fields will have to learn a new offense the very next season cuz they'll never stay here too long. This is the reality for us having a defensive HC. If you have a problem with constant OC turnover, take it up with Poles--not me.

And Getsy's ""WTF calls"" have far outweighed the good he's done. He calls games like he's allergic to pass TDs and wants to go right back to 1970s ball as soon as Justin makes an insane long pass. I honestly can't tell if he's incompetent at times or if he's just committed to the tank that much.

Let's use your logic to extrapolate for a second though. You say Getsy played a role in everything good Fields has done. Ok, sure. I'll grant you that for sake of argument. Getsy has played a role in every touchdown, every scramble for 1st down, every play made when his teammates failed him. But if that's the case, the opposite is true as well. All the airmails, all the doinks off linemen's helmets, tripping over himself, the boneheaded picks/pick sixes. Unless, of course, you believe Getsy is only responsible for the good things and nothing else.

You can think whatever you want about what my argument boils down to but I'll just lay it out plainly for you: Getsy's playcalling has been garbage. And our record (among many other things) reflect that, not my emotions over the OC.

And for the record, patronizingly superior behavior of any sort *IS* condescension whether or not it encapsulates your opponent's argument. Just in case you didn't know what that word meant.

The trick play with ESB that netted exactly one yard? Taking Fields out of multiple plays by calling multiple wildcat formations? All the HB dives and pitches on 2nd & long or in the red zone? The conservative playcalling all season long that shows he plays to not lose as opposed to win? Taking 7 weeks to figure out your athletic QB can make plays on his feet?

As nice as the 34th pick is, you have no idea whats going to be there and statistically you're not super likely to hit on those anyways.  Taking a chance on a young player that's already seen some level of success and giving him an extra half season to gel with your QB is a decent trade off imo.  

And everything I've read about Claypool being a 'diva' is either overblown or completely unjustified in the first place.  Dumb decisions? Sure.  Locker room cancer? I doubt it.
