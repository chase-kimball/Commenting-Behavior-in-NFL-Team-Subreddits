2015: 65/69 (54.6)

2017: 18/58 (72.2)

2018: 5/62 (83.6)

2019: 41/58 (66.6)

One good year in 2018 and he was still in the low 80's. His rookie was dreadful and otherwise he was above average. 

He had (1) game with an above 80.0 grade from 2015 to 2017 (finished with 5 in SD/LA). He had (1) above 90.0 grade in 5 years. 

He managed to rush over 1000 yards ONCE in 5 years. Pretty bad for a 1st round draft pick. He was able to boost his numbers in the passing game a bit but any RB without stonehands could catch dump offs from Rivers. Ekeler averaged a full 2 yards/reception more than him with 8 more catches from 2017-2019 (158 - 10.6 Y/R vs 150 - 8.4 Y/R). 

He also fumbled the ball in the worse situations that a RB can fumble in. 

All in all, Gordon was a bruiser RB who lacked vision and awareness but had a a solid tendency to break tackles which helped inflate his y/a. He did not have elite speed and I'd say his pass blocking was solid but not great. 

In his defense, the Chargers did not have great o-lines during his tenure which I will admit fully but they did have Rivers and having an elite QB takes a lot of stress of a RB that imo he didn't take advantage of.",1.0,nfl,t3_zedd40,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers :Bills: Bills,2022-12-06T14:44:41Z,chargers,-0.0667458007929833

Come on, do I really even have to address this? 

You can coach players to punch a ball out, you can coach running backs to hold onto the ball, you can’t coach running at a player while looking scary that makes them fumble the ball.

Fumbling a recovered fumble requires no skill from our team, it’s an absolute one in a million miracle that it happened.


>There are three ways to win: you make the plays when you need to, the other team doesn't make the plays when they need to, or the refs or other random luck hand it to you... All the chargers wins fall into one of the first two categories. 

There’s definitely three Chargers wins and it falls into the latter option of those four. We are absolutely lucky that the Browns kicker missed that FG when he made 15 of 19 attempts on 50+ yard kicks through college, and it was absolute random luck that the Falcons player fumbled the fumble.

I’m always going to be an optimist, but with Lombardi, mans really got to go.

Obviously we as casuals can point out the stick routes and comebacks but it’s the little things that really hold us down on critical downs like bunches, having someone already in motion with momentum when the ball is snapped, or even having both backs on the field so that it keeps the defense guessing.

People were shitting on Kelly and Spiller but when they’re only on the field for 3-5 snaps and you always run them, the defense is just going to load the box.

Even if it’s a drop or 1-5 yards a catch, or for pass pro, let them make those plays so that later in the game, defense isn’t immediately thinking to load the box and play the offense fair .",18.0,chargers,t3_zf5q8t,False,0.0,JUSTIN SHERBERT,2022-12-07T11:12:15Z,chargers,0.095990208
