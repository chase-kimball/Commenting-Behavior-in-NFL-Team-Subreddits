Romo would go on to have one of the worst starts to a game in his career followed by re-injuring himself in process, ultimately ending his career in process. (Although it’s fair to argue the re-re-injuring that in the 2016 preseason against Seattle was the official end)

23438,192215,192215,Tiger_Rivers,"Will McClay, current head of personnel, is black. Our current QB is black. Jerry has continually followed the Rooney rule when interviewing for positions, and this latest picture of him that’s in the news was of him at age 15 simply standing in the frame. 

Sure he might be a racist, I don’t know the guy personally, so I can’t say. But those that do, to my knowledge, have never accused him publicly of much. I know Pac-Man Jones has defended him as has Dak. 

If we want to talk about the broader context of racism within the NFL that’s a fine, and I’d argue necessary, conversation to have, but starting that by going after Jerry with a picture from 65 years ago isn’t the way to do that, and is probably counterproductive to your average (non Reddit/involved) NFL fan. To that point I’m sure we can all think of some family member that sees this as the media trying to cancel a great NFL owner with something he may have been involved with nearly 70 years ago. That’s not productive at all. 

I’m not saying to ignore it, people should be able to confront their own past and show that they have changed, and from everything I’ve seen Jerry has done exactly that.",1142.0,nfl,t3_zanik0,False,0.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,2022-12-02T09:56:27Z,cowboys,0.01119642501

He was the sex symbol of a generation. Could have any woman on the planet, even still today.

My theory: his marriage has always been perfect. But he's always wanted to go spread his wings and actually live the life someone like him could be leading.

He retires. One night, while fed up and bored, he just casually jokes, ""Haha what if I went back"", just to see what Giselle would say. She immediately replies, ""Haha I'd move out and leave your ass.""  
""Wait, really?""  
""Yes. After all these years of you not being home and hardly seeing your kids? Then you finally come home, I see some light at the end of the tunnel, and you go right back before I even have the chance to enjoy it? Dangling this in front of my face like a carrot and I'm a fucking horse? Yes, I'm 100% gone.""  
""I didn't know you felt that way... But don't worry, it's not happening haha.""

That was it, they moved on. But even Tom Brady takes shits, yeah? Even at home, my dude has time alone. And he kept thinking about it. ""If I just go back and play one more year, I can be free again. Single again. And I don't have to cheat, I don't have to hit her, I just have to look like a person who doesn't want to not play football. I go back for a year, she divorces me, and then I can enjoy retirement single and filthy fucking rich.""

His plan is working beautifully. And he looked all stressed during training camp because he didn't actually wanna play. He was at peace, he was done. But this was his out from his marriage. And moments like him screaming on the sideline last night, it's all from a mindset of ""I DONT EVEN WANNA FUCKING **BE** HERE! I JUST WANNA GO FUCK OTHER WOMEN AND EAT A FUCKING BOX OF FRIES. BUT INSTEAD I'M HERE SWEATING MY ASS OFF, GETTING SACKED AND Y'ALL ARE DROPPING PASSES LEFT AND RIGHT, THIS FUCKING SUCKS!""

_______

Great regular season 
 
Yet another first round playoff letdown
  
QB who needs to be improving plays ZERO snaps during the preseason  

That same QB comes out in the home/season opener against a big time opponent that was offensively impotent and ripe for being crushed, and has possibly his worst game as a pro.

Backup comes in and wins a bunch of games.

_______

Like, of course Dak is better. *Of course*. But when your QB doesn't see any snaps during the preseason like he's a top 5 talent, and then comes out on the big stage and plays like a guy who hasn't seen the field in 9 months, people will get kind of fed up with that.

After prolapsing in the playoffs like they did, I want my team's leader to be like, at *least* getting reps in the fuckin dress rehearsal game. And any insinuation that he shouldn't be out there doing what he can to get better should piss him off. Didn't see any of that. Didn't look like he had any desire to be out there.

Look at Micah Parsons this season. Any time we have had a big lead and he gets benched because he's a star and the game is out of reach, he's on the sideline looking like he just found out McCarthy fucked his girl. He always looks like he hates the whole ass world when he's held out. I am okay with him *being* held out in those situations (as it's McCarthy's job to smooth that kind of shit over and channel that frustration into production during the next game), but I *love* to see him want it that bad.

As a fan who has watched Dak be usually pretty good, sometimes fucking great, and also sometimes fucking abysmal, I don't think he's earned the right to be ""guy who doesn't need to play at all during the preseason"". So it's frustrating as hell to see this guy, who needs more reps and more experience to really hit a point in his career that I think he's got the potential to one day hit, to just....not get all the reps he should. And it's his job to go out on night 1 and play to a level of ""still think I need reps during preseason, bitch?"" But instead, just about every throw looked like, ""wow, he looks like a dude who's taking his first snap since January.

So yea, I don't think a lot of the Rush talk was about thinking Rush is better, I think it was just frustration based on all of ^ that.

Dak's accuracy has still felt worse than previous years - don't have any stats to back that up, but it feels like his off-target throws/hospital balls/passes tipped into INTs or almost-INTs have occurred a lot more this season.
