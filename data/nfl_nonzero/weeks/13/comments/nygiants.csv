Worst case scenario, we lose in the first round and get the 19th/20th pick. I'm fine with that vs. the 18th. Bonus if we actually win in the first round (likely @ MIN). 

As for DJ using making the playoffs as leverage, I guess that depends on his agent. If I'm Schoen, that makes no difference to me. DJ at best gets an incomplete this year regardless of how the season ends. He's not all of a sudden getting $40MM from me just because the team made the playoffs (largely on the back of the D, not the O). 

I have not dug into the draft yet. It's too soon for me. But I doubt there's any QB worth taking in the high teens / low 20s so for me, this next draft will be about using draft capital to fill holes (IOL, CB2, ILB, WR, TE - not in an particular order).

There are PLENTY of instances where the coaches have given either non-answers or neutral answers for players they think are underperforming or just don't have it for this team. If you paid attention to the actual games and press conferences you'd know that. Just like they've done with Toney and Golladay since the jump. One was traded after neutral non-commital answers and neither of them were played regularly. The coaching has been clear on who's getting the snaps and who isn't.      
         
Lets see the facts of what coaching has DONE vs what you understand: From what coaching has shown, If you aren't trusted you don't get the snaps. So, tell me, is Jones getting the ball every Sunday or is their boy Tyrod QBing this team?

I think the game plan to go after him would have be to move back in this draft with a team that is hoping to make a playoff run next year to secure an extra first round pick, pray they end up sucking (like the Lions with the Rams and the Broncos with Seattle), and move some players for some mid-round picks. Using those mid-round picks to move up a few rounds + the two 2024 first round picks + probably a 2025 first and/or second is the only way we're getting Caleb Williams.

- we had several opportunities to win yesterday and did not pull through. This feels like a loss more than a tie because of this

- DJ played smart football in all 4 quarters

- Slayton’s Q4 drop killed us. Feliciano’s taunting killed us. Both were errors made by veterans of the game. I would imagine Daboll has no tolerance for Feliciano’s taunting, it’s just sheer stupidity. Unfortunately based on his comments yesterday, it doesn’t sound like feliciano feels he did anything wrong, which is concerning.

- Hodgins is playing pretty well and I’m pleased to see him get more involved in the offense. Looks like DJ trusts him. He seems to be playing the role we expected Kenny to play. I’d like to see him take on the role we give Slayton of the 40 yard downfield jump ball

- I am so glad Azeez is back. The dude is a force. The combo of Thibs and Azeez is great and both were heavily involved in applying pressure yesterday. I’d like to see them set the edge better in the run game, but pass rush is on point

- our CBs got burnt all game. Adoree’s presence was missed

- I hope we sign Love to a new contract. He had a really solid game and the man can drop some big hits

- I think we came out of the game relatively injury free? Which is key to us beating the eagles next week",38.0,nygiants,t3_zd6n39,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-12-05T07:32:42Z,nygiants,-0.0282006711445243

Regardless of how things turned out, at the time people were projecting Drew Lock and Dwayne Haskins as the next-best QB's after Murray.  I know people were expecting teams to trade up or for the Raiders to pick one of those two at #4.  

DJ was projected to go last - to the Pats - if at all in the 1st round.

I was texting my brother at the time and could not BELIEVE Josh Allen had fallen into our laps.  I texted ""Welcome to NY Josh Allen!"" before the pick was in.

Baker might be a tool but that *was* a pretty unbelievable pick.  Also, it's important to note that [he wasn't just trashing DJ out of thin air](https://www.gq.com/story/baker-mayfield-is-feeling-dangerous-profile).  A SportsCenter segment on the Giants draft came on during the interview and he just said he couldn't believe the pick out loud.
