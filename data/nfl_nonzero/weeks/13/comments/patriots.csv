People are gearing up for Kraft to come in and lay the hammer for them to get better and for them to throw around all the cap money they'll have. Honestly, I see if quite the opposite. I think Bill has settled into the rest of his career. I think he's okay scrapping out 7-10 wins a year until he catches Shula and he's not looking to win at a high level, he's looking to survive and avoid headaches. He's got two coordinators that will never usurp his job and will sit around all day and smell his farts if he wants them to, he has a QB who, even though he has pushed back at times this year, still doesn't have a ton of leverage to push back against Bill, he has no high end offensive talent to make waves. I;m very afraid that I think the Patriots we see right now are the Patriots of the next half a decade. 

The Chargers will always be the Chargers. Great talent and can never put it together, going back to Schottenheimer (with the exception of Lynn maybe cause I don't really remember him as a head coach) they've always had these coaches that wanted to win second and prove they were the smartest guy in the room first.

10919,108170,108170,LiveFromNewYork95,"Yes, firing Patricia and giving Mac his third OC in less than two years is not a great move. 

But I will honest argue that firing Patricia and giving the role to Judge, or Caley or hiring Gase, Marc Trestman, Pat Shurmer, Rob Chudzinski, or any other former OC who doesn't have a job, would still be better than moving forward this way. Patricia hates Mac, Mac hates Patricia, the OL sucks, they can't protect Mac, Patricia can't coach them (Trent Brown has totally given up), the WR's hate Patricia. It just doesn't work. If you make a change things *might* blowup but if you don't make a change you're just limping to the finish line anyway. 

The ideal solution of Bill O'Brien wraps up with Alabama and comes on board as an ""offensive consultant"" and can insulte Mac before taking over as OC. But I don't see that happening, Belichick could have hired him this year if he really wanted him and he didn't. And although I think turning Mac and this shit show offense around would put BOB back on the fast track to be an NFL headcoach I don't think he wants to come back here and coach for Bill. 

And the biggest and worst reason there won't be a change, I don't think Bill is being pressured by ownership.

or

Option B) Patricia, a former (bad) Defensive Coordinator and failed HC has no fucking clue how to run an NFL offense, our offensive line (also Patricia's jurisdiction) is a sieve, none of our passcatchers have any clue what's going on, and defenses are calling our plays out at the line - all of which is leading to Mac and the entire offense looking completely lost and dysfunctional.

Which is more likely? You really going to say A?

Everyone on the offense has regressed. Henry went from leading the league in TDs for a TE last year, he's been invisible. Bourne practically had 1000 yards last year and barely sees the field.

Huh? I kinda get what you were going for but that analogy doesn't work at all. The world cup *is* the playoffs so, once your team qualifies, there's only one option: play hard and try to win every single game.

If the pats made the playoffs I'll be rooting like hell for them to win out but honestly, OP's point stands: there is essentially a zero chance of the pats making a playoff run with Patricia & Judge at the helm of the offense.

There are no draft picks in international soccer so there is no ""upside"" to losing. The NFL draft, on the other hand, is structured to promote parity by having the team with the worst record pick first and the super bowl winner pick last. I certainly don't want the pats to intentionally tank but this season is *over* for all intents and purposes.
