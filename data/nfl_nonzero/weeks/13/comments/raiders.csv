5136,38617,38617,Creeping_Death_89,"Not sure where you heard that but Graham himself said that neither of them really exist anymore.

>“The game is sub-defense. Period, point blank,” said Graham, referring to the lack of a defined 4-3 or 3-4 base defense. “Whether it’s 11-personnel that we’re seeing from teams or the 12-personnel that plays like 11-personnel and the way we combat that a lot of time is playing sub-defense. So, when I say sub-defense, now you’re getting into the 4-2-5 world of it. Whatever the spacing is – four-down, five-down, three-down – however the spacing is, you’re really dealing in a world of five DB’s on the field at once. And four bigger bodies with two linebackers.  
>  
>“So, to me the 4-3/3-4 discussions is almost like it’s antiquated, to be honest with you. What you’re talking about sub-defense do you have guys that can rush the passer? Yes. Do you have guys that can stop the run? Yes. Do you have guys that can cover, that have shown they can cover in the past? Yes. So, those are the three major things I’m looking for aside from tackling, so, yeah, I’m good with that.”

But in general the situation is even more unique to Jacobs as a 1st round pick considering the FO turned down his 5th-year option and then also drafted 2 RBs.

There was a point in Le'Veon Bell's career where he was in the exact same situation that JJ is in right now.

Obviously we don't know what's going to happen, that's literally the entire point of using the internet to speculate about the possible outcomes. One of those outcomes could be a tag and sit out situation which based on how it went for Lev Bell hopefully means that won't happen.

Hunter Renfrow and Darren Waller have both essentially missed the entire season and we also spent 3 weeks without a pass-catching TE on the roster due to Waller and Moraeu going down at the same time. We were literally using OT's in the TE spot. 

Our defense is one of the worst in the league and has lost multiple starters to injury and suffered from having no clear cut starter in the DT, OLB, LCB, and SS positions. It's been better lately but earlier in the year (I think week 8?) the best offense in the league was the combined teams that had played the raiders defense.
