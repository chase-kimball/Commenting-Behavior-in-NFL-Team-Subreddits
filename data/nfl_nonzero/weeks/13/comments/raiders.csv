>‚ÄúThe game is sub-defense. Period, point blank,‚Äù said Graham, referring to the lack of a defined 4-3 or 3-4 base defense. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs 11-personnel that we‚Äôre seeing from teams or the 12-personnel that plays like 11-personnel and the way we combat that a lot of time is playing sub-defense. So, when I say sub-defense, now you‚Äôre getting into the 4-2-5 world of it. Whatever the spacing is ‚Äì four-down, five-down, three-down ‚Äì however the spacing is, you‚Äôre really dealing in a world of five DB‚Äôs on the field at once. And four bigger bodies with two linebackers.  
>  
>‚ÄúSo, to me the 4-3/3-4 discussions is almost like it‚Äôs antiquated, to be honest with you. What you‚Äôre talking about sub-defense do you have guys that can rush the passer? Yes. Do you have guys that can stop the run? Yes. Do you have guys that can cover, that have shown they can cover in the past? Yes. So, those are the three major things I‚Äôm looking for aside from tackling, so, yeah, I‚Äôm good with that.‚Äù

There was a point in Le'Veon Bell's career where he was in the exact same situation that JJ is in right now.

Obviously we don't know what's going to happen, that's literally the entire point of using the internet to speculate about the possible outcomes. One of those outcomes could be a tag and sit out situation which based on how it went for Lev Bell hopefully means that won't happen.
