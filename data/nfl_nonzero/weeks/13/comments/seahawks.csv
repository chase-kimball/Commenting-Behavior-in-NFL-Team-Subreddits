The national discourse has switched to a narrative of great QBs carrying teams single-handedly, when in reality it is (and always has been) something like 20% / 30% / 50% split of QB, coaching staff, and the rest of the team.

A HUGE reason for Russ's success (as this season shows) is due to the system he played in, the team he played with, and the coaches and organization he played for, and with all that taken away it's really really really hard to regularly carry a team no matter how good you are (and I do think he is good, with some elite traits as well as some deficiencies as well).

That's also why you can plug a good or even below average QB into a good system/team and find a decent level of success (e.g. the 49ers). It's a team game and while QB is a huge factor, it's never 90% of it like the media loves to portray (as much as I love QBs like Allen and Mahomes haha)",55.0,nfl,t3_zd9e0r,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-12-05T12:10:44Z,seahawks,0.1636798482510288

8568,64729,64729,Esuu,"Let's look at the turnovers we've had.

Week 1:

* DK fumble - This was just sloppy, but it was also week 1. Haven't seen anything like this from DK since.

Week 2:

* DeeJay Dallas interception - Just a silly play call. Fortunately, we have moved away from this play.
* Geno interception - Not the best decision but the 49ers defense is legitimately good and made a great play here.

Week 3:

* Geno interception - 4th and 18 at the end of the 4th quarter. Just a desperation throw, doesn't really matter.

Week 4:

* Lockett fumble on punt return - Not ideal but I'm not too worried about Lockett's ball security.

Week 5:

* DK ""fumble"" - Still think this was bullshit.
* Dickson turnover on downs - For some reason our punt blocking sucked for a couple weeks there.

Week 6:

* Dickson fumble - see week 5.

Week 7:

* Geno pick - Not the best decision, great play by the defender and the Chargers were lucky it deflected somewhere that could be caught.
* Geno/Eskridge fumble - Again we've fortunately stopped doing Eskridge toss plays.
* Walker safety - Some poor run blocking here. Not really ball security related though.

Week 8:

* Lockett fumble - Just a great play by Andoree Jackson and unfortunate that Lockett wasn't down. Again, not worried about Lockett's ball security.

Week 9:

* Geno pick 6 - Just a bit of laziness in the throw here, but the response the rest of the game makes up for it.

Week 10:

* Geno fumble - This seemed like either a weird broken play or it was a designed QB run that was really poorly blocked/executed. This fumble is definitely a bit of damnit Geno moment, and certainly a ball security issue.

Week 12:

* Geno/Walker fumble - A mesh point fumble is always annoying. Another bit of an execution and ball security error.
* Geno interception - Our WRs basically ran into the LB dropping into coverage disrupting the route that Geno was throwing with anticipation. Watching the all-22 the ball is out of Geno's hands before Lockett essentially stops his route. Just unfortunate really, and a good play by Perryman.

So that's all of our turnovers. 15 turnovers is right about league average. Could most other team break down their turnovers like this a justify a lot of them? Probably. Could some of these have been mitigated? Sure. Looking through them though, I don't really see a ball security issue. It more just seems like there have been a couple plays in the last two games that might make one think that.
