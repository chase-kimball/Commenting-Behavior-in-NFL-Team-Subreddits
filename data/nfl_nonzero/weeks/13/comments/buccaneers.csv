Nope. 

They love the song in Germany because it somehow became a big hit for Oktoberfest (the beer festival)

And it's such an (old school) American song that probably someone at the stadium thought it would be cool to play it..and the crowd loved it aaaand the rest is (contemporary) history

>The oddest and maybe the most fervent ‚ÄúCountry Roads‚Äù stronghold outside of Appalachia, however, might be Germany. Hermes House Band, a Dutch act, recorded the song and that group‚Äôs version shot to the top of the German charts in 2001. It‚Äôs been a staple of Oktoberfest celebrations for decades now. Danoff was invited by Germany‚Äôs ambassador to the U.S. to play a gig at the German embassy in D.C. in 2013 just so he could sing the song.

>‚ÄúThey made me sing it four times,‚Äù Danoff told me yesterday from his D.C. home. 

>He‚Äôs also been a guest of honor of the Steuben Parade, a sort of St. Patrick‚Äôs Day celebration for German Americans held each September in New York City. Danoff didn‚Äôt watch the Seahawks-Buccaneers game over the weekend, so he didn‚Äôt catch the amazing singalong in real time. ‚ÄúBut lots of people were telling me about it,‚Äù he says. 

>And lots of people are asking him how the heck his old song is so big in Germany. He tells them what he‚Äôs been telling them for years: He has no idea.
