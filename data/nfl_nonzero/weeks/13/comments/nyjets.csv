I agree though like it's not bad to be a system QB, every QB is in some way highly affected by the system and supporting cast around him. Aaron Rodgers is one of the best of all time and both of his bad years have come when his WRs are just not good. And i think QB play can be very sensitive to different changes around them, and that sensitivity is adjusted by the amount of talent they have.

I didn't say it's decided post-snap. It's clearly part of the pre-snap decision. And his decision to run the drop he did, SHOWS what his first read was tied to, which was Ty Johnson. which he chooses to do, not the OC. The OC can suggest what the first read should be based on the coverage, but the QB decides the reads himself based on what they believe is happening.

both takes on him not expecting to have time on it, or not actually having time for it- are based on something he COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN at the time of setting his pre-snap decision. Whether it was a risky play is something he could have known but again there is no reason to credit this as a big A+ for not CHECKING IT.

14199,99796,99796,NannigarCire,"no, it probably isn't made 90% of the time. 90% of players don't contort their body in the opposite direction of their momentum to catch the low ball. the standard for the WR in the NFL is not even close to that high. it's a very tough play to make and i don't understand where any concept of this being an easy one to do comes from. it is very difficult. not a 90% catch rate. There are i think 5 plays where a similarly positioned ball is thrown at a Jets WR and i don't think a single one of them was caught. a large amount of players will probably just let this hit the ground altogether because they will not be quick enough to recognize the balls trajectory against their momentum, or move their body quickly enough, or finish the play. and again, it's the only placement that allows Hicks to make a play on the ball. There are better placements and they were available. It's on White. Berrios could catch it. But he also could've just let the ball sail behind and not even tried, which would've made it more obvious- it's the fact that he put in that insane effort to almost catch the ball that even makes it possible to blame him. It's like when a defender misses a tackle after coming all the way from the other side of the field- they're lucky to even have made it there in the first place.

IMO Kendricks (the LB under moore) wouldn't have time to undercut it, it would be a very close play where he'd be somewhere in the vicinity but an on time pass would not lead to him getting there. he still has a lot of ground to cover before he will make it to Wilson. But again- even if he ended up seeing that the linebacker was coming, White never even attempts to recognize this event. He is already pre-determinately going towards Ty Johnson. 

[Here's the exact moment the ball has left the hands of White (the end of his throwing motion)](https://imgur.com/2FgTJIB). The time is there. There is a chance it wouldn't be, lets even pretend it wasn't there, but the way White plays this he never has a chance to figure out. He also doesn't have to run a quick drop. He can go deeper, because the drop depth is based on his decision to pre-determinately go to the shorter route. If he wanted to read Wilson, he could extend his drop. And all of this goes back to the main criticism- his conservatism leaves these plays unexplored. Ty Johnson was always going to be there. But he never thought about seeing what the other option provided.

>I‚Äôm sure you could cherry pick examples of everything,

trying to imagine what gotcha this is trying to make out and what i'm imagining is someone believing there's a conspiracy i'm creating to contrive a totally false narrative on an otherwise great QB.

> Do you think by looking elsewhere that defender somehow drifts so far to the inside that he‚Äôs out of position?

i have no idea. I don't know. There's a lot of subjectivity in this play. I'm noticing it as part of a bigger pattern of his eyes being quick to stare at the target, and that leading defenders who watch the QB to react to it. If he's not watching, i don't know what the CB would do. He might do nothing. But the point isn't that White is why this play doesn't finish (i agree that Conklin's depth might play a part in that), it's that White could've added something to this play by using that but he didn't. And it's not an isolated incident. I can imagine how you believe this isn't a 'fair criticism' if you think this is the only play i can find of it. But I chose it because it's an interesting what-if. [The Harrison Smith near INT in the 4th Q is just a more egregious one that is undeniable, but that's boring for analysis.](https://imgur.com/SigCUaC) I like to choose plays where something as mundane as just looking off a bit more could've resulted in a much larger chain of events occurring because it expresses the immense subtlety and difficulty of the QB position much better than just visceral obvious events.",5.0,nyjets,t3_zdlht9,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-12-05T19:44:12Z,nyjets,0.0146771991233868
14200,99797,99797,NannigarCire,">I don't like the framing. You invite comparison but you don't say what it takes to be ""a QB"" so it's a straw man argument.

i don't follow what you're saying here. there's no set criteria for being a QB- the QBs skills are all based on their relationship to each other and no specifically rigidly defined critiera will help make it clear. White's pocket presence means he needs less athleticism because he is rarely off balance. His quick decision making in the short game means he needs less throwing power since he throws early and on time. so on so on. you can't just like, make a checklist. everything occurs in relationship to each other.

>Because like all QBs with 5 starts they are inconsistant with their play and hasn't been exposted to all that is football and until we see that, we can't know the risks very well.

sure. but across 3/5 starts that span 2 years he's shown some very consistent tendencies. ive reserved my opinion on him until now because until now it wasn't clear if there was any pattern to his play. but there is. i don't know if he'll change, but my guess is not. probably just refine a bit. i think he could learn how to not stare down his target, even if he knows where he's going pre-snap. he could built up his intermediate accuracy a bit more. but none of this is guaranteed.

The following play was the Conklin 4th and 2 that wasn't finished. It's not a tall ask, it's something QBs in the nfl definitely do. I'm not watching White in a vacuum and asking him to do something that my mind logic'd out.

i don't think white should've looked left, he should hold closer to the middle while still looking right. QBs do this often. If this was Brady, he would basically be looking down the right hash with his head but have his eyes all the way to the right. It makes it seem like he's looking in one direction but he's actually looking the other. Zach knows how to do it as well, if only he could do the other parts. Again, i'm not sure if it would play a part because i'm not sure how that corner in this situation would've reacted to it. But *the CB has line of sight on Conklin and the QB and there's a chance that if he's not staring at Conklin the CB drops further above him instead of staying at his hip. But i can find you another play of him staring at his target if that would convince you it's a real thing he does, and that it affects the plays.

>ompletely catchable ball thrown at the needed awkward arm angle

this is just a fully disagreeable take. just because the one camera angle makes it look like the arm angle and all was necessary doesn't mean it was. it's not a reach either, the ball is thrown low and closer to the defender than any other throw would've. it's seems ridiculous to have you claim i'm making an unfair criticism when White puts the ball in the one spot the defender has any play on. I can find him doing that in multiple plays on this game, this one is just the most impactful. i don't undersatnd this whole 'getting blown up' idea either. he doesn't have to throw him laterally towards kendricks. he can throw him deeper towards the back of the endzone. that's actually how most QBs would make this throw.

i don't see what you're talking about re:elijah. he's looking at the trips which just lets him read the whole thing. but what he should do imo is hold his head more inside as he does so to at least not over-commit and tell defenders where he's going. it's unrealistic for him to stare down the middle as he drops back for this one, but he could potentially do more with his eyes. unclear if it would help this specific play but he lacks these habits overall which is why it stands out to me. i saw the same thing in the chicago game. the harrison smith play is where it's most egregious, maybe i should've gif'd that one

He didn't simply check the ball down either, as he made many throws in the intermediate range, as noted by his 11.3 YPA.

No. His air yards per attempt last week was 5.9. if that number held across the season, it would be the 3rd lowest amongst all QBs with only Colt McCoy and Kyle Allen being lower. Right now, as of the last two years- Mike White's games rank the following in air yards per attempt (AYPA) out of 937 individual QB games where a player threw at least 10 passes in the last 2 years:
> vs CIN: 3.7 AYPA, 9th lowest

> vs CHI: 5.8 AYPA, 157th lowest

> vs BUF: 6.6 AYPA, 299th lowest

> vs NEP: 6.8 AYPA, 333rd lowest

> vs IND: 9.2 AYPA, 720th lowest (217th highest)

He has one game in his career throwing further down the field than average, and it was the one he got knocked out against. I bet he would end that game a lot lower if he finished it, and in the other games where his AYPA was higher, they were his worst performances.

He's an effective short passer, but he is very prone to checking down and playing the underneath game. YPA does not in any way measure the depth of passing- it is the total completed yards. It's a complete misunderstanding of the statistic. Being willing to throw down the field more often doesn't mean anything specifically either, but you can not retcon him into someone he is not. Until he does so, giving him credit for something he does not do is completely wrong.

>He also has shown that he has plenty of arm strength to fit the ball in tight windows. Look at the second TD to Garrett Wilson last week. He fit the ball over the linebacker and in front of the DB on a ball that required a lot of zip, but still touch to get it over the linebacker's outstretched hands.

His near INT to the linebacker that is argued as arm strength is also misevaluated- the linebacker was never part of the equation because what actually happens on the play is the LB made an insane recovery after the playaction that was highly unanticipated and that White probably did not even calculate. Even if the Linebacker got his hands on the throw and taken it away, White would've not been to blame as it was just an impressive play by the Linebacker to be in that position from where he began. Earlier in the same game, he tried to make a throw where he did not calculate Eddie Jackson's position and got nearly picked off. In that one, he was wrong, in this one- he would've been right even if he was intercepted. That's to say, it's not unusual for him to not account for a players position. He is not shown that kind of elite mental processing, which is also evidenced by his tendency to checkdown. In any case, it's not a sign of arm strength.

This post is, to me, just as offputting as the ""Mike White is the franchise savior"" or ""Mike White is a nobody"", as it argues nothing and has no actual basis.

17094,112946,112946,Phifty56,"I was bitching all game about these refs.

* That 3rd down conversion that led to the easy run in by the Vikings. The refs spotted the ball short based the marker. Another ref picks up the ball, move it a bit closer to the 1st down marker, and it's still short. Saleh for whatever reason HAS to challenge it for them to look at it, and they refuse to measure it. They justify the 1st down by claiming the forward progress took JJ past the line. IF that was true, why did the spot it short not once, but twice. In slow motion it does look possible, but the entire process was fucked. Refs should not be allowed to eye shit like this especially on such a big down. It's fucking ridiculous.

* The White QB sneak. Again, Saleh had to challenge it. It was such a clusterfuck and it was a such a big play for either team, that it shouldn't even have been a question to look at the play. Goalline plays have unique conditions that should always warrant a 2nd look on close plays, yet they almost didn't want to be bothered. So what happens when if they ruled against the Jets on this play? Do they get a magical ""Fuck you go directly to the loss column card"" when a 3rd big play happens and they refuse to even double check it? These refs sure did not want to work on Sunday, which leads me to example 3.

* On the Greg 60y FG, one of the Vikings defender #98 either Leaped(trying to jump over the line) or Leveraged (using another player to launch themselves). They didn't call either one, which didn't matter in the end, but had Zurlein missed it, either flag should have been a 15 yard, automatic first down and should have gotten another shot.

* I am convinced that they were closing their eyes to tons of holding against the Jets DL. There were just so many unnatural sudden stops against the DL when they were about to beat their guy, especially in grabbing range of Cousins.

Overall the refs were too hands off slanted towards the Vikings. It's like they wanted to ""let them play"" from the beginning, but it vastly benefited the Vikings multiple times and didn't hurt them at all.",21.0,nyjets,t3_zd672w,False,0.0,":PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya",2022-12-05T12:02:25Z,nyjets,0.031645308883876

* Modernize the [classic 78'-97' logo](https://nfl-teams.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1978-New-York-Jets-logo.jpg) a bit and make it the official logo for normal use. Use the other historic logos sparingly or in combination with throwback variations.

* Be Bold.

Does benching Wilson hurt his confidence and cost him real NFL reps where he can sort out his issues? Of course. Wilson does have mechanical issues that are fixable with drills and training, but they also feel to be partially mental as well, and not being able to during real games might never let him get over the hump.

However, the Jets have to do what the Jets need to do to help the team, not just Zach Wilson. If Wilson is the key roadblock in the team making sure the team has a winning season and other players develop, then you absolutely have to ""punt"" on the issue and deal with it later, even if it has reprecussions.

So while it might suck for Wilson to be thrown under the bus as the ""franchise QB"" for the team it sends a strong message that no one is above the team, and you need to play your ass off to remain a starter.
