28105,196278,196278,Why_So-Serious,"1.) He had 3 feet in bounds. The 3rd foot eliminates all the going to the ground stuff. That is where the NFL made a mistake. 

2.) If you miss the 3 feet being down and you look at the play as only 2 feet then the call is correct. Catch is 3 parts 1.) Possession 2.) Two feet in bounds 3.) football movement. 

In the event you only complete 1.) & 2.) and you go to the ground. Then you must retain possession while going to the ground out of bounds. 
When Po goes to the ground it clearly pops up in his chest when he loses control. He regains control when he is out of bounds. That means he didn’t complete 1, 2 and 3 so it’s a no catch. 

If the same thing happened in the middle of the field. It would be an INT because he would regain control in the field of play. 

The biggest factor, (if you miss the fact he completed #3 with a 3rd foot) is he lost control of the ball then regained out of bounds.
