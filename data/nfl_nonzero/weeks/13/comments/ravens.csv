Instead of banking on injured guys to come back healthy on the oline and rb postion (for 2-3 years in a row). Or choosing Greg Roman over Hollywood brown and not using any of the 11 picks we had in the draft on wr last draft. Relying on year 2 bateman to be the number 1 guy when last year he didn't play a full season and this year he won't play a full season. Or Relying on tyllan wallace, James proche, mahomes sloppy seconds in Robinson (who was like wr 4 for them), or trying to hope duvernay could be a number 2 wr instead of a number 3/4. Or insert the other low round/undrafted/ XFL players we brought in over the years. Or the fossils we bring in like desean jackson this year or dez bryant coming off significant injury and not playing in the league 3 years prior or the other do nothing old guys. I will never forget EDC picking up Alejandro Villanueva last year to play tackle for us and the Steelers fans (rightfully so) laughed at and mocked us. Everyone and their grandmother knew that was a bad move and it was still made(like we don't play them twice a year). Don't get me started on hoping Jujuan James could play after only playing 4 games since 2019(1 of those with us 2022).


EDC has done some good things but we are going to look back at the Lamar rookie contract years and realize he wasted Lamars rookie window on a outdated way of playing ball that doesn't get us over the hump in the playoffs. And instead of fixing some of those offensive problems we double down on the system and continue to do the same thing. We can't even fore Steve fucking Saunders let a lone Greg Roman.


I can't even belive we only have 2 players from the 2019 draft left and only 1 is starting the other would have been cut this year if our 2 starting RB's could stay healthy.


I say all that to say if fans and non ravens fans can see this I'm sure other teams Gms and staffs see it too and they probally think they could do more and a better job than the Ravens did with Lamar over the last 5 years.",0.0,nfl,t3_zek6pu,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-12-06T16:50:14Z,ravens,0.0421830759122084

When you have a lack of a deep threat, you have no way to keep the defense honest. They can play 7 in the box every down, cover the middle of the field, and reliably shut down your offense more often then not. 

Sure, with all those factors, you're going to score points. But you're going to have droughts like, idk, going 2-3 games without scoring an offensive touchdown. 

If the Ravens don't run the ball well, the offense sputters. We don't stretch the field, we don't get creative with passing concepts, we just keep running at them hoping to ""wear them down"" and, because statistics are a thing, we will beat more teams than we don't.

Not on board with Martin, but I'd like us to actually hold interviews instead of next-man-up OC'ing.

> Lamar signs a team friendly deal, especially after his knee injury, but still makes him $48.5-50M a year with a lot guaranteed.

The contract is going to be based on Lamar's best. Lamar's playstyle is not what has gotten him hurt twice. Both times he's been injured standing in the pocket. He *will* reset the QB market, and will get a gtd contract somewhere I am almost certain. ATL will go hard on him.

Don't like this, tbh. We need first round corner this year. Target trades for WR.

MP has no cap hit next year. He's a FA. We'll let him walk and, yeah, hopefully re-sign RS.

31481,177948,177948,ZombieFeedback,"Two points.

First, if you really think organizational philosophies don't change and adapt based on the way the game moves and their rosters change, you really need to pay more attention. The Rams went to the Superbowl in 2018 with a run-first offense built around Todd Gurley and play-action passing. Three years later they went back to the Superbowl with an offense that ran the ball the ninth fewest times in the league. Hell, the Ravens have changed offensive philosophy, Greg's scheme is completely different from Trestman's, which was completely different from Kubiak's, which was in a similar coaching tree but still different from Cam Cameron's. All of them are a completely different offense from Matt Cavanaugh's unit in 2002. I don't know if you're being facetious and just taking the piss, but if you legitimately, genuinely feel like the Ravens are the same team they were in 2002 because they run the football at a higher-than-average rate in both years, then as I said before, I really don't know what to tell you, because that is the football equivalent of thinking modern computing is no different from the punchcard era because they're both using electricity. There is so much more nuance and complexity to the sport than that.

Second, I echo what I said at the top. I don't understand this ""Go root for another team if you don't love everything about it"" mentality. Should Rams fans who liked that run-first style from 2018 have abandoned them when they went back to the Superbowl? Should fans just shrug and stop liking their team as soon as there's a change in organizational philosophy that doesn't 100% align with every thought they have about the sport, just swapping allegiances like they're changing outfits? Have the Ravens never done anything that you didn't completely, unequivocally approve of? If not, did you leave when their organizational philosophy differed from your thoughts? Never digging deeper, never being critical, never taking a stance beyond ""Love everything about 'em, ride or die"" or ""I don't agree with everything they do therefore I'm changing teams,"" I just do not get that at all.

When people point out that EDC, while certainly a good GM, has had his share of misfires, they get berated with ""Well if you're so smart why hasn't any front office hired you, mister GM?"" as if it's a requirement to have every answer to every problem before you're allowed to make an observation.

31485,177952,177952,ZombieFeedback,"Unsurprised disappointment. 

I was all for giving Greg a mulligan over last year due to injuries, but the offense has continued its regression in 2022, and while there *are* excuses this year, they're out of the ""Who desecrated an ancient burial site"" territory and more in-line with the setbacks every team suffers in this war of attrition we call a sport. Yes we have been particularly hard hit at RB in a run-first offense, but on the flipside, OL has basically been 100% all year outside of LT. Mekari's no Stanley, but you can absolutely build a strong ground game on the backs of Mekari-Powers-Linderbaum-Zeitler-Moses. If you subtract Lamar and Huntley, then on a per-carry basis, we're mediocre; Drake, Justice, Gus, JK, Davis, Sweepernay, and Screen Pass Pat combine for 4.4 yards per carry, tied with New Orleans and Carolina for 16th. If Greg is the ground game genius whose passing deficiencies are made up for by his unstoppable rushing attack, then he shouldn't be relying on a generational athlete at QB to make it do something beyond average.

If we hit 2023 and there's no change, the only thing I'd be able to say is that it's in-character for John. The regression since 2019 has been gradual but consistent, even if you ignore 2021. The problems have gone uncorrected in spite of being very correctable with literally years to work on them, from poor route combinations to an inability to get the play in quickly to league-leading presnap penalties due to too much of a good thing with the motions. Greg had a great fastball, but the league adjusted to it, and he's refused to develop an off-speed pitch.

If you seriously think the Ravens haven't changed and adapted over the years based on the changing dynamics of the NFL, I don't know what to tell you lol

Patrick Queen is a safety in 2003, he's smaller than Ray and Ray was considered undersized, but defenses have gotten smaller and faster as offenses have pushed the upper limits of outside speed and signed Olympic sprinters like Marquise Goodwin, so he's a prototypical modern Will. Isaiah Likely doesn't get drafted in 2004, receiving weapons at TE like Kellen Winslow and Tony Gonzalez existed, but prior to the mid 2000s when guys like Antonio Gates and Jason Witten gained prominence, and especially the early 2010s with pure receivers like Jimmy Graham, a guy like Likely who was a converted WR with questionable blocking coming out college just weren't very common beyond UDFAs since the ground game was still a focus and blocking was more important. I can go on, but 90% of the Ravens organization in 2022 would not exist in 2002. Hell, a lot of it wouldn't really exist in 2012.

I've never understood this ""Go follow another team if you don't love everything about the Ravens"" mentality. Are we just not supposed to ever criticize anything about the organization? Can we not have any more depth or nuance to our sports opinions beyond ""Go team""?

I like doing sports analysis. It used to be my job. [I write long-winded punting analysis for fun.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/utlf96/sam_koch_was_snubbed_on_the_2010s_alldecade_team/) Taking a critical look at the team I root for is part of the fun for me, I wouldn't enjoy the game anywhere near as much if I didn't think critically and analyze the Ravens, both the good and the bad.

Also I love the insinuation that these opinions are inherently uninformed. Pretty much every stat you could ask for is available for free, from simple stats like total rushing yards to complex stats like average air yards to first down per throw.

That doesn't mean every yahoo with a reddit account is going to have the depth and understanding of Belichick or Saban, but it does mean people can formulate opinions that have more thought and reasoning to them than a 105.7 caller's rant, and those opinions deserve more consideration than the football equivalent of ""If you don't unquestioningly love America then go back to Russia, commie.""

31489,177957,177957,ZombieFeedback,"Three points:

1. You need to account for Justin Tucker. A man who holds the record for career accuracy *and* career long is an undeniable weapon, the Ravens routinely come away with three points in situations where 29 other teams get a punt. If we exclusively look at offensive touchdowns, there is a clear regression: 1st in offensive TDs in 2019, 9th in 2020, 19th in 2021, and 12th so far in 2022. This regression is echoed in pretty much every measure of offensive efficiency. Points per drive has gone 1-9-18-9, suggesting that at absolute best they're stuck in neutral as far as getting touchdowns instead of field goals on their scoring drives; Red zone efficiency has gone 2-12-12-24, suggesting that the offense only works when the defense has to cover the entire vertical field and has no answer when the only way to spread them is horizontally; yards per drive and plays per drive have gone 2-14-13-11 and 1-16-7-18, respectively, suggesting those long, clock-killing drives are disappearing as defenses adapt to Greg's fastball, and he neglects to develop an offspeed answer. This is echoed in Justin Tucker's average kick length growing steadily larger; Average field goal distance is 38 yards, attempts from further than that have gone from 12 in 2019, to 14, 21, and currently on-pace for 19 in 2022. We are increasingly stalling out and failing to score touchdowns, and the only reason this isn't reflected more dramatically in our points per game decline is because we have the greatest kicker in NFL history to guarantee we get three points every time we cross midfield.

2. You also need to account for a very good defense and perennially excellent special teams backing him up. Ravens starting field position has gone 9-2-30-2. Turnover generation rate has been 5-11-29-2. Third down rate allowed went 12-2-3-2. Between consistently forcing turnovers, consistently forcing punts on third down, and routinely outstanding return units - 2021 notwithstanding since you were a Jimmy Smith Knee Injury away from tailgate tryouts for starting corner - Greg's offense routinely winds up with excellent starting field position. The average starting field position is 29.75 yards. In spite of this consistently favorable field position, the Ravens have been forced to settle for field goals at a higher and higher rate as defenses have adapted to Greg's offense. (20-15-6-5) You might argue that any points are good points and when your kicker is Justin Tucker of course you kick more, but again, our best offensive year, we attempted the 12th-fewest in spite of also having Justin Tucker then. When you're starting on the thirty and you have a kicker whose accuracy from 50+ is higher than the career accuracy of most kickers at any distance, you are effectively two first downs away from field goal range. With Justin Tucker, even a terrible offense will only look average if you exclusively look at points per game.

3. Let's assume all of this is moot. Points win ball games, and the Ravens offense is scoring points. Who cares about leaving touchdowns on the field? If Wink is any precedent, there is still plenty of justification to move on; Wink's defenses moved 2-3-2-19 in points allowed. He consistently had one of the best defenses in the league when it came to points, with the only exception being 2021 when every corner on the roster died. The Ravens still moved on from him, because his scheme, while effective, was stifling the growth of talented young players - look at Judon and ZD Smith's cosmic leaps forward once they left for evidence - was pushing free agents away, was clearly at a plateau, and while effective against the league at-large, it was consistently unable to keep pace with the offenses you're going to wind up seeing in January. Despite accomplishing his job of preventing scoring at an even more consistently excellent rate than Greg scores, we still moved on from him, because he was not going to get us where we wanted to go, he refused to adapt his scheme, and that scheme kept us from being able to reach our full defensive potential. Swap ""defense"" for ""offense"", ""points allowed"" for ""points scored"", and ""Wink"" for ""Greg"", and literally every word of that applies to Greg's offense. If last year was time to move on from Martindale, this year is time to move on from Roman. Scoring totals be damned, just like they were with Wink.

31495,177969,177969,ZombieFeedback,"The complete lack of spread concepts is something that has absolutely infuriated me for years.

[We have faced the fourth-highest rate of man coverage in the league this year](https://www.pff.com/news/week-11-man-and-zone-rates-vikings-zone-collapses-vs-cowboys-rams-ultimate-gauge-of-chiefs-gamelan-influence-power), trailing only KC, Cleveland, and Green Bay. You might notice that other than Amari Cooper and *maybe* Christian Watson, all four of these teams have garbage WRs. The only real #1s other than Cooper are both tight-ends. If the receivers don't scare you and you can trust your corners to erase the terrifying presences of James Proche and Mecole Hardman, that frees up everyone else to do so many things.

All three of those teams run a much higher percentage of their plays from spread formations, Cleveland substantially less than KC and GB both because Chubb-Hunt > Jones-Dillon > CEH-Pacheco and because Mahomes > Rodgers >>>>> Jacob E. Brisket, but still at a much higher rate than the Ravens. The reason for this is pretty simple: even the best cornerbacks get beat sometimes, so by spreading the field, you reduce the amount of help they get when they do. Mix that with a QB making quick, decisive reads, and you have a system that isolates defenders and punishes the inevitable mistakes that happen in man coverage. It gets even deadlier when you have the weapons the Ravens do in Mark and Lamar too; your linebackers are basically frozen by those two, one *has* to spy Lamar and one *has* to assume Mark is running a route and play coverage, meaning he's either unable to help the guys split wide, or he's expecting pass and by the time he realizes it's a run Mark has blocked him ten yards out of the lane.

Obviously it doesn't work 100% of the time, and I'm not advocating for the Ravens to turn into a pure spread-option offense or anything like that, there are times going tight makes a lot of sense. Plus our personnel limits how much you'd want to use it; sure we could split Andrews and Likely and Oliver out wide and use them as pseudo-WRs since they're all talented receiving TEs, and there *have* been teams that used TE-heavy spread looks to great success before, most notably the early 2010s Patriots with Gonk and Hernandez, but even then it's probably not going to be as effective as a spread offense with multiple good WRs, especially while Likely is still developing.

What I *am* advocating it for is A. using it more often as a way to keep defenses from getting comfortable, and B. using it situationally when it is clear that the gameplan the defense is using is something that it can exploit. I get it, that would mean taking the fullback off the field and Greg is contemplating leaving his wife for Ricard. (Tbf though who *isn't* in love with Pancake Pat?) But it works when you use it properly! Remember Lamar's comeback against the Colts last year? We ran a ton of spread formations in the second half of that game. We didn't run it exclusively, but we used it far more than we normally do, about a 50/50 rate, and the results spoke for themselves. Then the very next week it was back to the same thing we always do.

This is one of my biggest frustrations with Greg; things go wrong for every offense. Sometimes you get lucky and stumble into a solution. Good teams incorporate that solution more and use it to improve their offense. Greg shrugs, chalks it up to a fluke, and goes back to The Vault‚Ñ¢ for more seven-man protections and Pat Ricard screen passes.

36232,208090,208090,eatmyopinions,"Kyle Hamilton is the man. He's not a center-fielder so he doesn't rack up interceptions, and that unfortunately keeps his names out of the headlines. But he is incredibly versatile. PFF believes he is already an elite safety. With his size and instincts there is no ceiling to his play.


Tyler Linderbaum has started his career as a slightly above-average center.  The Ravens would need to shift to a zone blocking scheme for him to flourish. I think when you take a center in the first round they've got to start really strong or you doubt if it was worth it. And the team could really use a receiver, so his impact is always compared to what Hollywood Brown would have brought.

David Ojabo should be starting his first game this week. Right about on time. This will be a red-shirt season for him.

Travis Jones missed a few games early on and has been an average starter since then. He's been a run-stopper and not a pass-rusher so far. All of this is fine for a third round pick.

Daniel Faalele is bad. He's a rugby player who only has like two years of experience playing football. I think the idea here was a year or two of seasoning before he cracks the starting lineup. Unfortunately an injury to Ronnie Stanley and then Patrick Mekari, and Faalele is suddenly starting.

Jalyn Armour-Davis has been bad and there's not a good excuse. He got burned early in the year and has been inactive most weeks.

Charlie Kolar hasn't played yet due to a training camp injury. Probably this week or next week is my guess.

Jordan Stout is already an above-average punter. He doesn't deliver the consistency that Koch used to, he's prone to shank or touchback when you were really hoping for better field position. But he'll be very good.

Isaiah Likely will end up being that 4th round gem. He was already a very good pass catcher but the surprise is that he's run-blocking really well after it used to be a weakness in college. When Mark Andrews isn't on the field, Likely has delivered the goods.

Damarion Williams is fine. Not as bad as Armour-Davis but decidedly below-average. For a 4th round rookie you'll put up with that. But there will need to be some offseason growth.

Tyler Badie didn't make the 53 but is on the practice squad. That makes him a bad draft pick but the 6th round is a crapshoot anyways.",24.0,nfl,t3_zeabv6,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-12-06T10:39:40Z,ravens,-0.0087619966329976
