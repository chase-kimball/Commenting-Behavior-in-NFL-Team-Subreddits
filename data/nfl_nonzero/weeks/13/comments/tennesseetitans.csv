Idk, it does seem really odd that she wouldn't know about it. The deal didn't materialize in the span of minutes, they had time to loop her in on the conversation at least.

1925,18590,18590,Bieber_hole_69,"He tore his ACL in the 2017 divisional round, then went on to have a pretty bad 2018 season when he came back in like late-September.

They were then put in a pretty rough spot after the 2018 season when they had to decide on his 5th-year option. He wasn't great in 2017, was pretty bad in 2018, so they turned down his 5th-year which was probably the right decision at the time.

He then started to play pretty well again in 2019, especially towards the end of the season. They were in a tough spot with Conklin, it would be beyond expensive to franchise tag him, and playing him the top tier RT money he would command on the open market wouldn't have made a ton of sense when they were also paying big money to Lewan at LT and Saffold at LG.

They assumed they could get a decent enough replacement for him in the end of the first, which is actually a decent enough bet most years. Unfortunately they ended up taking one of the biggest busts in league history to replace him, and then whiffed on another top 50 pick in 2021.

Like most of these decisions that got Robinson fired, it makes complete sense in a vacuum and is totally justifiable. He just did not execute when it came time to actually pick a player to replace a departing player ready to get their 2nd contract.

1929,18594,18594,Bieber_hole_69,"Yeah, trading the home grown stars or letting them walk isn't the ultimate issue.

It was fine and made sense to let CD, Conklin, Jonnu, and Adoree walk. We couldn't afford to keep all of them, so some would have to go, maybe not all, but at least some. 

So say we keep CD and Conklin after the 2019/20 seasons and pay them what they got on the open market. Are we any better overpaying for those guys than we are now? Yeah. But we also could have been fine if the picks to replace those guys hit, and it would be cheaper. That was what they intended to do, the only problem was none of the picks to replace them hit. 

Wilson, Radunz, Fitzpatrick, McMath, and the Julio trade were all picks made directly in response to letting those two guys walk, and none of them hit. If even one or two of them hit, we're in a totally different place, but not a single one of them hit.

So now, the only positive we have is we aren't paying CD and Conklin what they got on the open market, but if you're going to miss on *all* of the picks you use to replace them, then you should have just kept them in the first place. And now you've spent so many picks trying to replace those few guys you let walk, that other places on the roster start to atrophy because you can't spend any of those picks there.

Robinson continuously made bets, like Belichick did before 2021, that, ""since I drafted those guys that can get big contracts elsewhere, I'll just do it again rather than pay them."" And it blew up in our faces when all of his draft luck ran out seemingly overnight after 2019. If he hit on even 75% of those picks to replace guys we let walk, he's an fucking genius and still has a job, but he didn't.

You can even still spin the AJB trade as making sense in a vacuum, because it still kinda does. The issue is that Robinson made the same bet that he could just replace AJB since he drafted AJB in the first place, and even if Burks turns out as good as he seems to be, Robinson still made the same bet he had made before that he had consistently failed at.

He didn't keep AJ Brown which is obviously stupid.

We wasted a draft pick last year on Caleb Farley who looked bad when he did play and most likely will never see a football field again.

The covid draft classes for the Titans were absolutely terrible in general.

We will be in salary cap hell next year.

Our offensive line is the worst in the league by every metric and he did nothing to address it other than draft a 3rd round rookie tackle.

He gave big money to Bud Dupree and Zach Cunningham which may have played a factor in not being willing to sign AJ Brown. Having that much cap space tied up in Cunningham in particular is beyond stupid .

So no not just one thing. And I have somewhat of a source with the Titans and he said players in general don't like dealing with him now especially after the AJ debacle and him playing footsie with Jeffrey Simmons contract.

Sure... i'm not going to refute a single thing you said... but the cap hit... is the cap hit... is the cap hit. Regardless of WHY he is expensive, he is expensive next year and there really isn't much we can do about it now. 

>We’re not winning with Malik

We aren't going to be winning much with Tanne either, realistically we have too many holes and not enough cap space with him on the team to address them adequately, and even if we did by some miracle to what end... another 1 and done in the playoffs where Tanne turns into a pumpkin on national television? Why is that the end goal for this team?

He should only be at around a true rookie QB level starting next year, I get you don't like him... thats fine... but ultimately we don't have much choice anymore unless you want to draft another QB next year. 

Best we could do with our current draft spot is Anthony Richardson (who will basically be at the same level as Willis and arguably less overall upside) or maybe Hendon Hooker who will be 25 come draft night, high floor, low ceiling... and even if it panned out and he's a great QB in the NFL (which isn't particularly likely) he may not make it on the team a full decade before we are already looking to replace him... that's not great when teams typically like to invest heavily around their franchise QB.

That path at least would have guaranteed us a good - great caliber QB going forward... and maximized our chances of hitting at the most important position in the game.

19494,120846,120846,RyokoKnight,"In 2019 he had a concussion and was ruled out week 9, he had a knee injury in 2020 and was questionable for 2 weeks. (also anyone who watches closely can also tell when the man in playing injured and only at 80 - 90% which he often does as he digs deep like when he lifted henry earlier this year while banged up and I believe was suffering a back injury at the time... but he IS injured and these small injuries add up)

But injury history completely aside it doesn't take a crystal ball to anticipate a increase in injury odds when players reach certain ages brackets depending on position group.  As an example Taylor Lewan started picking up injuries as a lineman in 2020 at the age of 29 (now 31). Ben Jones this year is 33.

The average age of a starting offensive line per team is around 25 - 27 years old (there are younger and older but in general that is the ""sweet spot"" when it comes to position age for a starting lineman), this is because as players age they end up getting injured, taking small accumulative injuries that cause them to slow a step or miss games and then their career is over (and of course having a younger line means they typically lack the experience of a slightly more experienced player that has found their groove).

There are of course exceptions like Andrew Whitworth who played till he reached 40 years old and is something of a genetic freak when it comes to both lack of injuries (really until 2020 when he started picking them up more frequently... the only notable exception being a knee in 2012!) but in general once a lineman gets to around 30 its time to start looking for backups and potential replacements depending on how common injuries are for the player.

In lewan's case we should have looked for a LT that needed time to develop 2 drafts ago that could take over now (maybe instead of Dez)... OR someone who could potentially start like a 2nd - 4th rounder sometime this year.  In Ben jones' case it isn't AS severe but this year would have been a great time to draft a backup that doesn't snap above our QB's head or into the dirt like Aaron brewer 33% of the time.",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_za79tl,False,0.0,"""BIG Jeff"" Simmons",2022-12-02T10:00:12Z,tennesseetitans,0.0947078589459939

When you make the catches AJ does I struggle saying he has a hands problem. I’m 100% nitpicking here. A concentration problem maybe but a hands problem? Definitely not.

Besides, drops are kind of volatile because there are always passes that count as drops that other receivers might not even get a hand on, passes charted as catchable that might not be, etc. 

If I had to guess, without having the numbers off the top of my head, I’d guess his drop rate isn’t too far out of line with other receivers.

2019 was our magical, out of nowhere, birth-of-a-team-on-the-rise year. That was the year we were ""playing with house money"", as they say, but it was clear we were building something. We didn't have to win it all or bust that year - but it was obvious we were on the doorstep, on the threshold of becoming a factor in the AFC. My perspective from that season was ""just need to improve the roster each year from here"". The key pieces were in place, we just need to add a piece here and there to become a major player.

And we didn't. I never felt we did. Every year we were subtracting main, contributing pieces from the roster and having to replace them instead of adding to a competent roster. Losing Logan Ryan, losing Jurrell Casey, losing Adore Jackson, losing Malcolm Butler, losing Jack Conklin, losing Jonnu Smith, losing Corey Davis, losing Anthony Firkser... The list pretty much goes on and on. It culminated with losing AJ Brown. That was the last and final straw.

I understand and realize it's impossible to re-sign and retain all of a team's draft picks and key free agents. But the glut of talent this team was losing year over year and stuck having to replace instead of keeping a solid roster and adding pieces to it was just miserable for me to watch. We wasted money (and some times draft picks) on players like Vic Beasley, Jadaveon Clowney, and Julio Jones. 

We've also churned the roster at D-line and LB (necessarily, out of injuries) to remain successful in-season, but not at WR, TE, or OL. Why??? I'm not sure if that's a Vrabel problem or a Robinson problem, but ultimately, Robinson is the one responsible for the roster.
