I question drafting a WR with no plan for QB. Trading your first next year when that draft has multiple potential franchise QBs suggest to me that they thought their QB situation was tenable and that seems like a questionable decision making to me.

It's like the Falcons drafting two pass catchers in a row with seemingly no plan for QB. So you run a run heavy offense that barely utilizes those players. We got a rookie QB drafted in the 3rd that hasn't taken a snap in favor of a journeyman that everyone knows isn't the answer because we were ""competing"" for a playoff spot in the worst division in the NFL.
