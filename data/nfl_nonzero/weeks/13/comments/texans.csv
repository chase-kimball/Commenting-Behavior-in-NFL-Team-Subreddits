Two horrific coaching searches being at the top of that list. 

But as far as the talent Caserio himself has brought in- Pierce, Nico, Pitre, Stingley are guys I think will all flourish with competent teammates and coaching and more time growing together.

Kenyon i think is a guy who needs a lot more work but has a huge upside. He’s really got to add more strength to his body so he can anchor against bull rushes and that starts with him and redistributing his weight and hitting the weight room. Same for Christian Harris, lot of potential, but needs a lot of work. Metchie is obviously unable to be evaluated at this point. 

Everyone else from 2021 class I think is a wash. Mills probably done. Brevin maybe has some value but not enough to keep forever. Lopez looks like the late round pick he was.
