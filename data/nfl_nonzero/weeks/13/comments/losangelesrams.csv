And he’s either going to 1. Hurt your team or 2. At best, be a neutral factor.  And at that point, if he’s a neutral factor, what’s the point of even signing him and paying the money?

He has no chemistry/rapport with Dak. He doesn’t know Kellen Moore’s offense. The worst thing you can do in a playoff game is turn the ball over. Having him out there while not knowing the offense/playbook and not having chemistry with Dak could result in a interception due to running a wrong route, or at best the ball fall incomplete. And who’s to say that that throw isn’t completed if someone else is running that route that’s been with the team and knows the offense and has a rapport with Dak. Who’s to say that that completion doesn’t keep a drive alive and that drive result in a critical much needed touchdown? Even so, I just wouldn’t feel comfortable with him out there if I were a Cowboys fan and said playoff game be his first game back. 

And see, the Cowboys due to Jerry Jones are one of the few teams in the league that I’d be worried about actually doing this and signing him knowing that his first game back would be in the playoffs.

If the opportunity to acquire Matthew Stafford had not been an option, we would've had zero problems sticking with Goff.

He really only has a few weaknesses in his game - although they are pretty prolific. Nearly every quarterback struggles went under duress - Goff is historically terrible at protecting the ball under pressure; I seriously can't remember anybody worse at ball protection when the pocket collapses around him. His fumbles were more of an issue than his interceptions. 

He's also not incredibly creative when it comes to improvising on busted plays. Someone referred to that as being the system quarterback. And if that's the case he's one of the better system quarterbacks in the league. 

Most quarterbacks at the NFL level can execute reasonably well when the play where is drawn up runs well. Goff executes those plays to perfection. When he is on I can barely think of any other quarterbacks in the league with a prettier looking mid range to deep ball throw; it's a thing of beauty when all goes well. Give him some time in the pocket and a  receiver with just a fraction of an inch of separation from her defender and you got paydirt. 

I have not been able to see him play every game the last two seasons in Detroit but I seen highlights both this year and last year and I see significant improvement. He doesn't seem to make as many of those ""Goof"" plays that turned it to get him negative highlights on social media. 

All in all, I still really think he's a great quarterback; and Detroit shouldn't worry about trying to invest in their future in the draft at the quarterback position - they're good for a few seasons behind Goff. They should go get all the other pieces they can get  to complement him",5.0,nfl,t3_zei2hx,False,0.0,:Rams: Rams,2022-12-06T19:25:19Z,losangelesrams,0.0028889440680844
