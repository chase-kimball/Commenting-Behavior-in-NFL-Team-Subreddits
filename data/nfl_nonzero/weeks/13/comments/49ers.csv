This is what I’m thinking (hoping, praying) is the case because it’s very on brand for Kyle. He doesn’t really lie, but he doesn’t say the whole truth. I don’t think he lied per se, but the question asked of him was whether he would activate Trey “now” and obviously he isn’t ready right this moment. 

Kawakami asked him afterwards, and mentioned it in his Athletic article, whether Lance has a chance to return in the playoffs.

15793,118145,118145,MrTouchnGo,"Loved this article by David Lombardi and the ""Light the fire"" line in particular.

>SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Kyle Shanahan wasn’t fully pleased with the performance of the 49ers’ defensive line in their previous victory over the Saints, and he let the unit know about it Saturday night during a team meeting ahead of Sunday’s showdown against the Dolphins.

>Shanahan’s critique was just lighthearted banter — or so the coach thought, until he saw star edge rusher Nick Bosa stone-faced on the receiving end.

>“I told (the D-linemen) that I thought the linebackers outperformed them last week,” Shanahan said. “And I thought they would smile, but he didn’t smile at all.”

>Fast forward less than 24 hours. The 49ers had just smothered the Dolphins and their top-ranked offense. Bosa had finished off the 33-17 win with a strip sack — his third sack of the day (he leads the NFL with 14 1/2 sacks) — returned for a touchdown by linebacker Dre Greenlaw. There was no remaining doubt about the true standing of the 49ers’ defense during that roaring moment at Levi’s Stadium. It is indeed an elite unit, and Shanahan thought that Bosa was approaching him with a celebratory hug.

>“I thought we were going to celebrate together,” Shanahan said. “And he goes, ‘That’s what happens when you talk — that way — in the team meeting.'”

>Bosa’s exact, stoically delivered words to his coach — according to the edge rusher: “‘Don’t talk s— about me anymore.”

>The entire 49ers’ defensive line had taken Shanahan’s barb personally, according to Bosa. So it turns out that Shanahan had delivered effective motivational fuel at an opportune time — the night before the 49ers would become more reliant on their defense than ever before.

...

>The 49ers’ second-half shutout streak is no more — it ended at four games after Hill hauled in a 45-yard touchdown bomb from Tagovailoa in Sunday’s fourth quarter — but its reputation is fully restored now. Sucking the life out of a top-tier offense has fully revived any swagger that the 49ers’ defense may have lost in that defeat to the Chiefs.

>That’s evidenced by the team’s proclamations in the locker room after the game. They’re openly calling themselves the NFL’s best defense again, and even using that belief to express their confidence in the team’s new starting quarterback, rookie Brock Purdy.
go-deeper

>“He’s played (in practice) against the best defense in the league for the past 13 weeks,” Warner said. “So he’s going to be just fine.”

>Perhaps the final restoration of this brashness can be traced back to Saturday night, when Shanahan ticked off Bosa by saying that the 49ers’ linebackers had played better than their D-linemen against the Saints.

>“We talked in our D-line meeting,” Bosa said. “We don’t like being called out like that.”

>But the 49ers obviously responded to it. And that wasn’t lost on Shanahan, who saw Bosa’s monstrous performance against Miami and wasn’t apologetic about critiquing one of his superstars.

>“I’ll make a note,” Shanahan said. “I’ll make sure to do it a lot more.”

>Is some more smack-talking from his coach OK with Bosa?

>“Yeah,” Bosa said. “Light the fire.”",10.0,49ers,t3_ze94ds,False,0.0,:jerseyhome85: George Kittle,2022-12-06T09:11:08Z,49ers,3.643319718792118e-05
