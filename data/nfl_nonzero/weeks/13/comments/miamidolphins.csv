The guy is right about the NFL being extremely efficient when it comes to betting markets, but it has nothing to do with the respect, or the lacktherof that different teams can get. 

To me there are a few explanations as for why the Vikings are the same 1 point underdog as the Jags were:

1) The Jags got overvalued, thus vastly bet on after a surprising win vs the Ravens

2) People are very high on the Lions after the beatdown of a Jags teams people were high on.

3) People still aren't believers in the Vikings (A lot of pros love betting against the Vikings because they're seen as being an extremely lucky team, more so than one deserving of their record) and them escaping with an ugly win vs the Jets didn't convince them.

In all likelihood, it could be a combination of the three. But betting markets being ""efficient"" or the Vikings being decent against the spread aren't logical explanations and don't even make any sense.

Personally I don't think the Vikings are as good as their record and there's a fantastic chance that the Lions win, but I need for there to be value to bet it. 

I thought that there was a lot of value in the Lions last week because the Jaguars got overrated by the betting public from their unexpected win against the Ravens. The betting markets also overrated the Jaguars when they notably made them favorites against the then 5-1 Giants. But I'm not sure yet that there's a lot of value with the Vikings right now.

The betting markets either massively overrated the Jaguars, or they're massively underrating the Vikings for them to point be the same 1 point underdog to the Lions. 

As for your advice about getting rich beating the markets, I wouldn't say I get rich off of it, but I've been doing well enough to the point where I usually do wagers like these for half the games that play out on Sunday. I've been doing this for years and follow lines throughout the week almost religiously. There are times where a line does not make sense and is backed up by the result of the game.

40675,298788,298788,realneocanuck,"The ""Tua hate"" in my view mainly stemmed from two things.

1) Draft positioning: As soon as Tua got picked over Herbert in the draft, the writing was on the wall. Fair or not, Tua and Justin would get compared against each other for pretty much their entire careers, especially in the first few years. And objectively, based on stats and the eye test, Herbert was better those first two years. But it's an unfair comparison because Herbert was playing at pretty much an elite level from the start, which is extremely rare for rookie QBs transitioning from college to the pros. If Tua had been drafted in '21 alongside Zach Wilson, Trevor Lawrence and Trey Lance, I think people's overall view of him would've been noticeably different.

2) Lack of ""big plays"": The young QBs who have taken over the league these past few years have pretty much all been sexy athletic guys who make big highlight reel plays, either with their legs (Lamar, Kyler), their wicked arm (Herbert) or a mix of both (Mahomes, Allen). Compared to those guys, Tua just doesn't look the part. He's smaller, less mobile and more of a traditional pocket passer who relies on accuracy, efficiency and reading and manipulating defenses.

Also kind of a side note, Tua's most important games those first two years, the ones that had the most playoff implications and thus garnered the largest audiences (I'm talking @ Bills in '20 and @ Titans in '21) were complete duds, which I think also unfairly influenced public perception on Tua.",1.0,miamidolphins,t3_zb36p1,False,0.0,Teddy Bridgewater Stan Account,2022-12-02T21:30:03Z,miamidolphins,0.02901367978781
