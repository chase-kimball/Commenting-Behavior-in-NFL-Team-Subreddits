Man, it feels great to be winning and having high expectations for this team. Lions Won Again by Gmac Cash expresses it best:

We just won another game they can’t touch us

We ’bout to win another game they know what’s up

We just won the last game with a blowout

You see what happen when the Lions really show out?

Call the whole city up we ’bout to go out

We ’bout to have them bars jumpin’ while it’s cold out


After starting the season 1-6, people were already calling for Dan Campbell’s head. Imagine trying to run the guy out of town who is solely responsible for the shift in the Detroit Lions culture just because he lost to some good teams. Last year he fired Anthony Lynn and promoted genius Ben Johnson. This year he fired defensive backs coach Aubrey Pleasant. Both have been fantastic decisions.

Sheila Ford Hamp cannot be appreciated enough for being the first Ford to hire somebody that actually knows what they are doing. Bob Quinn and Matt Patricia cannot even run a peewee football team.

God-tier freak of nature, Brad Holmes, is a genius. This man got us Amon-Ra St. Brown in the 4th round. According to PFF, the Sun God is the 3rd best receiver this season behind Tyreek Hill and Stefon Diggs. Hill and Diggs were late-round picks, too, going in the 5th round. To spot guys with talent and know where they will fall in the draft is a GM’s best ability. Brad Holmes has done this multiple times. After the Levi Onwuzurike pick in the 2nd round of the 2021 draft, Sheila asked Brad, “What would we do if we don’t get a receiver out of the draft?” Brad responded, “You know we still have the USC kid and all of those kids, so we’ll still be in a position to get one.” 16 wide receivers were taken before Amon-Ra, and somehow Brad knew where he would fall.

You must stop if you are still calling for the Lions to pick a quarterback with one of their first picks. You are not watching the games, or you are a Goff denier. This man just went 31/41, 340 yards, and 2 touchdowns. Goff’s situation is similar to Tua Tagovailoa’s. Tua had a coach who had no belief in him, making him less confident and causing him to be Tua Turndaballova. Jared Goff started out hot in Los Angeles, but he and Sean McVay lost their chemistry. They dumped him off to us and even sent us a second 1st rounder for us to take his salary. The coaching staff here believes that Jared Goff can make any pass he needs to make, and I think so too. The team believes in him, the offensive line protects him, and most importantly, he believes in himself. He is 28 years old and only getting brighter.

Recently, the whole team has looked phenomenal. Malcolm Rodriguez returned from his elbow injury and looks just as good. D’Andre Swift looks like he did at the start of the season after sitting out for some time and taking low snap counts. Okudah has gone from a bust to a beast. DeShon Elliot has fully bought into the culture and has made some big plays. The defensive line has improved, and 6th-round pick James “The Problem” Houston has 3 sacks in just 17 snaps. The Lions are building through the draft, and it is undeniably working.

The Giants and Commanders tying hurt our chances of getting into the playoffs, which are already small, with us most likely having to finish 10-7. If the Lions finish the season 9-1/8-2 after starting 1-6, there will be a lot of talk about Detroit this off-season. This team is getting hot, and it is hard to cool down a Sun God.",7.0,detroitlions,t3_zdo949,False,0.0,JAMO,2022-12-05T17:41:36Z,detroitlions,0.0127362694285612

26944,152375,152375,Pinkaroundme,"On the bright side, last season, 8 teams (that’s a quarter of the league) were hiring new HCs. This year, it’ll be the Panthers for sure, Colts probably, maybe Broncos, maybe Texans (Lovie Smith could be out after a year maybe). Cardinals just gave Kliff an extension but it’s possible he gets fired, Seattle if Pete retires which I don’t see happening.

So that’s

1 for sure (Panthers)

1 very likely (Colts)

2 maybe (Broncos and Texans)

2 maybe but something big needs to happen (Cardinals and Seahawks)

There could be other surprise firings for sure, but right now that’s the list. So less teams looking to replace HCs than last year is likely. That already decreases the chances of it being Johnson to be picked. And there’s a lot of maybes on that list.

Possible surprise firings will be teams that didn’t meet expectations like Vrabel (don’t see it happening given they let go their GM instead), Arthur Smith with the Falcons, Staley with the Chargers. Saints HC could be one and done. Keep in mind, these are not HCs I’ve heard about getting fired, but there’s often surprise firings and these seem like candidates if they aren’t meeting owners expectations.

They have to live and breath the sport. It controls them and the life is extremely hard both physically and mentally and can rob you of your true identity. But what if deep down you don’t want it? 

With football, it’s such a team driven sport that you also have the added pressure of always having to be there for the other guys as well.

It’s interesting insight into the mind of a generational talent. What these young men have to go through when they get a label like that when they are just teenagers all the way up to becoming a franchise player.

It’s no wonder that so many of these types of players end up fizzling out prematurely. Just consider how many failed to live up to expectations.

That's not hyperbole - if we can manage to get after opposing quarterbacks better, or get some ball-seeking missile at LB/safety, and start holding opponents regularly to under 20 points a game, we have an offense that is putting up 30 points against good defenses when healthy, and that's all she wrote.
