I think Sam Howell will be good because he was a prolific passer that transitioned to an RPO after his 4 playmakers got drafted to the NFL (He ran for over 800 yards that season).

I like Sam Howell because we're developing him correctly and giving him a year to hone his game and learn the playbook.

I like Sam Howell because he's a gamer like Heiniecke but has an arm like Wentz.

I like Sam Howell because by all accounts he is like one of the best team mates and on field leaders around according to players, scouts and coaches.

I like Sam Howell because he flashed his skillset in the chances he got in preseason.

I agree with the PFF rating that he was a Top 50 prospect:

16019,127055,127055,Pentt4,"> This off-season, we should definitely look for a QB, but also we shouldn't reach for a Haskins.

None out there. Jimmy G will be the best option and hes NYJ bound. Maybe Tannehill once Tennessee goes full tank mode but Ryan is 35 and were just repeating the same mistake we always do. 

So of course what will happen is next year is exactly the same as this year. We end up as a fringe playoff team drafting in the mid to late teens with no way to fix the QB spot.

Im fucking tired of it. Either go hard after Lamar if he gets tagged or figure out Young in the draft.

This franchise only operates in one year intervals. They never think more than the season ahead. The incessant need to do as best as they can in any individual year puts them behind for future years. 

Eventually it catches up to them and they bottom out with a 4-5 win season and then the next staff comes in and does exactly what the previous days. ""Theres some talent on this team. We can win some games"" they go out and try to win as many games as they an that first year to end up with 6-7 wins drafting in the teens. 

Theres never a future plan. Theres never a thought of maybe 1 step forward only puts us one step back next year. They never think of maybe if we take one step back this year it can put us 3 steps forward in the future. Its why talent walks out the door for nothing like Kirk. Like Payne will.

Not ideal when you have to hurry to get everyone set and spike the ball.
