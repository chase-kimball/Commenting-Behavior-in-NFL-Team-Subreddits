9744,67755,67755,ExCollegeDropout,"Dax Hill hasn't seen the field much, but has splashed with his few opportunities. Had a near sack against Tennessee and has tackled well in open space. Versatile also, taken safety snaps both in the box and deep as well as at slot and outside corner.

Cam Taylor-Britt has played very well coming in for Awuzie. He can get a bit physical and I'd say has gotten a bit lucky to avoid PI calls, but a strong tackler, plays with a lot of confidence, and has been playing the ball better the more he plays. He'll be a week 1 starter next year for sure

Zach Carter has been meh, but it was to be expected from an edge guy in college converting inside full time. He's undersized, to be expected, but what's been shocking is that he's been a solid run defender and kinda nothing as a pass rusher, which was the opposite of what I expected

Cordell Volson isn't going to be mistaken for a top 5 guard and certainly had a rough start, but he's clearly taken a step forward the last few weeks (along with the rest of the OL). He's not the most athletic, but makes up for it with some straight up angry blocking. He'll be a solid starter for years if he continues to develop like he's done since week 1

The past two offseasons, the Bengals and Chargers have done the same thing, swapping years. 

Both needed oline, and some defensive free agents to build their teams.

Two offseasons ago, the chargers revamped the oline, with Slater and FA. The bengals rebuilt oline THIS past off season, with a draft pick and 3 FA linemen, 

Two seasons ago, the bengals sign a big DE Free agent (Hendrickson) and CB (Awuzie) and this past offseason the Chargers did the same, DE/OLB Khalil Mack and CB JC Jackson. 

Bengals were picked to be the fluke and prognosticators and fans alike were clamoring over the Chargers.

I'm just arguing it's not ""everyone but Herbert"" as the downfall.

He makes some questionable decisions and accuracy is not his strength. He's a big playmaker and has a huge arm. Still 66ish percent completion percentage.
