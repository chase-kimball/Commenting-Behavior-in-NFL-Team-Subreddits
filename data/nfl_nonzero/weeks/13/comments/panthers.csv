The media's obsession with football being a ""QB-driven game"" completely undercuts the very harsh reality that there isn't a single position in sports that depends on the performance of others *more* than Quarterback.

IMO, the #1 indicator of whether a QB will be successful or not is the environment he walks into after he's drafted. There are so many positive influences that all of these young ""bust"" QBs never had that imo made the elite guys the QBs they are today:

* Is there a vet QB either ahead of him or on the roster that can keep things going while the rookie learns the ropes, while also teaching the young guy? (Ex: Brady, Mahomes, Rodgers, Dak, etc.)

* Does his HC or OC have some track record of putting their QBs in positions to succeed and/or develop their skill sets, or even change their entire offense to maximize their strengths? (Ex: Allen, Lamar, Hurts, Tua, Geno etc.)

* Does the rest of the offense have enough talent at the skill positions and/or the OL to both keep him upright and take the pressure off of him? (Ex: Herbert, Burrow)

* Is the defense at least league-average, skill-wise, so it isn't up to the QB to score 28+ to win every game?

* Does the organization have a culture of competence and/or patience?

* Does the GM know how to build a team the right way and know how to support a QB?

* Does the owner have any idea of what it takes to run a successful organization?

* Does the team itself have a solid culture?

Think about any QB you consider elite rn, or have in the last decade. I guarantee you all of them had at least 3 of these things going for them when they came into the league. Mahomes, Allen, Lamar, Burrow, Hurts, Tua, Rodgers, Brady, Dak, Herbert, etc., ALL those guys' success was at least partially due to having a team setup that helped set them up for success (I just pointed out the more obvious leading factors for each one, they all had more than one). Some of them (Ex: Hurts, Tua, even Justin Fields) started looking like completely different players once the right environment coalesced around them.

Now think of all the QBs who get drafted in the top 10 every year, by teams with zero of the above characteristics. It's wholly unsurprising that they fail at such a high rate when you break it down this way. And I'd go even further and say that those who failed bc they didn't have the ""right attitude"" or whatever were likely just bitter bc they realized how much their team hung them out to dry.

A QB's individual skill obviously matters. So does his Football IQ, drive, attitude, etc. But football is the ultimate team game for a reason; you can't white-knuckle your way to success as a QB, it takes a ton of help from every part of the organization for a guy to get handed that sweet sweet ""Top 10 QB"" designation",2.0,nfl,t3_zd9e0r,False,0.0,:Panthers: Panthers,2022-12-06T01:01:08Z,panthers,0.0418603095826995

QB gets drafted by bad team > fails due to lack of structure around him > gets 2nd chance with another team > that team also lacks structure (hence why they're calling on reclamation project QBs) > 2nd chance goes poorly.

The NFL is a zero-sum league. By definition alone, there can only really be 15 coaches/teams considered ""solid,"" maybe 10 of those are ""good,"" and no more than 5 are contenders. And in the modern NFL, it's borderline impossible to be in that top 1/3rd of teams without already having QB figured out.

So what you end up with is more or less the same 10-15 teams either continuously starting over at QB or recycling guys who didn't work out with one of the other 15 or so teams until they get the formula right, hit paydirt, and enter the playoff hunt consistently...which is not a recipe for success.
