1906,19592,19592,Bkfootball,"> in a year that was certainly going to be a down year  

That definitely wasn’t set in stone going into the season. One prevailing idea was that this team had too much talent (particularly on defense) to not at least compete for the playoffs. Jameis was more of an unknown than anything - he played pretty well last season before getting injured, so we didn’t really know which Jameis we would get during the season. Dennis Allen created an elite defense over the past few years, after all, so why wouldn’t he make a good HC?  

In hindsight this was probably a dumb mindset. It’s not that we *don’t* have talent, it’s that it’s being completely wasted by our trash coaching staff. Not to mention Jameis, without being tethered by a leash to Sean Payton, reverted back to his old ways. I think taking Olave was a good pick and one that was easy to make at the time (they love their Ohio State players), though with hindsight we’d obviously have preferred a QB.  

I honestly don’t know what we do going into next season. This team does still have lots of talent, it’s just not translating into wins. The smart move is probably trading away some pieces and tanking with Dalton or Jameis over the next few years, although I wouldn’t be surprised if “we just keep doing what we’re doing,” as Dennis Allen likes to say. It’s not a stretch to say that we’re just a QB and head coach away from making the playoffs, but the likelihood of getting either of those while this core is still in its prime doesn’t seem great.",6.0,nfl,t3_zbmc4e,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints :Chiefs: Chiefs,2022-12-03T18:17:47Z,saints,0.0692418978108748

The Saints are injured to shit, have an incredibly boring and putrid offense, and have a former top-10 defense that's heavily regressed thanks in large part to losing our best safety, trading away one of our top 3 corners, and our best corner being out for damn near half the season. This team has absolutely no personality, which is surprising considering we've got players like Cam Jordan, Mark Ingram, Alvin Kamara, and Michael Thomas. Oh yeah! He got injured again.

- Carmichael felt like he hit a sweet spot in the second quarter of the season but holy crap the playcalling has been tragic the second half of the year.

- Carmichael got two chances to run a four minute drill tonight and failed miserably (also failed vs Cincy). He's got minimal game sense in calling plays. Don't care how smart he is and how well he can scheme things up if he can't call plays real-time. He deserves to be fired more than DA.

- I'm so sick of seeing our defense take the brunt of the criticism because this offense can't sustain drives when they need to. They've played winning football 3 weeks in a row and we're 1-2.

- It's no coincidence that since McCoy got hurt our run game has struggled behind Throckmorton and Josh Andrews. All-Pro Cesar Ruiz is turning sure losses into 2-3 yard gains.

- I'm not necessarily saying Olave is him but I've never seen Olave and him in the same room.

- Dalton was good enough tonight.

- Defense is starting to turn it up at the right time. Interior DL needs to be better though.

- I saw posts asking if we should trade Cam in the lead up to this game. Fuck my life if Cam plays a snap for any other team.

- First time I've said this but Adebo's job may be in jeopardy once Lattimore gets healthy. His lows have been far worse and far more often than Taylor's. Disappointing after a really good rookie year.

- For fucks sake go for it on 4th and 1 just once I beg you.

- Special teams stepped up today.

- I've been 27 for two days and sports already suck.

- All-Pro C/G Cesar Ruiz deserves better than this offense.

- Rasheed Shaheed is a better Deonte Harty right now. 

- Can't believe I'm saying this but WRs are letting Dalton down tonight. He's doing enough to win.

- The fact we've only run a screen *once* out of that 3-stack formation with Taysom at QB is a playcalling travesty. We've run QB draw out of that like 10 times.

- I can't wait for McCoy to get healthy so Throckmorton/Andrews no longer have to start.

-  Our defense is at its best when Cam Jordan is on the field. Go figure. No idea why he was taken off the field majority of the 1st quarter snaps but I feel like they averaged 5+ yards per play when he wasn't out there.

- Cookie Monster is a little thumper at CB. Clean up the holding penalties and I feel amazing.

- ~~Defense went and got their allergy exam and the needle marked for takeaways left such a large welt you could see it from space.~~ fucking finally thank you Demario but I'm not deleting my poetry

- That takeaway shows just how important turnovers are to momentum and scoring opportunities. The lack of them by our defense and the influx of them by our offense have swung games unfavorably far too much this season.

- Hold your tablets tightly tonight.

- They really fired the cannons after a third down conversion because they weren't sure they'd get another chance to.

As I see it, *very* optimistically:

2022: dead. done. shit.

2023: no first rounder, eat cap, suck, trade away aging vets for picks (cap permitting, and for shitty picks), hope for pick 1:1 in 2024. Fire Dennis Allen into the sun (and Pete Carmichael if he doesn't retire after 2022). If Payton comes back and we trade him, I would expect a minimal return, maybe a 4th rounder - nothing worth getting hopes up about.

2024: eat remaining dead cap, so cap situation is clean after 2024, draft QB 1:1, hire coaching staff to support him and help him develop, focus remaining draft picks on the trenches, suck but with hopefully showing signs of things to build on.

2025: Clean cap, 2nd year QB on the cusp of taking the next step, proper coaching staff (one that hopefully does not enjoy penalties on every play), probably suck, but maybe sneaky good, foundation in place.

2026: Ready to compete.

More than likely, one of the following will happen: the QB will be a bust, the new coaching staff will be middling at best, injuries will conspire against us, or the complementary pieces drafted will fail to develop and create a proper foundation.  So it is much more likely that by 2026 we have some ingredients of success in place, but certainly not all of them, but at least with a more optimistic outlook moving forward, leading us toward our 10 year cycle coming to fruition and being in the NFC championship game in 2029.

Edit to add what I think our dumbass team will actually do: claim Baker, believe he is the missing piece, kick the restructured cap can down the road again past the ""dead end"" sign, trade picks to get back into the first round next draft to take a tight end, extend Andrus Peat again, because why not, suck moar longer.",72.0,nfl,t3_ze7oaz,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2022-12-06T09:55:49Z,saints,-0.0495486289379472
