Think of the ~~children~~ vacuums!!!

Edit: also I get it, what Gay did was wrong getting any sort of physical during a verbal argument is wrong but the NFL can’t get its head out of its ass with what is morally right vs wrong and how they apply that model to different caliber players. Mike Evans came off the bench onto the field of play and **assaulted** another player. You can sugar coat it all you want, any sort of physical altercation when the game is not in motion is wrong and could easily by the rule of the law be considered assault. Sure it isn’t normally because of unwritten rules but you take it to court and odds are they rule in your favor. Meanwhile you’ve got Watson after his truly extreme amount of sexual assault allegations - 5 of which were investigated by the league and deemed to be extreme enough to require suspension and he gets 11 games and then Willie Gay gets 4 for scaring his gf/baby mama/whoever she was to him by breaking a vacuum during an argument? And I get it, I would literally shit myself if Gay screamed at me while breaking a vacuum on a door frame. But you wanna know what else is scary? Being coerced into unwanted sexual acts by a clearly overpowering/high profile adult male

The only difference is caliber and notoriety of these 3 players

891,2632,2632,AU_wde_2,"The Rams rolled out an oline without whitworth and new offensive pieces without any preseason reps so their sloppiness was expected and the only question regarding the Bills for that game was would their be any emotional hangover in losing a close one last season which clearly didn’t happen. The Rams will be battling it out with the 9ers for the NFCW title but not in a dramatic 13-4 tie breaker way, more in line with a 10-7/11-6 way. But as the season progresses I predict they’ll pick it up defensively and give some teams problems 

The Titans have been slowly deteriorating since they lost the AFCCG to us in 2019 - sure they finished 1 last year but that was mostly because the other competitors cannibalized themselves and they waltzed into the 1 seed on an easy schedule. But they’ve been hemorrhaging talent for a couple years and have not done a good enough job replacing that talent. They played *alright* in that first half and once Lewan went out the wheels absolutely fell off. Tannehill cannot carry a team to a win - he lurks somewhere in the 13-16 range of top QB’s - serviceable but unless they have a devastating running attack like they did in 2019 behind a stout oline they’re screwed

All of this to say that the Bills have looked impressive as was expected, I think anyone who thought they were going to take a step back was just full of wishful thinking. The only questions I have for them is can Von Miller last an entire season and can their secondary hold up against a non-sputtering prolific passing game, alongside that will Tredavious White look the same after coming back from this ACL injury.

Bucs v Saints - could just be a good game similar to us and the chargers the Saints just play them close and maybe we see some of this behind the scenes stuff weigh on Brady 

Colts v jags - Colts always struggle with jags in Jacksonville so could be an upset and help to shake up the AFCS even more so

Dolphins v Ravens - a good measuring stick for both squads, the Ravens have been lingering as one of the marquee AFC teams this year, can the Dolphins make a name for themselves or will it be business as usual in Miami?

Falcons v Rams - the Rams came out so flaccid that this game will either be an absolute blowout as a pissed rams team whoops up on a lesser opponent *or* the Rams oline situation really is that bad and they falter, officially putting them on notice as a sputtering team 

Seahawks v 49ers - Seahawks coming off an emotional SNF, and a devastating performance in Chicago for SanFran. Can Lance get on the right track against a fairly weak opponent or will fans be calling for Jimmy G by this evening 

Bengals v Cowboys - probably won’t be an interesting game as the Bengals just have too much firepower on offense and have a good enough defense to keep a dak-less cowboys O off tilt BUT Micah Parsons is an animal and if the Bengals tackles don’t show up, this could be a rough day for Burrow from a hits sustained standpoint 

Texans v Broncos - Texans looked pretty okay last week so if the broncos show up and display the same comedy of errors they could be in for a rude awakening

Cards v raiders - this is the one I’m gonna watch a to b if it’s interesting because it’s pretty pivotal for both franchises. On one side you’ve got a cards team who I don’t think are emotionally capable of recovering from an 0-2 start who will be trying to claw their way back. And on the other side you’ve got a Raiders team that also displayed a bunch of miscues all over the field last Sunday and if they start 0-2 with all of the preseason hype surrounding them, the hot seat underneath Carr is going to turn up just a little bit (and hopefully it shows *sooooome* media members that the big splashy trade/FA signing isn’t always what makes a team great especially when they have deeper issues a la the titans signing Julio last season)

5692,40697,40697,ChevalMalFet,"So, I'm increasingly impressed with our performance on Thursday. That was a tough, gritty win against a division rival, and despite the whining on social media, the Chiefs deserved the win. 

Starting with the negatives, the offense. Mahomes made some poor decisions with the football and indeed got lucky to get away with 0 INTs. But all QBs get lucky now and then - Herbert had some dropped INTs, too, *just like every other QB*, but only one gets his talked about. Two more INTs were negated by penalty, but, I don't know what to say about those besides...don't commit penalties? We had our AFCCG winning INT negated by a penalty, it sucks, but the Pats still won that game. Deal with it, Chargers. 

But Mahomes having a 'poor' (that is, average - 200+ yards and 2 TDs) game is totally defensible given the short week, gelling with a new offense, and above all, the Chargers defense. Mack and Bosa lived up to the hype and were in the backfield all day long. The secondary covered our guys very well and Mahomes had to make magic out of basically nothing.

I don't have stats on how often Mahomes was pressured, but there's maybe one other QB on the planet who could have gotten the two TDs that Mahomes did against that defense. Yes, he took risks, yes, he gambled - but those risks are why we scored, and this time we got lucky. Reddit wants Mahomes to only take the risks that wind up scoring a TD or a deep shot, but those plays only happen if you're *attempting* many - and sometimes they don't work out (the near INTs...except they still worked out because they *weren't* INTs, because *shit happens* on a football field). They claim to only be judging process, not results, but that's not true - because the process of pushing, taking risks, looking for cracks in a very stout defense, *necessitates* taking risks, gambling that you'll get the one play that breaks your way, and that the multiple plays that don't won't be too crushing. That's exactly what happened in the game, but the media just wants to grouse about the ones that didn't work and say they should have been *even worse*. It's a one-sided look at things and if you believed it would leave you totally baffled how Patrick Mahomes has been so damn good for going on five years now. 

So the offense made mistakes and got lucky, but I think that's more a product of the tough nature of hte opposition than because we suck. The defense is a much brighter spot:

They were great. 

After the Chargers opening 10, they locked down and held them out of the endzone for the entire second quarter, including after the offense stalled out a few times and gave the ball right back to LA after a good stop. There was a wobble at the start of the 3rd, when Mike Williams caught that amazing TD, but you just tip your hat on those plays - the coverage was good, dude just made a play. We got it back on the pick 6 later - the Chargers have to tip their caps in turn to Watson on that one, dude just made a play. Otherwise, the Chargers' vaunted offense was stopped dead until the game was out of reach. 

Bottom line, I think we have good reasons to be really optimistic going forward. The offense sputtered because of a tough D but still did enough to get the job done, and the defense did an excellent job shutting down what the Chargers fan has never ceased reminding everyone was one of the best offenses in the league last year. All in all, I don't think it was a D or a C game from the Chiefs, but a solid B.",9.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_xgji48,False,0.0,"Pat ""Kermit"" Mahomes",2022-09-17T10:07:20Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0100877230560638
