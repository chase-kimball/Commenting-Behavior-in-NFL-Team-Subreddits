It took a near impossible sequence events for that collapse to happen. And yes, Nick chubb should’ve fell down, Cooper should’ve caught the ball or batted it out of bounds, and Cade should’ve hit his PAT. But 99% of the blame goes to our (way too often) incompetent defense.

Straight up – there’s way too much money and high draft picks spent on D to be this bad. Too much legit talent. How they managed to blow so many coverages (this week and last) and let Flacco march down the field at the end of the game was stupefying. Words can’t really capture how bad it was. It’s not even an isolated thing either – for as good as our defense was the last half of the 2021 season, there’s been way too much inconsistency and lapses where we let offenses walk all over us. The answer won’t be firing Joe woods this morning and Stefanski/Berry wouldn’t do that, but are we really confident Joe Woods is getting the most out of our defense? Changes need to be made but unfortunately idk what can be done for this season. Even before the collapse at the end our defense wasn’t great. We got like what, 3 offensive possessions the first half? Too often Offenses march down the field with little resistance. Jake burns mentioned this and I think it perfectly describes our pass defense – way too passive. 

And the amount of hate Stefanski gets for our offense is hilarious. What a solid game by him in terms of playcalling and offensive execution. Our run game is legit beautiful to watch and god bless Callahan too. Brissett played super well, and if he can do more of that then we’re gonna have a chance against some good teams that we otherwise thought were almost guaranteed Ls. I personally can’t wait to see what Stefanski can do when he finally gets a star quality QB in Watson. If we wanna blame Stefanski, blame him for keeping Woods and Priefer. Continuity is important, but these two dudes (Priefer for sure) just don’t cut it.

Losing this game really sucks for playoff hopes, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we look back in January and it’s this game that keeps us out. But, many other AFC teams (and particularly the AFCN) are also shitting the bed which really helps the overall playoff picture.

And I have to mention it again, but Doug Lesmerises article yesterday was laughably dumb. “the Browns brought it on themselves.

It's classic NFL Big Brain Coach thinking - *""the Mike MUST be the playcaller""* - and shows why teams like the Rams have stayed ahead of the game, being led by McVay and hiring open-minded and progressive thinkers like Staley and Morris who aren't inhibited by traditionalist mindsets when they develop their scheme and teach it to their players.

24044,176635,176635,deviden,"Gonna copy some of my comment from elsewhere... 

There's actually nothing inherently wrong with the scheme or playcalls. 4-2-5 quarters shell as base defense is a good idea in the modern NFL meta. 

The problem is that the DC and DBs Coach can't teach our players a good enough understanding of their roles within the scheme and playcalls so they repeatedly fail to execute their coverage assignments, and the back 7 seem to be struggling with communication in general. Flacco and Jets have put us on notice. There isn't a team in the league that can't score on us at will if our DBs dont get their shit together, and nothing else we do will matter if that remains true - we wont win more than 3 games all season if it doesnt get fixed. Opposing teams can (and should) send a guy on a deep route every play because eventually he'll get one where he can just run free and completely uncovered for a TD.

There is a cause for optimism, in that we've got a mini-bye coming up and that's a great chance for the coaches to self-scout and course correct, and the solution is clear - simplify, simplify, simplify. 

We'd be better off if we chose to almost never blitz, and just focused on teaching two or three zone coverage concepts at most until the DBs have shown they can consistently execute them. Limit the menu and focus on field communication so everyone on the field always understands their job - that'll get better results that throwing out theoretically good/creative defensive playcalls that the DBs have failed to learn/haven't been taught properly.

We should use *some* more Man because it is very easy to teach to DBs (""you got that guy""), but if an opponent knows you're running Man all game in today's NFL you are gonna get repeatedly toasted by simple pass plays that are designed to beat man coverage (mesh, rubs, etc). There is a reason that every good defense in the league outside Miami has abandoned Man-spam on every snap - even the ratbirds kicked out Wink.

If we limit the coverage menu to quarters, cover 2, cover 1 robber (starting from 2 high shell), and 2-man, plus a few designer blitzes each week - get the DBs knowing their role every snap and playing fast - we'll improve rapidly.

That said, for me, it's inexcusable for this Joe Woods to be in his third year and his defense repeatedly failing to execute coverages - especially when this DB group is in its second year within the third year DC's scheme.

The problem we have is teaching and communication... and (schematically) man is very easy to teach to DBs (""you got that guy""), but if an opponent knows you're running man all game you get toasted by pass plays designed to beat man coverage. 

We'd be better off if we chose to almost never blitz, and just focused on teaching two or three zone coverage concepts at most until the DBs have shown they can consistently execute them. Limit the menu and focus on field communication so everyone on the field always understands their job - that'll get better results that throwing out theoretically good/creative defensive playcalls that the DBs have failed to learn/haven't been taught properly.

Limit the coverage menu to quarters, cover 2, cover 1 robber (starting from 2 high shell), and 2-man, plus a few designer blitzes each week; get the DBs knowing their role and playing fast.

The irony is we went through this exact same routine last year. Defense was losing us games with busted coverages, then we self-scouted and simplified the coverages and the defense rapidly improved.

Flacco and Jets have put us on notice. There isn't a team in the league that can't score on us at will if our DBs dont get their shit together, and nothing else we do will matter if that remains true - we wont win more than 3 games all season if it doesnt get fixed. Opposing teams can (and should) send a guy on a deep route every play because eventually he'll get one where he can just run free and completely uncovered for a TD.

There is a cause for optimism, in that we've got a mini-bye coming up and that's a great chance for the coaches to self-scout and course correct, and the solution is clear - simplify, simplify, simplify.

I get that OP is a meme, but thing that doesn't make it into our fan narrative is that the scheme and playcalls aren't actually the problem.

There's actually nothing inherently wrong with the scheme or playcalls. 4-2-5 quarters/split safety shell is a good idea in the modern NFL.

From the conduct policy

>First, when a player is formally charged with a crime of violence, meaning that he is accused of having
used physical force or a weapon to injure or threaten another person, of having engaged in a sexual
assault by force or a sexual assault of a person who was incapable of giving consent, of having engaged
in other conduct that poses a genuine danger to the safety or well-being of another person, or of having
engaged in animal abuse. The formal charges may be in the form of an indictment by a grand jury, the
filing of charges by a prosecutor, or an arraignment in a criminal court.
Second, when an investigation leads the Commissioner to believe that a player may have violated this
Policy by committing any of the conduct identified above, he may act where the circumstances and
5 PCP – LPP 2018
evidence warrant doing so. This decision will not reflect a finding of guilt or innocence and will not be
guided by the same legal standards and considerations that would apply in a criminal trial.
In cases in which a violation relating to a crime of violence is suspected but further investigation is
required, the Commissioner may determine to place a player on the Commissioner Exempt List on a
limited and temporary basis to permit the league to conduct an investigation. Based on the results of this
investigation, the player may be returned to duty, be placed on the Commissioner Exempt List for a longer
