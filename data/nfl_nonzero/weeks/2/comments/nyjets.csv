Why didn't Lineman recover it if Cam didn't make an effort? If Cam was afraid of getting hurt, why was he still rolling around when the ball was loose to try to get it? Why didn't the 5-6 other players on both teams who had a chance to recover it not get any shit?

Because fumbles are generally very random, very messy, and asking a player to make a 100% accurate read on a bouncing oblong egg was and is ridiculous. I know what no effort plays are, that was absolutely not one.

He took off for it immediately but a Dlinemen was already half way to the ground and the ball fell into his lap. Cam's body simply reacted due to a big lineman flying towards his leg, and that was enough to get branded a ""quitter"" on that play. 

Cam would have had to read the ball perfectly, and magically anticipate that a lineman was going to fall over near it, to even make an attempt on the ball. Those commentators did him real fucking dirty describing it the way they did.

It's like jaywalking, while everyone knows it's technically against the law, everyone still does it. It's just frustrating because if you ever get in trouble for it, it's almost like they purposely, selectively enforced it.

If they are gonna flag him for it, I want to see flags on every similar play too. But that won't happen because it happens all the time.

The Jets seem get zero slack on any possible penalty, meanwhile other teams are given more leeway on minor infractions. Those small plays become major drives and end in wins and losses.

If that's all you have to do to be a Jets beat reporter, than I guess there are a few thousand candidates just right here. And if you wanted to do better than that, then look to see how professionals like Michael Nania and John B use stats and qualified takes to both praise and criticize the team. I can listen to them beat up on the team for hours because I know they actually want the Jets to win deep down.

He gets no breaks. If the Jets ended up losing in that game all that tweet was doing was rubbing salt in the wounds of the fans. If he wanted to do his job well, maybe he should have made his point with stats highlighting how much Chubb and Hunt were running over the defense, or how drops have killed drives.
