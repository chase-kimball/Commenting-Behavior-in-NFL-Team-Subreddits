The pocket breaks down, Ryan Tannehill is running, looking for something, anything. He sees Burks, completely unable to get separation, slowed down from his broken wrist and his skipped breakfast of albuterol. He sees Woods running the wrong route, not looking his direction, his ACL has fallen off. Austin Hooper is dead. He looks deep down the field and sees double coverage, but a glimmer of hope. One last spark of hope for humanity. He throws deep. Its going to the back corner, but the coverage is too tight, there is too much traffic, the ball is too high, there is no way he is going to connect, no mere mortal could bring this ball in... Suddenly we see the majestic hands of our lord and savior JOSH GORDON slowly rise up. The light blazing around his body is so bright it causes everyone in the stadium to shield their eyes. He is in the air for what seems like minutes, slowly rising, rising, rising. He makes the perfect one handed catch, He keeps rising. He is 20 feet above the goalposts now. The clouds open up and a single beam of sunlight falls to the field as JOSH GORDON does a forward flip and comes slamming down to the ground in a marvel-like superhero landing. The shock-wave from his landing causes the entire opposing team to fall to the ground with CTE. Miraculously, everyone on the Titans is unharmed, Ryan Tannehill is young again, Burks no longer needs an inhaler, and Hooper is still dead on the field. The crowd goes wild. The Titans win.

It's chemical element 83.  It is sometimes called the highest numbered element with at least 1 stable isotope (i.e. can exist as a non-radioactive substance).  This distinction also sometimes goes to lead, number 82.  This is because bismuth technically has no stable isotopes, but one of them has a half life many times greater than the age of the known universe, making it functionally not radioactive.  It's also notable in that it borders the infamously toxic lead at 82 and the acutely radioactive and poisonous polonium, 84, but it is itself not toxic, and is intact an ingredient in Pepto-Bismol.

There's no question that he deserves a healthy dose of criticism after his defense gave up 28 points in the fourth quarter, but I think outright calling him terrible two games into his professional coordinator debut is premature.

That said, good coaching is about putting your players in a position to succeed, not dreaming up a system and sticking to it come hell or high water. Say what you want about Wink, but one of the absolute smartest decisions he made as a coach was when he saw Earl Thomas struggling with his notoriously complex scheme and simplified it to closer match what he excelled with in Seattle. *That* is good coaching and it's not a coincidence that defense was top-five in yards, points, turnover rate, passer rating allowed, rush yards, basically every stat you can think of. You scheme around the players you have, and if the players you have need simpler concepts, you run simpler concepts, you don't continue running things they're not going to figure out and shrug when they screw up. Sure you can gradually introduce your more complex concepts, but priority #1 is making sure that, at the very least, you line up properly.

31654,178231,178231,ZombieFeedback,"Safety is one of the hardest positions to adjust to from college to pros. You have all the usual difficulty of adapting to bigger, faster, smarter players, but because you have to cover so much ground, you have a smaller margin for error because there is no recovering if you're too far out of position, and your mistakes are magnified. If a corner blows a coverage, it's a gain of 20. If a safety blows a coverage, it's a Tyreek Hill house call. 

On top of that, elite athleticism can cover a lot for a young corner, because if they're man, then high-end athleticism can help bail them out, and if they're zone, their responsibilities are usually going to be less of the field than a safety's. (Especially if the DC is trying to protect a rookie who's still developing) At safety, you have to read the entire offense to see where the play is going, and read the entire defense because if a coverage bust leaves a man wide open then the design goes out the window and you need to erase that, all while still reacting and positioning yourself properly in contest with literal Olympic sprinter speed.
