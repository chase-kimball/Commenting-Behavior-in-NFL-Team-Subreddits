He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen pints of avocado ice cream in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the pints and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each pint and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",8.0,nfl,t3_xg4lg8,False,0.0,:Texans: Texans ,2022-09-17T15:27:43Z,texans,-0.0270445510168174

The only other QB at this point, without costing a 1st or more, could be Garner Minshew and he comes with an equally balanced Pro-Con list as Mills. 

Better arm, but undersized, better processing, but more reckless, etc. Not to mention it's not easy to get dropped into a new offense without an install period.

Safety not even around and they would have been walk in touch downs.  Mills just didn't see him or didn't make it to him in the progression, but that's so much meat left on the bones that needs to be taken.  

He just seems so timid this year for some reason.  

I think it's way too early to knock the play calling.  The all-22 does show receivers and TEs open (NFL open so a half-yard to yard separation) and really that's all a play caller can do.

AR has better receivers but it's not like they are getting 5 yards of separation.  AR throws the ball on time and in the right spot and they make a play.  Mills isn't showing that at all on a consistent basis.  He seems way too timid out there and is either not seeing his reads correctly or not trusting them.  He's gotta clean that up because at this point he's playing for his NFL future.  If he can't cut it as a starter on our shitty ass team then nobody in the league will give him a shot.
