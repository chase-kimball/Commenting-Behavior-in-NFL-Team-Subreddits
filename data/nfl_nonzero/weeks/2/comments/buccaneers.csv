4570,25704,25704,BuctheFalcons,"The Good: 
Mike. Stood up for his QB/RB and was one of two pass catchers to actually make a play yesterday. He’s a dawg and even if he gets suspended it was worth it. 

The defense. They’ve played lights out the last two weeks, especially after the scripted starting drives. Definitely still some things they need to work on in terms of finishing tackles and playing a bit too far behind the sticks on third and long, but so far they’re the reason we’re 2-0. 

The Oline. This is more of a relative good considering we’re trotting out 3 back ups at the moment. They largely kept Brady clean. They blocked okay in the run game. I’ve been expecting a much more dumpster fiery type of performance so I’ll take this 7 days a week. 

The Bad: 
WRs not named Evans/Breshad. Scooter can’t catch and has the Darden slips. Gage disappeared. Darden just got penalized. For a group that’s going to end up getting significant playing time this year, they all looked piss poor. Might be time for a PS call up. 

BL. Don’t fucking run the ball on first down. Don’t. I get the OL is banged up. I get the WRs are dead. But the handicap we have utilizing them in the passing game, is smaller than the handicap we receive when the other team has an 85% chance of getting it right when they guess a run on first down. We got some tastes of creativity on that Perriman first down and with some of the quick game in the second half. Need more of that, need less 2nd and 8. 

The TEs. I know that Otton and Kieft are rookies and have been doing admirably as blockers. I know Brate and Rudolph are old and washed. But at some point one of the four needs to step the fuck up. Our TEs have 3 receptions on 7 targets for a whopping 20 yards through two weeks. Two weeks where we’ve missed some serious snaps from the WR room.

Marpet is done, he couldn't play his position right now, and good for him.

Beasley has great hands and is more versatile than Scotty.   Beasley can fill a similar role to Godwin that Brady really needs in this offense.

A few tips though:

When/if you get approached, get eye contact first, hold your phone out to them and keep your distance. 

Than Just swipe the 4 tickets quickly if they ask and say the seats out loud (add the seat next to you as well to make it seem like 5).

You want to speak at the same you swipe and try and stare at their eyes. When you do that you take advantage of splitting someones attention between their senses. 

Its basically the same trick pick pockets use. Divert attention away from what they want to see.

Poker patience. I love that we didnt get away from the run though, set up the touchdown to Perriman and in a grind oriented game like that, huge. DEFENSE BABY, that was the most clutch part of yesterday, being patient, not breaking, and letting them just make mistake after mistake. Offensive line did step up in pass protection and it made a huge difference. We went up and forced Jameis to make decisions and play aggressive. Our recipe for the saints should be to get a lead,and make them play aggressive. 

The bad - Our offense really struggles without receivers and if it wasnt for Brady game managing properly we would have been screwed. O line and injuries made our running game non existent. Until we forced that fumble, the saints did run the ball a bit too well for my liking. Had that fumble not occurred we would have been screwed. Our redzone offense is absolutely trash lol. 

Overall: A win is a win and against a division opponent who matches up well with us it feels freakin awesome , albeit not being sexy fantasy football wise.

Wtf are you on about? That paragraph makes no sense. Another delusional rebuttal.

Lol 20-10 is not “barely” winning and the Bucs won despite missing 5 of 11 starters and multiple backups. They had a close game with a largely healthy Saints team that they match up poorly against and they still won despite the injuries, that’s my point. You seem incapable of grasping that.

And Your logic that because the Bucs beat the Saints by 10, and because I called the Saints offense trash, i’m calling the Bucs team trash is mentally handicapped. That’s why I keep talking ab the injuries and the defense, but again you’re really poor at reading comprehension so maybe it’s on me to dumb it down.",1.0,nfl,t3_xjk6an,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers,2022-09-21T18:34:37Z,buccaneers,-0.08965995523005

And alas, the Saints, missing just one starter, managed 3 points and 7 in garbage time. NO has 37 points in 2 games. Tampa has 39. Except Tampa played the 4th and 7th best defenses from 2021. NO played the 5th and the 29th lol.
 
And yes I will hold onto the fact that the Saints are bad enough to be beaten even when Tampa plays poorly. And you can keep pretending that one player being out is the reason PJ Williams (who is regularly on the field with Lattimore) got torched by Perriman to make it 10-3 and why Winston threw a pick 6 to Edwards.",0.0,nfl,t3_xjk6an,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers,2022-09-21T12:40:21Z,buccaneers,0.00654024218869

13084,88296,88296,Modsareass,"Lol what a copium version of the events

bAsiCaLLy: the Saints had 3 points since the first drive of the game and only 3 redzone trips the entire game. The Bucs got 3 points in the 3rd after squandering multiple early Redzone trips. The fight happens. The Saints offense still can’t do anything. The Bucs score a TD on a drive that includes multiple long Fournette runs. The Saints offense still can’t do anything and turn it over. Bucs kick a FG. The Saints offense STILL can’t do anything but hand Tampa Bay another TD on a Pick 6. Saints score garbage time TD. 

So tell me in that sequence where you come up with more than 3 points to “potentially” win, before garbage time? 

Maybe if that pathetic offense posed any threat at all I might be convinced the Lattimore ejection mattered. But you and I both know the NO offense was eventually gonna turn it over close enough for Tampa to score (they had 5 TOs). And that’s exactly what they did to make it 13-3. 

Maybe a team should just score double digit points against NO, and with a half competent defense that should be enough points against this clown show of an offense.",-1.0,nfl,t3_xjk6an,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers,2022-09-21T11:34:37Z,buccaneers,0.0144325401669341

Tbh, I just don’t understand how they’re getting used. There’s no receiver that we’re scheming open (unless it’s an end around), there’s no receiver that’s consistently on the field (except maybe BP), I just don’t get it

>	BL. Don’t fucking run the ball on first down. Don’t. I get the OL is banged up. I get the WRs are dead. But the handicap we have utilizing them in the passing game, is smaller than the handicap we receive when the other team has an 85% chance of getting it right when they guess a run on first down. We got some tastes of creativity on that Perriman first down and with some of the quick game in the second half. Need more of that, need less 2nd and 8.

PFF has this chart that shows that, averaged for the entire NFL, a team is more likely to convert a first down if they pass on 1st and 10 (vs running on first and 10) and even if they pass on 2nd and 10 (vs running on 2nd and 10)…. And this is true at all parts of the field. 

It’s totally insane for the OC to think that running with 4 new lineman is a better idea than a quick passing game with Brady.

I’d rather give Brady 3 attempts to get a 1st down instead of rushing it for a grand total of 4 yards on 1st and 2nd down and then hoping he does some clutch shit on 3rd and 6.",7.0,buccaneers,t3_xi9zvj,False,0.0,:winfieldPeace: Winfield Jr. ✌️,2022-09-19T07:50:38Z,buccaneers,0.015573925962059

idk though that's just what I figured it was
