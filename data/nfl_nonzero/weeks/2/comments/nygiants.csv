28527,240420,240420,jshanley16,"Jshan’s Next Day Thoughts - week 2

DJ played “fine” for the 2nd week in a row. He played smart and didn’t really have any bonehead plays and definitely made the right read on our final play. Big takeaway: no turnovers

- Saquon didn’t have a great game by any means but still ran hard, was clearly the focal point of the panthers defensive playcalling.

- our defense has been playing great. We’ve held opponents to converting just 4 of 22 3rd downs this season which is insane. Oshane Ximines has showed up big time in the absence of Thibs and Azeez and it sounds like we get them back next week. Dane Belton looked pretty solid for his rookie debut.

- This may be a “No duh” moment but no giants WR can be trusted from a fantasy perspective. Daboll clearly is playing who he thinks has the best matchup for the week. Perhaps Shep is the only guy I would trust to flex into a starting lineup

- on that note I love that daboll doesn’t give a shit if KG gets paid a stupid amount of money, he’s playing guys who deserve to be in the field. Sends a great message to the team

33951,298765,298765,sybrandy,"This is something I've been expecting, to a degree, for some time with defenses getting lighter/faster to compensate for teams being more pass-happy and valuing speed at the skill positions, including RB. My thought would be to try to get as many RBs that can just run people over and blocking TEs to open holes. Combined with a good enough QB play to be able to get out some chunk play-action plays and top-tier run blocking, I see the following advantages:

1. You'll wear down a defense.
2. You'll eat the clock.
3. Long, sustained drives mean your defense is well rested.

However, the following problems most likely will crop up:

1. You're not set up for explosive plays, so if you're playing from behind, you're in trouble.
2. More plays means more changes to screw up.
3. It will be hard to find RBs/TEs that will fit this on a consistent basis.
4. You still need a QB that can call the correct plays at the correct time.

Needless to say, I don't expect this to be a thing at any time. Right now the Titans are the closest to this that I can think of, but if Henry goes down, they're in a bit of trouble. Even then, this year their run game hasn't been great so far, so they've been in some trouble.

1. Looks like he moved off Shep to look at #13 before Shep got open and pressure hit.
2. Not sure what to say about this one. Crosser opened up, so if he could have maneuvered better he could have tried a throw.
3. I don't think he moved off the outside receiver. This one looks bad.
