24828,171658,171658,TheFastestWaffle,"1. Salary Cap: With players like Bosa, Deebo, Warner, etc its easier for the front office to have a qb on a rookie deal so they can have high paid veteran players at other positions. 

2.  Injury History: When you pay Jimmy G as much as we were, it was hard to compete when he was injured. 2018 season and 2020 are most recent examples, although in 2020 everyone was injured so might be a wash. Best ability is availability. 

3. Known Ceiling: We know Jimmy’s pros and cons. With Jimmy, it’s hard to compete against a team with QBs like Burrow, Allen, Murray, Herbert, etc because those QBs have shown instances when their team is playing poorly, the QB will carry the team. With Jimmy, if everything else is going wrong he rarely is able to carry the team on his back. However, Jimmy has shown his ability to compete like against the Saints in 2019, and a handful of other 4th quarter must win drives throughout the years. 

Overall I think Jimmy’s a good QB, and has great intangibles like leadership and locker room presence. But, I think this front office wanted to gamble and try to find a QB who could carry this team when everything else isn’t going to game-plan.",1.0,49ers,t3_xkdi8c,False,0.0,:shanahat: Shanahat,2022-09-21T14:04:23Z,49ers,0.0064207381022067
