* Started dating new girl (10 yr wedding anny next month)
* I had never attended an NFL game
* She is a Philly fan cause she has extended family there that raised her as such
* She bought us tickets to  Eagles @ Redskins , excited to go to my first game with me
* My brother ends up offering me a ticket to Cowboys @ Redskins SNF home opener (few weeks before game GF bought tix to)
* GF is mad because she doesn't get to share my first game experience
* I go anyway. She is super pissed
* She gets offered a ticket from some ex-BF and goes to spite me, doesn't speak to me during game or next day
* She sells the tix she bought for us in anger
* She forgives me and buys the tix back from her friend and we go
* That game is the Michael Vick Monday Night Slaughter of 2010

Needless to say, we didn't speak much most of the game, or on the way home, or the next couple days, and then she was pissed at me again. The end.",2.0,commanders,t3_xk6l2c,False,0.0,:WAS:,2022-09-21T14:50:10Z,commanders,-0.089437037037037

- Our offense is still gelling. Theoretically, they should improve as the season goes on as Wentz gets used to Turner and his WRs and vice versa. The watch out here is: injuries along the O-line. Wentz will falter if he’s getting pressured consistently (see first half against the Lions).

27102,203386,203386,bbq62,"Hard to make any decisions now.  However, unlike the Colts, I don't blame our struggles on him. He's definitely one of the bright spots.  He has poor pocket awareness, but at least he has legitimate NFL tools which we've made great use of so far.  

I'm not quick to bail on Carson when our problem stem from poor roster management on defense.  

- over-drafted Jamin by 3 rounds
- expecting too much from undersized late pick Holcombe  
- signing WJ3 when you knew dang well you're going to play zone.  another square peg/round hole for this franchise.  
- 3 years in and two former LBs heading the defense, I don't think we have even a replacement level LB on the roster.  This is the most indefensible thing in River's tenure.   
- Last but not least poor defensive play calling.  Given our back 7 the only highlights are late round picks Forrest/Curl and sometimes Fuller will flash - I'm not sure we can expect even a top-25 defense.  So even taking that into account, DC should be fired.  No meaningful turnovers forced in 8 quarters.  Offenses averaging like 8ypc.  QBs usually not pressured.  WRs/RBs catching the ball in space with no one around.  Then poor tackling when they are around.   
- So yes I blame Del Rio, but he wasn't given a lot to work with in the back 7 in the first place.  For that, and staying with Del Rio this long- it's squarely on Rivera. 
- If we play an RB with even decent 1-cut vision, they are going off against us.  No 2nd/3rd level gap discipline unless Forrest can make a great play.  I trust 1 out of 7 currently healthy players to make that tackle.  

Then on Special Teams yesterday, We lost 18 yards b/c some no-name player carries the ball into the end zone.  We lost about 20 yards on a couple Dax Milne returns.  Milne has no ball carrier vision which was on display when he took that big hit from his left.  That guy came from about his 10 o'clock but Milne had no idea.  He is the last skill position OFF/DEF player I would put back there.  You can't coach those natural ball carrier instincts.  He doesn't have it.  Plus he makes terrible decisions.  

Offense had 3 bad quarters, but at least they've had 5 pretty good quarters.  And this is without the defense and ST giving them short fields.  Even if the defense could generate one turnover in the middle of the game, I mean the sky is the limit on that side of the ball. 

So - with all that said and my objective assessment of the team - if I had to decide today I would absolutely keep him.  There are few franchises like the Bears who can beat us in realizing that you can ABSOLUTELY do worse than Carson Wentz at QB.  And like we learned with Cousins and the Colts with Ryan - you better not move on unless you have better on the roster or within your grasp.  

When you look at our problems, it's Ron Rivera at the root of them.  Not Carson Wentz or any other offensive player or coach.  Rivera made poor roster and staff decisions on defense.  We aren't getting any value for our first round picks or FA signings whether due to injury or poor play.  And this scheme is so bad a 2nd year late round safety is calling it out after his second start.  His decision to stick with Del Rio this long as well is on him.  

He wanted all this responsibility, and so far we're getting all the negatives of Rivera with hardly any of the supposed good things.  You're not supposed to want to play a Rivera team with such a great ""culture"", but I can name maybe 2 teams who wouldn't look at us as an immediate W and get-right game.  

I'm not trying to be overly harsh on Rivera - if we had a GM I would mostly blame them.  But since he wanted that job too, he's going to get the blame that comes with it.",5.0,commanders,t3_xi9l8t,False,0.0,🧀 Cheeseman 🧀,2022-09-19T08:48:18Z,commanders,-0.0106644982456587
