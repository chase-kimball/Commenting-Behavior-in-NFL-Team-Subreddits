Taco just shrugs and says he has never heard of them 

Taco then proceeds to draft only Lions because they are on his favorite new fictional drama Hard Knocks.

Everyone let's it ride until Taco takes Amon-Ra St. Brown right before Andre was going to take him. Andre whines, but everyone finds it funny they just let it stand.

The storyline wouldn't fully work because I don't think they filmed the season during the season. 

The Lions offense keeps giving Taco enough points to win when everyone expected his team to be garbage. 

Taco converts to the Egyptian God religion, because he worships Amon-Ra St. Brown (the man is both an egyptian god and a catholic saint). Dressing like a Sphynx on Sundays.
