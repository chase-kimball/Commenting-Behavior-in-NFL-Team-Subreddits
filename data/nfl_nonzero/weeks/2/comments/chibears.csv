Does Fields need to better? Absolutely. But that‚Äôs what this season is for. He‚Äôs going to struggle at times but it‚Äôs about growth. This team is essentially starting 3 rookies on the O-Line, has dog water receivers, and very inexperienced QB. Not sure what anyone expected. The rookies and young players are going to take lumps this year. It is what is is.

Good:
Goddamn Monty looks solid. That man can fucking run, and he single-handedly made this game even remotely interesting in the second half. Love to see him playing well.

The O-Line played better than I expected today. Not great on the pass, but some of that was due to some questionable decision making by #1. The run blocking was on point, super impressive against a very solid D-Line in Green Bay.

Fields can run the ball well. Yes, we already knew this, but still a plus.

Travis Gipson was a goddamn beast. The pass rush looks much improved when compared to last year.

Bad:

Kyler Gordon got absolutely cooked today. Every time a big play saved the Packers, it seemed like he gave it up. He just couldn‚Äôt do anything. It‚Äôs early, but if he‚Äôs our starting nickel and he plays like that the rest of the year, it‚Äôs gonna be a long season.

I fucking love Fields but he looked scared tonight. Just no pocket awareness. He had time to throw, yet he just couldn‚Äôt get the ball out a few times. Slow reads. Really not impressed. 

Luke Getsy is so goddamn confusing. Even ignoring the shotgun playcall on 4th and inches, we had back-to-back-to-back three and outs. We couldn‚Äôt do anything after a nicely scripted first drive. It‚Äôs far too early to say for certain, but this was Nagy-Esque. He completely abandoned the run game that was the heart and soul of this team, and then when he ent back to it of course it works. The worst part for me is it seems like he doesn‚Äôt trust Fields, which doesn‚Äôt bode well at all. I‚Äôm worried.

This defense is only gonna get a little bit of heat from me due to the amount of time they were on the field, but man this secondary was getting beaten consistently. Just disappointing. We need to see some better stuff from this defense. They got murdered by the run today, almost 200 yards allowed on the ground. Unacceptable.

Fuck Ryan Poles for deciding to pursue an injured DL instead of Chark, JuJu, or any of the other reasonably-priced mid-tier WRs and then spending two second rounders on defense instead of WR/OL. 

We all knew it was fucking stupid at the time, we just tried to cope our way out of the situation. Literally the worst case scenario would've been if Fields was terrible, but at least we would've gotten a better evaluation of that and set up the next guy better. No one cares if we lose this year but if we can't evaluate Fields or ruin him by putting him in a terrible situation, that's an unacceptable outcome.

Now we have $100M of cap available for next year but no good free agents available to spend it on. Watch us go overpay Nelson Agholor or Sterling Shephard next year and call the problem solved.

**Edit:** Downvote me all you want-- there's a raging debate on twitter and reddit about how much of the blame for Sunday should be scheme vs. Fields vs. the O-Line vs. guys not getting open/dropping the ball. If we had better protection and receivers and still had this kind of outing, at least we'd know it was in large part Justin's fault. Also, a better offense around Fields probably makes us more comfortable giving him more than 14 passing opportunities-- when you don't let a QB pass, they aren't able to get into a rhythm, and they feel the pressure of each throw because limited opportunities are rarer, and thus more consequential.",3.0,chibears,t3_xjasqd,False,1.0,An Actual Bear,2022-09-20T10:46:01Z,chibears,0.077252400971148

I‚Äôm not a GM or a team strategist, I just think it‚Äôs pretty clear what they‚Äôre trying to do and it‚Äôs consistent with other teams that have turned things around in recent history. 

At the end of the day, the last regime seemed to basically fall in love with a guy and spend either too much in a contracting or too much in draft capital to move on them. But there never seemed to be a real plan except ‚Äúfind players we like.‚Äù  

It may not be the plan I would choose, but I think what reassures me about this regime is if you step back, they clearly have a plan. 

Here‚Äôs my take: 

- build up the defense and special teams. This is Parcells school of team-building. A strong defense keeps you in it, and a strong ST will steal wins for you. Looking at VJJ and Ebner, guys who can explode in returns, and mixing in starters on ST (like in the Lovie days) indicates this plan to me. 
- rely on scheme and athleticism (I.e. ceiling) to try to find bargains for the offense. You have this year that‚Äôs all about development, not competition. Perfect year to start a high upside LT who needs coaching and reps to (hopefully) reach his ceiling. 
- stress test your young QB and see how he responds. Like it or not, he‚Äôs not this regime‚Äôs pick. All reports are that they‚Äôre still bullish on him, but they can evaluate him less emotionally because you sort of have a (long-term, it might suck in the short term) win-win. Either he steps up and proves he‚Äôs the man, or he sucks and you‚Äôre picking top 5 and have a chance to replace him 
- I don‚Äôt think we need to win a ton for Fields to show he‚Äôs the guy. We just need to see steady progress. More of the upside plays, less of the wtf plays as the season goes on. Unless we‚Äôre an absolute dumpster fire all year (possible) there‚Äôs enough in place to evaluate if he‚Äôs progressing. 
- in 2023 you have your full complement of picks, better knowledge of where your holes are, and plenty of money to overspend fixing them. I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll be ready to win regularly in 2023, it‚Äôll still be a young team, but if the plan is working they‚Äôll be ready to compete and you won‚Äôt see this lopsided games. 

There‚Äôs going to be a lot of growing pains this year, and some next year too. But at least I can step back and say, ‚Äúokay, you have a plan to build a long-term competitor.

Personally, I think if they didn‚Äôt get bailed out on their second drive with an extremely soft defensive holding (which basically tells the defense ‚Äúhey, this isn‚Äôt one of those games where we let you guys play, don‚Äôt get physical or eat the penalty‚Äù) that would have taken a touchdown away. Then you count the TD that should have been and we lose by 3. 

I think our defense is better than they looked and will be without the packer handicap, and I think fields will gradually show improvement throughout the year as he learns the offense and plays average or worse defenses. It‚Äôs just natural. It‚Äôs like in fantasy when your stud rb goes against a top run D or your WR1 has a game against a lockdown corner.

It‚Äôs a really misleading statistic especially for an offense like ours). We even faced one of the best pass defenses in the league where the obvious move was to rely on the run heavily. 

Now he did look terrible, but it‚Äôs a brand new offense playing against a top defense. He‚Äôs got things to figure out and I think it might take some time. He‚Äôs clearly not comfortable at all.
