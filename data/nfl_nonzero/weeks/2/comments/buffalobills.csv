On offense: You just have to cover Diggs, Davis, McKenzie, and Crowder, but also look out for Singletary or Cook out of the backfield, and wait, also apparently now have to check for Gilliam? Okay no problem tho, you also have to make sure Allen doesn't run the ball, and then you're good as long as he doesn't hand it off to Moss, Singletary, or Cook. No problem. Ezpz

&#x200B;

For defense: You just have to stop Rousseau, Oliver, Von Miller, Boogie, Phillips, and whatever other DLinemen they sub in every other down from getting to the QB, while your WRs also have to get open against Hyde, Poyer, Johnson, Bernard, Elam, and White when he comes back. So just give your QB time and make sure the WRs get open. Or run it against that DLine that stays fresh because of the constant rotation of bodies. No problem.
