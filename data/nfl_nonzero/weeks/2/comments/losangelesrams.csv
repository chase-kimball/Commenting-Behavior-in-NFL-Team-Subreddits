18840,166555,166555,admiralnel,">No, it‚Äôs not. But it‚Äôs on the DC to put their players in the best position to succeed. And Raheem is absolutely terrible at that. 3rd and 4 in a situation where our defense has to get a stop? Play our defensive backs 10+ yards off the ball! It‚Äôs absolutely maddening. 

Atl was 3-10 on 3rd down, would've been 2-10 but Wagner missed a tackle. Execution matters.


>The death by 1000 paper cuts bend but don‚Äôt break defense makes absolutely zero sense to me. 1. You unnecessarily wear out your defense and are just delaying the inevitable, instead of making a genuine attempt to prevent it in the first place and 2. How do you expect your defense to build confidence and momentum when you put them in a situation just to delay them from scoring a touchdown for as long as possible and hoping they make a stupid mistake in the process. This is the NFL. And finally 3. It keeps your offense off the field for an unnecessarily long amount of time. No one ever says ‚Äúwe need to get our offense off the field‚Äù. We need to get our defense off the field. And we can‚Äôt do that because Raheem‚Äôs scheme is literally designed around keeping them ON the field.

Which is odd because it's been widely adopted by the rest of the league, big difference is teams like the Bills and Chargers can play tighter because they can generate pressure without having to blitz. Right now the Rams can't do that, Wagner might be the 2nd best pass rusher. There was a handful of plays last week where the coverage was good but the pass rush wasn't there. And our corners have been bad the few times they play up close, big TDs and big penalties. You know if the offense would quit turning the ball over as much the defense could get a breather.

I think we all would like a better performance out of the D, and tighter coverage would be nice. But I think it's lazy to put this solely on the DC, especially because guys aren't executing and we're (as fans) aren't even sure they could handle press coverage.

34078,278242,278242,txyesboy,"The one thing that negates the entire argument on Reddit about how poorly Aaron Donald tries to contain his anger management on the field for the Los Angeles Rams, is how poorly people on Reddit are at keeping their own anger management in check. 

Honestly I'll never understand it.

And the thing is; people automatically assume just because you don't lash out in anger at Aaron Donald to the same degree that others on Reddit do - and you are a Rams fan - then somehow you think automatically that we think it's OK what he does. 

Life is a little more nuanced than that. 

And more importantly, I can go over everything's roster and find people that I've done far worse things than Aaron Donald has done but - off the field - yet to this sub, he's literally Hitler.

And to those who say ""but Aaron Donald get away with it, and they don't""

Seriously? 

Do you know how many NFL players have beaten their wives girlfriends and children to nearly an inch of their lives, and has served almost no prison time? Because I do.
