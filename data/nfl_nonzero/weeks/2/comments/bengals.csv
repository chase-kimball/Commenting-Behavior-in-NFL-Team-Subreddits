16616,114691,114691,Lionheart_513,"Some thing that most casual football fans don‚Äôt understand, and I‚Äôm not accusing you of this by any means, is that you only have five linemen. Maybe you add a tight end and a running back to make it six or seven, but regardless, you only have X amount of blockers. You cannot block more than that amount. On the other side of the ball, the defense can rush anybody they want. They can run an 11 man blitz if they feel like it.

If the cowboys rush six and we have five blockers, there is going to be a free rusher. This guy is called a ‚Äúhot‚Äù defender. He will get through untouched. This is OK though because the quarterback is aware of who it‚Äôs going to be on every snap. He can read what that guy is doing and be able to make him mess or get the ball out quicker or just do some thing to play around him.

My theory is that the Bengals offensive line is struggling with who to get in these blitz pick up situations. it‚Äôs not enough to just block somebody, you have to block the right guy. If Burrow thinks that a blitzing middle linebacker is going to be the hot defender on a given play, and then said linebacker gets picked up, then it leaves him guessing who the hot defender is going to be. You don‚Äôt have time to get through your progression and figure out who the hot is on the fly. It‚Äôs OK to have an untouched free rusher, but it isn‚Äôt OK to not know who the free rusher is.
