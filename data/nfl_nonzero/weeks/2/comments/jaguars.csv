2878,23609,23609,Bmilla51,"- Getting up early forced the Colts to beat us through their passing game with a bunch of nobodies at WR today.
- This made JT a non-factor.
- Defense still played great and didn't take their foot off the gas with constant pressure
- Easily the best offensive performance from TLaw and crew, but visors off to Dougy and the coaches for getting the team ready after a tough loss last week

I'm cautiously optimistic with our schedule that we can make some noise. Positive vibes only

But! If we assume truth in OP's assessment of Allen's mood, I'd only argue that that's not the time or place to show it from a professionalism standpoint. Josh Allen is our defensive leader. I love that dude as a player, and did not see the same thing OP saw.

That's why teams don't go 17-0. It's called deviation from expectation. I'm fully confident that this team will surpass our 3 wins from last season, and maybe even play in some meaningful games in the second half of the season.
