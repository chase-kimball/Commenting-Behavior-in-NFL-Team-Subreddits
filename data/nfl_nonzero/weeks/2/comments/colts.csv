A QB can’t be good if he has nowhere to throw. “But good QBs make receivers be open”. Horseshit (pun intended). Receiver have to be capable of making athletic moves to go get the ball. This corps is not capable of that against nfl secondaries. It’s not their fault either. It was organizational malpractice to run that WR corps out and ask them to be competitive. They aren’t capable. It’s on Ballard. EVERYONE said we need WRs. EVERYONE. Except Ballard. Everyone says he’s a great drafter but why? Cause he got Nelson, Pittman and Taylor?? Anyone with eyes knew they’d be at least decent pro football players. His defensive drafting is awful. Just horrible. Especially on the D-line. Every damn year we have 0 QB pressure. All opponents have to do is double team Buckner and their QB could read through his progressions, read War and Peace, and take a nap before making the throw and he won’t be touched. And you can’t say Ballard hasn’t TRIED to address the d-line. Trading for Buckner (good move), Ngakoue (is he even on the field these two games??) hasn’t fixed it. Drafting Odeyingbo, Banogu, Paye, etc hasn’t worked either. The secondary is awful as well, so sick of 80% completion rates from QBs against us, and minus Leonard the LBs are below average.

He has a record of 37-30-1 and has made the playoffs half the time he’s been here, not advancing past the divisional (and that was 4 years ago). Hardly inspiring hope there. He consistently gets outcoached. For god’s sake Eagles fired Pederson, he took a year off of football, and in his second game as the coach of a 2-15 team last year, he *destroyed* Reich, in Reich’s 5th year. This is completely unacceptable and it has been a consistent theme in Reich’s five years here.


This is not a knee jerk reaction. How can it be after the ending to last year? Most coaches would be fired for vouching for Wentz and collapsing how we did, and here we are 9 months later and Reich + his staff have learned nothing. They have not improved, in fact, they have regressed. Oh yes, somehow they have regressed from one of the most embarrassing losses in the 70 year history of this franchise. We are the laughingstock of the NFL.


Not to mention Reich picked Gus Bradley to be his DC, a complete reject from multiple teams who has now let two mediocre QBs destroy us. I think most realistic fans were expecting he’d be about as good as Flus, but somehow, some way, he is much, much worse.


How can you look at the performance Reich put out today, and then look at new hires Mike McDaniel, Kevin O Connell, among others, and say “yep, Reich is the guy, surely something will change in year 5!”


By all accounts he has lost the locker room. The team looks unmotivated, uninspired, and chaotic. In. Week. 2. Of. A. 17. Game. Season. He will not take us to a Super Bowl. Ever.
