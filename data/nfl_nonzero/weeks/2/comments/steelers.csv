Firstly, I fully agree with you. The passing chart for the most part is stupid. BUT, to be completely fair, I was at the game, there were at least 4 plays where guys are wide open down field. One in particular driving to the closed end of the stadium, I believe Pickens was wide open 15 yards downfield, and he checked down to Najee who gained 3, we settled for a field goal. Another where Diontae would’ve gained 35+ driving to the open end, Mitch scrambled left and took a loss even though he had time. Diontae had his hands up in frustration his entire walk from the pats sideline to the bench.

On the flip side, there was one play Hunter Henry (I think it was HH?) went completely uncovered from the snap through his entire route, would have had a walk in TD, and Mac just went Stevie Wonder too.

20659,140912,140912,Ooziez,"Good:

- Minkah. Star players make star plays. Minkah is just being Minkah. 

- Dotson. Live tv view sure did show a good game from him which is very encouraging. Gonna need a rewatch of course but he was moving people for sure. 

- Dionate. This guys catches are absurd. He is a total playmaker, no way around it. 

Bad:

- MOF defense. Don’t know the stats but it sure seemed like we struggled here. Soft zone which just let those crossing routes destroy us. Probably trying to mask the loss of TJ but this was an absolute whooping on us all day long. 

- offense. I don’t even know where to begin here. The same issues that happened with Ben are still the same with Mitch. What does that tell you? Spoiler: Kenny won’t fix it. We wait till we’re down 10 and then finally come to life. We just tend to make things look SO hard. There are a lot of culprits here and I know Mitch will be the easy scapegoat, but it’s more than him. 

- Muth drops. He saved himself with that TD but I had 2(?) drops for him. Uncharacteristic of him so not putting a lot of stock into it, but I know he wishes he had those back. 

- Pass rush. We knew TJ’s loss would hurt but not like that. 0 sacks and 2 QB hits? Mac had nothing but time. Gotta find a way to get home and make him uncomfortable. 

- Gunner. Total game changing muffed punt that completely flipped the script. special teams matter and we need every advantage we can possibly get. 

Story of the game is, yet again, the offense. Defense gives them every opportunity to do something and we can only respond with 3 and out. Again, this is the same thing we said about canadas offense since he got here. It was easy to blame ben tho. This offense needs serious help. 1-1 with a quick turnaround to Thursday night. Maybe they’ll surprise us.

Kenny has had the least opportunities to prove himself in this league out of the 3 of them and many on this sub are begging for it to stay that way. Unexplainable.

I am the one who highlighted the play. I am the one who posted a screenshot of the play. I watched the play.

Chase has the EXACT SAME depth as DJ when Trubisky releases: 3 yards. The difference is that Chase was far more open. And Chase is running a slant while Diontae runs a whip route, the slant takes less time to break and thus Chase would be ready for the ball sooner.

The point of this post was to highlight that even if we run a play with not one but two routes to the middle of the field that means little if they are not Trubisky's first read. The time with which it took Mitch to release is irrelevant, he never looked anywhere but Diontae. I also highly doubt he was even aware of Hubbard on his right because he never looked that way.

There was no defender within 5 yards of Chase. If he caught the ball he could literally fall over and get the first, allowing us to get even closer. 

LMAO @ ""It would be dumb to throw to a wide open receiver."" Better throw it to the guy who has less separation and has the boundary containing him as an extra defender.
