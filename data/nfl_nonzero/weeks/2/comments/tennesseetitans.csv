2169,18882,18882,Bieber_hole_69,"Feels like this may be similar to what happened in Seattle last year. He just didn't trust his knee or it locked up or something.

My guess at this point is he's a GTD depending on how warm-ups go for Sunday, pending the injury report this week. Might just let him sit this week to be cautious.

The fact they didn't put him on IR today makes me think he's back before the bye.

Edit: Also anyone that roasted me for my comments earlier today saying Buck's sources/report seemed shoddy can leave an apology lmao

Edit 2: Does anybody that's torn an ACL want to chime in on what this issue might be, flaring up almost two years after Lewan's initial tear? My understanding of it last year was that his knee didn't feel right pre-game against Seattle so he was scratched to be cautious. Is it mental? Does he not trust that knee anymore and can't get through that? He had to be stretchered out on Monday and was limping after he tweaked it before the Seattle game last year, so is it pain or does it just not feel right sometimes?

I know all injuries are different and all, but I've never heard of someone having these issues so far removed from surgery since ACL surgery has gotten so routine.

Do we think he felt it was off pre-game and decided to try to play anyway? The last time he decided to last-minute scratch himself from a start could have been a reason why Ty Sambrailo retired, so I could see why he may feel the need to try playing through it this time lol",36.0,tennesseetitans,t3_xkd0m4,False,0.0,11,2022-09-21T13:38:54Z,tennesseetitans,0.0585375765682206

2172,18885,18885,Bieber_hole_69,"I agree with that on Buck. I think he cosplays as a reporter when he shouldn't. The stuff last year when he unquestionably reported Ty Sambrailo's side of the story when he retired and basically allowed Ty or his agent to go on background to bad mouth the Titans org was some of the shoddiest reporting I've seen in a long while. Just reading a wikipedia page about Journalism Ethics would go a long way for Buck.

Nashville media has a long record of getting scooped by national reporters when it comes to major injury news for starters and stars on the team. Pelissero had the Landry ACL news first. Glazer had Lewan's ACL news in 2020 first. Rapaport had the news about Butler's wrist in 2019 first.

You can go on and on, local media never breaks news about significant injuries. Agents and players have their reporter buddies that they leak news to first, those in the FO have their reporters they leak the info to. Local guys are never on that list of who gets the info first in Nashville. 

The fact that Buck had this info first, and has been the only person to have this info for a full day is fishy. Nobody else has been able to corroborate or refute this info?

2173,18886,18886,Bieber_hole_69,"No, but almost always when Shefty reports that a player is likely done for the season, it gets corroborated by other insiders that get the same info from their sources.

Buck is the only person to report anything about the severity of Lewan's injury almost 48 hours after it has happened. I can't help but imagine that most NFL reporters that have a source in the Titans building would have called their source up after seeing Buck's report and checked his info. So far nobody else has reported anything one way or another, which to me indicates that either, 1.) Everyone else's sources are not confident enough in this info to tell insiders to report it on background, or 2.) Buck didn't actually get this info from a primary source and is reporting something he heard through the grapevine.

I've been critical about Buck in the past for running stories with iffy sourcing in the past on here, and I think that might be what's going on here. I don't think he has legit sources in the building, or at least good sources that would come to him with exclusive info that they wouldn't also share with national reporters.

Speculating here, but maybe this morning his source for the Lewan info came back and said that the situation has changed or wasn't as certain as they thought it was last night when the initial report from Buck came out. 

Maybe Lewan does end up out for the year, who knows? But I think it's fishy that Buck has a scoop like this and nobody else is reporting anything about Lewan's injury yet.

Better that this happened on the road in September in an interdivisional game rather than at home in November to a team in the AFC South.

Maybe a partial tear that would require rehab rather than surgery?

And it's definitely possible they might be over cautious here. It's a big deal for Lewan if he's done for the year, they probably don't want to make that call unless they know 100% for sure that he's done. It would be the end for him as a Titan and very well could be the end of his career. His last ACL recovery didn't go all that smoothly, another tear might be it for him in the league, or would at least decrease his value so much that it's not worth it for him to keep playing.

Is Buck backtracking on his initial report that Lewan was likely done for the year? His sources were just, ""Those close to the situation,"" and that he saw Lewan was using crutches and had a sleeve on his knee after the game.

I've had issues with Buck's reporting and sourcing in the past, and as far as I can tell it seems like he's the only person in any media that's put out something saying anyone inside St. Thomas thinks that Lewan is done for the year. All the other articles and tweets I've seen about this source Buck's initial report.

The initial article from Buck also says that story would be updated when further information is available, but instead they just published an entirely new article saying nothing is final. Feels like they were waiting for confirmation to come in to further source the initial report and they got nothing else, or a walk-back from the original source.

Wouldn't shock me if Lewan is done for the year either way, but Schefter had the news broken that Lewan tore his ACL the morning after that 2020 Houston game.

Targeting value bin free agents, building in the trenches, not overpaying for free agents at premium positions, accruing as much draft capital and cap space as possible. 

It's all great stuff in theory, until you end up with a roster where your only stars are at the least impactful positions, (interior OL, off-ball linebacker, RB,) and you have all this cap space you've been sitting on for years even though you're just about out of the window when your best players are still cheap.

Maybe it would have made more sense to pony up last year and spend some of that cap space on a WR1 or an LT that's not cheap because he's coming off a torn Achilles in the playoffs. It's smart to build up all that draft and cap capital, but you've gotta use it at some point. Now it's going to be all spent on second contracts for those star players at non-impactful positions and an old QB that looks cooked.

Maybe it would have made more sense to trade a couple 1st round picks to get high enough in the 2021 draft to take a QB rather than trading a single 1st rounder to get a value in Wentz? Or would you rather have tried it in 2020 and opted to not trade for Buckner since you had a top 15 pick and less distance to jump in the draft for a QB? 

It makes sense on paper to try the stop-gap veteran QB carousel to maintain cap and draft flexibility until it's year four post-Luck and you still don't have an answer at QB.

I know Titans fans like me have a particular saltiness about how beloved Ballard and Reich are by the media because Vrabel and Robinson have done so much more and gotten such less press lavishing in comparison.
