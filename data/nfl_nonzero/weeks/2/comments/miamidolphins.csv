6302,46129,46129,Cidolfus,"At the snap, all of the Dolphins defenders were within five yards of the line of scrimmage. The offensive line opens up a hole so that when Jackson gets two yards downfield, he's already in a footrace with all the other Dolphins defenders who have to disengage blocks and turn around to chase him. Jackson doesn't have to make anyone miss. He doesn't have to break any tackles. After his initial blocks, he has wide open field and he just has to be faster than the defenders trying to play catch-up. Obviously most quarterbacks *aren't* that fast, but plenty of runners are, and PFF doesn't give Jackson extra credit for not being a running back on designed rushing plays.

That play went for a touchdown because fantastic blocking by the Ravens offensive line, especially their in-line tight end and the pulling left guard who seal off the hole which Jackson shoots out of like he was shot from a cannon. He'll get credit for being fast enough to win the footrace, but with a hole that big, the runner is *expected* to have a massive gain.",7.0,nfl,t3_xijza6,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-09-19T16:12:51Z,miamidolphins,0.1122657319307327
6303,46131,46131,Cidolfus,"I've observed the opposite. If you're taking easy throws underneath, they tend to grade those neutrally so that one or two *bad* plays can wreck a grade.

Consider Jackson's passing depth yesterday. 11 of Jackson's 28 attempts were thrown 10+ yards downfield and he went 6/11 on those attempts. 189 of his 318 passing yards and two of his three touchdowns came on attempts that traveled fewer than ten yards downfield through the air.

He was graded most positively for his intermediate (10-19 yards) throws where he went 5 for 7 for 103 yards and a touchdown, but he received middling grades in the 0-9 yard range where he's getting dinged *hard* for his turnover-worthy play (the dropped pick-six) and probably not getting much credit for the 75-yard slant to the house or the TD pass from the one yard line.

Similarly he's graded poorly on his deep attempts where he went 1 for 4 for 26 yards. The 26-yard completion also wasn't flagged as a big-time throw nor way is that deep, so I'd wager it graded pretty neutrally.

Jackson's 90.0 grade on intermediate throws yesterday is absolutely elite (they credited him with two big time throws on those seven attempts), but it wasn't enough to elevate what they viewed as otherwise throws he *should* make and one really bad throw.

Same thing happened on his rushing attempts. PFF credited Jackson with 8 rushing attempts yesterday. Of his 119 rushing yards, only 11 yards came *after* contact. He went 79 yards for his TD completely untouched, so his offensive line is getting the credit for that grade, not him. On his other designed rushing attempts, Jackson rushed for 11 yards on five attempts. It shouldn't be too much of a surprise that his 29 yards rushing on scrambles got wiped out by a goal-line fumble in terms of PFF grading.",14.0,nfl,t3_xijza6,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-09-19T14:12:56Z,miamidolphins,0.0181626942689307

Byron Jones will be out, and it seems likely we'll start a UDFA Rookie (Kader Kohou) who has been very good the past couple weeks but hasn't taken on a full game load - he was given the role at halftime against the Ravens.

I think if Miami is going to win, it needs to turn into a shootout with the defense providing turnovers to offset the bleed - that's been their identity the past year or two; we just haven't had the offense to win those games against stronger teams.

And you completely ignored the other argument...Tua was working with a head coach that didn't want him there, the same head coach that in his rookie year was benching him when he was struggling. The next year he was having to play with rumors about Watson the entire offseason and until the trade deadline last year, and his head coach every day in the media indicating that he wanted Watson, every year a different offensive staff, one more incompetent than the other, can you imagine what all that can do to a young QB's head in this league?
