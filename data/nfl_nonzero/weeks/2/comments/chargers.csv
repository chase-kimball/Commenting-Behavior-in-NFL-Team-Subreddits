This symbolizes injury to the team, both physical and mental. The eight wands planted in the ground are past victories or achievements and the man holding the ninth wand is very carefully guarding them. This could represent how hard certain players are working to keep their achievements and to gain new ones, even though they are injured. 

The second card that fell from the pile was the Ace of Cups. This is a really special card, symbolizing the abundance of hard work and dedication. A hand is holding the overflowing cup as a dove dives into it, showing the peace that comes from reaping your rewards. This could mean a hUge win for the chargers, either physically or emotionally.
