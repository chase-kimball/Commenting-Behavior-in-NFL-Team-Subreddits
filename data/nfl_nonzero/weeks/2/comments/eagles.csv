Women are socialized to be embarrassed and indirect about our sexual needs. Faking an orgasm to ""finish"" sex is something my friends and I have talked about ad nauseum. Women are not raised to think about our own pleasure and sexuality as important TO US, rather, as a tool to entice men.

At the same time men are conditioned to believe that sex is ultimately an act that should lead to their pleasure, not necessarily their partners. Men who grew up learning and understanding female sex from porn and the mainstream media (for example) may believe that penetrative sex should be sufficient for a woman to achieve orgasm, which is not the case for some of us.

TLDR. Its not about the couple engaging in sex, but more about how overall men need to be attentive to their partners needs (and need to create a comfortable environment for their partner) AND the woman needs to take her pleasure seriously and set expectation for sexual enjoyment.

They also mention that in 2019 and 2018 combined 30% of fades went for TDs compared to 48% of all other routes. Even worse, 5.4% of fades were intercepted vs 2.7% for all other routes. (These stats are for within 5 yards of the goal line)

But we’ll need that draft capital because we have a lot of gaps we’ll need to fill this upcoming offseason. At DL (Cox final year on contract, Graham is starting to age and even Hargrave is losing some steam). Among DBs (Both Bradberry and Gardner-Johnson on final years of their deals). So we need to address edge, CB, and safety. And that’s just defensively.

On offense Miles Sanders is on his final year and Lane Johnson isn’t getting any younger. I could see us trying to work out a deal with Gardner-Johnson if he plays well, but as far as Cox, Bradberry, and Miles Sanders, this very well could be their last year on the team. 

If we want to address all of those needs, we’ll need to keep our draft picks.

33357,294528,294528,m16a,"So I recently moved to Miami for my wife's school and I wanna call out the sports fans in Miami and Bills fans in general being cool af. I found a local sports bar/grill jauwn a few mins from my place and rolled up, perfectly content to just chill at a table, have some snacks, and enjoy the game. I don't mind being solo (my wife cares almost zero for Eagles football and sports bars haha) so it was no bigs. No other Eagles fans in the place, but a surprisingly high number of Bills fans.

So they have both games on and the majority of the TVs (and the sound) are to the Bills game, totally cool with me, I don't mind not hearing. But I had a view at two smaller TVs and was just vibin with the night. And like 20 mins into being there, two of the Bills fans look over at me, see I'm wearing Eagles green, see no Eagles on above the bar, and motion and ask ""hey, do you have a view? is it on over behind us?"" And I told em yes, I can see. But they got the bartender to put it on on one of the bigger TVs right above the bar in front of them for me.

So a little while after, I went over in between the quarters or between scores and just said thanks for lookin out for a fellow fan of the game. And we all got to talk about how much Bills and Eagles fans have in common, how much I love Josh Allen and Diggs, and how much they all love Smitty and Hurts and how they think he's ""that dude"" So I ended up hangin with em away from my table and watching the game with a few guys.

I think many people assumed that since Hurts had played four years in college, he was pretty much a fully developed product w/no room to grow. 

* Uh, no. I remember McNabb's early years, he was a force of nature on Eagle offenses that didn't have much else in terms of weapons. Those early playoff years under Reid were a mix of Jim Johnson's defense starting to mature...but also McNabb basically dragging the offense with him by [being a run/pass super weapon](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/McNaDo00.htm). Folks who only saw McNabb after his broken leg, or not at all, I don't think fully understand how great he was when he was still able to run at 100%.

* Being old enough to have seen all three, my opinion is that Vick was the most athletically gifted QB we've ever had re: making ""how'd he do THAT?!?"" plays, Randall was the most revolutionary in terms of changing how to play QB...but pre-injury McNabb was the best overall QB in franchise history.
