8101,46199,46199,DudeAbides29,"Tons and tons of names to sift through. So my first thought is, can the story of the NFL be told without this player named?

It can’t be without Joe Thomas and DeMarcus Ware, so they are my first 2 submissions. Let’s go position by position to find the other 7…

QB: Steve McNair is very close, but given the limited amount of people we can enshrine, he misses the cut. 

RB: Shaun Alexander and Mike Alstott IMO were the premiere players in the backfield for a very long duration of time. Priest Holmes, CJ2K, and Jamal Lewis had excellent peak seasons, but didn’t sustain it long enough. 

WR: Hines Ward had several memorable playoff moments, it’s hard to tell the story of the greatest show on turf without Torry Holt… If Devin Hester doesn’t make the HOF no KR ever will. 

TE: Coates was an all decade player but I’m passing on all options. 

OL: Joe Thomas is a lock. 

DL: Dwight Freeney was the premiere pass rusher in the 2000s. As a Vikings fan I am very fond of Jared Allen and Kevin Williams. The latter may have done it long enough to deserve the recognition. 

LB: DeMarcus Ware is a lock. James Harrison may have the longevity to have a case. 

DB: Cam Chancellor’s career was cut short due to injury, but he played such a unique and impactful role in the Legion of Boom. 

K/P: If Shane Lechler can’t get in no punter ever will in the modern era. 

Final 9: Joe Thomas, DeMarcus Ware, Shaun Alexander, Mike Alstott, Devin Hester, Torry Holt,
