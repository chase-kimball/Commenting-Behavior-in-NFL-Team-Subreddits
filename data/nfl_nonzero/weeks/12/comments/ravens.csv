1. Reading what the defense is lining up in (man/zone/quarters/halves/etc)

4. Designed option plays to utilize his athleticism for big gains (half point to Lamar, half to Roman here).

>Yes, he could be more creative in the passing game. Whether that would make a difference with bad WRs and an inconsistent QB is a different discussion

I think that's literally the discussion that needs to happen. Roman **is** hamstrung by a lack of WR talent. Which is why he needs to get more creative to scheme them open. They don't have the route-running ability of Adams. They don't have the pure speed of Hill. 

That fake design run into TD pass for Likely during the Saints game was the most creative shit Roman has done in years, and both times we've used it, we've scored points on it because it keeps the defense guessing and allows receivers to capitalize on that confusion.

KD is going to be dropped in favor of keeping Gus/JK actually healthy. The FO still wants JK to be the lead back here and after the injury concerns, I feel like we could even look to get him on a very reasonable contract this off-season if he's able to come back and finish strong this off-season.

16997,106405,106405,Maaaat_Damon,"I’ll agree to a lot of those arguments, it’s not strictly wide receivers but I do think that’s a big issue. The fact that the jags marched down the field *and* got the two point conversion was insane. That defense has so much potential and can make the big plays but it can be all over the place.

For the last two SB I think the Bucs were the more well rounded team for sure but Brady’s receiving core was amazing that year too. Burrow definitely got fucked by that o-line and I think if that was fixed the Bengals get it. 

Chefs? I think the Chiefs are doing just as great if not better than when Tyreek was there because it’s forcing them to spread the love. The AFC championship I was at work and couldn’t watch and I was shocked when I saw the score. The Bills I think was also luck.

Phins? Haven’t been able to watch too closely but the defense seems to be an issue. But then again that offense is just putting up points like crazy, so who knows?

Only saw the highlights of yesterday for most games cause I was driving home (also I live in Indiana so no local market games for me 🤷‍♀️) probably for the better cause watching that live would’ve been too frustrating.

Browns? Fuck ‘em. Twice this year I wanted Brady to win and it still didn’t work. 

What do you think are the other bigger issues? Defense is there and I think will eventually work out the kinks but they need to get their shit together. I think we need a new OC and I’m worried of Lamar walking. Again, I also don’t believe a better wide receiver core is going to make things perfect but it could make us a more serious contender

27279,160474,160474,SuperSaiyanSandwich,"> Lamar is the better qb

Lamar has the higher ceiling, and I personally agree he's the better QB, but I think most of this sub would be surprised at the disparity in the average GMs view of Watson v Lamar. The way Watson was desperately bid for and the articles coming out at the time had GMs acting like he's a young Peyton Manning(he's obviously not). Deshaun's also a much more traditional fit for any scheme and thus naturally has a broader market appeal.

I think if people on this sub are expecting two full drafts they're going to be sorely disappointed if/when a trade occurs(not that we won't all be disappointed regardless of the return). No team is going to leave their roster construction that barren on top of paying a fully guaranteed top QB contract. Their window to a championship would instantly close so unless an owner forces a GMs hand to sell tickets I don't see that happening.

>and given London’s value instantly is worth less when he is drafted (like a used car)

I also disagree with this. Yes he's lost a year of control but how many first round picks have gloriously flamed out in their first year or so due to injuries or personal problems(Jamarcus Russell, Leaf, Kardarius Toney, etc). I don't know that I'd value Drake at the 8th overall pick still but I would view him as an asset comparable to a first round pick which essentially makes my demands 4 firsts and a second.",0.0,ravens,t3_z8wj69,False,0.0, :ELITE:,2022-11-30T13:39:29Z,ravens,0.0775136533191975

31500,177976,177976,ZombieFeedback,"***TL;DR*** Part of it is that the Ravens use more personnel groupings and more rotations on a per-game basis than almost any other offense, and those eat time, and in my opinion it is clearly past the point where it stops being helpful and starts being a problem. Part of it is that Greg, throughout his entire career, even when he didn't use those excessive substitutions, has always been slower than average when it comes to calling the play, the reasons for which are only known by Greg, Lamar, Kaep, and Tyrod.

To play devil's advocate: The Ravens make a lot of personnel switches. Not only do we use more different personnel groupings than most of the league(Discounting 2021 because of injuries and looking at 2020, the Ravens had four personnel groups that saw 100+ snaps. The Falcons and Browns were the only other teams to do similarly), we rotate a *lot* of players in and out; 20 Ravens have played at least 10% of the 2022 offensive snaps. The only teams with more are either terrible teams throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks(DEN, IND, CHI), teams who've had multiple QB injuries so reached that mark via 3-4 starting quarterbacks(MIA, NYJ, NO), or teams who have been absolutely destroyed by the injury bug this year. (LAR, WAS, LAC) Pretty much no other team is willfully choosing to rotate this many players in and out. This isn't injuries for us either since I know we've had a lot of those; of those 20 players, only JK, Gus, and Rashod are injury cases. We are choosing to involve as many members of the roster in our offense as possible.

In theory, this is a good idea. Changing personnel keeps the defense guessing, rotating in specialists lets you get favorable matchups, giving everyone a breather lets everyone stay fresh and rested, and zero roster spots are wasted on the bench. On-paper it is an excellent idea. Problem is it is a logistical nightmare; one play, your five skill position players are Andrews, Ricard, Drake, Robinson, and Proche. Next play, it's Andrews, Ricard, Justice, DJax, and Likely. Play after that it's Oliver, Ricard, Drake again, Robinson again, and Faalele who's in as an extra lineman. On and on and on. Unless you have the kind of precision where every single player knows to rotate and when - and basically only the Patriots and Bill Belichick have that kind of precision - those rotations are going to eat a lot of time as every player who's leaving gets the message, every player entering gets the message, and the players take the time to walk on and off the field. Not only does radioing all that in and executing it take time, but it is another thing that can go wrong, with extra players in the huddle or Lamar having to wave people off who are supposed to be on the sideline, further slowing the Ravens down when it comes to getting to the line.

Again, this is a really good idea in theory. It is an understandable impulse, and there is certainly nothing wrong with using a lot of rotations and substitutions. That said, the Ravens under Greg Roman clearly do it too much, as it is an active detriment to their offensive efficiency, both as a contributing factor in those pre-snap penalties, and by robbing their quarterback of the ability to adjust at the line. It's too much of a good thing, a perfect example of outsmarting yourself and getting too cute, and a good coach's response to that - especially after the bye week - should be to reduce substitutions and simplify. That has not been Greg's approach, as the Ravens had 16 players with double-digit snap counts against Carolina, and 17 against Jacksonville. Compare that to KC, Buffalo, Cincy, and Miami, who in their last two games - a total of eight games - have only exceeded 15 twice, in Chiefs-Rams and Fins-Texans. In spite of it clearly being past the point of diminishing returns, the response has been to at-best stay the course, and at-worst double down.

Also, for all this justifying and explaining, there's also the fact that Greg is just slow to get the play in. This has been an issue for his offenses all the way back to San Fran, and while he was subbing at a higher rate there, he wasn't doing so nearly as excessively as he is here. He has always taken an eternity to get the play in. Some people are slow talkers, some people take a minute because they're indecisive, some people are perfectionists who want to make sure they make the right decision, I don't know the specific reason, but it's been a problem for Greg even when he wasn't using these excessive substitutions.

If it were a one or two year thing I could understand, but it's been a thing for twelve years, and it's gotten to be a bigger thing as Greg's added more complexity and substitutions to the roster.",12.0,ravens,t3_z834ih,False,0.0, :19:,2022-11-29T20:42:42Z,ravens,-0.0005366173633269

31503,177981,177981,ZombieFeedback,"The thing is that Greg is in the room. The CBA puts very heavy limits on how much contact teams and players can have during the offseason. Lamar has some input, but he is not contractually allowed to engage with the front office on non-contractual football matters past a certain point. None of those limitations exist for Greg, and given he's designing the offense, it's doubtless that he *is* being asked for input when Harbs and DeCosta are deciding what to add to the roster since he needs to know what to expect when he starts drawing things up. It's not all Greg's fault that we have no WRs or healthy RBs, but he definitely shoulders some blame for John and Eric believing the offense would be fine with paper-thin depth at WR and no RBs in camp other than Mike Davis. All the tight-ends, the run-focused offensive line, this offense is built in the image of what Greg's system has historically wanted. That doesn't happen without him telling the front office what's on his scheme's shopping list. Lamar might get asked some questions, but again, how much input he can have is contractually limited. Greg is in the room on draft night. Neither one is directly responsible for the personnel decisions, but one has *much* more influence on those decisions.

Also, I honestly question how much credit Greg's running scheme actually deserves, because Lamar's legs are the only reason it's working.

In 2019, if you subtract Lamar's contributions running the football and only focus on the halfbacks, the Ravens went from #1 in yards per game to #8. Do it again for 2020, and they're #9. Do the same thing this year? #29. It's not a matter of distribution either, if you focus on yards per carry, the 2022 Ravens drop from #2 to #16. On a per-carry basis, we've got the league average in the backfield. Sure, a big part of that is a diminished group of halfbacks, but this is supposed to be Greg's bread-and-butter, the place he's supposed to be the best of the best capable of making something from nothing, so far above everyone else that it makes up for all of his passing inefficiencies. Four of his five starting linemen are healthy, as are his fullback and blocking TE. Lamar's legs still scare the shit out of every single defensive player in the league. Everything else is there, if Greg really is a run game wizard capable of making something from nothing, why are his halfbacks only effective when he has all-decade rushers like Frank Gore or Shady McCoy, or when he has three thousand-yard backs to rotate between in Gus, JK, and Ingram? Why isn't he churning out thousand-yarders out of nowhere like James Robinson and Austin Ekeler and Elijah Mitchell? Why is the only reason his offense is ranked anywhere above ""Average at-best"" because he has a quarterback almost as elusive as Barry Sanders?

31504,177982,177982,ZombieFeedback,"Pre-snap reads are absolutely crucial to an effective offense, especially an effective passing game, and *especially* when you've got a bunch of practice squad players at WR making the margin for error so small. A really good receiver can win even when he and the QB miss something about the coverage just by being that athletic and abusing the inherent advantages offensive players have over defensive players. (Making a cut on an in route you know you're going to make is a lot easier than switching from a full-speed backpedal to running horizontally at a second's notice because the Olympic sprinter you're trying to keep up with sold the deep angle before breaking inside)

People talk about how Brady was able to win Superbowls with nothing but Gronk and a bunch of tiny white dudes from DII schools, but a big part of that was that Brady read the field masterfully, knew who was going to be open and how the defense was going to attack him, and could adjust the playcall to compensate. I'm not saying Lamar is on that level - Brady at that point had about ten years more experience than Lamar after all - but I am saying that every time we see him frantically clapping to try and get the snap off before the penalty, we are watching him lose one of the biggest tools to make this offense work, to say nothing of how out-of-sync it leaves him and his receivers once the ball *is* snapped",26.0,ravens,t3_z7w0je,False,0.0, :19:,2022-11-29T10:17:14Z,ravens,-0.233138671875

Furthermore, he’s failed to fire Greg Roman, who is calling dogshit plays week in week out. Greg could be harbaughs fall guy - and i hope he goes - but honestly harbaugh needs to go too.

2 wins in the playoffs since the Super Bowl win, we’ve given him 10 years and he’s produced 2 playoff wins. This is like the 3rd or 4th lowest in the NFL for a team that’s consistently in playoff contention.

43605,254285,254285,ripthisaccount6,"Apple rots at the core…

You wonder why teams like the Falcons and ravens choke games all the time and the chiefs, Steelers, bills, patriots never do? It’s how you coach the players and the culture you instill. 

Harbaugh is probably soft after these comebacks and has a “well get em next time attitude” - which never happens.

Personally I think harbaugh has to go if we don’t go anywhere in the playoffs.

He’s had 10 years since the super bowl win and has produced 2 playoff wins and 4 playoff losses, which is one of the worst win % in the league for some coaches.

Not only that, harbaugh is claimed to be a “regular season god” but you can list at least 10 games in the past 5 years that hes blown away, just in the last 2 years:

- 2021 Steelers failed 2pt conversion
- 2021 packers 2pt conversion
- 2021 rams 4th&5 blown lead
- 2021 raiders 14pt blown lead
- 2021 Steelers (2nd game) Blown lead & OT loss. 
- 2022 dolphins 21 point blown lead
- 2022 bills 17 point blown lead 
- 2022 giants 10 point 4th quarter blown lead
- 2022 Jaguars 9 point 4th quarter blown lead.

Those are 9 games where IMO we should’ve at least not choked 5 or 6 of them. We should’ve really only lost 3 of those 9 at worst. But somehow we lost them all.

46781,266727,266727,teb1987,"He has pass catching TEs, FB, and RBs. If this offense was run optimally you don't need #1 WRs to make it work. You just need WRs.

First thing first, RBs need to stop dancing in the backfield like they're the second coming of Leveon Bell and just hit a hole and pick up 2-3 yds. Lamar is already a threat to run behind the line, teams are either straight up just coming after him or containing him. A RB dancing in the backfield gets himself caught in whatever was coming for Lamar and takes away the advantage we get from Lamar's dual threat. This is why Gus and JK run so well.

Our success with screens and hitting flats is abysmal. We don't do enough to leverage the defense to make the wrong read or freeze them. We will often run routes to the same side but the spacing is so close the defender you're trying to leverage can play both routes. We rarely have a true under route to leverage defenders.

We should have a lot more 1 on 1 looks and purely open TEs/RBs/FB on just about every single passing play. They are double teaming Andrews and accounting for Lamar.. we should either be able to find large gaps at the line or find an open receiver wherever Andrews isn't.

Some of this has been Lamar missing reads or just keying on a target, but more often than not it's scheme and play call. Fundamentally, it is purely on Roman. There are HS teams with more complex route trees than Roman builds into his offense. The man can draw a run play up wonderfully but he really drops the ball when trying to build a passing game on top of the run game.

We should really have a run formation with RB/FB/2TE/WR with 5 different runs/sweeps and at least 5 more passes out of the same formation. Literally could run a whole drive out of one formation and just take what the defense gives you at the line and not target the same guy twice and run the ball with 3-4 different ball carriers.",4.0,ravens,t3_z7w712,False,0.0, :SHADES:,2022-11-29T15:13:47Z,ravens,0.0068303097971308

You would hope to make an impact with the trade since we aren't really in a rebuild situation, so the teams in the NFC with multiple picks next year would be the Seahawks and the Saints (Eagles too but they arent going to be high picks and they are probably okay with Hurts)

I would assume we would stick with Huntley for the short term..

So I would take the Seahawks 2 first rounders.. one looks to be a top 5, then give me Metcalf (maybe Lockett) and their LT Cross or CB Burns
