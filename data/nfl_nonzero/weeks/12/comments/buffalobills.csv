I'm in agreement here.

But I'm saying Milano went from great to what seems like elite. 

Not going to say I've watched every minute of every game, but it really feels to me that there isn't a better off ball linebacker in the entire league than Milano this year

Whilst Edmunds's change with the DL improvements has gone from average to good

>Warner has always played in front of talented DL's in San Fran

He has played great even whenever Bosa was injured, and after they traded Buckner (whose replacement is perennially injured).

19842,136221,136221,PoogeneBalloonanny,">Milano is insanely valuable to this offense, but they also play 2 different positions. Just because they're both LB's doesn't mean they are interchangeable

Agree with that yes, but less so what you said after:

* Milano plays sam/will to Edmunds's mike (agree)
* Milano's positions aren't more or less valuable than Edmunds's mike, much so like Oliver/Phillips's 3-tech to Von's edge IMO (but I can let this point slide)
* Ultimately they both fill (respective) gaps in the run game, they both blitz and Milano has even greater coverage responsibilities (which you alluded to)

**That aside, I do feel like you have to factor** ***both*** **how good a player is and how important his position is as an aggregate** 

**We all agree that QB >>> WR but is Cousins really that much more valuable than Justin Jefferson?**

* And my point is that Milano is so much better (at his perceived to be less valuable position) that his overall value is more than Edmunds
* For what it's worth, in the 2 games Edmunds missed recently Dodson filled in at mike vs the Browns which was bad, Milano actually played mike vs Detroit which surprised even me with how much better that was

Also, Taron is a good but not elite nickel corner IMO Kenny Moore pre this year, Nate Hobbs, prime Desmond King are elite nickel corners

I understand that one of Edmunds's biggest contributions is that he is just this rangy big obstacle over the middle in the passing game which Milano doesn't do that in his position and isn't asked to do likely because of his physical profile

But my point was that Milano had always shone for us, showing he was less reliant on a strong DL than Edmunds is, who is only shining this year.

2 - You keep playing what ifs with Allen's injury when there is no basis for it. Team doctors cleared him AND he was a full participant this week. I'll trust those doctors over a Reddit user.

2 - I'm not sure what you are watching where you say ""Josh Allen is regressing"". Has he struggled for the past 4 weeks, yes? Prior to that he was far and away the front runner for NFL MVP. He will be fine.
 
 
3 - Ruin his career because of his elbow? Countless physicians that analyzed Allen's elbow said that playing through it was dependent on pain tolerance, not further injury. Even if he did tear it, both Drew Brees and Matt Stafford came back from that injury without issue.
 
 
4 - The Bills went 2-0 in a 5 day span without being able to fully practice while decimated by injuries with both games on the road. Both games were close, yes, but other contenders have delt with the same. Go re-watch the Chiefs Rams game and told me they won by ""enough"". Further, the Bills have a larger average margin of victory against below .500 teams than the Chiefs and Dolphins.

A far majority of NFL stadium do NOT host events outside of football. It’s very rare. NBA/NHL stadiums host other events. Buffalo has a decent NHL stadium that can host whatever national touring event wanted to come to Buffalo.

For example here are the list of events scheduled at US Bank:

https://www.usbankstadium.com/events 

A high school playoff which The Ralph/Rich/Oh Hi Mark 👋🏽 can host. 
Taylor Swift which would go downtown to HSBC
Ed Sheeran which would go downtown to HSBC
Luke Combs ditto
Monster Jam ditto. 

So in 365 days the stadium will be used for 8 Vikings games and 5 other events. 

NFL stadiums do not, far and wide, host other events. I’ve lived in the DC are for 20 years we have 1/15th of the NFL stadiums (Commies and Ravens). I have gone to an event at an NFL stadium maybe 4 times.

 NHL/NBA stadiums are made more modularly where you can move seating and floor space around. NFL stadiums, are a difficult venues to work with and the teams don’t like people on their playing surface. 

So it’s worse than what you said it’s a multibillion money laundering scheme to put money in the hands of owners through luxury boxes, the NFL gets a cut through the general seating and the community gets maybe 20 days of usage out of 365 days.",26.0,buffalobills,t3_z5rasj,False,0.0,clap,2022-11-27T06:35:54Z,buffalobills,-0.0466964284104444
