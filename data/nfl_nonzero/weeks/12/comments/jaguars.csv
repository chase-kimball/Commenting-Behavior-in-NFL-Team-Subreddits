Sometimes players exchange jerseys with each other, but I‚Äôve never seen them give them to the fans. There was a classic Coke ad from the ‚Äò70s where Mean Joe Green gives his jersey to a kid for a soda and I think that‚Äôs the last time I‚Äôve seen it happen.

If you get to the South End Zone by 11:00, they‚Äôll let you in to see the players warm up. Get to the West tunnel and they‚Äôll sign when they‚Äôre done. After the game, hang out on the West side of the stadium and stay inside the gates. A 14 year old asking nicely should get loads of ink.
