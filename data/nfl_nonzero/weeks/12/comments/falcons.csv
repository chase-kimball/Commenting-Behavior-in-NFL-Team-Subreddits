Same thing happened to Ryan last year against the Bills, he scrambled and appeared to score a TD, but was ruled to have given himself up going in and was down on the 1/2 yard line, despite no one touching him before he reached the endzone.

* 2nd Half passer rating this season: 96.9
* Passer Rating when time in pocket <2.5 seconds: 99.0
* Passer Rating when time in pocket >2.5 seconds: 56.9

Seems that Ryan and the Colts are making halftime adjustments that work at least somewhat. However, if his receivers don't get open right away, he has trouble getting anything done. Ryan's sack percentage when he has >2.5 seconds in the pocket is 13.9% (unsurprising with an older pocket passer).

I could be very off base, but it seems that the Colts should focus on running more with Taylor and work mainly with timing routes when throwing.
