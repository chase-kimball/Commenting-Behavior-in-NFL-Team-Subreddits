There IS such a thing as administrative tanking. Earlier in the year it could be argued that's what the Panthers were doing. Got rid of Robby Anderson and CMC in like two weeks.

There IS NOT such a thing as coaches and players tanking. This largely has to do with their own job security. Now, a team may give up on a coach. That's different. But to lose games just to have a better draft position for next year? Nah.

This is what we've seen with the Panthers. Every QB has suffered through a high ankle sprain. We've traded players away. Fired the coach. And Wilks and them boys won't give up. Looks like they're trying to 2014 this thing and sneakily win the division.
