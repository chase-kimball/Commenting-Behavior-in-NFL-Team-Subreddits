8017,59618,59618,Hit_The_Kwon,"This was exactly my thinking. Obviously video games are different, but the amount of games you can play in comparison to what a coach sees is insane. Playing madden wouldn’t make you a good play designer, but you could get a good understanding of situational football. For example, when to call a timeout, when to go for it, things like that. 

I had a game the other day similar to Noah where I was up one, three minutes left in the game, 4th down from my 20~. I figured I should go for it because if I punt it away, they can run the clock out and they just need a FG and I won’t have much time to respond, or if I don’t get it (I actually failed my 4th down attempt) then they won’t be able to run much time off and I’ll have time to push up the field and score. Gave up a field goal, and then I got a FG with barely any time to win it.

And this thinking has come from thousands of matches over 15~ years. I play about 10-12 games a week every week. You pick up on some things some coaches wouldn’t. It’s clear our staff doesn’t have a game manager/analytics person.

11445,75358,75358,Kreynard54,">Other teams run on first down a lot as well but the difference there is they can actually run the ball. that's not a coach's fault. That's our players fault.

Im not a coach, but ill simplify this for you as a college football player who spent time on sidelines after my career was over. If im a coach, and see that statistically we are the worst team in the league running on first down, and am constantly putting the team in second in long, its because I as a coach am not putting my players in a position to succeed. That could be by design, or it could be because im predictable which is the likely scenario. Even acknowledging injuries to our line in mind, we are not doing well enough to stick with the same mentality of run on 1st. The definition of insanity in this sport is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. 

Using common sense, I would know they're loading up for the run and hit them with play action to keep them on their toes and open up the run. When you become predictable, you don't score, you dont move the ball efficiently, and you have 5 straight 3 and outs. Here's the statistics, and you can verify them. 

**Currently, we pass the ball 66% of the time. 34% of the time we run,** 

**Out of the 34% of runs, we run the ball on first down around 80% of the time.** 

**Over 4 out of 5 running plays are on first down in total per game. That leaves an average of 1 running play between 2nd, 3rd and 4th down.** 

**That also means theirs an 80% chance we will pass on 2nd, 3rd, or 4th down.** 

**Defenses can predict whats going to happen or at least have a really solid idea.** 

**That would put us consistently in 2nd and long situations which lessens our playbook and makes us more predictable to pass.** 

Im spitting facts, your speculating the feelings of people. The difference between you and I, is that you seem to think that football isnt a chess match. It very much is, and our coaches suck at chess. I dont disagree that our team ISNT a power house like previous years, I do believe at this point though that are coaching is incompetent.",2.0,buccaneers,t3_z6fwn9,False,0.0,:RedJersey69: Nice,2022-11-28T09:50:58Z,buccaneers,0.0058673588336218

- Bowles had the offense try and draw the defense offsides on a 4th and 2, then took the delay of game instead of using a TO...And instead of kicking a 55yd FG (before the delay of game), had to punt. 

- Insane usage of first down runs, resulting in a ton of second and longs

- Terrible quick game on offense - when its not a run, its a screen or a deep shot. Unless its third down, and then the WRs run a quick out

- Terrible clock management with using no time outs when the Browns were in scoring position (before they scored) or using the timeouts after a first down screen with 30 seconds left. 

- Barely any PA usage outside of their TD drives, where they used PA heavily

At one point, the Bucs had a 1st and 20 and I was **surprised** that they didn't run the ball, because they've done it at least 2 other times this season.
