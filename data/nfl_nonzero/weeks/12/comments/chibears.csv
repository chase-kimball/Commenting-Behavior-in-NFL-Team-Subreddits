You just answered your own question regarding the 0-16 browns. So what? They still can get a good player at that spot. And just cause they were 0-16, doesn't mean there is a large gap between them and the 2nd worse team, because football only has 17 regular games and is probably the only sport where the lesser roster has a shot to win every game.

13108,65083,65083,Er0ck619,"Overall I think the class grades around a C+/B-. 

Gordon = C. Gordon’s play has been uninspiring  and he’s looked lost and slow at times on the field. We use Kyle Fuller as an example but for every Fuller there’s always a Conte or Justin Gilbert. Not sold but not giving up either. We’ll see next year with a revamped front.

Jaquan Brisker = B. Good instincts. Strong tackling. Room for growth but his biggest impact might have been the resurrection of Eddie Jackson. Easily our best pick. 

VJJ = F. A WR room begging for a game changer got one. Unfortunately for us he changed the game for the worst. If he was worth a damn I doubt we pull the trigger on Claypool. Another reason why Gordon over Pickens is tough to swallow. Considering last years cap situation and this upcoming lack of FA WR talent (Poles justification for the Claypool trade) it would have made sense to address it early last draft. Hindsight will always be 20/20 though. This VJJ pick just seemed like it had repercussions. 

Jones = B-  Not sure if he “won” any sort of camp battle but it’s been great to see him rise to the opportunity. He gets a chance at starting next year but he needs to bulk up and they need to bring in competition. 

DRob = C. Lots of athletic potential. If we’re being honest though this may be the most game playing time he’ll have in his career and it’d be nice to see him make some plays and be a consistent disrupter. Quality depth. Not a starter next year. 

Gill = B. Some more hang time would be nice and to see teams pinned deep more often. 

Ebner = D. Just a body so far. Next year expect  Herbert and two of the following Monty/FA/draft pick. 

Doug Kramer = C.  Giving this kid an honorary C grace cause there’s no way he’s worse than Mustipher.

In previous discussions, I went back and looked at his various draft profiles.  The Athletic had a fairly long write up on him that was probably the best.  Consensus is he has good instincts and play diagnosis, but he lacks athleticism and is a liability in pass coverage.  Plays slower than his 4.7 40 time.  Some of the instincts and diagnosis can cover up the lack of athleticism, but the margin of error gets a lot smaller when you're less athletic than the guy you're trying to cover, and you might be cooked regardless if you're going against someone elite.  Plays the run between the tackles well and is less of a liability on run downs, but he's probably a career backup (which is not necessarily a bad thing) unless he somehow improves his athleticism and speed.

>\- Selected Kevin White with the 7th overall pick in his first draft


That's just bad luck


>\- Traded up for Leonard Floyd in his second draft.


Floyd was a really good football player, he just never had the sack production. I never hated the pick like everyone else (theres my hot take)


>\- Made one of the worst free agent signings in NFL history by signing Mike Glennon. Glennon has played nine seasons in the NFL and more than half of his career earnings are from the 2017 season when he started 4 games. He made $16 million in 2017.


Bad signing, but far from the worst signings in history.


>\- Orchestrated one of the worst draft day trades in NFL history when he traded up to select Mitch Trubisky. He surrendered draft capital and passed on two superstar QBs. Two of the draft picks he traded away eventually ended up being Alvin Kamara and Fred Warner.


Agree 100%, this was his biggest offense (and it was a big one)


>\- Selected Adam Shaheen in the 2nd round of the same draft that he selected Mitch Trubisky.


Agree 100%


>\- Paid Andy Dalton $10 million in free agency sandwiched in between two seasons when Andy Dalton was paid $3 million.


Minor offense, it was a 1 year deal for a bridge qb that was  needed to save his and nagys ass. I get it.


>\- Traded a 4th round pick for Nick Foles.


His contract was the real fuck up, not the 4th. And, he had a championship defense and a shit qb, he had to do something. He was getting a scheme fit for nagy (little did he know, no qb was a scheme fit because nagys scheme was ass)


>\- Left the organization devoid of cap space and draft capital at the time of his firing.

I don’t love it but that’s the only angle I can think of where I get it. I guess my only other thought is they knew Jenkins was so raw they wanted film of a veteran OG for him to watch too for technique/scheme reasons.
