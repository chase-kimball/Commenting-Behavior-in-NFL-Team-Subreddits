Defense has had amazing games this year. 

I have a feeling that we are underperforming due to bad coaching (worst turnover margin in the NFL by far, tons of penalties, conservative playcalling), bad luck (lots of injuries and unbelievable key plays not in our favor) and obviously bad QBs.

So we have two option now. We either trade most of that talent for picks, clean the cap for a year or two, and hope to start from scratch in 2 or 3 years. Or we trust that we're close to being competitive, and try to fix what's wrong.  Like changing tires with the car moving.

Dennis Allen and Carmichael as HC and OC looks like a huge mistake. 

We sent CJGJ (fans loved him) to the Eagles for peanuts picks just to overpay Matthieu and also bring Maye. Now CJGJ is a Safety and leads the league in INTs. 

We also went hyper aggressive trading up this year for a tackle and a WR. It's one thing doing this with Brees and Payton and being a SB contender. But this year it was obvious we could suck (and we do). Now the best team in NFC is sitting on a Top 10 or maybe even Top 5 pick, that we could've used to get a much needed QB. 

We also had controversial 1st round picks recently. Davenport is pretty good, but we also traded 2 firsts to get him. Payton Turner seemed like a reach and is always injured. Ruiz was horrible for 2 seasons, but this one gets a pass because he pulled a miracle from his ass and is our best OL this year. 

So basically, we got a fan base that was spoiled for 15 years and now will have to watch a bad team for at least 2 or 3 years, and Loomis is in part to blame for.

This is on top of having to spend almost 10 more years as an assistant than white assistant coaches.

Direct quotes from a black offensive coordinator regarding the hiring process:

‚ÄúWhen I got my first job, I interviewed with the coaching staff to work as a scout,‚Äù explained one of the few Black offensive coordinators who has interviewed for a head coaching job. ‚ÄúWhen I joined the coaching staff, I interviewed with the offensive coordinator to make sure I understood the offense. But if I want to be a head coach, you have to interview with people who never played in the league and don‚Äôt really know anything about football. They‚Äôre just looking for someone who they think is smart. Well, what‚Äôs smart? Someone who talks like them and acts like them. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt like Black coaches‚Äîat least I don‚Äôt think they know they do. But if you look at who gets the jobs, it‚Äôs white kids who grew up in skyboxes and went on vacations with the same people who are doing the hiring. It‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs just one good ol‚Äô boy‚Äôs club and you gotta know the secret handshake. It‚Äôs a network of good ol‚Äô boys who grew up playing golf at all the good ol‚Äô boys club, so [the owners] feel comfortable with another good ol‚Äô boy!‚Äù",2.0,nfl,t3_z6orkc,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2022-11-28T00:51:31Z,saints,0.067965052859019

Davenport is Cam Jordan lite. Bigger, younger, but a little less consistent against the run and doesn't finish pass rushes as well as Cam. He's still impactful at edge but he's the king of ""almost sacks"". In a vacuum I'd be more willing to re-sign him but him being an edge rusher balloons his market, so I think he's priced out.

- I could just say ü¶∂üî´‚öúÔ∏è and that would be succinct but I'll keep going.

- We had a chance to make it a one score game with 10 minutes to play but then point number 1.

- Another chance to make it a one score game with 6 minutes to play but point number 1. Two drops and two whiffs in pass pro by Hurst.

- RedZone playcalling continues to be atrocious. Absolutely embarrassing.

- Great to see Taylor's ball skills but of course it was undone by point 1.

- Olave is an elite route runner and I have 0 regrets about the trade.

- Cesar Ruiz's All-Pro play has severely overshadowed  how Ramczyk is easily having the worst year of his career so far.

- Run defense looked better than they have of late. Wish the pass rush could balance that out by getting some sacks.

- With Roby back and Lattimore getting healthy I think I've had enough helpings of Chris Harris.

- I trust Lutz more from 50+ or with a chance to win/tie than I do from <50 with a chance to cut the lead right now.

- We are so predictable when we're not actually planning on running a play on 4th down. We're 4-7 and have trailed for most of game time and we've only actually gone for it 8 times all year.

- One day we'll force a turnover and *not* get it called back. Hopefully before my kid who hasn't been conceived yet gets their drivers license.

- Our players' feet look like Swiss cheese because of how often point number 1 happens.

- If I had a dollar for every time point 1 happened in a game this season I'd have enough money to buy an NFL team full of players with Swiss cheese for feet.

-  Our coaching staff is so conservative we should check where they were on January 6th.

- That last drive that started in 49ers territory was some ref bs.

- Winning the battle for field position does fuck all if you can't get points and you can't win the time of possession battle.

- Offense gotta start taking some early chunks on possessions. Get some rhythm going. Need to get some time of possession. Our D is gonna start wearing down.

- OL has been mostly good.

- If we could stop giving the ball away whenever we get moving that'd make me so happy.

- Defense playing a great ""bend don't break"" game. Pass rush needs to win battles a bit quicker.

- There's no killer instinct in this team. Can't finish pass rushes. Can't generate takeaways. Can't take advantage of good field position.

- When Werner comes back that means Elliss takes over whatever snaps Baun would get which is a double positive.

- Gillikin with a strong half.

- Last week we did a great job of adjusting at halftime. Need to do the same this week.

27315,248191,248191,myxanders,"Mahomes is more talented, has had a higher peak, and plays a much more exciting and athletic game. Mahomes makes the hard stuff look easy.

I'd argue that at times Mahomes makes the normal stuff look harder than it needs to be. Brees was so precise and methodical about the fundamental QB skillset that he made the normal stuff look so boring and simple when that isn't the case at all. And he did it for the better part of two decades.

Brees could put the ball in the exact spot it needed to be - short or long throw, pre-noodle arm or during noodle arm era - it was on target with anticipation.

Mahomes gets the yardage and the scores based off raw arm talent and playmaking ability. Brees got similar production based off of precision. It's two different skillsets, and both are very beautiful to watch and appreciate.
