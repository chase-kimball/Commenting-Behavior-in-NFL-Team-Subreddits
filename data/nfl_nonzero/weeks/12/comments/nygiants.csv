This is exactly why I don't get why people just want to trash Jones and draft a new QB. You think a mid-late first round rookie is going to do better behind a decimated O-Line and throwing to practice squad level recievers? 

Forcing a QB to consistently run for his life and throw into tight windows on every play will be great for their development and definitely won't set them up for failure... 

Jones may not be on Mahomes or Burrow level as a QB, but he will be the best option for the Giant's QB position next season. My only hope is that we don't overpay for him.",1.0,nygiants,t3_z4hpy1,False,0.0,:Saquadsflair:,2022-11-25T22:24:37Z,nygiants,0.0995962191358024

I hear what you are saying.  Eli put up some solid numbers.  On the other hand, you have to adjust for the era.  [12 of the top 15](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/hof/hofm_QB.htm) QB's played in the 80s or later, as an example.  

Also, as I mentioned, here are Eli's peers and the number of Pro Bowl selections:

* Peyton (14)
* Brees (13)
* Favre (11)
* Rodgers (10)
* Wilson (9)
* Rivers (8)
* Roethlisberger (6)

I know it's hard to remember but there were years when people would legitimately pick guys like Joe Flacco or Daunte Culpepper or Tony Romo or Cam Newton over Eli.  And honestly, it wasn't an outrage.

I'm hoping he gets in because of his playoff performances more than anything else.
