When the law was first brought in it was to stop kickers who were getting absolutely drilled or people recklessly diving at them and destroying their plant leg. 

Because it's subjective what hurt a falling player to a plant leg or hitting them in mid air can do, the way the rule is implemented now is basically if any meaningful contact happens at all. It's basically a zero tolerance policy.

So nowadays most of the flags are for situations just like you saw.
