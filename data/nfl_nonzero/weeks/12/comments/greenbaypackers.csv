12767,80427,80427,Goodbye_Hercules,"1. More film to evaluate Love, if this is in fact Rodgers' last season (very unlikely imo due to Rodgers' contract). If he's the guy, you pick up his 5th-year option; if he's not, you roll with him and tank for Caleb Williams in 2024, if not Young or Stroud this year

2. If/when we're eliminated, Rodgers gets a head start on rehabbing his thumb/possibly getting surgery. We also might get a top 5 pick depending on how Love/the defense finish the season (see above)

3. If Love plays well, it raises his trade value. He probably would've gone for a 4th, maybe a 3rd, at the start of the year; now he could turn into a 2nd + both of those, and possibly more if it's a really desperate team. This makes building for Rodgers' last run in '23 & '24 (and beyond if he restructures) a lot easier depending on what we do with Gary/Elgton/Amos/Bakhtiari/Smith/Savage this offseason",3.0,nfl,t3_z97yik,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers :Packers: Packers,2022-11-30T19:53:34Z,greenbaypackers,0.048512754869461

LG: Don Barclay—Dollar Tree Elgton

C: EDS maybe? He wasn't bad, just got sandwiched between Wells and Tretter who were both quality starters

RG: Royce Newman—already got bullrushed by a blitzing LB and whiffed on a basic stunt in the time it took me to type this

RT: Jason Spriggs—was supposed to develop behind Brian Bulaga, Iowa but had godawful footwork and never developed proper technique IIRC.

Capers had his overly complicated fire zones and disguised coverages; Pettine liked his dime and quarter personnel, even in short yardage situations; and now Barry is running an uber-soft version of the Fangio/Staley Cover 4 shell. Meanwhile, all the top defenses of the past 5+ years were built on stopping the run: 2017 Vikings/Eagles/Jags, 2018 Bears/Patriots, 2019 49ers, 2020 Rams/Bucs, 49ers/Jets this year, just to name a few. Their run-stopping ability reinforced their pass defenses—they could also get after the QB, routinely jam WRs at the line, and make big hits/tackles to force punts & FGs

Remember when Saleh challenged his team to keep giving us body blows at halftime because he knew we couldn't hang with them? When was the last time a Packers DC, let alone *coach*, got hyped and talked about punching the other guys in the mouth like that every week?

We need to bring in someone like Fangio/Flores/Zimmer—someone who's experienced enough to facilitate a philosophy/culture change. I like Jim Leonhard, and I'm not opposed to him being our next DC, but I'm not sure he's what we need right now (that and I'd love it if Fickell can keep him at Wisconsin somehow)

Honestly though? Love looked *good* tonight.
