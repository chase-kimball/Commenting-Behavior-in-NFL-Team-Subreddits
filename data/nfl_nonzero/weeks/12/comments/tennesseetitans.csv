There was that stretch from like 2009-2015 when both the Jags and Titans were bad and would split the season series pretty much every year, but yeah it was mostly Titans before then and has been all Titans since then.

Maybe the single biggest improvement in wins each year the Titans have made since the Fisher/Munchack/Wisenhunt era is that they can finally sweep divisional opponents. From 2009-2016 the Titans did not sweep a single team in the division, even though all three other teams in the AFC South fielded some absolutely horrific teams. The Colts, Jags, and Texans all had 2-14 teams during that stretch, and one of the two wins for all three of those teams were the Titans. In the stretch from 2011-2015 when the Jags went a combined 22-74, 27% of those wins were against the Titans.

Favorite: Roger McCreary

Sorry Stonehouse, but I’m giving my vote to McCreary. I also thought about NPF for this one since he’s filled a hole in our roster well ahead of schedule and surpassing expectations already. However, McCreary has been a stud. When we drafted him, I’m sure most of us were disappointed because we thought the CB position has been all but solidified because we were getting Farley back (woof). But he’s been a DAWG, he’s making plays, he’s all over the field, and he’s arguably been our best corner this year. Shoutout NPF, Stonehouse and Burks for this answer. 16 just needs to stay on the field and be consistent and this answer could change before the year is over. Although McCreary’s play so far might not allow me to change this answer.

Most disappointing: Theo Jackson 

It might be easy for some of you to say Malik here. But the reality is that he wasn’t supposed to see the field for this season. He’s rawer than sushi, and his play has shown at times. However he isn’t a disappointment, he has certainly shown flashes and nearly beat the Chiefs in ARROWHEAD this season, and if not for questionable playcalling he might’ve even won that game. So it feels a bit unfair to pin the disappointment label on him. So I’ll go ahead and throw the disappointment label to the guy who couldn’t make the roster. Hell, he wasn’t really even in the conversation with the carousel of safety depth we’ve endured this season.

Underrated? Haskins. He has been so good on special teams, and he continues to grow at the RB position. He should be RB2 next season.",29.0,tennesseetitans,t3_z5hlst,False,0.0,:Titans:,2022-11-26T15:32:05Z,tennesseetitans,0.0019301097396555
