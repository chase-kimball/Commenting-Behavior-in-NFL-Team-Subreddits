Payne has missed one game in his career.  Mathis hasn't finished one game yet.  

Think of how many draft picks you never hear of after a few years.  You take the sure thing here with Payne.  The odds were already against Mathis before his injury to be more than a JAG, and now if he works out at all while on his rookie deal, you're happy for some depth.  

I'm 100% on team re-sign Payne.  How often does this team go out to sign players to play them to their weakness like a William Jackson, but then we have this chance to sign a durable guy that is a perfect fit for what we already do at an elite level and we're going to pinch pennies???  

We don't win the Jacksonville game without him batting down 2 third down passes, and we may not win yesterday if he doesn't bat that pass for Fuller.  This isn't even mentioning his TFL, his pressures, and his sacks.  Before Sweat's sack yesterday, who was it that sliced through a double team to get the TFL to make ATL pass?  Yup, Payne.

The Off-White x Air Jordan 5 ‚ÄúSail‚Äù is the follow-up to Virgil Abloh‚Äôs initial Jordan 5 collaboration from early 2020. Images of the ‚ÄúSail‚Äù colorway surfaced around the same time Off-White and Jordan Brand released the black-based Jordan 5 in February 2020. Like the black version, this design features Abloh‚Äôs singular deconstructed aesthetic. The upper displays exposed foam, mesh detailing, and a transparent film with die-cut circles placed randomly on the body and tongue in reference to the Jordan 2010. Off-White‚Äôs signature industrial inspired styling is applied throughout, including the Helvetica text on the laces and medial side. Both the embroidered Jumpman on the silver reflective tongue and ‚Äú23‚Äù branding on the heel are finished off in Fire Red as a call back to the original styling of Michael Jordan‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlayer Exclusive‚Äù version. Additional nostalgic elements like the ‚ÄúNike Air‚Äù on the heel and pre-yellowed outsole give the shoe a vintage look. Release date: October 24, 2020.‚Äù

The majority of the shoe is off-white, but the color I‚Äôm calling out is described by the shoemaker as ‚Äúpre-yellowed‚Äù. Why are you calling that an off-white?",1.0,commanders,t3_z6znph,False,0.0,Fuck Dan Snyder,2022-11-29T08:32:24Z,commanders,0.0004998354160355

But with B-Rob healthy, and factoring in Henicke‚Äôs limitations, Scott Turner‚Äôs approach is to run the ever loving hell out of the ball. It allows us to win the time-of-possession battle and sets Heinicke up with manageable third downs. When he does throw, Heinicke only has eyes for Terry, TEs, or RBs in the flat.

As others have noted, we have a QB who rarely exceeds 200 yards a game. 50-100 of those are going to Terry, and rightfully so. Until we get a QB capable of slinging it 40 times a game, expect more of the same.

- Nike jersey (Reebok were still the manufacturer during Sean's time)

- Reebok tights (got this right, I guess)

- Adidas soccer cleats

All on top of it being a wire mannequin thing you wouldn't see in a low end department store.

It looks like and feels like a kids school project they had to throw together over the weekend with random things from an old stock room.

It had been reported Sean's family helped with the merch line and mural but nothing as far as the mannequin is concerned. Closest I could find was Sean's daughter liking the cleats, which were a thoughtful touch. Wish we got a real statue, but that's just me

edit: did some more digging, the family did not design the memorial. This post is false. https://twitter.com/scott7news/status/1596998655982022656?s=46&t=7Ce-jhL4DXpxVuwvA4geHg",10.0,commanders,t3_z707kf,False,0.0,:45:,2022-11-28T13:55:00Z,commanders,0.001499875685871
