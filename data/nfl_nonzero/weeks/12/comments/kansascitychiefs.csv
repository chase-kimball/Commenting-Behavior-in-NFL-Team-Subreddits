It's more about not having defined punishments for penalties can sometimes lead to situations where referees are afraid to throw the flag because they don't know exactly what they are going to enforce.

You can imagine in this case if the Seattle player would have had maybe a more material effect on the play or a slightly altered scenario where you have to make a palpably unfair act ruling that it could be difficult to determine how big the penalty should be.

That's why I'm way in favor of the NFHS strategy, where basically it's 15 yd and if there's something else that happened, you can add the probably unfair act on top of it. But it's nice to give referees a set punishment towards penalties.

I’m going to Kansas City, where they know how to run a football team.  Who's ready for Mahomes 2nd Super Bowl. CHIEFS KINGDOM

The Ravens finally play a good team and are exposed for what they are: a trash team. By the way, the Panthers are the best team in the NFL.
