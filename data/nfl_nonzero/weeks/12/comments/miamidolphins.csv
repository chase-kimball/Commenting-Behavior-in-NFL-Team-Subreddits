Gonna have to disagree here. Stafford threw for 41 TDs last year and led the league in 4th quarter comebacks. Dude was clutch as hell. People just forget about that now because of recency bias, with his underperformance this year. Goff had a pro bowl year when the Rams had their first SB appearance, with 4688 yards and a 100+ passer rating. Meanwhile Ryan was literally the MVP his SB year.

Look I'm a huge Dolphins fan and I'm hoping against all hope that Tua wins MVP this year, but the above statement is likely untrue. Using Tua's current stats and game averages, if he hadn't missed time for the concussion he'd be 2nd to Mahomes in both yards and TDs right now.
