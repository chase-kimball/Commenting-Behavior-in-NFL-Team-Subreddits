they can designate the retirements as post june 1 and spread the hit over two years. that makes the combined dead cap for those two 46m and reduce 2024's to 84m. either way, those two retiring is going to kill this team and at that point I don't think mcvay stick around for the shitshow.


yes, the rams have the right to claw back the prorated signing bonus and remove that from the salary cap.

16215,156146,156146,Wapow217,"For one game, it is questionable. Given his reaction and even almost sulking during the game, it is a great learning experience for Wilson, a very young QB. But a 2nd overall pick is usually the face of a franchise. Creating a sour relationship with the face of your franchise is never a good thing. This situation is all bad for the Jets. 

So Mike White played well in A game. Why has Mike been on the bench since 2018 though? Not saying Mike White is worst than Wilson or that Mike White is a bad QB, but 7/10 times if not more a bench QB is on the bench for a reason. There aren't many Kirk Cousins or Geno Smiths in the league. 

I always remember Kurt Warner when he was with the Giants. They wanted to bench Eli because of how badly he was playing. Kurt was the guy who said no and pushed back. He explained that even if he is playing badly, Eli has to learn to overcome it, and if they benched him, he wouldn't learn.  To me, this is a very similar situation, and the Jets have one of two options kind of three, because at the end of the day you can't help someone that won't help themselves. 

The Jets need to start him and let him play through his struggles and learn to overcome them, which can take time, especially when your head coach is defensive-minded. In the end, they may be in the same situation where Wilson is just not good and is not learning anything. I just highly doubt an NFL team drafts a player as high as they did for Wilson and thinks he can't learn or improve more. But this would also be the 2nd QB the jets have just thrown away.

If the Jets already think this then trade him first thing in the off-season. But the Jets are starting to look like a QB nightmare for anyone that goes there.
