17287,89587,89587,FunetikPrugresiv,"Why do you think they can't develop a QB?

Fan pressure can be stifling. Look at all of the child stars that end up with mental illnesses; hell, [look at the difference](https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Elizabeth-Olsen-Sisters-SS-ftr1.jpg?w=620) between the Olsen twins (grew up in the spotlight) and their older sister Elizabeth Olsen (did not grow up in the spotlight).

These QBs come in at a young age and are thrust into the media spotlight, with crazy, angry, and impatient Jets fans ready to jump down their throats at the first sign of failure in the largest media market in the U.S.

Think that's not accurate? Look at Geno Smith with the Jets and look at him now. He was trending in this direction in his two years in NY, but they got impatient and dropped him.

The past two decades of Jets' QBs has a consistent theme - they start okay and show improvement, but then when expectations get high and they don't immediately meet those expectations, they tank. Smith, Sanchez, Darnold, Wilson... This is a culture problem, and the fanbase affects that. It's going to happen with Mike White - he'll be the savior this year as he leads them to the playoffs and maybe wins a playoff game or two, but next year he's going to start to suck because the fans will demand that he leads them to a Super Bowl, and that's too much to expect of an athletically limited 27-year-old second-year player with an average (for the NFL) arm.

Now, the blame, of course, doesn't rest entirely on the shoulders of the fanbase, but they're a factor that increases the degree of difficulty of developing a QB. They'll never admit it - that would take a degree of introspection that no fans anywhere have - but the Jets will forever struggle to develop young QBs because that fanbase is not conducive to it.",0.0,nfl,t3_z7ae0a,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2022-11-29T09:16:45Z,detroitlions,-0.0489404963930145

Not too long ago QB‚Äôs were drafted well before the team actually expected to play them. Drafted QBs would sit behind their teams starting QB for multiple seasons, getting a taste of the game and learning under a vet. These players were then molded to the team and mature enough to handle the pressure. Teams don‚Äôt really do that anymore. When a QB is drafted, most fan bases expect them to start day one, and holy shit if they aren‚Äôt perfect immediately then all hell breaks loose. 

Even if Goff turns into the long term answer, there will come a day when he needs to hang it up, and so you want someone waiting in the wings to take over. Look at Zach Wilson. Not too long ago he was the obvious 2nd overall choice for the Jets. Now, he looks like an absolute joke playing. If he would‚Äôve been sat for a year or two would things have been different? Maybe. No one can say for certain, but it‚Äôs not hard to imagine the insane levels of stress that a 21 year old kid must feel when all of the sudden you are now THE face of an entire NFL franchise and you MUST produce. 

To that point, I say if you take a QB with a high pick and then develop him under your starter for a year or two, you either have a fresh, mature, good football player waiting in the roster, or you can move on if it‚Äôs not working out. I don‚Äôt think you should take one every year, but if you‚Äôre in a position to get the next possible star, why wouldn‚Äôt you if you‚Äôre not happy with the next QB class?",73.0,detroitlions,t3_z6jeet,False,0.0,DETROIT -VS- EVERYBODY,2022-11-27T20:04:38Z,detroitlions,-0.0375178077997319
