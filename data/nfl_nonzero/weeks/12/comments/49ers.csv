I ask because I routinely see it mentioned in our sub that our S&C staff needs to be fired, but historically, I have never seen blame for player injuries ever attributed to a team's S&C staff. Maybe its not as newsworthy as a DC or OC getting canned after a bad defensive or offensive performance.

26501,178108,178108,ToePunchKick,"Just so I'm clear, I'm not bashing Oluokun here. Merely cautioning against weighing tackle stats too strongly when taking the measure of linebackers.

And passing yardage given up is one of those highly volatile stats, so having given up a lot of yardage this season doesn't necessarily spell doom for his playing ability either. It's just one of those things to keep an eye on, and see if it trends back down or not. 

And, of course, linebackers who actually stay on the field and get asked to pass cover by definition give up more yardage than linebackers who get sent to the sideline on 3rd downs. So that's another bit that has to factor into the calculus.

My overall take (which is still being formed over the course of this season) is that Oluokun isn't a Top 5 linebacker even though he's being paid like one. So on those grounds, I haven't been the biggest fan of his acquisition.

This isn’t always a good thing. Some less than great linebackers have led the league in tackles. Sometimes all that stat is telling you is that the linebacker plays behind a crappy defensive line that doesn’t make any stops themselves.

And sometimes it tells you that the linebacker is giving up catches in coverage and then tackling the guy, instead of breaking up passes or covering the guy well enough that he isn’t even targeted.

And there’s a bit of that last one to Oluokun, because the 413 passing yards he’s given up in coverage so far this year is 7th most of any linebacker in the NFL.",6.0,jaguars,t3_z8wynj,False,0.0,:JAX: :49ers:,2022-11-30T13:45:06Z,49ers,0.0133679012345679
