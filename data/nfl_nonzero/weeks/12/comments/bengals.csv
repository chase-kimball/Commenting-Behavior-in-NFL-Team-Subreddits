Their WR corps is not scary, containing and frustrating Mahomes should be the gameplan. 

JuJu has been injured and was on a snap count last week, the injury came right as he was clicking into the offense but he’s prob not fully back there. Effectively he’s a backup Kelce. 

MVS can burn but 50/50 chance he drops the ball anyway. Brick hands unfortunately. 

Mecole is on IR. 

Toney is new and had a few good plays but is probably still injured in a week. 

Kelce is the real threat outside Mahomes of course. Flowers has shut him town pretty well in the last two meetings, let’s hope that still works but we do have excellent coverage LBs. 

Pacheco runs hard but he’s not Henry. 

Keep contain and play Kelce very physically is the recipe.
