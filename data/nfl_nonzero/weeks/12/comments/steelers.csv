508,3642,3642,34shadow1,"To be fair Ben had two counts, the first one was most likely looking for a payday after she didn't get pregnant, this is from the wiki about it with a sworn testimony from one of McNulty's coworker's. 


""In the affidavit, Angela Antonetti, McNulty's former co-worker, delivered a sworn statement that McNulty had bragged to her about having consensual sex with Roethlisberger.  As part of the affidavit, Antonetti said she was ""absolutely shocked"" upon hearing of the case on the radio on July 21. Antonetti explained, ""I knew that [her] lawsuit and false allegations would unfairly and unjustly hurt Mr. Roethlisberger"".

According to the affidavit, defendant Antonetti claimed that McNulty had revealed she was hoping she had gotten pregnant with a ""little Roethlisberger"". Antonetti also claimed that she had been asked to travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in August 2008 in an attempt to ""run into"" the quarterback.

Nor for the second one, is the one where the lady ended up not filing charges due to multiple reason, mainly the rape kit yielded no semen and didn't have enough male DNA to create a profile, second reason was she didn't want to press charges fearing how invasive the trial would have been into her life, which back in 2010 it would've been quite intrusive. Lastly Ben's lawyer was Ed Garland, the man who helped Ray Lewis escape the murder trial he was in. 

So essentially first one was most likely consensual and lady got mad she didn't get pregnant so went for money by suing instead. The second one most likely did happen it just got swept under the rug really good.

Is this what your talking about? It looks like the Georgia tech player throws the first punch but regardless I definitely wouldn’t say pickens just punched him out of the blue. It looks like a mutual fight.

Also, I’m not sure how him getting into an altercation with his own teammates makes him a dirty player that happens all of the time

My view on it is that if in the last 5 games the offense looks a lot better to the point that we’re just saying “if we get a few more pieces on the O line and another WR this thing could work”, then that is a case for keeping him.  If on the other hand, our defense keeps us in the games with good play, sacks, and turnovers, and the offense does just enough to scrape out a win, then I would still be more in favor of looking for a new OC.

20519,140714,140714,Ooziez,"Bad:

- Dan Moore- some bad plays tonight. From the penalty to getting Kenny smacked. Not his best game. 

- Kickoff unit- gave up a ton of yards and just god awful contain. Is the Boykin loss that major? I don’t know but this unit struggled mightily tonight and set Indy up for success. 

- Front four pass rush- 1 sack from that group. All other sacks came from DB’s. Gotta get home on these rushes, especially on a zero mobility QB and just how close we continually got.  

Good:

- Run game- run game showed up big from the OL to all RB’s. BSF and Ant Mac were running hard and quick- really encouraging stuff to see

- George/Kenny- far from perfect but these two showed what I wanted to see. George continues to impress and makes the difficult look easy. Kenny showed great pocket presence and mobility. Good decision making and arm strength. Improvement for both which is what we really need to see the rest of the way. 


Ugly game but goddamnit give us that win baby! Almost blew a 16-3 lead and was a Jeff saturday boneheaded coaching decision to possibly tie the game up but whew baby we needed that one. Highsmith completely took over that drive. Keep these building blocks going and stack some wins.

26651,185666,185666,TastesLikeHoneyNut,"Under Mike Tomlin:

- Bruce Arians- promoted from WR coach to OC (This happened 4 days prior to Tomlin becoming HC, so there is an argument whether or not Tomlin had a say in this)

- Todd Haley- outside hire. His dad was a former personnel director for the steelers, but yes. Outside hire.

- Randy Fichtner - promoted from QB coach to OC

- Matt Canada - promoted From QB coach to OC

- Keith Butler - promoted from LB coach to DC

- Terryl Austin - promoted from DB coach to DC

Under Bill Cowher:

- Dick LeBeau - ""outside hire"", but previously the DC with the steelers 7 years prior

- Tim Lewis - promoted from DB coach to DC

- Jim Haslett - Outside hire

- Dom Capers - Outside hire

- Ken Whisenhunt - promoted from TE coach to OC

- Mike Mularkey - promoted from TE coach to OC

- Kevin Gilbride - outside hire

- Ray Sherman - outside hire

- Chan Gailey - promoted from WR coach to OC

- Ron Erhardt - outside hire

So in conclusion, in the 15 seasons of Tomlin being HC, 5 out of his 6 coordinator hires have been internal hires. In the 14 seasons of Cowher being HC, 4 out of 10 of his coordinator hires were internal hires. Call it the Steelers way or call it the Tomlin way, it doesn't matter. In the last 15 years we have a strong record of hiring internally, and a strong record of it failing. I'm not against hiring internally if the candidate is qualified. It's hard to argue that Fichtner and Canada have been worthy candidates.

All but one is just a pokemon, but as a robot. Robo Tyranitar, Robo Delibird. And they have the STUPIDEST names imaginable. “Iron Hands”, “Iron Treads”, “Iron Thorns”, literally just “Iron” + another word that describes them.

The Ancient Paradoxes are similar in how they take inspiration from mons. The names arent meant to be the real names, but they are at least more descriptive and get most of the way there like “Roaring Moon”, “Brute Bonnet”, “Slither Wing”. 

And you can make the logical leap as to how the mons are related because they are.
