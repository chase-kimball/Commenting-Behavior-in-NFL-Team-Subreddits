Zeke has had at least 1200 yards from scrimmage and 8 TDs in every single one of his seasons. That doesn't make him ""only good for his rookie season.""

Zeke's motivation to continue playing through these injuries was to protect Dak, who was also dealing with nagging injuries. If Pollard were asked to carry that load last year, there is little evidence to suggest that he could have handled it, and there is a greater chance that Dak could have gotten seriously hurt.

I understand the hesitation with the contract (even though not a single fan has to pay it), but Zeke's ability to stay on the field and produce consistently puts him in a class above most NFL players.
