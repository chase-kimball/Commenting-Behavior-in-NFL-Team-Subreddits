Defense was atrocious, refereeing was horrible ‚Äî but even with all of that, we likely still win that game if not for the muffed handoff between Geno/K9 in the RZ in the 4th. 

On offense, two big things:
1. Get Geno in a rhythm early. Bootlegs, motion the tight ends, easy passes to get those first two or three completions. When Geno gets hot, he stays hot. When he‚Äôs out of rhythm he‚Äôs just not as effective. 
2. Spell K9 with Homer/Dallas more often. K9 has all the skill but is still learning the NFL game. He‚Äôs often slow to hit the gap, spending too much time hesitating in the backfield. He‚Äôll get better, but keep him fresh and mix it up, even if it‚Äôs Homer getting you 3 yards here and there. 

On defense, just have to figure out how to get pressure with who we‚Äôve got, and need to stop assuming that the opponent‚Äôs run game isn‚Äôt a threat. We assumed Tampa Bay couldn‚Äôt run and they gashed us. We schemed as hard as we could against Adams and somehow undervalued Jacobs.
