Here’s my perspective: As someone who prefers city life and taking a train I would love a stadium where Citi Field is. Pregame at a cheap dive bar with friends, grab some pizza, hit the 7 express, brown bag a train beer and walk to your seats. 

$2.75 each way. Avoid traffic. No need for an Uber. Door to seat in 35 minutes. This is exactly what I do for Mets games and it’s incredible. Bonus is that I can be at the bar on TickPick waiting for a cheap ticket to post, buy it and go. If it doesn’t hit my price point, I’m at the bar watching the game. Win win.

With that said tailgating is super fun and I totally get why people love it.

Compare that with Zach who has had a monumental effort by all involved to try and put him in the best possible position to win, a team who are no longer a basket case and have a credible coaching staff and one of the best GMs in the league who could not have done more to try and make it easy for him.

14220,99818,99818,NannigarCire,"they were pretty easy, the majority of the throws were under the zones and in places defenders weren't really bothering with. its only one game but the average depth of target for him in this game was 5.9, last season it was 6.4. both are very low, checkdown stuff. if he ended with 5.9 on the season it would be the 3rd lowest currently in the league, only Colt McCoy and Kyle Allen throwing shorter. it doesn't mean a whole lot on its own, it really depends on if he can supplement it with effective downfield passing when necessary. in this game he could, and the downfield passes were very easy because the chicago defense had only one player who matters in coverage and he got injured early in the game. it's hard to evaluate anything off of this kind of game. the talent difference between garrett wilson and anyone covering him is too wide, and the safety play was horrendeous after jackson went down- who also almost picked off White from reading his eyes when he tried to force a ball he probably shouldn't have. 

i also wouldn't rush to credit him getting sacked as a positive indicator of anything. the two plays i referred to were just the same as the others, underneath players he wanted- but he chose not to because the defenders were getting closer than he was used to. he also didn't run into many disguised coverages in this game, most of the plays were pretty straight-forward. i could guess the coverage on the pre-snap, and i've never played a sport in my life. there were two where they surprised him (and me) with a rotating blitz, and to his credit he hit his checkdown fine against them. but it's still just hitting a checkdown. better defenses that aren't relying on Jack Sanborn and Nicholas Morrow over the middle might not let that play happen

in this game, he did what he had to do, but one game doesn't mean a lot. this game didn't tell me a lot about him, other than him having a pretty solid pre-snap read on defenses that aren't hiding their intentions.",3.0,nyjets,t3_z6tnsi,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-11-28T16:33:29Z,nyjets,0.0508720744067022

14223,99821,99821,NannigarCire,"Just watched the game, wanted to drop my thoughts on White. It was a mirror game of the Bengals performance last year. Bears defenders played heavily in zone and White kept attacking them underneath- his eyes don't do him favors because he tends to stare at his target before making the choice to throw but the Bears weren't able to capitalize on that. There was one real wowing play where White created an opportunity that didn't exist otherwise, [stepping up to hitch in the pocket and get Conklin](https://imgur.com/a/lmtoSx9) but otherwise the majority of the game was him hitting what he had in front of him. He had 3 clear bad plays on the sack, near INT to Garrett, and then a 3rd down miss near the end of the game. The sack and the 3rd down miss were both on him entirely, and i don't know why it happened, but he paused to take an underneath throw as he had been all game and missed the chance. He's quick to make decisions and his accuracy on those decisions are solid. His pocket movements are controlled and he's generally ready to throw even has he moves. I'll say this much, he looks better than Fitzpatrick did in 2015. We'll see what happens with a few more games, but i think Zach had a game similar to this against the Steelers and Dolphins. Just those teams have a lot better defenses. But where Zach's eyes can deceive defenders, he usually is much later to throw. White trades the deception for quicker timing.

However, if you want to be fair to both White and Wilson, the Bear's defense compared to the Patriots and the Bills is a huge gap.

Next Week should be a good test for White.",41.0,nyjets,t3_z6tnsi,False,0.0,":PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya",2022-11-28T07:39:12Z,nyjets,0.1980814814814815

17134,113002,113002,Phifty56,"Thank god. I appreciate how much of an emergency fill in he was, but Cedric Ogbuehi was not meshing well with the rest of the line and would routinely let some guys go untouched into ZWilson.

It's one thing to get beat all the time, but Ogbuehi looked like he didn't understand his assignments and simple stunts and blitzes where poorly handled.",4.0,nyjets,t3_z5i9z9,False,0.0,":PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya",2022-11-26T20:00:26Z,nyjets,0.1559222222222222
17135,113003,113003,Phifty56,"I wonder if the two injuries both this year and last year play into it.

17136,113004,113004,Phifty56,"It still comes back to coaching/front office because at the end of the day a conversation is had where you decide that a QB is raw and you have to ask if they can be coached up or not. If they decided that Wilson was the best option, despite playing in a weak conference, and with other QBs and top non-QB positions available, it is on them.

I was Fields guy before the draft, and part of it was due to Fields playing against much stronger competition and excelling, meanwhile Wilson looked like he was dominating against teams who were out of their element. I saw pass rushes that didn't get to Wilson for like 40 seconds, DBs who would get turned around and lost, and lots of Hero ball throws against defenses who had to chance.

Wilson has a very good arm, and good escapability which are prototypical of what the top young QBs have in the modern NFL, but it scary that not only is his accuracy suspect, but he is also bailing out of pockets early and forcing bad throws that are dangerous against NFL defenses.

Maybe the benching is what he needs to take a breather and reset himself, along with the coaches to diagnose what is causing the problems for him.",3.0,nyjets,t3_z5cp15,False,0.0,":PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya",2022-11-26T12:47:07Z,nyjets,-0.0880896090534979
