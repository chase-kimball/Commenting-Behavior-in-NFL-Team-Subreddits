Fire back to last year when they were 8-0 and just beat the Texans. Within four days, the following would hope:

- Murray snaps his ankle and misses three games before limping through the rest of the year.

- All-Pro C Rodney Hudson inures his pec and misses several games and is clearly injured when he does play. His backup is Max Garcia, the second string right guard,

- JJ Watt blows up his shoulder and is done for season.

Carry that to this season where their paper thin o-line has been more injured than the entire rest of the league, Ertz is done for the year, Nuk and Brown have been on the field together once, Conner is beaten up, a fucking coach got fired for being a pervert, and Kliff is still a dumbass.
