Defenders give up on runs anyway if they are untackleable unless you use an illegal type of tackle, so yes he is in the wrong and he should not have gone for the ball. 

Do I fault him for going for the tackle, though? Absolutely the fuck not, it was either he tackles him and leads with the helmet alongside being penalized, or the ref somehow whiffs a blatant flag. Somehow it was missed though, so Sorenson gets credit for risking it to save a score. If it was called, then it would’ve been 1st and goal, if it wasn’t called, it’s a TD so again, Sorenson did what he had to do, but it 100% should have been called and I genuinely don’t think that the ball carrier has any blame here if scoring a TD used to literally involve diving at the end zone.",3.0,nfl,t3_z4dttk,False,0.0,:Texans: Texans,2022-11-25T19:44:06Z,texans,-0.0502341855859378

Obviously I was elated when we drafted him. Was extremely happy for him when he got the extension, too. When he voiced his displeasure with the team, I even felt empathy for the dude. I gave Deshaun the benefit of the doubt almost every time. 

Then, he decided to essentially quit on the team and held the Texans captive after already cashing in. THEN, the allegations dropped and the mfer decided to do a complete 180 and became a dickhead overnight. Thats about when I lost all respect for him. 

At this point, not only do I wish him the worst, I wish him a career-ending injury. And thats not who I am *at all*, but that piece of shit deserves **everything bad** to come his way.",3.0,texans,t3_z7i52u,False,0.0,:ProPain:,2022-11-29T10:38:20Z,texans,-0.1034100770865528
32814,250008,250008,watdude,"> Houston is a laughingstock. The Texans have won four games in back-to-back seasons and probably isn't going to sniff four wins this season. There's not a lot on the roster to build around after the Bill O'Brien regime traded many picks and whiffed on others. The Texans moved off of controversial former executive vice president of football operations Jack Easterby in a sudden firing earlier this season, and that probably isn't a bad thing. But anyone watching the Texans the past couple weeks knows this team is a mess, it looks like it is ready to be done with the season and there's not a lot of hope for it all turning around anytime soon. Good luck, Bryce. You're going to need it.
