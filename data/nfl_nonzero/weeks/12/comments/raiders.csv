43792,300886,300886,someonepoorsays,"yeah, we do understand it. none of us blame the NFL for letting the rams move back because their owner could pay for his own stadium. 

what we DO blame the NFL for us blocking us from sharing the stadium and giving the chargers the opportunity to instead. and no, our “if the chargers decline” consolation doesn’t count. and it’s because 1) mark davis is “poor” and lacks other rich-get-richer streams of shared income like other NFL owners do, and 2) the NFL old boys club hated mark’s dad. 

kroenke is especially guilty of the former; he knew his team would play second fiddle to the raiders forever if we were able to move back. he was the biggest opponent vs. davis in the shuffle. all i’m saying is, if it was raiders/rams and not chargers/rams at sofi, i doubt we’d have trouble with home field in the manner the current LA teams do",2.0,nfl,t3_z7xmte,False,0.0,:Raiders: Raiders,2022-11-29T22:25:19Z,raiders,-0.07997344789505
