I think when you are truly a fan of a team you are sorta married to that team in a way and when you watch other teams and hope that they win it's not even remotely the same thing.  

I like the Lions. I like Dan Campbell and what he is trying to build there. Usually when I watch them play I find myself hoping that they get a win. I don't get the same kind of emotional high from them winning, or sadness from them losing as I do the Broncos and it's not even in the same universe.

I mean maybe we just have incredibly bad luck and every single HC/OC we have hired has been utter trash. But seeing as how every single year it's the same shit with new faces coaching or running the front office, you'd think that would kinda increase the probability that the core players we have built around either don't know how to win, are totally apathetic, or just suck relative to the rest of the league.

4885,20727,20727,Bronco30,"The Lions are actually a good football team. IIRC, like 4-5 of their losses are by 3-4 points and their offense is one of the better ones in the league. Just because they’re historically bad doesn’t mean they’re bad this year. Dan Campbell is slowly but surely turning their ship around. I definitely think we would lose to them. They’re way better than the Raiders and we lost to them twice. Our defense is good but it’s not great. It takes a great defense to carry a team. Our offense is one of the worst I’ve ever seen in the 25 years I’ve watched the Broncos. There’s no way we could keep up with the Lions offense. I don’t think this is even a debate. There are way better comparisons to make, like the Jags or Texans. As much as I can’t stand it, we are a bottom 5 team in the league right now.

This is a legitimately unprecedented decline that I don’t think we’ve ever seen before because Russ was still good last season. That’s why we need to send Hackett packing and bring in a coach who will actually utilize Russ’s strengths and not try to turn him into Aaron Rodgers.

Also if this is the worst offense since 2000, that 100% points to this being more of a coaching issue.

25938,157947,157947,iSamurai,">	The running back disasters deserve some of the blame, but so does Wilson. This was probably what the star passer did best in recent years with Seattle. In 2020, his 90.2 QBR inside the red zone was the fifth-best mark in football. Last season, even while dealing with the finger injury, he posted a 91.9 QBR inside the 20, which was first. He was second in 2019, 13th in 2018 and fifth in 2017. He ranked No. 1 in the red zone over that entire five-year span.

>This season, Wilson has been the league's worst quarterback in the red zone. His QBR has dropped from 91.9 to 6.3. That's not a typo. The only quarterback within 15 points is Pittsburgh's Kenny Pickett. Wilson's completion percentage over expectation (CPOE) is nearly seven points below that of an average passer, and he's averaging just 2.3 yards per attempt. He doesn't have Metcalf or Tyler Lockett in Denver, but he was dominant in the red zone before Metcalf arrived in town, too.

>What makes this even more staggering is what I mentioned about Hackett earlier. One of the first items on his résumé as a potential head-coaching candidate would have been his success building the game plan for the Packers in the red zone over the past three seasons. The Broncos have somehow combined the best red zone quarterback of the past five years with a guy who was responsible for one of the league's best red zone offenses and landed the league's worst red zone attack.
