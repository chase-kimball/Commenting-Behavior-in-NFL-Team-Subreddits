Joe Thomas is one of the best to ever do it, but that is because his feet were the best feet to ever come out of college. 

We moved Jed from right tackle to left tackle out of college so he started from the wrong footwork.

Trent Williams who is still the best tackle in football was in the low 70s average for his first 3 years.

Everyone declared Andrew Thomas to be a bust after his first couple years, now hes one of the best.

Wirfs did well his rookie season and hes still great, but he's at right tackle.

Becton was sort of red flagged for his ankle injury, and hasnt been able to make it to the field in the NFL sadly.

There is no reason to believe Jed wont turn into an elite tackle in the NFL. He has the best coach in the NFL to help him, hes a willing learner, he has improved every year, and he's still young.

4150,26515,26515,ClevelandOG,"Bojo has had some great holds this year. There were a couple snaps that bounced to him and he still got them set up in time.

I dont know for sure, but it seemed like York was trying to kick balls much higher than im used to seeing. That 51 yarder was a moonshot. I think they are changing his kicking spot on the ball to get it up and he just shanked it doing things hes still learning to do. It's like changing your golf swing and playing the masters the same week. You are probably going to put one into the woods. I know for a fact they are changing his time to kick clock to try to speed him up.

I saw the same thing with Gillan his rookie year. He had a 3 step approach coming out of college and Priefer changed it to a 2 step. They also tried to rework his hang to distance so he didnt outkick his coverage. He struggled a lot trying to basically rework everything. But ultimately it was the right call to make him do it, and you can see it starting to pay off (unfortunately in New York instead of Cleveland).

We have to remember that everyone in the NFL has talent. York for sure has talent, i think everyone agrees with that. And a lot of these young players need time to go through the process of changing to become NFL caliber players. It is important to have patience with them as they work through those changes.

David thought he was alone so he began his postgame ritual of listening to Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On” as he washed his thick burly muscles with his big calloused hands. They were man hands, and someone had noticed. Njoku turned to exit the shower and gasped as he saw Jacoby standing in the shower doors, blocking his way. They locked eyes with a sort of primal understanding. Njoku stood still, quivering with anticipation as Jacoby approached him. He felt so exposed and vulnerable standing there, dripping wet, with his hog hanging there for Jacoby to see. Nikkei knew what he wanted but was unable, or unwilling, to make the first move. But Jacoby was a leader of men. He would take control. He completed his final step towards David and flirted “thanks for making that catch, you really saved my ass, i thought I was toast.” David replied, “hey, that’s what friends are for.” Jacoby bristled at the statement and Njoku began to worry he offended his big strong QB. “I’m sorry, did I say something wrong?” Jacoby bit his lip and looked him in the eyes, “is that all we are? Friends?” The look of hurt clear as day in his deep brown eyes. “Of course not, you’re my QB…” his voice trailed off as he struggled to articulate what he really wanted to say. Jacoby could sense that David was being shy. And like the big bad alpha male QB he is he boldly exclaimed “well that’s not enough! I’m tired of these games David. I want you. And you want me. Don’t you?” A look of pleading in his eyes. David had always suspected, but now he knew for sure. Jacoby felt the same. Those feelings he had long ago buried began to bubble to the surface as he grabbed Jacoby’s pants and began to tear them down to his ankles. “Call me chief” he said dominantly as he sensually settled on his knees before Jacoby. Jacoby, emboldened by Njoku’s sexual act grabbed his thick pulsating member and asked David “who’s your QB?” “YOU ARE!” David shouted as he swallowed his QB’s man meat.

If we separate the 22’ draft and only judge his first two draft classes that’s still 4 guys that are starters ALL drafted in the third or later. That is really good, you usually don’t find starters after the second, just role guys. DPJ starts, Bryant starts, when it comes time to review Conklin’s contract I bet you my nutsack we roll with Hudson. So he starts in the not so distant future. Were it not for injury Nick Harris would have started this season. 

Berry is doing well, he takes risks which guys applaud on draft day and then when they don’t pan out everyone in here acts they knew it all along. Schwartz was a project. We all knew the likelihood of him being a star was low, he’s a track guy. Richard LeCounte was a risk, he had just had his injury before being drafted and we all liked the pick but also understood it probably wouldn’t pan out. Tony Fields was never seen as anything more than a diet Wu so we have a guy that can play a similar role in case Wu gets injured. He was literally never seen as a potential starter but we all still liked the pick. Demetria Felton is a 6th rounder and he has contributed far more than any 6 rounder should be expected. Tommy Togiai was supposed to be an excellent run stuffer and is imo the most disappointing pick of the Berry era, I never thought he’d be good. But I won’t be surprised if we get a new DC and D-line coach and then next year he’s suddenly good. Kiffin is absolute garbage and shouldn’t be an NFL coach. Jacob Phillips was seen as high risk high reward pick. He’s a rangy lengthy guy with decent speed. But he was always seen as a major project.
