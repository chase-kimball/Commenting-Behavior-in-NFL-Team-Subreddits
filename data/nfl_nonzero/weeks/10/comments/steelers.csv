20535,140734,140734,Ooziez,"Good:

- RB’s- now that’s the Najee we knew last year. He heard all the noise- ran hard, ran north, aggressive. Don’t have to get cute all the time and he showed that today. Solid game from 22. And then Warren… just an absolutely great compliment. Nothing cute or fancy, just good hard running. Great game for these guys. First time we ran for 200+ yards since 2016. 

- TJ / Highsmith. TJ Watt is good at football. That is all. Highsmith shines when TJ is present (as does everybody). That spin move of his is disgusting. 

- George- Steelers looked to get him involved today and it paid off. Sweeps, catches. YAC. He sure doesn’t look like a rookie. 

- Levi Wallace- 2 plays really stood out: his coverage on the Kazee INT and then his personal INT. Solid, solid game for 29

Bad:

- Kenny- well. Overall, it was not a good game. And that’s okay. So before you guys come to kill me that’s not a long term indictment against him- just a bad day at the office. Here’s what I noticed: when his first and second read is not there he immediately scrambles back in the pocket and loses yards, making himself vulnerable for a big sack. He just didn’t look comfortable today. And kudos to the saints, they did a good job making the rookie uncomfortable in the pocket; he struggled hitting the deep ball and lacked accuracy very early on (crossed to George was behind him). These are all things that are fixable but today was not his best performance. 

- Spillane- I mean. Find 41 and attack him. It’s been the recipe for success for every team we play. But that’s our dimebacker for some crazy reason. 

- Left side of OL- really great spot to attack in the off-season. Moore and Dotson struggling bad not only this game, but really all season. Need to do some more research, but I wonder if Moore would be a better guard than a LT. Anyways, gotta give your rookie Qb some help and they both struggle. 

- Matthew Wright- well… I don’t think that’s Boz’s replacement for very long.
