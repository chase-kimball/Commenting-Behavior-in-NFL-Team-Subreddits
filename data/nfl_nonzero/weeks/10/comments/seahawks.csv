6499,50698,50698,CustardAffectionate6,"Question 1) 

Re-sign Geno. 2 years and as incentive-laden as you can make it. I keep hearing the narrative that he's going to go for that huge contract -- his final shot at doing so -- but I have a feeling he'll want to stay with the only organization that he's ever had success with, vs. learning yet another new offense, with a new coaching staff, new supporting cast, and the need to prove himself yet again. He'll still get a bag, but I see a deal getting done at a price that doesn't raise any eyebrows.   
Question 2) 

If we get two years of Geno, then I don't think so. Pete Carroll knows how to develop a QB for the NFL. I believe he's invested in the Drew Lock project right now -- meaning, focus on fundamentals, protecting the ball, etc (essentially reproducing the success he's had with Geno). Sign Lock to a 2 year deal. If Lock isn't impressing the coaching staff behind the scenes next year, then draft a QB in 2024 and give him a year behind Geno.  
Question 3) 

In the draft, use your top picks on ILB, Edge, interior DL, and interior OL. I know some are hungry for a standout WR3, but I think we can find a FA to come in and compete against Eskridge/Goodwin (I'm personally optimistic about Goodwin in the short-term, and think he'll be better with a full year in the system + another offseason). Who knows how Bo Melton is developing on the practice squad, as well. Maybe spend a late round pick or two on some guys who you can add to that competition. 

The situation at safety is the most perplexing to me. Jamal is coming back, and given his contract/cap hit, you have to plug him right back in and hope that he can stay healthy for a year (I wouldn't re-sign him after that year, *unless* he can play an entire season without injury and can be signed on a ""bargain"" contract given his injury history). As for Quandre, we've got two more years on his contract, and that worries me. Could we trade for a 5th and find someone in the draft to backup/play as a 3rd safety behind Adams and Neal?",2.0,seahawks,t3_yuqwo9,False,0.0,:sea1:​,2022-11-14T11:37:44Z,seahawks,0.0235053855421409

8605,64789,64789,Esuu,"ESPN uses their FPI metric for game predictions. For whatever reason that system seems really sticky, so it's still really down on us.

This includes things like having our offense at 20th below teams like the Raiders, Jets, Giants, Bears, Jags, and Packers. The funny thing is that we're above the Bills so that's a thing. It also thinks we still have one of the league's worst defenses.

The weird thing is that if you go to their efficiencies metric things make more sense. We're the 8th best team, 6th best offense, 17th best defense, and 8th best special team on the season as a whole. This is much more in line with both other advanced metrics (DVOA, EPA, etc.) while also tracking analyst sentiment pretty well.

Looking at where FPI comes from it seems to be a mix of EPA and preseason expectations at this point in the season. The preseason expectations are clearly what are dragging us down and according to ESPN include:

* Vegas expectations; the expected win totals and money lines for each team
* Previous years' efficiencies for each unit, number of returning starters (on offense and defense), coaching/coordinator/quarterback changes and quarterback injuries.

Of course, with a rule like this it is still going to be left to someone to make the decision, so best judgement of if the rules are followed, is still going to occur.

Thanks for adding those other penalties, it was early and I couldn’t think of anymore. Certain penalties are already reviewable (12 men for example). Those i see there that should be are grounding calls. For the most part its pretty clear and actually refs usually do a fantastic job at making grounding calls. The rest are tough because I don’t think roughing should be reviewable. Block in the back as well, similar to holding, this occurs basically every play it could happen on. Its really depends on if it affects the play. For illegal contact and late hit, those seem like they are less subjective and could be reviewable.

But this idea that bringing in a different coach and he'll be fixed is probably just copium. Since about halfway through 2020, his play has deteriorated, he's been injured a lot more often, and his speed is shot. He's not turning into 2015 Wilson with some new coach. 

Even in his best years, he's always played one style of offense. He's not going to change with some new scheme. The Seahawks had three offensive coordinators over his tenure and he always looked the exact same. He's always going to take a lot of sacks and he's always going to lead several frustrating drives a game.

Also, and I can't really prove this, but I *know* that the Seahawks fans were louder during the game. Whenever the Bucs offense was out, our section became really loud instantly. Whenever the Seahawks were on offense, however, our section was relatively quiet, but the middle sections became really loud gradually. Because all sections were sold ad random, it strikes me as odd that there was such a distinction in sections between our crowd and the Bucs. I think they may have been pumping in noise.
