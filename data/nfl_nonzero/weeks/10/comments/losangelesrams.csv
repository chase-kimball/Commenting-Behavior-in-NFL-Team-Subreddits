31290,260959,260959,shaneknysh,"I find it hard to fairly divide the blame between the coach and general manager. The Rams have spent several years of draft capital to win now, and right now I clearly see the downside of that kind of gamble.

The Rams are clearly having a down year and it's going to reward other teams with high draft picks.

Last year's success is/was nice but it's not a lot of comfort seeing the team struggle this year.

Regardless how much input McVay has had on personnel moves it seems clear that this season he is not getting the best results out of the players he has on the field. There are several weaknesses the team has and McVay doesn't seem to be able to minimize those weaknesses via schemes and adjustments. 

The mythical Belichick (as opposed to the actual Belichick) is infamously credited with the ability to ""prepare his team to beat yours"", or, to ""take your team and prepare it to beat his."" I don't buy this hype, entirely. But McVay won with a stacked team with minimal weaknesses. With a WR3 that might be a WR1 on some teams and a WR2 that would certainly be WR1 on any other team. With a superb offensive line. With a defensive front with at least 2 first ballot hall of famers. The backfield running backs and coverage team being the weakest part of the team and even those were average or above average.

This year with weaknesses everywhere I keep wanting to see McVay make an adjustment that offsets the weakness but I'm not seeing it. 

I'm by no measure a football genius but I'd like to see a game, a half, a series... where the Rams do something different and we can see the benefit. All I see is the Rams doing the same thing that worked last year - like empty sets when the o-line is struggling - and the results are not there. I see flashes success but as far as I can tell it's heroic solo efforts and not systematic and sustainable.

I'm still not sure how much blame to pile on McVay, but it's a lot more than none and less than all.",52.0,losangelesrams,t3_yx8w8a,False,0.0,LA Rams,2022-11-16T17:23:25Z,losangelesrams,-0.0137616620824655
