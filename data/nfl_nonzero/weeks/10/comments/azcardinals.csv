16260,147605,147605,UserInAtl,"I think Colt played well today. That being said, the Ram's QB could not hit the side of a barn. Its hard to judge this game because the other team clearly wasn't going to score more than 1 TD. Stats wise McCoy did alright. He wasn't some world beater with  a line of 26/37	238 yrds	1TD	0 INT and more or less just went off short passes (which this sub dogs Kyler about non stop). If the other team had some sort of offense that could make a drive or two, I think this game may not have looked so clean since we went 3 and out a ton.

I think we need another game or two. In this one, there was never a real threat of losing after you went up because the Rams QB was so terrible. In other games, its going to matter when your QB throws a ball 2 yards pass the LOS on 3rd and 10. I think Colts longest play was 25 yards (and I think that was his only pass longer than 10 yards but I may be wrong). That is okay if you can pin your hat on the defense and get a game manager, but I don't think our defense is at that level.

I agree that Kyler has not been good this year, but TBH I think that this sub has such a raging hate boner for the guy that anything (even mediocre play from a backup QB) will be enough to crown the other guy.  You could of course give up on him and hope it isn't a Tua or Hurts situation. That also means you need to draft another QB next season because Colt is really at best a career backup and is 36. Maybe it works and Kyler's first 3 years were anomalies, then we look great. What's more likely is you get a HC who can use his skillset similar to Hurts or Lamar, and that team goes off while we are back where this team has been most of my life, with no QB and every season hoping you get the #1 pick.

It´s now on Kyler to adapt to that and find a way to be productive again. Kliff can help with that by creating a scheme that counteracts that but at the end of the day it´s on Kyler to execute.
