I also think the FO really put Favre's feet to the coals to get a retirement answer quickly, partly because they viewed Rodgers as a good replacement. But, they didn't go out of their way to resign him.

The average HOF WR scores 104 in their metrics. Here are the current active WRs and their scores:

* 106.01 - Julio Jones

* 60.30 - Tyreek Hill

* 54.94 - DeAndre Hopkins

* 52.15 - DeSean Jackson

* 48.86 - AJ Green

* 44.65 - Davante Adams

* 44.33 - Cordarelle Patterson 


Everyone else is below 40. The lowest score of a player that played in the 2000's for more than a year and has made the hall is Calvin Johnson's score of 84.19
