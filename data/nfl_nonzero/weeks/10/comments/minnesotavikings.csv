Its hard to tell if he was underperforming because our 2nd year safety has been really great and our backup safety has been just as good when hes played this year. So they might just have been overperforming.     
      
Andrew booth has barely played outside of special teams and was benched after a bad series of plays against the bills for a guy we recently picked up off of the bears practice squad (duke shelley!). Our 4th rd rookie akayleb evans has been playing well but Booth finally being healthy and sitting at 4th string isnt a great start.     
      
Ingram started strong at rg and has played worse and worse as the season went on. Seems like he has potential but wasnt ready to start. Definitely wasnt worth taking the risk on a possibly awful person. To draft him a lot higher then he was expected to go.     
       
The vikings are having a great season with great free agent results and Im honestly still iptimistic about Cine once hes healthy next year.

It's worse because you ask it with the benefit of hindsight.
