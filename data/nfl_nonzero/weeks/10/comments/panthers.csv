The additions of James Campen and Chris Tabor have been absolutely invaluable to the coaching staff as they're the two best looking parts of the team.

Here’s the truth:

As recently as 2019, the rate of such injuries was notably higher on artificial turf fields than grass. But the difference began narrowing in 2020, and by 2021, the numbers were almost the same. Artificial surfaces had an incident rate of .042 per 100 in 2021, while the rate for natural surfaces was .041 per 100.6.

It is not entirely clear why the rate difference narrowed, although part of the reason is that injuries on grass increased from 2018 to 2021.  That’s fact.

Not ignoring, it's just not worth considering.

That's a different scenario. This case, with a defender bearing down from in front, your decision is throw away or take the sack.

38369,258036,258036,tank4trevor,"> We should’ve used Foreman more for the up the middle runs

I had been beating the drum for years on this point (obviously not Foreman specifically since he wasn't on the team until this year, but just using a bigger, more physical back in general to compliment CMC). CMC was constantly getting stuffed in short yardage situations, which is something the Panthers used to be unstoppable at previously. That part of the offense had been missing ever since a healthy Cam was under center.

Foreman had a total of 12 carries in the first 6 games of the year before CMC was traded. In the 4 games since he's had 79. In 3/4 of those game he's eclipsed 100 yards, with the exception being the Bengals game where he only had 7 carries. He was criminally underused, meanwhile CMC, coming off of multiple injury-plagued seasons, was getting run into the ground.

The same thing holds true for Terrace Marshall. He had a grand total of 5 targets before Robbie Anderson was traded. Since then he's essentially matched Robbie's production for the entire year in just 4 games. I don't know if it was a sunk cost thing with Robbie's contract or what, but for whatever reason he was getting the lion's share of snaps opposite DJ Moore while TMJ warmed the bench on the sideline. Now that TMJ is getting more opportunities, he's showing flashes of being a really good player.",3.0,panthers,t3_yv11r0,False,0.0,Tepper,2022-11-15T09:14:12Z,panthers,0.0651265974610636
