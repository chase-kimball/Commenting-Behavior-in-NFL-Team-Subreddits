He's not Top 5 QB in the NFL, but I think when you look around the league, your assessment is correct. He's average to above average. I think he's Top 10 when he's feeling it, but obviously right now he is not anywhere close to feeling it as shown by the crying in the post game press conference. The dude has had nothing but a revolving door for HC and OC his entire career. He damn near willed that Bisaccia team to the playoffs last year on several occasions. Even in this terrible god awful season, the record would look immensely better if not for really really untimely dropped balls. As a Raiders fan and a Carr fan, this is all real sad.

1913,7732,7732,ATX_rider,"I always get down voted for explaining stuff like this but sometimes I just can't help myself. The 2021 Raiders were a statistical anomaly‚Äîthey won a large number of games by walk-off scores and/or single digits. Since there are two teams in such games ""regression to the mean"" dictates that the Raiders were not really a 10-7 team last year but more like a 6-7 win team.

Now, one could argue that adding the offensive play calling mind of Josh McDaniel and adding one of the best receivers in the game would pull the Raiders *back up* to the 9/10 win level despite regression to the mean kicking in‚Äîand it's pretty apparent that isn't going to happen.

To me there are two kinds of playoff teams. There's the **""playoff team""** as the Raiders were last year‚Äîwhich is a team that has a good run of fortune, a key divisional rival implodes and ""whelp, there you have it the Lions are in the playoffs for the first time in 11 years"". Then there's the **""playoff contender""** which is a team that is year in and year out pretty damn good and they are almost always in the playoffs unless things fo terribly wrong. And if they hit on a draft pick or a free agent signing, if the teams stays healthy, they can make a *deep* run into the postseason. NE, KC, BAL, GB, SEA fit into this category.

All of which brings me back to there was a great chance that the Raiders were going to take a step back this year, just like they did in 2017, the year after their last playoff appearance when they beat the odds by winning a ridiculous number of single score games in 2016.

Huh?  Parham has been beat like a drum.  He's been unbelievably bad.  Him and Bars are our worst two linemen and frankly the main things holding the offense back.  



Munford has been below average, but for a 7th round rookie that's acceptable.  



There's still plenty of time to turn it around, but here's a recap of how our draft picks are so far:


3rd: Parham - terrible regression.  OK when he first started but downhill ever since. 4th most pressures allowed in the NFL.


4th Zeus - 8 carries for 19 yards on the year..........



4th Farrell Jr - healthy scratch, but has previously shown flashes


5th - Butler - healthy scratch


7th Munford - below average T, which is great value from a 7th round pick



7th Brown - still has 0 snaps



Regarding defensive personnel changes, we resigned Maxx and got rid of everyone else who can rush the passer.  That's why we went from 27 sacks from people other than Maxx to 3.  We did spend big on D this past offseason but it's to bring in Chandler Jones for 10%.


Got rid of Thomas ($2.2), Yannick ($13), and Jefferson ($3.5) with their 18 sacks to spend about that same amount to bring in Jones for 0.5 sacks.

This clickbait is as good a place as any to talk about this.  The way McDaniels is handling Chandler Jones tells you everything you need to know about McDaniels.  He swung and missed on Chandler.

All they have to do is ""do their job"" and be a cog in the machine that Bill designs.  When we hired Josh someone posted a video of the Pats winning a playoff game.  The piece was supposed to illustrate Josh's brilliance.  Literally, Bill tells Josh what to do, Josh has a deer in headlights look for a moment, then does what Bill wants.

The year before, CLE was 3-13.  But don't be fooled - they weren't anywhere near as good as their record.  Their 3 wins were against crappy teams.  They had one thanks to a gift fumble that bounced right in the Browns' defender's hands with a clear shot at the end zone.  Two others were squeakers against terrible teams that they barely pulled off.  Total margin of victory for all 3 wins combined was +14.

In an offense where the QB is right-handed, the LG pulls moreso than the RG, so you want a LG who is athletic and mobile, and that's Parham.

Parham being at LG isn't the issue - and I projected back in May that Parham would start at LG - but rather the continued playing of Bars instead of not giving Simpson a sniff at RG (where his physical strength would be a great fit) is one of many head-scratchers by McDictator.",4.0,raiders,t3_yv6khx,False,0.0,:28:,2022-11-14T18:18:17Z,raiders,0.236212890625

At that time, including when Gruden got exposed last year, I was 100% supportive of Mark Davis.

I thought he made the wrong decision to not give Bisaccia/Olson/Bradley + Mayock a shot, after they guided the team to 4 wins against playoff contending teams despite having lost Ruggs and Waller. The coaches worked with the players, who were willing to ball hard. It's difficult to quantify how valuable that kind of cohesive leadership is, but we had it.

I thought Mark made a credible decision when hiring McD + Zieg.

It's clear given the MASSIVE regression that the coaching staff is the problem, not the players.

But for Mark to come out with these statements after such a humiliating loss (which sadly I was unsurprised by) shows he has no idea how to run a successful football organization.

Credit to Mark on LV stadium deal, but he's freaking clueless otherwise.

The hiring of McD is going to set this franchise back several years. McD didn't learn the lessons he really needed to learn from DEN. In DEN, he was an outright dick (screaming at players) and arrogant coach. In LV, he's still an arrogant coach. He refuses to set players up for success. It's the epitome of an inflexible, immature leader.

Mark already had a good hand and threw it away shooting for the moon, then doubled down that he made the right decision. How about holding the guy you hired accountable, Mark?
