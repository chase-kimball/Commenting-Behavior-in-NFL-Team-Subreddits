On multiple occasions, I’ve seen him make unbelievable Mahomes-esque throws when plays break down. He seems comfortable in the pocket and doesn’t get antsy unless plays break down. When they do, sometimes the touch is there, he’s also a master escape artist. Reminds me of a more athletic Josh Allen. Very big frame, standing at 6”4 with strong legs and extremely elusive. At his full potential, I believe he can be a cross breed between prime Cam Newton and Josh Allen. He’s fallen a bit down the draft boards with guys like Bryce, CJ, Levis, and Hooker ahead of him.
