Look at this fucking franchise for the past 15 years. What am I supposed to be? Happy? Content? Jerking off because we have some improvement at some positions? We are losing games we have a shot in and getting beat by some pretty bad teams, usually by self-inflicted errors. Our defense is a very expensive doormat. We have a promising young QB-RB duo and a decent O-Line. Our WRs are average at best. Calling a 3-7 team improved is a testament to how little we expect out of this franchise year in and year out. And THAT my friend is an indictment of this whole team. We expect to fuck up. We expect to lose. When people are suddenly okay with losing because it was by one score, we have to admit we have a losing culture we are still clinging to. We need to break that shit clean off if we are ever getting out of the fucking basement. Losing can never be okay by any margin. That needs to be the mentality. It clearly isn't.

The secondary just isn't getting it done. I would put money on having a lot more sacks if any of our DBs and LBs could cover outside of Campbell.

The INT that Cisco had was caused by PRESSURE. Matter of fact, that INT took 2 pressures because Mahomes is that good. Any pressure that leads to a non-positive play is a good play. Don't be so simple minded.

JA benefitted from Calais and Yan but no one wants to talk about we had 2 top 10 CBs that year in Ramsey and Bouye. IIRC, 3 in the Top 25 if you count Colvin too.
