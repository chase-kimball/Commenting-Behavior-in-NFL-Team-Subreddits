Not great at separating, hands are unreliable, route running isn't great, not a ton of quickness/agility/acceleration. He does have decent top speed and is pretty good at breaking tackles though.

So that screen pass he got on his TD yesterday was a perfect play for him. It probably should've only been a 15sh yard gain, but the two Falcons defenders tripped over each other when they chased Shenault at the boundaries.

We, as fans, cannot view ""not losing as badly"" as acceptable. Do you know why? Because the teams that actually DO fucking turn it around don't subscribe to that mindset.

Defense forced a couple turnovers against an elite offense, Lawrence was able to move the ball through the air and on his feet. I really see him starting to improve and feel like some confidence and the ability to sense pressure, and not break down from it, would go a long way toward solidifying him as our franchise QB.

You point to the giants and jets as “getting better overnight”, but ignore the raiders and broncos who have “gotten worse overnight”. Life and football isn’t black and white. We are making strides and improvements that should be filling jags fans with optimism for the future. 

I don’t want another 2017 season and it’s ridiculous that other people do. What happened after 2017? We had no future.
