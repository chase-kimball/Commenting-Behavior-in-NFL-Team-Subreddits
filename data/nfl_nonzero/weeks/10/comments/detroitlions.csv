We'll see what happens in the Lions' second half, but the fact remains that Detroit is a better managed team than Green Bay right now, and that hits me right in the chest.

237 defensive snaps last season, PFF Grad 61.7. Not a bad rookie campaign, anything over 60 is replacement level starter.

PFF Grade 64.4 this year but in reality it's an Incomplete, only 2 games and 4 defensive snaps. His lingering ankle injury has kept him off the game day roster since the Patriots game WK 5, and he was a limited participant all of last week.

I think they like him for the same reasons they love Jerry Jacobs, he's a versatile DB you can line up at S (his presumed position these days) but is also available as a Slot corner if called upon. But his run support has not been good. 

PFF had him listed as a possible surprise 1st Round pick possibility three weeks before the 2021 draft. The thought was he had the length and strength to become a press corner in a few years. Turns out that's not who he is, but I think they still view him as a decent backup who just needs more game reps to develop his confidence. 

Slay looked awful his first 1.5 years. Okudah was labeled a bust after 2 years. Both improved with more in game experience, and it's double impressive Jeff did so while coming off two injury plagued years.
