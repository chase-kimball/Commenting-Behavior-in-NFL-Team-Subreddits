The run defense is actually one of the top run defenses in the NFL statically. 

Pass defense is not great but its far from the worst in the league. 

This is evidenced by epa/game for defense being just below center of the pack https://rbsdm.com/stats/stats/

The run game is also statistically right in the center of the pack with the 4th lowest run percentage. 

The pass game is the best in the league adding up to the best (or second best depending on the stat) offense in the league. 

Also the Chiefs are one of the most consistent teams in the entire NFL especially looking over the past few years. In a variable league like the NFL that is very valuable.

Part of the reason the Broncos have not given up as many points is because their offense is so terrible. If their offense scored 35 points a game, they would give up a lot more points.

Look at most Chiefs games under Reid; you can look at Sunday. The chiefs were not as aggressive on offense or defense when they got up 20 points.
