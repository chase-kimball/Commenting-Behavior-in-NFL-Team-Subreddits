I think a LOT of stock is put into resumes, rather than aptitude. Or with coaching specifically, pedigree. People who took 20-30 years to work their way up the ranks to head coaching being the next spot aren't usually great candidates. And sons of coaches aren't always great candidates.

What Irsay did challenges the status quo that a lot of people think they're entitled to. If it works, it'll be pandemonium, for sure.
