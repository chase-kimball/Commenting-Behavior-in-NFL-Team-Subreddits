I learned that Only two times in the past ten years was a snap fumbled at the 1 yard line.  Both times it was Josh Allen......
I also learned today that Josh now leads the league in interceptions (and not in passes attempted for those trying to be positive here) 3 games makes a trend.  No 2nd half touchdowns in 3 games. We dropped from the 1 seed to the 6 seed in the AFC.    Our injury rotation this season is just dreadful.

He's hurt, yes, but he's played inconsistent the last couple weeks.  The Bills are currently the 6 seed, 3rd place in the AFC East.  They are not the 1 seed and are not playing like a 1 seed.  Josh Allen is not the MVP and is not playing like the MVP.  The defense really really really really misses our All-Pro DB's that are out.  the D-line gets gashed by anyone that wants to run them over.  They show up at times but it feels like every year were good for a few 80 yard TD runs with the excuse of ""we just overplayed it"".    

Were 6-3  and on the outside looking in.  Gabe Davis is awesome (sometimes) but he was supposed to have a breakout year and that didn't happen.  iMac was supposed to be our next slot guy and he's been absent for long stretches.  We still score thanks to talent on offense but the defense is hit or miss right now.

7029,45005,45005,DaXss23,"Its more so how in 6 years with the current HC, the Bills still do not have a consistent running game for 4 years straight now, and that every single year the coaching staff still chokes away games in the most unimaginable ways possible in games that we were ahead in and should have easily won. Think that is why these takes are now starting to appear everywhere, because its the same choke jobs year in and year out in big moments.

Can this change? absolutely. But people are annoyed how its not improved in 6 years, or how a defensive minded head coach cannot fix the run defense, or establish a consistent running game to take the pressure off Josh Allen. Which, defense and run game are supposed to be defensive head coaches specialties.

I hated Daboll too, but the more I think about it, maybe our offense got boring at times because he was reeling in Josh Allen when he sensed Josh was getting reckless, and now that Dorsey/McD do not do that, we're seeing what happens.

Josh played a damn good game yesterday until late, when it seemed like Dorsey's play calling switched to hero ball for reasons we will probably never know, I just think mainly people are talking about this now because the Bills on paper have one of if not the deepest rosters in the NFL, and we still have not reached a super-bowl, which is going to get people (myself included) questioning if the head coach can get us to the super-bowl or if hes just a playoff coach but not a super-bowl coach.",24.0,buffalobills,t3_yva74r,False,0.0,:BUF:,2022-11-14T14:01:42Z,buffalobills,0.065825778889656

19937,136382,136382,PoogeneBalloonanny,"Agree on the draft evaluation part mostly but not fully, cba to go into it fully (for now)

But there have also been other non-draft evaluation related questionable moves in the past:

* Star Lotulelei from the signing to begin with and the choosing to restructure as opposed to outright cut
* Everyone from the press and the fans thought Trent Murphy was going to be a cap casualty in his final contract year for us, Beane surprised everyone by keeping him on where he ended up bringing in nothing as we all expected (has since not played a down)
* Likewise afterwards with the signings of ex-Panthers Addison and Butler, and the subsequent refusal to cut them, similar to Murphy
* Overall with Star, Addison and Butler we have just shown a bit too much faith in ex panthers
* Said multiple times to the media that the 2021 DE FA class was weak, hence why they went back to back DEs in the draft. But that class had Judon who is NE's only bright spot in the last 2 years, Hendrickson who balled out in 2021 (albeit missing time and coming a bit down this year, but he also has a 1 year out in his Cinci contract) and Carl Lawson who was only a bad move with hindsight goggles on due to his camp achilles tear (he has been good for the Jets this year)
* Giving OJ Howard a fully guaranteed deal when he wasn't a roster lock

(Not draft evaluation but overall holistic draft and offseason related philosophy) My biggest gripe with him was (seemingly) purposely choosing to ignore IOL between 2020 and 2021:

* We had fuckall run game in 2020, mostly but not completely due to our bad run blocking
* While Beane and the media spoke about how we lacked pass rush in the AFCCG, Allen was running for his life and Chris Jones basically set up camp in our backfield in the same game, alongside having no run game (this fact seemed to be mostly forgotten by both fans and press)
* So we extended Feliciano on albeit a cheap deal (understandable if he was for depth) but otherwise make NO additions to IOL outside of Forrest Lamp and a 7th round pick
* Fast forward to 2021: we still had fuckall run game, and IOL lost us some crucial games like Pittsburgh and Jacksonville as Josh again had to run for his life with a turnstile in front of him
* In the draft we went 1st DE, 2nd DE, 3rd OT.

So those are examples of *good* defensive football somehow?

Apart from our Gabe Davis TD, the longest play in the *entire league* at the halfway point of the season was 81 yards and it was a pass play. We gave up a fucking run play that equalled that because of 1 bad miss tackle and a poor angle from a PS safety.

In the context of the game, this run came on the FIRST PLAY after our offense woke up and put us up 3 scores for the first time.

We literally got away with 12 men on the field in the final overtime stop, we probably lose the game without the offense going on the field had the refs done their job right.

4th and 18 in a do or die situation, I don't know what the average probability of conversion is for a normal defense but I'd wager <20%. Cam Lewis went for a selfish interception rather than the batdown, when we all thought this team had learned from literally the same thing happening with the Hail Murray.

Also, I'm a fucking nobody but I was thinking ""maybe in critical pass situations, we should double their only viable target and play zone for everyone else"".

Since Daboll left:

* We don't motion anymore
* Mckenzie gets like 1 jet sweep every 2 games
* We don't manufacture TE production anymore (Knox is just a checkdown)
* (I'm not the one calling for Reich btw, just responding to play calling) we traded for a scatback weapon in Hines and we don't seem to know what to do with him
* Our screen game sucks

The big non-Daboll related playcalling issue:

* We cannot (or choose not to) get long methodical drives done late in close games with a lead
* Whether this be running the ball and/or continuing the short passing game with high percentage throws
* This happened  in the Bal, GB, NYJ and Min games. Chewed up no clock and gained no points.
* The beauty of what Daboll managed (with a more handicapped run game) was using the pass as an extension of the run, esp on 1st down (typical wide open 4-7 yard easy pass, to any WR/RB/TE), setting up 2nd and short which really was our true first down.
* If the first down results in 2nd and 1/2, then yea that can free up some deep shot options but please just get to 2nd and short first
* Dorsey has shown he can replicate that, but somehow goes away from that in our critical drives.
* Not only that, but Dorsey is far less handicapped in the run game (Daboll was minus Saffold, Bates for most of the season, Williams backing up Spence, no Kromer) so if anything it should be easier for him to mix it up on these crucial ""4 minute drive"" situations

Seattle's stadium is loud, but isn't leaps and bounds above the competition. KC gets equally as loud as they had a back and forth for the world record.

> Constructed to contain crowd noise is the Seattle Seahawks Century link. It has long been considered the loudest arena after hitting a nerve-wracking 137.6 decibels during the 2013 season.

It pretty much becomes a moot point since at these levels conversation is difficult and the higher levels have diminishing returns.


My point being it's easier to adjust and account for noise level over unbearable heat. Cold as well is easier to combat since clothing, heaters, sideline jackets, and physical activity that they're doing produce heat. While the opposite isn't true for playing in hot conditions.
