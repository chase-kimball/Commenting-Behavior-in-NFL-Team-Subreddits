2. You're not trying to overcome the defense in 1 year. You just need him to learn the offense and get good on the offense so that when you finish building the defense the following year you already have a complete team. The only real difference in strategy is that instead of building defense first this year you'd build offense first. And even then you don't need to spend a plethora of picks. A QB, WR, a center in mid rounds, RB2 late and you've set your QB up for success. The rest can be defense and the next year you can still get more defensive players.

Instead you take the QB you want and make sure he has enough around him IN THE OFFENSE to be successful. You can still build the front 7 this year but it's not going to all get fixed in one year anyways. Let your QB learn, grow and get costed by the defense for a year rather than being left in QB limbo. Yes there's another way to build the team but as I said this is an aggressive way.  
  
Also it's not like bringing in an offensive HC means bad defense or that the defense can't be fixed. Ex. The 49ers have a highly regarded offensive coach and an elite defense.

If you think the offense has been worse than the defense this year you’re playing yourself. The defense clearly needs way more help than the offense in more ways than just personnel. What happens if we build a good defense and Mills can suddenly play with better field position and not perpetually trying to come back in games? Mills might still be the answer, at least in the short term. Stroud and young may be good players- neither of them are good enough to overcome a horrific defense. 

Look at any of the last Super Bowl contending teams. They’ve built the team first, THEN gotten their quarterback. Even if you hit on the QB, taking him too early in the rebuild effectively closes your window because by the time he gets good or you accumulate peripheral talent around him, you have to pay him and you can’t keep the nucleus that made you good to begin with.

Look at the top 15 projected teams rn. In the top 10 alone- the raiders may have to part with Carr, the panthers and saints both will be looking for their long term answer, as may the Lions. Then you get into teams like the Packers, Falcons, Cardinals, Commanders, Colts who are probably in the boat of being QB needy. There’s a lot of opportunity to trade back and still get really great defensive talent. I don’t think we’ll see a situation like this past draft where there’s only 1 QB in the first and then the rest of the top ranked prospects go through the mid rounds. And we can’t discount Miami trying to trade back into the first round if they really fall in love with someone since they got their pick forfeited. We may well end up with 3 first round picks and could possibly end up with 2 of Carter, Anderson, Murphy, Bresee, Smith on the defensive side of the ball.

Hopefully Lovie is gone and we go all in on front 7 this draft and in free agency.
