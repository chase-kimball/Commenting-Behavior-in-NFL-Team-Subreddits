Same with the Deebo stats if he only gets one or two throws his way then his stats are going to go down in air yards compared to last year. Or if he is only getting one or two carries from the back field then his YAC stats will go down too by comparison.

13813,108051,108051,MajorWuss,"I understand what you are saying. I just disagree. I think the idea of developing a qb who really hasn't shown the skill is a bad idea at this point. Especially when it's a guy who has barely played since high school. Especially when he's proven to be injury prone. What if he misses say, 4 games next year? 

I think they are gonna have to keep a capable backup. I think it will be jimmy. I hope they move on from both jimmy and trey although, Jimmy is playing extremely well this year. I think lynch and shanny really messed up the timing, but they meant well. Ideally you transition to a new qb with enough talent around him to make his mistakes not stand out.

I also think shanny wants a mobile qb really bad. He talked about the way treys ability to run changes the angles the defense has to play. I think it's less about Jimmy's ability and more about Kyle's scheme. 

Finally, most of it is not Trey's fault. The organization mismanaged the timing. Then trey started getting hurt. I'm worried about a few things moving forward:

None of the players have complained about jimmy. None. Many of the players talk a little about treys potential, but mostly about how smart and likable he is. I'm worried that it is football speak for not good enough. They also haven't been talking about trey for weeks and weeks. There was no hesitation ending Trey's season. Zero. The media even tried to offer the narrative that trey could be ready just before playoffs. Shanny shut that down immediately. It almost seems like the organization is preparing for a pivot. Finally, what will losing games with trey look like for guys spoiled since jimmy came? Will guys give up and leave the team? They are really tight knit right now, and have been for a while. I don't think there are many in that organization that don't believe in jimmy. I think that there are many who don't believe in trey. 

Why foist that upon the team? Move on and draft someone else. Might I suggest Cameron Ward out of WSU. He looks like an under the radar NFL talent.

14054,109456,109456,MasterOfRajanomics,"The game actually ended as soon as Peterson got the interception. The rule is the other team gets to possess the ball once if the first team kicks a FG on their opening drive. Possess once. So if Pat Pete fumbled and a Buffalo player recovered it and ran for a TD, I don't think it would count because that would be a separate possession for Buffalo. 

This exact scenario sort of played out in a game a few years back, I think the 2nd drive team fumbled, and after the guy picked it up he fumbled again, but it was explained the game ended when the 2nd team's possession resulted in no points. 

Now I don't know what happens if Pat Pete runs it back for a TD (I doubt any DB would be dumb enough to try, maybe if it was a point blank pick six). But I think as soon as there is an interception at all, chances are the play is blown dead, maybe not but that would be my best guess. Because OT is supposed to be sudden death, with a few caveats of course, but as soon as there is a change of possession, the game ends.
