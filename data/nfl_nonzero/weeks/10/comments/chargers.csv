Also, with the speed the Dolphins have at receiver its basically impossible to play man coverage so as long as Tua keeps hitting key shots against zone coverage the offense will keep ticking.

9372,48115,48115,DrewDonut,"Before people start criticizing ""why didn't the Chargers trade him if there was interest?"": the Chargers wanted to keep Tillery as a depth piece and a pass rush specialist on the interior. Obviously they felt none of the offers were good enough for them to go in a different direction than this.

The situation changed after the trade deadline, and Austin Johnson was injured against the Falcons. As a response to Johnson's injury, the Chargers elevated Fehoko & Gaziano. Staley said ""Tillery was 'not necessarily' going to take on a bigger role with Johnson out"" ([from Popper](https://theathletic.com/3846441/2022/11/11/chargers-jerry-tillery-49ers/)).

Tillery obviously did not take this well - because he probably expected he was a player that was an injury away from getting his starting role back. His expectation that he was gonna get this spot probably came into conflict with this coaching staff's emphasis on competition (a positive example of this is Michael Davis). Tillery became a detriment to the team, locker room, coaching staff, etc. - so they decided to move on, and at this point, all they can do is release him.

EDIT: This makes me give Michael Davis even more credit, considering how he responded. And he responded this way as a CB that got a big extension - not a disappointing player on the last year of his rookie deal after his extension wasn't picked up. I think Staley also deserves credit for getting Michael Davis to *want* to buy in, and succeed on this team; and be that dude who can step up.",51.0,chargers,t3_yvg304,False,0.0,Chargers,2022-11-14T17:27:32Z,chargers,0.0584082116161953

But just to address a few of your points  
 

* Worst OL in the league

You realize Herbert had the worst offensive line in the league in 2020 right? Our right tackle was rated worse than any player on your offensive line in 2021.  


* Worst run game in the league

In what stat? The Dolphins were ranked 21st in 2020 , 29th in 2021, and 29th in 2022 in rushing yards per game. It's not great but it's not the worst in the league. Let's keep things factual here.

* 3 terrible OCs in 2 years

You're not going to get any sympathy from me here lol. Look at our staff.  


* HC that didn't support him

Anthony Lynn literally said ""Herbert's a backup for a reason"" in his coming out game where he went OT with the Chiefs in his first game with 5 minutes notice. And let me remind you how competent Anthony Lynn was. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BvIgO4NKug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BvIgO4NKug)  


Herbert's also never played with a defense that wasn't in the bottom 10 in the league in points allowed. Tua's never played with a defense that was in the bottom 10.

2 of 3 Herbert's years our defense was bottom 3 in points allowed. Say what you will about Flores but at least his defenses weren't horrible.

Instead, Fehoko and Covington were likely the ones to fill into Austin Johnson’s spot and Tillery wasn’t happy about that. This speaks to the alleged friction between players.

17723,92781,92781,Machidalgo,"This is a very interesting article, especially when you factor the run game and how it’s struggled even when everyone was healthy on the line.

The run game has arguably been even worse. L.A.'s 25 carries on third or fourth down with two or fewer yards to go have gained an average of just 2.0 yards a pop -- 28th in the NFL. The offensive line has gotten almost no push, with the average carry losing 0.2 yards before first contact. Perhaps this is because Lombardi repeatedly crowds the line of scrimmage with bodies in tight formations and tries to run directly up the middle: 44% of L.A.'s rush attempts in these situations have gone up the middle, per TruMedia, compared with a league average of just 32%. As a result, the Chargers have achieved a first down just 56% of the time, compared with a league average 70% rate. Austin Ekeler is a powerful runner for his size, but he's also not necessarily equipped to just run it right up the middle with a bunch of big dudes clogging his running lanes.

This can be most obviously seen in the Chargers' short-yardage struggles. Offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi repeatedly calls the same kinds of plays in those situations, and defenses absolutely know what's coming. To wit: On 27 dropbacks on third or fourth down with two or fewer yards to go, the Chargers have almost exclusively operated in the quick game. According to TruMedia, 60% of Herbert's throws on those downs have been released within 2.5 seconds of the snap. The league average is just 47%.

This play calling predictability rings eerily similar to what Golden Tate had said in the past with Lombardi’s time with the Lions.

that's not the first time this year that another player said that.
