>After a few rounds of interviews, the brass voted. It was 4-1 in favor of Sean McDermott, the Panthers' defensive coordinator, a coach who had crushed his interview and was known to be open to new ideas.

>Haslam voted for Hue Jackson, the former Raiders head coach and then-Bengals offensive coordinator. Jackson was a respected playcaller and teacher, especially with quarterbacks. Haslam told the group he felt Jackson could relate better to players. Jackson knew how hard it was to get a second chance as a head coach, and he was nervous about the rebuilding plan. He would later tell friends the team undersold him on the extremeness of the rebuilding plan, a charge that Browns executives found absurd, given the level of detail shared during the interview process.

>DePodesta wrote Haslam an email arguing that the Jackson hire went against many of the characteristics of successful coaches they had discussed. Brown met with Haslam -- there's always a race to be the last one to talk to Haslam before a big decision -- and told him he thought hiring Jackson would be a bad call. ""I hear you,"" Haslam said.

>Then Haslam flew to Cincinnati and hired Jackson, who would report directly to ownership.

>In a span of 10 days, Haslam had fully committed to two opposing football philosophies, and whether he intended to or not, he had set himself up as the arbiter of future conflicts.

I also know jones hasnt been good so far but hes a square peg right now until he learns the defense. You can see on some plays why hes a top LB. But his positioning isnt there because hes trying to cram info like its the day before finals.

Harrison is gone. LeCounte not becoming the guy hurts us, but this incoming safety group is solid. Not top solid, but day 2 solid. If Johnson, branch, and Catalon all declare... It could be *really* solid.

DT isnt great in the incoming class and unless bresee or dexter fall to the second round nobody is a difference maker off the rip. Plus, im not a fan of taking DTs in a win-now draft anyway since it takes them a long time to learn anyway. (Which is also why im not entirely giving up on elliot.)

I dont know. I just feel like blowing a draft on tackles because of need could cause you to have a bad time and just put us where we started. Iirc, Barry has taken at least one DT in every draft... It isnt like he's not spending. He just keeps missing for whatever reason.

Edit: also i really really believe just getting a single lockdown tackle can entirely change the dynamic of the line... In the same way Cam Heyward gets like zero credit in TJ watt's success. If you force a double on the inside everyone else whos only job it is to rush the qb gets in there that much easier.

4179,26548,26548,ClevelandOG,"Im not sure it's an all-in year to the point of hurting our future. Basically we have already gone all-in by getting Watson so if he returns as even a shadow of what he was in houston, we have to have sustained success and make smart use of the cap.

Like, we cant pull a Dorsey and go Monty Brewster on our cap and assets. And we need to keep drafting replacements for players that are getting older and expensive.

Also Baltimore and Cinci both have to pay their QBs big time money coming up which will cause them huge problems in the future. 

Plus, and i know a lot of people will disagree with me here, but, imo our defense is just a DT and a ballhawk FS away from being above average. I mean, everyone was talking about how good this defense would be before we saw the actual product on the field. 

I think Delpit is actually pretty good and hes shown improvement. Hes super athletic and is willing to stick his helmet into gaps, but John Johnson isnt the ballhawk that you want to compliment a player like that. 

DTs are just... A mess.

Linebacking room is actually ok if you go in with Deion Jones on a restructure, Anthony Walker, and JOK. That isnt bad at all.

Cornerbacks are fine. Edges are fine.

Like... I know the defense has been bad, but it just has a couple holes in it that once adressed can be good again. It isnt like it's an unsalvageable mess where you cut everyone. The problem is that since there is indeed a huge hole in it, once you put that hole on tape, every NFL coach is going to exploit it until you prove you can stop it. (Which they cant). Then you overcompensate (which they did). Then the entire thing falls apart and you get the Miami game.

The Cincinnati game for some reason or another (who knows) they chose not to try to exploit our huge weakness and our defense looked like world beaters. So it isnt the *entire* defense that's the problem like a lot of people are trying to say.

But yeah, if Deshaun is good, you have to be frugal and efficient in spending and drafting to have prolonged success during *his* window. You dont want to pull a Bill O'Brien.

If Watson comes back and hes bad... Well... Lets not think about that...

He talked about how he worked with both of them and was impressed how they adapted their defensive style and problem solved well in SanFran trying to combine Gus Bradley's Seattle 3-deep with Tennessee's Wide Nine 4 man front. And he was right there with them in the room listening to how they went through their process of turning that into a real NFL defense.

4189,26560,26560,ClevelandOG,"Sure thats a good point, however not a lot of teams' revenue comes from tickets specifically. Inside the stadium, It comes more from getting bodies into seats. Ie. From merchandising and concessions. The vast majority of money comes from sponsorship and media deals.

This is why when Arthur Blank in Atlanta lowered ticket prices and slashed concession prices so that fans with less money could afford to go to games he ended up making **more** money. Obviously the quality of the food isnt the best you can find in the world, but all the basic concessions are cheap.

>Granted, for fans the numbers aren’t quite as glittery as they seem once you factor in all the ancillary costs of going to a Falcons game, plus the psychological impacts that lower prices have on purchasing actions. But nonetheless, it’s like the old business-school maxim says: a $2 hot dog buys you more goodwill than a 7-9 season ever could.

>The Falcons’ cheap-eats pricing covers all the ballpark basics: soda, water, pretzels and hot dogs are two bucks; nachos, waffle fries and pizza are three; beer and cheeseburgers are a five-spot; and chicken tenders and fries are six. It is, then, realistically possible to feed a family of four at a ballgame without having to take out a second mortgage.

>“It’s working in terms of economics, but we didn’t do it in terms of economics,” Blank said. “We did it because it’s the right thing to do for the people who are supporting our business.”
