9826,65331,65331,JaedenStormes,"I think the blame game with Tom and the energy level and all that comes down to this.

Tom is the beating heart of the team. He was going through hell and disengaged, understandably. Anyone would get listless if your leader is unfocused. It's like, if he's not dialed in how should I be? Guys like Evans should have stepped up, but nobody can claim to take on a leader mantle over Tom Fucking Brady. You'd hope the coach would have installed some fire as the other canonical leader, but the only fire Bowles has is lighting his bong. 

Now that the divorce is done, Tom is dialing back in and the rest of the team sees that. Guys are starting to give that little bit of extra effort. It also helps that young players like Otton, Leavett, Camarda and R. White are learning and coming into their own, and guys are getting healthy. 

For example, we have all said ""what the hell is wrong with Evans dropping balls?"" Well, if you were playing with bruised ribs and knew you were about to get leveled by a safety, you would be thinking about protecting yourself more than securing the ball too. You'd also be not wanting the ball to hit you in the chest, considering Tom knocked Scotty Miller on his back with a pass from 20 yards out.

We all shit on Leftwich for running on 1st down, but we wouldn't mind if it consistently worked. With Leavett and White in place of Goedeke and Fournette, it is working. Not having everyone in the stadium knowing Evans is getting the ball certainly loosens up coverage, and not going 3rd and out all first half means the D isn't gassed at the end of the game.

I call great anything thats above average. Yes Leftwich has coached like shit as well. Theirs been plenty of ground balls Bradys thrown this year and missed opportunities to receivers running open and him checking down too quickly out of fear of getting hit. 

Bradys the goat obviously. But suggesting hes been his normal self this season? Nah dude. Hes been average to above average compared to his normal self.

11455,75420,75420,Kreynard54,"**Offense: B+**

We found a run game, made common sense plays, and moved the ball really well, just didn't bring it home as much as we could have scoring wise. Some dumb mistakes, and had our defense faltered this very well could have been a C. But its a team game. White is the man, he can do all the runs we need, and im a bigger fan of Vaughn than Lenny due to versatility.  Offense feels better with those guys in. Weird pick by Brady but it happens with linebackers, Evans was wide open and against most teams Brady would see that linebacker. We left points out there again, and id love for us to score over 21 sometime soon and win. BLOCKING WAS TOP NOTCH almost all the way around. 

**Defense: A**

Minus the seahawks moving the ball well in the second half, we did phenomenal slowing them down. Stopped the run, made them get away from 5 step drops and resort to the short game. Chewed up clock and gave a bend dont break on it. Tryon got pressure, White got pressure, and tbh the last few drives were Smith making amazing passes more than our defense letting it go 

**Special teams: C+**

Missed kick mainly, coverage units were on point, return blocking for punts wasn't ideal. Not knocking on them, overall its passable, but wasnt perfect. 

**Coaching: A-**

Game plans worked like a charm, not a solid A because of the obvious trick play we tried to run. We beat a VERY well coached team relatively handedly and let them stay in it with a few weird miscues/playcalls/penalties. I can really only recall 3-4 plays where i was like 'and just like that this is a ball game again'.

Hansey held his own fairly well. 

Mason probably gets away with a hold but does manage to not allow the defender to blow up the play. 

Meanwhile, Wirfs completely seals the edge from two defenders, which allow Godwin to cleanly hit his edge block 1:1.

A couple difference this game driving the perceived changes are that the Seahawks had some broken plays on defense (Julio TD), and the Seahawks offense didn’t do anything at the beginning, so we didn’t have to pass more to score (like against Rams, Steelers, Panthers, Chiefs). Furthermore, the runs were marginally more effective than in previous games… 2nd and 8 or 3rd and 6 is definitely better than before, but not so much better that our problems are solved or better than giving Brady an opportunity to pass

Totally agree re wildcat and taking the ball out of Brady’s hands. That’s my biggest reason for being pro-passing

I also have an extremely hard time believing that he invested his entire net worth into one thing like that. There are random sites reporting that he lost $650 million but I think they are actually just reporting things completely incorrectly. 

As far as I can tell, his investment, if any, was not disclosed at any point, so any news outlet reporting a loss of $650 million is speculating or reporting off of someone else's speculation. If that number is real, I'm guessing it represents the peak value of his equity, not what he invested. Like if some random scam coin ballooned to 1000x for a few days and crashed, people go on the internet and claim they lost ""tens of thousands"" but they really only put $50 in or something. 

It's possible his endorsement deal brought him a lot of early equity that rose to a large number, but I doubt he lost a bunch of his own money.",4.0,buccaneers,t3_yre84d,False,0.0,:RedJersey5: Jake Camarda,2022-11-11T06:17:40Z,buccaneers,-0.0865571743011474
