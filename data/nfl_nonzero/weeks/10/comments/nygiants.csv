4715,48718,48718,DoABarrowRoll,"it's just not doom and gloom though that's the point

we're happy we're winning but we're also able to be realistic and realize that we can still be way better than we currently are

to make criticisms and say ""we could have lost those games"" is not the same as ""doom and gloom"" or ""not enjoying the ride""

it's just an acknowledgment that this is still the team we thought would win like 7 games max coming into the year and we still have work to do

on the first thing specifically, I have full faith in Daboll, Kafka, Wink, and Schoen, but I also don't want to go into the future saying ""yup we're just going to win games by running the ball 30+ times and only throwing it when we need to""

we just got done complaining about how Judge, Garrett, and Gettleman were stuck in the 80s and you don't build a team that way in the modern NFL; I'm applying the same logic here. The difference is that the 2022 Giants staff is just flat out better and we have enough evidence built up in their resumes that they're not just going to build a team to win like it's the 80s

people like me who still criticize the team despite the success are just trying to reiterate that; there's a middle ground between ""we're 7-2 everything is great just keep doing exactly this and we'll be Super Bowl bound in a couple years with this gameplan"" and ""we actually suck ass and this is all fake""

that's where I'm at, and where I assume that other guy is at; luck and bounces and whatever are part of the sport, it's not like ""we deserve to be 2-7"" or ""we're actually a bad team but got lucky"" or like we're not happy about the team's success. We're just saying that not all wins are created equal and just because we're 7-2 doesn't mean that for those 7 wins there are no notes and we won so it's good.

raiders fans call for carrs ass to be fired and he actually gets scapegoated, then they hype up their first round qb just for him to be ass because he's coached by someone who sucks so hard at his job and getting his paychecks from a guy who cant get his head out his ass.

then after carrs gone — the only reason the best receiver in the league even went to las vegas — adams is going to wail about turning down that packers deal which offered more money and do everything in his power to go play for a real professional football team.

then there goes all their other good players because they arent mcdaniels guys, who cant/wont run his elite system(crosby, waller, renfrow)

It was designed for two teams, so anything there in terms of decorations has a temporary feel to it. Most of the stadium is gray - gray seats, concourses, etc.

The video boards by now are outdated, although they weren't 12 years ago. That's something the teams could easily fix, upgrading to 4k displays.

It's a pain in the ass to get in/out of and get around. I've been to multiple games at both the old stadium and MetLife. MetLife, if you're sitting anywhere other than the lower bowl, you have to go up/down a bunch of escalators or stairs to get to where you're sitting and the traffic flow is terrible. In the old stadium, all you had to do was take one escalator to your level and then walk left or right.
