They had an extra spot on the roster with Farley going to IR so they had to fill it with somebody, so it makes sense they would go DL with Simmons and Strong both being question marks.

In the same way I don't know that Schobert is bad news on Long, but it's not good news at the same time. It's a short week so the team and players themselves won't have any real idea of who can go until tomorrow and Thursday afternoon, so they need insurance regardless if it's a 10% chance or an 80% chance they can play.

1978,18661,18661,Bieber_hole_69,"Turning this team into an air raid offense would be a disaster. And Kliff is among the most rigid play-callers/designers there are, no way he would be accepting of scheme changes forced on him by Vrabel. This team would need a few offseasons to get to a place where we could comfortably run out of empty regularly.

Vrabel would absolutely lose his shit with an air raid OC lol. It would be like when Mike Zimmer hired John DeFilippo in 2018, Vrabel would fire Kliff by midseason because he didn't run the ball enough and it's keeping Vrabel's defense on the field for too long when we go three-and-out in 10 seconds.

Vrabel clearly has a philosophy and a type when it comes to offensive coordinator hires, from LaFleur to promoting Smith to promoting Downing, they've all spent time in the Shanahan zone run scheme and run the offense through the ground game to set up chunk play action. Whether than is determined by the personnel we have had is a question, but it's not like Henry was lighting the world on fire or Mariota was a set QB-type when LeFleur was hired and we've kept the same guiding principal during Vrabel's whole tenure to different levels of effectiveness. They made the transition from the man blocking run heavy scheme of Mularkey to the zone run scheme of LaFleur in Vrabel's first year.

I just cannot see Vrabel going away from the Shanahan zone run offense as the base scheme in the near future at a minimum. He's never going to hire an OC that will run the offense through the pass game, it's just fundamentally different from his philosophy on the game and I don't see that changing unless he makes some kind of radical adaptation. He wants the offense to control the clock and not turn the ball over, in other words he doesn't want the offense to fuck up the game for his defense. 

He's won a lot of games doing that, and even if you're a proponent of the air raid you have to admit it's an offense that can screw over defenses. You have to play defense differently if your team also runs that air raid because you're going to be on the field longer. You need to play riskier to force more turnovers when the other team is going to get more possessions. You're going to give up more yards and more points, you just have to adapt the defensive philosophy to match that and I don't think Vrabel wants to do that.",2.0,tennesseetitans,t3_yvyrly,False,0.0,11,2022-11-15T09:55:38Z,tennesseetitans,0.0018613280627757

1997,18684,18684,Bieber_hole_69,"When the Fulton inactive news broke I really thought over the plan with the defensive injuries this week, and I came out of it thinking it's a really good plan for the season going forward, assuming these guys don't have any long-term injuries since they weren't put on IR.

Coming off that near 100 snap performance on Sunday night, every defensive starter needed as much rest as they could possibly get during practice last week. With a Thursday night game coming up the next week, there had to be a choice made on how the team wanted to deal with the main three, Simmons, Dupree, and Hooker, but also the late inclusion of Fulton.

Choice 1 was to play them yesterday, but any of those guys that were banged up may have been healthy enough to play on Sunday, but definitely not at 100%. Playing them yesterday also would have pretty much guaranteed they would not be good enough to go for Thursday night either, so you get a sub-optimal performance from them and then turn around to get *no* performance out of them the next week.

Now Choice 2 on the other hand was to rest them for this entire week, basically treat it as a bye week for those guys and hopefully they are good to go on 10 days rest for TNF the next week. And if they still aren't good to go on Thursday night, then they've got another 10 days of rest before we have another game to play. Almost three weeks of rest is available to these guys without having to put them on IR.

Part of the calculation in all of this would then also have to be, do you think you can beat the Broncos down four starters on defense, (Cunningham not included in any of this since he was IR'd on Saturday.) This Broncos game is more important to our season than the Packers game since it's an AFC opponent, but really it's just marginal and not all that worth thinking about. But Vrabel and Bowen essentially bet that they could keep the Broncos under 20 points no matter how many starters weren't playing, and that was the right calculation to make.

So to keep up their end of the bargain, the offense with Tannehill and Burks back just had to get to 20. And they pretty much did that. Points were always going to be at a premium in this game, and the flea flicker call was the perfect timing to make that call for the entire season. Reminded me of the fake punt against Houston in 2018 when Gabbert was starting for Mariota. Just needed a big play any way we could get one.

With such an early bye week, the team really needs to maximize the value of this rest coming up after the TNF game. We get two of those games this year, and they could really prove to be pivotal down the stretch if we can maneuver the injuries to get guys some bonus rest during those two weeks.

If someone on salary from ESPN, The Athletic, or the Tennessean asks the standard questions that don't get as many clicks, they still get paid. If PK writes the same article that everyone else on the beat has and asks the same questions at pressers, he doesn't get paid. He has to get a different angle on everything, and that's going to make him look like an idiot sometimes. It's also going to get him some great scoops and soundbites that nobody else can get, so it's a tradeoff that, based on his site still being active four years in, seems to be working.

Obviously everyone is writing with their readership base in mind because that's who pays the bills regardless, but at a major outlet you're writing more so for your editors. If they want you to ask a question that makes you sound like a jackass, you just gotta take your lumps and ask it even if you know you're going to get a bad answer.

In a sense, PK's individual subscribers are his editors. Professional editors at least tend to know what the dumb questions are, but fans absolutely do not. Look at the average message board post, those are the people PK is writing for and they want answers to the stupidest and most irrelevant fucking questions.

I respect the project PK is doing, it's a really interesting and unique approach to the model done by The Athletic, but even more specified and reader-driven. But the dude is an asshole, and always has been. Nashville has a very soft media compared to other NFL cities, so the brashness of PK is even more jarring here.

2008,18695,18695,Bieber_hole_69,"Based on the Haskins pick, seems like we wanted to get younger at the position around Henry and made a decent investment in it.

Foreman and Henry provide exactly the same thing at the RB position, they are the same type of runner. The only thing Foreman can provide is spelling Henry when he's not on the field and it's not a situation for Hilliard, which is essentially never. Are we really going to pay Foreman double the amount of money to do what Haskins is doing on offense now?

Would Foreman even want to come back after a good season last year just to get *maybe* five carries as his maximum workload? It at least made sense for him to go to Carolina where he's a completely different back from McCaffery, even if the Panthers liked to run CM between the tackles plenty. McCaffery also has an injury history more extensive than Henry's, it makes sense for the Panthers to want insurance after how badly Hubbard had played when McCaffery was out.

I love Foreman too, I wish we would have kept him after the 2020 season, but let's be real about him. He's a 26-year-old back that's had two achilles tears and has a playstyle that does not age well. For a backup RB he also does not play special teams. Are we really going to keep another RB on the roster and active on gameday that doesn't play special teams?

Everybody in the league could have had him at multiple points over the last few years and he sat out an entire season in 2019. How many guys that play like Foreman and have his injury history go on to have several more successful seasons when their best season by far came at age 25?

Drafting Haskins was the right decision, and if Foreman gets that same contract he has in Carolina with us instead then Haskins wouldn't have been our pick. It was the best decision for Haskins to sign elsewhere as well to maximize his earnings in the time he has left to play, no way is he getting another contract in 2023 if he has 30 carries for 100 yards with us in 2022.",5.0,tennesseetitans,t3_ys1ceh,False,0.0,11,2022-11-11T08:26:56Z,tennesseetitans,0.0507888793774354

I also enjoy the Music City Audible and 2nd & Victory podcasts at times, but not constantly. I will also listen to the Spotify uploads of The Buck Reising Show on a daily basis and occasionally 3HL and Ramon, Kayla, and Will (all from 104.5), though the latter two tend to be a little less Titans focused than Buck because they feature guys who played for the Vols while Buck is a Titans beat reporter. 

Long story short, I drive and do grocery delivery for a living about 6-7 hours a day, 6 days a week, and I am able to fill 5 days a week of that without touching A to Z’s morning show by listening to Buck’s 2 hour (without commercials) daily show, the Titan Up Pod weekly, A Football Show 2x per week, Football & Other F Words, plus those 104.5 shows occasionally.
