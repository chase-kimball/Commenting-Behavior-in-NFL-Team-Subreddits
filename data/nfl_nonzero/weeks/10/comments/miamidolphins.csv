Hurts is right up there on a lot of passing efficiency metrics, but his volume is even lower than Tua's, which is where they're both getting killed by Mahomes. The rushing difference bridges some of the gap with Tua, with the additional 326 yards and 6 touchdowns bridging the gap with Tua's total yards and total touchdowns, but still leaving him quite a bit behind Mahomes. Obviously Hurts plays tonight and can do himself some more favors here.

Mahomes is on track for 47 touchdowns and 5546 yards passing (which would be an NFL record, but yeah, sure extra game). Hurts and Tua are pretty neck-and-neck right now, but no matter how efficiently either is playing, they're not going to catch Mahomes's eye-popping volume metrics.",2.0,nfl,t3_yv5qiw,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-11-14T12:24:17Z,miamidolphins,0.1343752293381344
6283,46040,46040,Cidolfus,"I'd be curious to see where you saw that. PFR has him as the best on target pass percentage in the league at 81% and his bad throw percentage is 11th (of 34) at 13.8% better than both Josh Allen (14th, 14.5%) and Patrick Mahomes (19th, 16.7%). A better than average bad throw percentage and a league best on target percentage doesn't line up with the second most uncatchable balls narrative.

He's definitely got some particularly bad throws. PFF has his turnover-worthy play percentage at 4.1%, tied for 26th of 39 qualifying. He's definitely gotten lucky on dropped interceptions. So has Josh Allen with a 4.8% TWP% (33).

I'll give you that Tua wasn't good under pressure his first two years, but his pocket presence is excellent this year.

It looks like a ""clean"" pocket cause Tua is processing reads at an insane level right now.

We lose the Ravens, Bills, Lions & Bears games without Tua - he's doing MORE than his part.

He's hit Waddle multiple times in stride this year, including his best throw of the season against the Bills. He had a dime to Tyreek against the Lions that was dropped and another potential one against the Browns where Ward made a nice play on the ball.

These 11 papers provided 20 cohorts that could be assessed using magnitude-based inferences for injury incidence rate ratio calculations pertaining to differences between surfaces. Analysis showed that 16 of the 20 cohorts showed trivial effects for overall incidence rate ratios between surfaces. There was increased risk of ankle injury playing on artificial turf in eight cohorts, with incidence rate ratios from 0.7 to 5.2. Evidence concerning risk of knee injuries on the two surfaces was inconsistent, with incidence rate ratios from 0.4 to 2.8.
