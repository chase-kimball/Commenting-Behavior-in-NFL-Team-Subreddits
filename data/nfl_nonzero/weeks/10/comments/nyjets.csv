In any case, amongst a few scandals involving fraudulent giveaways- one of their long-time active members/partners was accused of sexually assaulting some women at a few of their events. One woman has filed a police report recently and is going through the legal system. Other women have also accused this same person of doing it to them as well. It's unclear what the extent of his actions were, but multiple women all claim it was something within sexual assault to sexual harassment. The leaders of the ""jets lounge"" were made aware of this in recent months but overlooked it, kept him around, and even did an event in which the accused sexual assaulter was involved. As everyone involved in Jets Lounge started distancing themselves from it, some instead dug into this weird ignorance defense, that is clearly bunk from the amount of people who have shown/expressed that they told them about it far earlier. Mainly the ""leader/owner"" of Jets Lounge.

In any case, it's an incredible trainwreck to watch, as the leader openly said to a group of 700 strangers that his wife no longer allows his son to talk to him because of this. and that's one of the funniest things i could've ever imagined hearing during the Jets Lounge leader's long 2 hour ramble about nothing.",89.0,nyjets,t3_yvyl7n,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-11-15T09:11:42Z,nyjets,0.048220059369021
