If you believe poles can fix everything in one off season, then there's nothing to worry about. Barring injury there is no reason to think fields can't remain a 3rd down cheat code.

And if his career arc follows Kaepernick, cam, lamar or Steve Young it doesn't matter if it ends in a super bowl win before his rookie deal ends.

If poles misses on a key player or injuries derail any of the next 2 or 3 seasons. Then passing becomes a concern. Not a he can't fix it concern. But a concern.

39951,238568,238568,dafoo21,"So basically, there are rules set in place for the defense and the offense. If the defense breaks a rule, the offense is either given less yards to get to reset your chances (ie 1st and 5 instead of 1st and 10, but it can happen on 2nd, 3rd or 4th chance. [2nd, 3rd and 4th down]. So a 2nd and 10 can turn into a 2nd and 5 if the defense breaks a rule on the offense's 2nd chance) or automatically get a new set of chances to gain another 10 yards (ie the offense is on 3rd and 10 and the defense breaks a rule and the offense gets reset back to 1st and 10). It all depends on the severity of the rule. You will need to learn severity on your own, though. Or ask your friend.

The inverse happens on the offense breaking rules. They can go from 1st and 10, to 1st and 20, if they break a rule. Or say, they gain 7 yards on their first try. It normally would be 2nd and 3, but the offense committed a penalty, so the offense then gets pushed back towards their endzone and it will go back to 1st and 10 + the penalty yards (so 1st and 25, lets say).

So if that doesnt help, to put it simplified, if the offense breaks a rule, they will need to go back closer to their own flag/endzone. If the defense breaks a rule, then the offense will get a no effort needed resolution of getting closer to the opponents flag/endzone. 

The only thing that pops to mind that is relevant in other sports is in baseball. If a pitcher balks, the base runner is moved up to the next base.",1.0,nfl,t3_ywl7sv,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-11-16T01:14:37Z,chibears,-0.0001301634251601
39952,238569,238569,dafoo21,"So, the basis of american football is for the team that has the ball (the offense), to advance across the field to enter the other teams endzone (which rewards them with 6 points). This is pretty easy to understand, as the one team that does control the ball, is going a specific direction, and the team that doesnt have the ball (the defense), is trying to stop them from moving the ball in that direction. Basically like capture the flag. You dont want the other team to get your flag, so you protect your flag (or endzone) by not letting the team with the ball get closer to your side of the field.

To advance closer to the defensive endzone, The offense get 4 tries to make it atleast 10 yards. There will be a bunch of times where this will either be less or more than 10 yards, but only if infractions are called or you lose your position/yards and move backwards. Your friend should be able to explain the penalty for an infraction or losing yards.

But, without infractions on the offense , each time the team with the ball gets 10 yards or more, the number of tries/chances resets back to 4 chances. So, if the offense is on their 3rd chance and needs to get 4 yards to get to a total of 10 yards (3rd and 4), if they get the 4 yards or more, then the tries/chances reset back to 1 (1st and 10). 

If on the offense's 4th try (4th down), they dont think they can reach the remainder of the 10 yards or want to take a huge chance of trying again on their 4th try, they have 3 options: 

1. The offense can try again on the 4th try to get to those 10 total yards. If the offense doesnt make it, the ball is automatically given to the other team. The other team will then get the ball at the same spot the offense was at. This matters, because if the team with the ball is close to their own flag/endzone, and they dont make the 10 yards, the other team will get their chances closer to their enemy's flag endzone.  

2. If the offense does not want to try to get the remainder of the 10 yards on their 4th try, they can choose to kick the ball( player is the punter) to the other team and towards the other teams endzone and make that team begin their chances closer to their own flag (their endzone). Alot of the time, this is the proper choice, so that you are not letting the other team start fresh close to your flag/endzone. 

3. If the offense thinks that they can kick a ball through the 2 yellow poles (a place kicker), this is an option to get 3 points instead of 6 points. If the place kicker cant kick the ball through the poles and misses, the other team will start their chances where the kicker missed the kick. 

Again, this is the basics so you can understnad at the basic level. Your friend will fill you in on the rest,",4.0,nfl,t3_ywl7sv,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-11-16T00:30:11Z,chibears,0.0224190520085235

Both had notable speed, both had concerns about a ceiling behind ST play, both had some red flags, both are superior athletes who were just emerging on offense in their final year in college. For better or worse, Poles was creating and searching for a bargain archetype and VJJ was, like Hill, probably one of the bigger “high ceiling low floor” picks at that point if the draft.

Considering Poles was around KC and Hill, if that’s what he saw then the upside is worth a 3rd round pick., even knowing it’s a high risk, high reward type selection. If we’d had a 1st or picked on offense in the 2nd I don’t think the Jones pick would get nearly as much criticism, but because it was the first offensive pick by a new regime (with a promising young QB) it gets way more attention and critique than a normal 3rd rounder would.",1.0,chibears,t3_yu58hw,False,1.0,69,2022-11-13T10:33:48Z,chibears,-0.0650656

You acted like YPA and PPG and PPP mean nothing. Then YOU moved the goalpost to completion % which nobody had spoken of. Which is fine bc if you’re begging for Fields to improve, he’s gone from a terrible 54% through the Wash game to 64% the last month while shattering QB rushing records. 64% is league average, not bottom 3, and not even bottom 10. Josh Allen is around 64%. Rodgers is at 65%. Cousins is between them. He will finish the year low because of the first part of the season.
