Since I can only assume Terry and Arthur didn't show up to their interviews with a seven year plan to get the team up and running, the falcons need a franchise qb within the next 2 years to capitalize on cap space, have a talented roster with a cheap good qb and probably not lose their jobs

The first half of the season mariota was still playing poorly behind the best (just mediocre) oline we've had in years.

This idea that everything has to be ideal for a rookie qb to start is a little overblown. 

He has 3 of the best safety valves in the game to work with (Pitts, London, Patterson) and a great run game. Design it to be a quick passing, still run first offense and you're developing Ridder more than you are giving him 15 practice reps as the backup

The falcons haven't had a good Oline in over half a decade and the new FO didn't draft a lineman till the 6th round (now on the practice squad).
