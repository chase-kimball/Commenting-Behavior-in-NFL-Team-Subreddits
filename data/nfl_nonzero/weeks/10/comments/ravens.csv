4632,22997,22997,BlackandPurpleHeart,"Yeah so true. People don't understand how little the ravens spend on offense espeically at wr postion. 

All Lamars wrs have been under 6ft, mid rd to undrafted guys, aged out vets like willie sneed dez Bryant coming off a terrible injury and not playing for like 2 years and now desean Jackson who litterally caught 1 pass in 1 game and hurt, seth roberts,john brown at the end of his career and I'm sure theres more I've forgot. 

The only 2 wrs ravens we grabbed in the 1st is 5'8¬† Hollywood who at the time was 150 pounds when aj brown and dk were on the board. No offense to Hollywood cause he came on later with his career with us and in the playoffs but he is too small to block, hard to get the 50/50 ball and he droped some passes too. He also avoided contact for like a year or 2 but I kind of understand he didnt really have his football body till year 2. 

Bateman came in injured and is injured again this year, hes shown small flashes but the way he hyped is just ridiculous cause he really hasnt done shit yet. 

Another thing is this team has always been a run 1st team. We always draft te's, oline and rb and poor the money into defense, we do the same shit now with lamar. I hate when ppl say they built this around Lamar sure new plays we couldnt we run with any qb we had before but were still drafting the same and just not appreciating the wr postion. This weekend is proof that wrs bail out qbs no matter if they are decent great or elite. 

I just get sad thinking how Lamars rookie window has closed and we really didn't do alot to take this offense to the next level. 

We are stuck in 2000-2012 mode but the game is really built around the passing game is with the rules and all the pi the league wants high scoring games.

I respect Lamar so much he does more with less than anybody and I feel some of the criticism he gets is just fucking ridiculous. Proud hes my qb and hope he stays but I would understand if he leaves.",4.0,nfl,t3_yvfs3a,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-11-14T20:12:18Z,ravens,0.0288459131384242

Coaches are more fallible than you think, but the big thing may be personnel.  The Ravens have a really talented secondary when healthy and the d-line is good enough to get pressure rushing 4/5.  Marlo is good enough to blank anyone but an elite WR (I do believe he was doing a decent job of blanking Waddle before he went down) and the rest of our secondary is generally good at limiting WR1s as a unit.  We held Diggs to his lowest total yards all year and no scores, for example.

Also, not to take away from Tua, but Hill is a huge reason for your success thus far.  He's a fantastic player, but he's also been a problem in the AFC for years now and come December/January, teams like Buffalo and Baltimore have had years of experience in planning to limit him.  Speaking to the Ravens, I know that putting aside the 4th quarter collapse against the dolphins this year, we've done a rather decent job of limiting him in our last few outings since he burned the fuck out of us in our first few game against him.

The salt in the wound was that it also paved the way for them to win the SB. That loss to Indy was rock bottom for me as a Ravens fan, and that's saying a lot considering how many frustrating season ends we've had since then:

-08/09: lose to archrival in the AFC championship, paving the way for their Super Bowl win 

-09/10: Meh, the loss to the Colts was frustrating but we were a heavy underdog and already playing with house money after stomping the Pats in Foxborough a week earlier. Almost didn't include this one. 

-10/11: eliminated by our archrival again, this time in the divisional round, after blowing a 2-score 2nd half lead, having a would-be go-ahead punt return TD overturned on a questionable holding call in the fourth, and giving up a crucial 3rd & 19 with two minutes left

-11/12: Cun*iff

-14/15: Fuck Dean Pees

-16/17: Christmas Nightmare

-17/18: Tyler Boyd

-18/19: people forget about this one, very frustrating loss to the Chargers, lots of self-inflicted wounds that dug us into a 20 point hole in the 4th that we nearly clawed back from, only to stall out at the end
