Keep a game manager type QB till we have a roster capable of winning a superbowl. He either wins us a Superbowl or...

From there we can trade a first as well as multiple future 1sts to trade up in a future draft for a generational talent.

 We could also take the Rams method and trade for a proven premier top 5 to top 10 QB. You can get away with their cap hit generally by extending their contract and then back loading the remaining years if your team really is just a QB away.

I'd prefer trading up in the draft for a generational talent if Ridder doesn't prove to be capable of going the distance since trading for a top 10 QB is gonna run you damn near the same as trading for a top 5 pick.

I don’t understand why some fans don’t understand why it’s a possibility, and why we keep being mentioned as the main destination if he doesn’t stay in Baltimore. 

1. He wants big guaranteed money. We have cap space like no one but the Bears. 

2. We don’t have a franchise QB right now, with a 3rd rounder being a possibility to try and be that against big odds.

3. We play in a weak division with no current franchise QBs, and every team looking at obtaining one this offseason. 

4. We play in a weaker conference with Hurts and Stafford and Dak the best QBs if Rodgers moves over to the AFC or retires. 

5. Rodgers likely goes to Vegas or the Jets. 

6. Jimmy G likely goes to the AFC as well. 

7. The Ravens don’t want to move Lamar in conference if possible and Atlanta helps that cause.
