Keep a game manager type QB till we have a roster capable of winning a superbowl. He either wins us a Superbowl or...

From there we can trade a first as well as multiple future 1sts to trade up in a future draft for a generational talent.

 We could also take the Rams method and trade for a proven premier top 5 to top 10 QB. You can get away with their cap hit generally by extending their contract and then back loading the remaining years if your team really is just a QB away.

I'd prefer trading up in the draft for a generational talent if Ridder doesn't prove to be capable of going the distance since trading for a top 10 QB is gonna run you damn near the same as trading for a top 5 pick.

1. He wants big guaranteed money. We have cap space like no one but the Bears.
