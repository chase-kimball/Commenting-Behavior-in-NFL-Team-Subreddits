If anything is disingenuous, it would be this comment. If McDaniel currently had Albert Wilson, Jakeem Grant, and DVP as his WRs, Tua would look very similar to how he looked with Flores. If Flores had the WR corp McDaniel has, Tua would look pretty similar to how he currently looks with McDaniel. 

Us having a top 3 WR corp is the biggest reason why Tua has looked much better, not McDaniel ""turning"" Tua into a much better QB. 

Also, you say Flores sucked as if we had a 12-13 win SB contending caliber roster that he ""only"" got 9 to 10 wins with. The roster we have right now is by far better than anything Flores had, and McDaniel's on the field coaching ability is seen in a much more positive light for going 9-8 because he's a player's coach and he showed a lot of support of Tua. 

He had his flaws with managing personalities and couldn't build a great staff, but saying he ""sucked"" doesn't sound like you're being objective about him at all, or maybe you don't know what a truly bad coach looks like.

I haven't seen this. He's great side to side, not so much up and down. He's always been a very boom or bust RB, the same way Kenyan Drake was for us. This year was one of his more consistent years of running, but he still only averaged 4.4 YPC. He had very high yardage because he was one of the few workhorse backs left in the league, so he had a ton of carries. Prior to this year, his YPC was 3.7 in 2021, 1.8 in 2020, 4.6 in 2019, and 5.0 his rookie year. So 2019 was the last year I'd say he was an efficient runner, and that was 4 years ago. 

His YPC and YPR peaked his rookie year, but he's still seen as a great runner because he sometimes has these huge runs he breaks out. If he only averaged 4.4 YPC this year with Daniel Jones, who is a massive running threat, imagine how it'll goes with a stationary QB in Tua.

>A big issue the team had is that we really had no one on the roster that could convert a third and short.

Barkley isn't that guy either. Like I said, he's boom or bust, he isn't a consistent runner. In fact, we might take a step back in converting 3rd downs with him. He gets so many negative yardage runs trying to bust a big play. He has statlines such as 15 carries for 22 yards, 20 carries for 53 yards. In his better years a few years back, 13 carries for 1 yard, 8 carries for 10 yards, 14 carries for 28 yards. 

If you want to fix our 3rd and short problem, it shouldn't be Barkley you look towards. 

I just decided to look up Barkley's rank in negative runs. Last season he had the 4th most. The two other times he played a full season was in 2019 and 2018. In 2019 he ranked 6th.

14536,123321,123321,MiaCannons,"As I said, I just think it's a case of diminishing returns.

For example, right now let's say we had the option to add AJ Brown for 25M a year. AJ Brown is obviously a fantastic WR1, and a top 10 WR, and clearly he'd be a massive upgrade from our WR3, but it wouldn't make much sense to do so. We already have Tyreek and Waddle taking who get most of the targets and being very productive and efficient. Brown *might* clear 1k for us, but we clearly would not be getting our money's worth in regard to his production because we have too many mouths feed.

That's the way I feel about Saquon. He's a solid runner but what people really crave him for is his receiving ability. We already have Tyreek, Waddle, and Sherfield open every other play. Throwing to them will usually be a bigger net gain than throwing to Saquon. We also had Mostert who was open for checkdowns very often, but just didn't get the ball passed to him. He was great when Tua checked the ball down to him.

Paying a premium for Saquon just doesn't make much sense to me when there's so many other positions that could use an upgrade right now. We'd be paying a premium for a definite upgrade at RB, but the production wouldn't reflect the cost, unless the cost is much lower than the apparent 12.5M that Barkley may want.

Mostert can be that short outlet that frees up the middle. As I said before, he was open very often throughout the season but just didn't get the ball.

If he was, the Giants would quickly franchise tag him because 10M isn't a crazy amount for a top tier RB. Problem is he isn't, and we shouldn't be the ones to pay like he is just like we did Gesicki.

Any fit thrown should be that we'd be giving up valuable cap space for a luxury the same way we did with Gesicki.

14541,123328,123328,MiaCannons,"The way you talk about Saquon is the way people were talking about Gesicki. In theory, Gesicki was supposed to eat because Tyreek and Waddle would be taking double teams and opening up space for Gesicki. In actuality, Gesicki had his least productive season since his rookie year partially because of his blocking issues, and partially because throwing to Hill and Waddle paid much better dividends. 

Saquon would be another ""Sounds good in theory, won't do nearly as much in actuality"" cases. As a runner, he's solid, not elite. He's very boom or bust, but people think he's better than he is as a runner because of his highlight plays (Kind of like how people think Gesicki's better than he is for the same reason.) What makes him really valuable is his receiving ability. 

The problem is we already have two receivers in Hill and Waddle who usually find a way to be open every other play, and Tua loves throwing to them. Hell, throw in Sherfield too and there's a WR open *every* play. Why would he force the ball to Saquon for a 5-10 yard checkdown when an open Waddle, Hill, or Sherfield will get him an easy 12+ yards? Saquon would be at his most valuable the rare occasions where Hill and Waddle have problems getting open, like the Chargers or Patriots games, but why pay him a premium when we only need to lean on him a couple games a year? 

Then there's also injury concerns to think about. Yes, last year he finally played a full season, but before that he missed time every single year and got the injury prone label. If our starting RB gets injured, I'd rather we be in a situation where we have two capable RBs that we're not paying much money (Mostert and Wilson combined to cost 4M last year), than have Saquon take up 10M on his own and have nothing behind him.",5.0,miamidolphins,t3_118cyym,False,0.0,TUA TONGUEY,2023-02-21T16:25:38Z,miamidolphins,-0.00508372165394

I do rankings for this sub and had you guys #4, and a majority of rankers who represent the other 31 fanbases had you guys top 5 as well. There were two outliers, one ranker who had you guys at #9 and one that had you guys at #8.

Sure there were a couple media talking heads making hot takes about you guys possibly not making the playoffs, but a vast majority of the media had you guys as elite prior to the season starting too. There will always be idiots making bad takes or some members of the media that try to go viral with a hot take, but that represents the minority of the media, not the majority.
