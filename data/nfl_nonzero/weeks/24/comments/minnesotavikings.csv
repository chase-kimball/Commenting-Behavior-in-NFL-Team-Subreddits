In the 2001 playoffs, they got bailed out by the tuck rule, and then Vinatieri made two kicks in a blizzard to tie ans then win the game, a week later he gets knocked out of the game and Bledsoe wins against the Steelers, and then during the Super Bowl, the Pat's held one of the best offenses ever to 14 points, including a pick 6, to keep the offense in the game. Did Brady come thru when he needed ? Absolutely, I'm not denying that, but it was a gigantic team effort that needed a lot of luck to go there way. And that's kind of the story with those Pats SB teams, they were gigantic team efforts, but people just attribute them to Brady. And credit to Brady, the years the Pat's didn't have elite defenses or weapons, him and BB still got them to 12 wins, and even a Super Bowl like that 2011 team, and he 90 percent of the time, met the moment, and the only other QB who can match that is Montana, but he also just had much better support to met that moment compared to some other QBs, and I think that's fair to say.

If the player trying to return the punt touches the ball (or any player on the team who is trying to return the ball), the ball is able to be picked up by the kicking team.  Therefore, if the player who is responsible for catching it fails to do so, it can potentially be recovered by the team that kicked it, allowing their offense to regain possession.

Florida: Bucs barely made the playoffs with the GOAT, and are nearly 56 million over the cap at the moment. Jags aren't moving on from Trevor for Kirk. I doubt the Dolphins are moving on from Tua either. 

Illinois: Not a contender, and if they were they aren't moving on from Fields anyway. 

Indiana: Not a contender, and they have a chance to draft the QB of the future. 

Maryland: Ravens can tag Lamar for cheaper than Kirk would cost, and I doubt he would agree to back to Washington under any circumstances. 

Michigan: Lions aren't moving on from Goff. 

New Jersey: Giants will likely tag Jones, again, for cheaper than Kirk costs. 

Nevada: 7th overall pick. Are they going to trade for a mid QB when they can draft a top rookie? Doubt it. 

Ohio: Browns can't, Bengals won't. 

Pennsylvania: Phiily is an obvious no. Maybe the Steelers would want to let Pickket learn from him for a year, but they are currently projected at -138K cap space.  

Tennessee: Lateral move to get rid of Tanny for Kirk. No reason this would happen. 

Texas: Cowboys can't afford to move on from Dak and pay Kirk. Texans aren't contenders and are set to draft their QB of the future. 

Wisconsin: They aren't trading him in the division.
