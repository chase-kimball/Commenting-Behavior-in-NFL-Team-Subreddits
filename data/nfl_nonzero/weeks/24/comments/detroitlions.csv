I'm moreso coming from the perspective that **if** Holmes and co are confident in their ability to maximize Richardson's ability, then he has to be the pick.

I think people take their opinions on players way too seriously at this point in the offseason cause it's not based on much (neither is mine). That's why I'm not arguing that Richardson *is* the guy, I'm saying if Brad and Dan think he's their guy, then it's *much* smarter to pull the trigger on him at #18 than to kick the can down the road with no plan for the future.

Sure, we're fine at the position *for now*, but what happens when Goff's contact is up? Are you okay with paying him $50 mil per year or more? Cause that's what's gonna be necessary if Daniel Jones is asking for $45 mil rn.

If you **do** re-sign Goff for that price, it hampers us in other areas long term. Gonna be way harder to resign players like Sewell and St. Brown and won't have significant room in FA if we keep all 3 under contract. Would a random defender at #18 drastically change this scenario? I think that's unlikely, especially when we've got 2 2nds that could change the defense just as much.

If you **don't** re-sign Goff then there's no plan whatsoever at the position unless we spend a fortune to trade for a disgruntled vet or to trade up in the draft.

6341,38021,38021,ChefCurrySauce,"Nice to see someone doing work like this in bo_77’s absence. Quick and enjoyable read. If you don’t mind, I’ve got a few tips for you from someone who writes for a living:

- Try to mind your punctuation and spelling (i.e. putting a semi colon where a colon should go, effect instead of affect, etc.). This may seem minor, but proper spelling, grammar, and sentence structure triggers a subtle bias in people to be more open and to lend more credence towards what you have to say. Don’t just guess if you don’t know what version of a word to use or where punctuation goes (like many many many people do) - look it up! This goes a long way.

- Your posts are already short, so I wouldn’t take up space with (I’ll get to that later) when “later” is like a few lines down. Be confident in your writing - people will get there when they get there.

- Try to make sure the spacing between paragraphs is even.

Historically, whenever a QB's cap hit gets into double digits we do see teams having to make significant concessions elsewhere and that usually is on the defensive side of the ball. 

Peyton Manning and Drew Brees exceeded 12.5% cap 8 times in his last 14 seasons. Brees did so 4 out of his last 8 seasons. Both suffered from not having strong defenses in the playoffs.

We also see a decline in OL play and these qbs having to rely on rookie receivers. 3 out of the last 4 seasons, Aaron Rodgers has had an average  cap hit % of 14 and he's seen is WR room depleted over that time and his defenses only ranked in the top 10 in PA just once.

I don't agree that it matters if a qb may retire in 2-3 years. It doesn't make them not top 10 if they are top 10. Daniel Jones is at best the 20th best qb currently playing. You don't pay the 20th best qb $45m a year. 

Also. He's a running qb. To me, that makes him less valuable. Daniel, kyker, Lamar, and hurts are all less valuable to me personally because they destroy their bodies running the ball. Daniel Jones will miss time. Just like Lamar always does. 

You don't actually know Daniel Jones will be playing in 5 years. But Stafford could be if he wants to. He's only 35.  Jones could get hurt on a running play 1st game of the year. Or he could just suck because every year before this year, he has sucked.  And this year, he was only mediocre imo. 3200 yards and 15 passing tds is very mediocre.

JPj is a very good scheme fit bc he's great in press man.

We are getting two potential pro bowlers, immediate impact starters and the fit is a perfect dovetail to our current needs.

Scenario A - love Witherspoon, he's the CB1 of the class. Bresee is an underachiever and literally has no plan of attack in pass rush - one note and one ineffective note only, throws his hands at the OL and hope something good happens.

Scenario B - again love the CB pick, Gonzales is a good all around LCB, not as physical as Porter but can flip his hips and run with anyone, doesn't get grabby but trusts his own speed. Mayer is a good all around TE and I'm sure he'll be successful but we have way too many defensive needs to be throwing first round capital at a devalued position. He won't make this team better.

Scenario C - Wilson used his length well, can play stand up or with is hand down, manhandles tackles. Not a great fit for AG's D rn IMO bc he doesn't set the edge, just not as good in run defense, but he's got some upside in the pass rush side. O'Cyrus is a tremendous G and while this is early I would not hate it. Takes care of an obvious need and makes our very good offensive line elite. Still, from a roster construction view I feel like we can get a like Jaxson Kirkland or Braeden Daniels four rounds later who can start at G or slide over to T in a pinch. 6th round C Ricky Stromberg is similar, you could play him at G and have a backup to Ragnow if he has more health issues.

40879,249702,249702,drfjgjbu,"The narrative around rookie QB contracts perplexes and aggravates me. The last team to win a super bowl with a QB on a rookie contract was Kansas City in 2019, and I would argue that Pat Mahomes’ main contribution to that team was being a very good QB, not just having a low cap hit. Before that, Russell Wilson was the most recent QB to start and win a super bowl while on a rookie contract, almost a decade ago. 

Yes, it is better to have an insanely good, MVP-level QB playing on a rookie contract with a minuscule impact on the cap. However, it is also good to have that quarterback with a cap hit nearing $40 million (or however high the market ends up reaching). It is exceptionally rare for a team to be in a situation where they can draft a QB who becomes one of the best in the league before the end of his rookie contract *and* build a championship-caliber team around those cap savings and that player before his rookie contract is up. The Eagles are there with Hurts, but their situation has been pretty damn unique since they drafted Wentz. Chiefs are honestly the only example I can think of of a team constructing itself in that way. 

However, every offseason every team with a veteran QB who wasn’t an MVP candidate the year before has to hear about how “you can’t build a championship roster with a highly-paid QB” or “Rookie QB contracts build championships” as justification for why they should move on and draft an exciting young rookie. The Lions were getting this talk even when we had Matthew Stafford carrying the entire team on his (repeatedly fractured) back. And then when we traded him to a veteran-laden, cap-starved Rams team they won the super bowl immediately, because there is more than one way to construct a good roster. Last year there were real people who genuinely thought the Lions should take a shot at Malik Willis at #2 overall despite glaring holes elsewhere on the roster, even though they already had a QB, because of that supposed rookie QB contract magic.

Inconsistency: Jared Goff had moments of brilliance but also struggled with consistency, especially in high-pressure situations. He often made costly mistakes and failed to deliver in critical moments.

Offensive line issues: The Rams' offensive line struggled to protect Goff, leading to many sacks and hits. This also affected the team's overall offensive performance.

Coaching changes: The Rams had several coaching changes during Goff's time with the team, which may have impacted his development and performance.

Lack of weapons: The Rams' receiving corps was not particularly strong during Goff's time with the team. This made it more difficult for him to make big plays and carry the offense.

2. We can’t just pay him $1.6M out of a rainy day fund, it would go against our salary cap. If teams could pay players under the table without effecting their salary cap, teams would just offer players a billion dollars to come and play for them and anarchy would reign. What he has to do IIRC is be a “liaison” of sorts for the team, and then they can give him that money for work done. Shit like coming to minicamp and talking to players, doing some fan meet and greets, etc. If the team just gives him the $1.6M and doesn’t have just cause to give it to him the league can penalize the franchise by taking away draft picks.

In other words, this take shouldn’t be considered all that controversial *or* insightful, imo

Edit: To be clear, just because it’s not very insightful or controversial, doesn’t mean it’s not true, important, and in need of change.
