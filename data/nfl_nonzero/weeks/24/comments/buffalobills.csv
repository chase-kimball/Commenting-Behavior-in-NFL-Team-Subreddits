If anything Khalil Shakir will be WR3 next year and he definitely has the ability to go over 1000.

Mackenzie is a weird one because he could easily go off but he’s buried in the depth chart and will randomly just forget how to play football. 

Davis could have easily gone over 1200 this year if we weren’t in the weirdest 1st year offensive play calling vortex ever. He was over 800 this year as it was and he really didn’t play as well as he should have.

9544,55855,55855,EagleRoxy2,"A lot of people underestimate how big of a hit Millers ACL was to our defense. Our D-line goes from 4th to 24th. And not saying he could have saved the game, but the Cincy game would have atleast been closer. 

One play of his that specificity comes to mind is the last play of the Chiefs game. Mahomes didn’t really make a mistake there, it was Miller making a great play. Miller broke of two linemen to flush Mahomes out of the pocket, Milano on the spy forces him to either take the sack (which he can’t do with how much time he had left) or throw and incomplete ball, which leads to the INT and the game sealer. Without Miller I don’t think we win that. 

Allen healing is elbow will also be huge. While the playcalling was albeit, subpar, it *might* have had to do with how Dorsey schemes around Allen’s torn UCL. Can’t remember exactly where but Allen said that the shirt to mid-range throws hurt his elbow the most. 

What can the Bills do to better there odds next season?

Get Frazier some help. The defense plays well against bad/midrange QBs, but starts to crumble when in a big game. Fraziers defense averages 35 points per game in the playoffs over the last 3 games. Expecting your offense to consistently score above 35 is insane

Draft O-line. Maybe pick up a few cheap off if FA but DRAFT O-LINE. I’d we draft another D-lineman in the first 1-2 rounds I may lose it 

Give Kaiir Elam and Khalil Shakir an actual role. Elam had an amazing game against Miami and deserves the starting spot for how hard he was locking up Tyreek. He almost have had 2 INT that game.

You assume I didn't read. You assume I don't understand the NFL, and how drafting later in a round, especially the first, means we don't have access to the top tier. NO SHIT. You really fucking cracked the code there genius.

Oliver has not lived up to a top 10 pick. 
Groot is ok, but he is a project. He's like Edmunds in that way, and if you bother to look back at any of my posts on him, I have been advocating to give him time since he was drafted.

Our second round picks are the biggest problem. The guys we selected are ""ok"" but it's more about who we did not choose. There are playmakers there that we bypassed, or like Basham, we selected players who would be buried in a rotation when we could have had OL, which we desperately needed.

Bernard is another fucking stupid pick. Again, even a backup OL at his selection does more for our team last year than he did. Even if he becomes a good player, he's buried behind Edmunds and Milano. We could have had a starting OL from that pick.

You mention the hits in Singletary, Cook, and Knox, but those three guys are not world beaters. They aren't exactly tearing up the league, especially since we just ignore them half the time. 

Look I get you don't want to hear that Beane isn't the God he's made out to be, but defending him when he's made serious mistakes is asinine. He has made some BAFFLING picks. Double dipping at Edge and Tackle. Not drafting OL early the past few years when guys like Creed Humphrey were available.
