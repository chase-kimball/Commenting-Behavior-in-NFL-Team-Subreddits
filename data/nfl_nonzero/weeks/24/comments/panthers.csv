The long answer is that he inherited that ""great economy"".

And particularly in terms of the housing crisis, he should have known better, because the first Subprime Housing Bubble crashed on his watch. He responded by doing nothing to advocate any reforms, and actually exacerbated the problem by failing to regulate mortgage backed securities trading and allowing investment and S&L banks to consolidate operations when he signed off on the Glass Stiegel repeal.

Clinton's amazing budgeting is also incredibly overrated. Most of his budget balancing was simply rolling back Cold War Era spending, which was easy to do absent the Soviet Union. He also slashed the absolute hell out of the social safety net, which hurt people badly when the 2008 crisis cleaned them out.

And not for nothing, but he was a fucking scumbag. He lied to the American people constantly, he had a number of nakedly corrupt cabinet officials, and he abused trust in the office.

I worked for a year prior to starting my PhD while my wife was finishing school and I found it quite refreshing to not be in school for a bit. The work was  also painfully banal and made me *very sure* that a PhD was what I wanted to do

Edit: Some more thoughts/notes now that I have more time:

STEM PhD's *suck balls* for the first year, and can be hard on the student's partner if they want to live a semi-normal life outside of working hours. If she were to enroll while you finish up, then she could knock out the worst years of the program (if it's STEM, but I kinda doubt it is if she's only just now applying?) while you finish up school and not feel bad about coming home late or leaving you alone on weekends.

I had a friend who was engaged for the first year of his PhD and busted his ass while his fiance finished her BS. He got a leg up on his program and now lives a very nice balanced life after getting married. Worth noting that he's at a school that's just a 2ish hour drive from their undergrad, so he was able to visit her on many weekends, just slaved away during the week.

11445,64502,64502,ISISCosby,"The archetypal DEs you're looking for in a 3-down front are, to oversimplify, basically a slightly heavier version of big strongside 4-3 DE types (>6'3 and >260 lbs preferably, but it depends), so guys like YGM (maybe he puts on 10 pounds), Henry Anderson, and Amare Barno (tho he'd be a better fit at Edge) are basically the types your looking for. Derrick Brown could conceivably drop some weight and pop out a gap to play DE as well, but you're right in that we're lacking in 1T types rn (the nose tackle you mentioned) which is usually the first thing teams add when looking to add more 3-down lineman fronts. An elite one is real hard to find, but it's not exactly a chore to find a serviceable one via FA, which I can see us adding. 

The thing about 4-down vs. 3-down that's actually really nice, is that your Edge rushers are still your edge rushers, so guys like Burns/Haynes/Barno/Luvu will fill in as ""OLBs"" or more realistically edge guys that line up in 2-point stances, their transition is somewhat straightforward.

Rn, imo if we had a game tomorrow and wanted to show a 3-3-5 base, the lineup would look like: 

YGM, Brown/McCall, Anderson/Brown

Burns (who would still line up on the LOS basically every play), Shaq, Luvu

Horn, DJax/CJ, Chinn, Xavier Woods, etc. (DB roles change the least)

Obviously, that's not what the Week 1 2023 starting 11 will be, but that's already a pretty solid foundation to work from.

A modern 3-4 is really just a 3-3-5; teams are playing in nickel packages 90% of the time these days.

As far as personnel changes, I really don't think we see anything crazy. We largely already have the joes needed to run a 3-man front (tho we could use another bigger DE, a 1T, and maybe one more deep safety) and two quality edge types in Burns and Luvu that offer some scheme flexibility with their different strengths. I guess we could run the first ever 3-4-4 with Chinn as a hybrid nickel/off-ball LB/Safety but in reality, he likely either switches to ILB full-time or he keeps going the safety/nickel hybrid thing.

Evero also isn't totally locked into the 3-down alignments, the defenses he ran in Denver and worked on (Tampa, SF, GB, and Rams) were very multiple in their fronts and coverages, though as a Fangio disciple, he def enjoys a little two-high safety look.

So TL;DR, look for us to employ multiple fronts (mostly 3-3-5 and 4-2-5), and don't be surprised if we don't make wholesale changes personnel-wise; I don't see us adding more than 3 or 4 defenders who will see significant time next year either via the draft or FA, bc we largely already have personnel needed in place",32.0,panthers,t3_117qa6e,False,0.0,OOU,2023-02-20T22:49:39Z,panthers,0.0259780910491943

The film itself, outside of some admittedly awesome highlights, doesn't do much to inspire confidence. Richardson's typical output compared to the guy he is in his highlight package are so different they might as well be different players.

For those who point out AR has Cam or Josh Allen-level upside, they leave out the fact that Allen dragged an otherwise useless Wyoming team to success his Junior year and Cam literally won a Natty and Heisman with largely JAGs on his team. They were miles ahead of where Richardson--a guy on a team stacked with 4 and 5* talent who struggled mightily to even be consistent, let alone excellent--is now as a prospect when they were entering the league.

He'll most definitely have to sit a full year, which is borderline impossible for us these days bc we don't have access to an Alex Smith-esque bridge QB that can win in his own right and stave off calls from an ignorant fanbase to throw the unprepared rookie QB into the fire like the Chiefs were able to do with Mahomes (aka the one and only example the ""AR can totally sit for a year"" crowd has from the last decade-plus).

So what does one do as an overseas NFL newbie (yet also a *seriously* devoted fan!) with a Pro international gamepass when the current season is over? Easy! With all due respect but we're football fans first, and Panther fans second (that's what happens if you're overseas) but *for the record*: **hell** needs to freeze over before we'll convert. We even got Panthers merch all the way out in the frickin' Netherlands!

Errr, sorry for that outburst, back to my comment: we're digging through previous seasons of course!  At the time of writing we're watching the 2nd half of Panthers vs. Cardinals from all the way back to 2015.

And *that* leads to: the roar is *most* ***definitely*** **real**!  Seems to be used less this season (I wonder why... 🤔 (no (bad) pun intended)) but yah. Loving it!

This sports is *amazing* in OUR humble opinion.

Darn those Cardinals...  but at the same time this is also what happened to me in Madden '23.

Enough offtopic blabber: the roar is / was rear, it was definitely a thing in 2015!

20312,130153,130153,ShelLuser42,"Well...  I wanted to post this somewhere and this seems like a good place for it.

So I love playing Madden '23 and now that the season is over it's a nice time to re-play matches, learn more about the game and have a good time. I'm still somewhat new'ish but have learned *a lot* this season. Thing is: because I'm new I often use the ""Coach suggestions"" option in Madden when it comes to the formation / playbook.

Now, I probably don't have to tell you what team I always play with. Thing is: Madden supports the use of live - real - NFL playbooks and I can somewhat confirm this because when re-watching matches this season you can really notice a lot of similarity with the formations.

Thing is...  even Madden seems to realize that Rhule wasn't all that great. Now, I can't make such claims myself because I plain out lack experience. Simple as that. But I **can** draw conclusions based on my gameplay and the coach suggestions.

We're up against the Cardinals and I'm having a rough time but still manage to keep the pressure on: 2 interceptions, 1 fumble and 1 sack. Not bad IMO. The score is 12 - 6 and I'm seriously pushing for a touchdown to get back in the lead. I've noticed that the Cardinals manage to fully cover us and passing attempts usually fail. So we make a lot of runs; we're not getting very far but we still manage to rack in downs.

Right up to a point where we're getting in the redzone. I try one pass into the endzone and it's incomplete. Close but no cigar. We push again: 1st and goal, ***now*** we're talking!

So what do my coach suggestions tell me?  ""Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass...."" the full list of coach suggestions (approx. 4 - 5 pages) : all passes, no runs. Screw *that!*

I find a good formation, set up a run. WHAM, touchdown. Feeling confident and knowing that this happened for real I went for the 2 point conversion attempt. I had to push hard, almost literally, but ... done. Now we're on 12 - 14.

IMO kinda funny that even in Madden '23 it seems often best not to listen to the coach when you're playing with the Panthers but instead go with your own gut feeling.

&#x200B;

Can't wait for the next season!  Also because I *know* what the Panthers are capable of, we're currently watching the 2015 playoffs and man... they were brutal against the Seahawks, whoah...

You can’t really teach pocket presense. You can’t teach someone to throw the ball harder or to get bigger. I genuinely think under the right circumstances AR is going to be a top 10 QB by year 3.
