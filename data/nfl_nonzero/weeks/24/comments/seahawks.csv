No one should deny that he is a dynamic playmaker, but he's just such a bad passer that one has to wonder if that will be enough or if he will ever be able to progress.

Even looking at some other QBs he might be compared to:

* Lamar 2018 - 24 DYAR, -9.2% DVOA next season -> 1261 DYAR and 34.9% DVOA
* Hurts 2020 - -68 DYAR, -17.6% DVOA next season -> 319 DYAR and -0.4% DVOA

Lamar is obviously a bit of an outlier, but the progression for Hurts from 2020 to 2021 is what you would hope to see. Instead, Fields went from a year as a near league worst passer to a year as a slightly worse passer.

I understand the desperation of Bears fans to actually finally have a good QB, but I think there's a very real chance that a few years from now we'll look back at the organization being confident that Fields is their guy and passing on (insert QB here) with the 1st pick as a what defines the franchise for the next decade.
