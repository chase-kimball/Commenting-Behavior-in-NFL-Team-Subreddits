3728,31514,31514,Carp8DM,"What's your source?

I mean, I'm not a professional historian.  But I studied fascism in college, and you are right that the first concept of facism were in regards to Roman idealogy of the many working as one ""fasces"" as being more powerful then the individual.  As ""fasces"" was a bundle of wooden rods strung together to produce a powerful weapon against the enemy.  Hence the concept of a strong autocratic society where the individual was not as important as the whole, and thus the whole would be able to conquer. (That's the down and dirty explanation, as I recall it.  I'm sure someone that has studied the topic more recently than 20 years ago can provide more insite)

But at no point have I ever heard the concept that the Roman empire idealized vegatarianism...  Additionally, I have no recollection of WW2 era German Nazis, or even Italy's facists as being concerned about eating meat and the subsequent gruesome process of slaughtering animals...

I mean, think about it.  Nazis are cool with killing humans because they are less than them - the Aryan Race. Therefore Gypsies, the mentally or physically disabled, ""communists"", and of course most notably, Jews were all less human than Aryans.  So why would they be so abhorrent to killing animals?

3729,31525,31525,Carp8DM,"Dude,  in 2 years,  if Walker can't be a pass rusher, I'll agree that it was a terrible pick.

I'm just saying that the earth he handled is responsibilities this year gives me confidence that he has a huge upside. 

Just think about it.   Trayvon Walker has the body of a DT but the speed of an Edge LB and if they can teach him how to work an tackle like a DE, we hit the jackpot. 

And...  that's all within his skill set.  

Hutch and Tribedeux don't have the ceiling Walker has.  They have the college talent,  but neither have the gifts and heart Walker has...

3730,31527,31527,Carp8DM,"I hear ya. 

There was this asshole called Vic Ketchman, he was the ""voice"" of the Jaguars back in the early to mid 00s...

Anyways, he's say some bullshit like ""YOU MUST TAKE THE BEST PLAYER AVAILABLE"" in the draft, no matter what!

He'd also say that PLAYERS not PLAYS was important.  Meaning that Coaching was not important.

And there was a whole toxic community that followed every word that old fart would say. 

So for me, when I hear someone say that Hutch was the right pick, it reminds me of the ""Best Available Player"" (BAP) argument Vic would make.  Regarding Hutch, he was never the BAP.  If you can recognize Hutch as having a high floor but low ceiling, that's not the best available player.  

From there on, it's what does your coach want and what can he do to develop an athlete into the position you need.  All I'm saying is that Walker has absolutely filled the need of run support.  Something that, in the AFCS was a necessity.  Colts and Titans both are run heavy.  Getting a guy like Walker was the best pick for what we needed to win the division.

On a side note, Pederson proved that Coaches are more important than just having players.  

At the end of the day, I just feel it's important that the ghost of Vic Ketchman gets exorcised.  Fuck that idiot.  He created such a toxic environment for so long with his bullshit ""Know it all "" attitude.

Dude is an absolute tank, he‚Äôs 6‚Äô7, 270 pounds.

He also runs a 4.8 and could surely develop as a receiving threat. His floor is a better Chris Manhertz, a player that we are losing and relied a bit on the past two years.

People like to talk about tight ends not coming in and immediately being contributors, but you bring this guy in and he instantly makes the line better, plus you resign Engram and have him develop as a pass catcher throughout the season. Could become an unstoppable red zone weapon too. The more I watch of him, the more and more I imagine the possibilities.

>I get what you're trying to say about purity but that doesn't matter if the next generation doesn't grab onto it because it's not entertaining enough.

The NFL is hugely popular and in terms of excitement already has incredible finishes.

There's a balance between excitement and legitimacy. I find rugby boring as hell and think the rules could be changed to open the game up more. But the rule changes should make sense and improve gameplay, not artificially aim to make the game closer.

A good comparison would be the fight business. If championship shots are given undeservingly or the best doesn't fight the best, you might boost business temporarily, but the sport loses credibility in the long term. (It's probably why Dana White let the UFC Heavyweight Champion leave, rather than resign him to a contract that allowed boxing. It's entertaining to see UFC Champ vs Boxing Champ, but having your champion get clowned harms credibility).",1.0,nfl,t3_116xh9n,False,0.0,:Jaguars: Jaguars,2023-02-20T11:08:37Z,jaguars,0.0850122165250274
