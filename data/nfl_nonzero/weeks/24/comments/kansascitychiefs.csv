Yes, of course Brady is the GOAT in 2001 he played great and led the team to the Super Bowl.  However, he didn't CARRY his team to the Super Bowl.  He won, in large part, due to the success of the defense.  Mahomes wins in spite of the defense.

Those two things swap and he‚Äôd be at 4 SB‚Äôs, with Brady at 5, 2-0 in the playoffs against Brady

Now lots of incongruences, if we win 53 then we probably don‚Äôt fire Sutton, make a move for Clark and Mathieu which means we probably don‚Äôt win 54 - without the oline falling apart we may have stuck with Fish and our interior and we‚Äôd be without Smith, Creed & Thuney which given that Eagles front we most likely lose 57.

658,2308,2308,AU_wde_2,"Looking to next years divisional opponents, of course the media is going to continue the hype train on the Broncos and if the Raiders bring in Rodgers the same will ensue.

For the Chargers: It is looking more and more like they‚Äôre going to lose Keenan, and I think that loss will be huge to them because he is Herberts release valve, whenever that line fails him he tries to find Keenan. He had some other receivers step up as the season went along but regardless their offense is going to experience some severe growing pains if he leaves. As for their future there aren‚Äôt many teams I trust less to navigate the NFL terrain with a gigantic QB contract. Just to hype ourselves up even more, Veach and co. did a masterful job of locating top talent for reasonable prices with rookies and vets in Dunlap, Reid, McKinnon etc. I just don‚Äôt believe the Chargers will be able to do that, they brought in aging vets to try and solve their Chiefs problem and all it led to was an uninspiring partial season before injury for JC Jackson and a suboptimal 8 sack season out of Mack while paying them tons of money. I think Van Noy had an okay season but I know with Bosa missing time they had to slide him in as DE which led to their LB room suffering more than ever. All of that to say of course they still have some top end talent right now and they‚Äôll still give us trouble (in 1 on 1 matchups) next year because that‚Äôs just what they do but as for their long term sustainability I‚Äôm not betting on them

For the Broncos: I think they‚Äôll be significantly better next year which isn‚Äôt a super high bar, but my big concern for them going into last season was their defense taking a step back once Fangio left, I certainly didn‚Äôt buy into the hype of their offense but also didn‚Äôt see it going that badly - but in the end their defense was phenomenal which means Payton can come in and work the offense and the defense should be self sufficient to a degree. Russel was bad last year, like really bad, *but* he showed flashes here and there down the stretch that made them look competent. I‚Äôm not saying Payton is going to be able to turn them into a high flying offense but if he can make those streaks of decent play by Russel more consistent, coupling with their defense and they‚Äôre going to be a much tougher team.

Fuck the Raiders: This should be rock bottom for them. If they bring in Rodgers he will definitely help mitigate that and make them a tougher team but they won‚Äôt be a serious contender unless they do something they haven‚Äôt done in over a decade and that‚Äôs competently draft. Their oline is below average in pass protection and their defense outside of Crosby is just bad. If they *can‚Äôt* bring in Rodgers then plain and simple they‚Äôll be the worst team in the division. They still have the weapons in place when healthy to be a competent offense and as long as they‚Äôve got a fast quick processing QB to run the offense it could work - but if they don‚Äôt get *that* guy then their offense will not be able to operate with its current oline play and the defense certainly can‚Äôt pick up the slack 

So all and all I think the Chargers have great potential to be worse than last year, the Broncos will certainly be better than last year (low bar) but I think they‚Äôll be much better and the Raiders with Rodgers will be better but not competently run and without Rodgers will be considerably less competitive, hard to be worse but they‚Äôd have fewer close losses",10.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_1181spk,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2023-02-21T08:41:29Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0574429826801156

6529,50084,50084,Cthepo,"Chiefs fan, here's the scoup:

First, anyone definitively stating they know the true extent of EB's role with the team, and his duties, is flat out wrong.

We know Andy is the primary playcaller. At times hss delegated that responsibility to allow OC's opportunities. It's never been publicly verified that's happened with EB. I've seen him on there sidelines with a playsheet talking while Andy sits back (there's a good clip of this from our 2019 divisional round comeback against the Texans). So the question is whether he calls plays, or if he sometimes calls plays, and if so what extent.

EB has been a Head Coaching candidate for like 3 years nowadays without any luck. This year he got almost no buzz (I think maybe the Colts requested an interview but I don't know if it ever happened with us in the playoffs). Eveyone connected with the Chiefs agrees he was probably planning on making a lateral move to a spot where he's seen as the guy running the show. It's nothing to do with us not wanting him back or him performing poorly. It's just about his own opportunity to audition for a head coaching role.

That's pretty much the factual information, here's stuff I'd say is more my opinion.

EB is responsible for a shit ton of stuff here. You know those last two touchdowns weeks scored in the Superbowl that were wide open walk ins? EB is the one credited for scouting the Eagles on their weakness to that. Even if Andy is the primary playcaller, EB has the chops to game plan and install an offense.

Andy is also pretty loyal to his guys, ones of which is Ron. We know Andy and Ron talked about EB and the possibility, and I don't believe Andy would recommend EB to him if he weren't ready as a playcaller. Andy genuinely seems to believe in him; and even went in front of all the owners last year pleading for him to get a shot as coach.",4.0,commanders,t3_114j751,False,0.0,:KC:,2023-02-17T11:31:26Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0003839373117979

Please point to when during the previous 58 minutes of the game a receiver got held out of his break or held at all? I wanna see it. The only one is the missed PI on the Eagles which doesnt seem like a great argument.

Did you know the average amount of defensive holdings called in a game in 2022? .74. Why the hell would only throwing 1 all game when the average is less than one be suspicious at all? He held him coming out of his break. Why would that be a business as usual play? It prevented a touchdown and it was obvious as seen by the picture in this very post.

24817,158683,158683,No_Rec1979,"You're very, very close to how Mahomes' contract situation is meant to work, but you're missing something important.

Yes, by converting salary to a signing bonus, we can defer money to future cap years. So even if we write him a $50 million check this year, contract shenanigans can make that look like $10 million a year over 5 years. We did a similar trick to reduce Mahome's cap hit last year, and I think the year before, and we will certainly do it again this year. 

The main thing you're missing is that Mahomes' contract *is designed to be reworked every single year*. That absurd cap number Mahomes has in 2023? That was put there *on purpose*. It meant the team never had any choice about coming to him to rework his contract in the offseason. It also means that if Mahomes is ever unhappy at all, he has plenty of opportunity to let them know. 

If Mahomes ever signs a new contract with a really low cap number for several years in a row, he's giving away tons of power. They can hire coaches he doesn't like, eliminate ketchup in the cafeteria - whatever, and there's not much he can do. By renegotiating every single year - and always having a *huge* cap number the following year - Mahomes has a virtually guarantee that the Chiefs can never take unfair advantage of the significant hometown discount he is giving them.",8.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_118nuf9,False,0.0,Laurent Duvernay-Tardif #76,2023-02-22T01:18:18Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0667628487523385

For those who don't know, Mccoy was on our team in 2019 as our annual rental veteran on a cheap contract. He was benched before the playoffs.  Healthy scratch in every post season game including the superbowl but he was still on the 53 man roster.

So he gets a ring even though he hadn't contributed in the post season at all.  That's fine.  Lots of guys get a ring without playing. 

But then the next year he goes to the bucs.  Gets a ring with them too.  Same shit.  Plays a little in the regular season, isn't any good, healthy scratch for the superbowl.  Ring two, never plays a snap in a superbowl 

But instead of having a good sense of humor about it like Melvin Gordon, he's very very bitter. 

I'm pretty sure acho knows he hates being called a superbowl champ because it's understood he didn't really do anything to earn the title.

I recognize that I'm biased toward him because he knocks my favorite team, but I really just don't enjoy Speak whenever he's on.  He has little of value to contribute.

  My blame would be put in the prep of the bermuda.  that's where the playing surface strength comes from.  If it is established with a good sandy loam, it would have behaved like every other feild.
