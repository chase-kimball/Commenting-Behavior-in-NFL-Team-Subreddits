Yes, of course Brady is the GOAT in 2001 he played great and led the team to the Super Bowl.  However, he didn't CARRY his team to the Super Bowl.  He won, in large part, due to the success of the defense.  Mahomes wins in spite of the defense.

656,2306,2306,AU_wde_2,"One mildly frustrating thought that comes into my mind every now and again is how close Mahomes was to being the inarguable Goat right this very second, if Ford lines up onside he’s playing and very likely winning his first in SB53, if our Oline doesn’t spontaneously combust throughout the season he would’ve had a fair shot at winning SB55. Those two things swap and he’d be at 4 SB’s, with Brady at 5, 2-0 in the playoffs against Brady

Now lots of incongruences, if we win 53 then we probably don’t fire Sutton, make a move for Clark and Mathieu which means we probably don’t win 54 - without the oline falling apart we may have stuck with Fish and our interior and we’d be without Smith, Creed & Thuney which given that Eagles front we most likely lose 57.

As in the GM’s, same as Veach prior, had the ability to put talent around Mahomes without a 40M+ hole burning in their cap, soon that cap will take the hit and it turns into the challenge of drafting well consistently, acquiring cheap but still productive talent and allowing that talent to walk when the bill comes due.

658,2308,2308,AU_wde_2,"Looking to next years divisional opponents, of course the media is going to continue the hype train on the Broncos and if the Raiders bring in Rodgers the same will ensue.

For the Chargers: It is looking more and more like they’re going to lose Keenan, and I think that loss will be huge to them because he is Herberts release valve, whenever that line fails him he tries to find Keenan. He had some other receivers step up as the season went along but regardless their offense is going to experience some severe growing pains if he leaves. As for their future there aren’t many teams I trust less to navigate the NFL terrain with a gigantic QB contract. Just to hype ourselves up even more, Veach and co. did a masterful job of locating top talent for reasonable prices with rookies and vets in Dunlap, Reid, McKinnon etc. I just don’t believe the Chargers will be able to do that, they brought in aging vets to try and solve their Chiefs problem and all it led to was an uninspiring partial season before injury for JC Jackson and a suboptimal 8 sack season out of Mack while paying them tons of money. I think Van Noy had an okay season but I know with Bosa missing time they had to slide him in as DE which led to their LB room suffering more than ever. All of that to say of course they still have some top end talent right now and they’ll still give us trouble (in 1 on 1 matchups) next year because that’s just what they do but as for their long term sustainability I’m not betting on them

For the Broncos: I think they’ll be significantly better next year which isn’t a super high bar, but my big concern for them going into last season was their defense taking a step back once Fangio left, I certainly didn’t buy into the hype of their offense but also didn’t see it going that badly - but in the end their defense was phenomenal which means Payton can come in and work the offense and the defense should be self sufficient to a degree. Russel was bad last year, like really bad, *but* he showed flashes here and there down the stretch that made them look competent. I’m not saying Payton is going to be able to turn them into a high flying offense but if he can make those streaks of decent play by Russel more consistent, coupling with their defense and they’re going to be a much tougher team.

Fuck the Raiders: This should be rock bottom for them. If they bring in Rodgers he will definitely help mitigate that and make them a tougher team but they won’t be a serious contender unless they do something they haven’t done in over a decade and that’s competently draft. Their oline is below average in pass protection and their defense outside of Crosby is just bad. If they *can’t* bring in Rodgers then plain and simple they’ll be the worst team in the division. They still have the weapons in place when healthy to be a competent offense and as long as they’ve got a fast quick processing QB to run the offense it could work - but if they don’t get *that* guy then their offense will not be able to operate with its current oline play and the defense certainly can’t pick up the slack 

So all and all I think the Chargers have great potential to be worse than last year, the Broncos will certainly be better than last year (low bar) but I think they’ll be much better and the Raiders with Rodgers will be better but not competently run and without Rodgers will be considerably less competitive, hard to be worse but they’d have fewer close losses",10.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_1181spk,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2023-02-21T08:41:29Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0574429826801156

6529,50084,50084,Cthepo,"Chiefs fan, here's the scoup:

First, anyone definitively stating they know the true extent of EB's role with the team, and his duties, is flat out wrong.

We know Andy is the primary playcaller. At times hss delegated that responsibility to allow OC's opportunities. It's never been publicly verified that's happened with EB. I've seen him on there sidelines with a playsheet talking while Andy sits back (there's a good clip of this from our 2019 divisional round comeback against the Texans). So the question is whether he calls plays, or if he sometimes calls plays, and if so what extent.

EB has been a Head Coaching candidate for like 3 years nowadays without any luck. This year he got almost no buzz (I think maybe the Colts requested an interview but I don't know if it ever happened with us in the playoffs). Eveyone connected with the Chiefs agrees he was probably planning on making a lateral move to a spot where he's seen as the guy running the show. It's nothing to do with us not wanting him back or him performing poorly. It's just about his own opportunity to audition for a head coaching role.

That's pretty much the factual information, here's stuff I'd say is more my opinion.

EB is responsible for a shit ton of stuff here. You know those last two touchdowns weeks scored in the Superbowl that were wide open walk ins? EB is the one credited for scouting the Eagles on their weakness to that. Even if Andy is the primary playcaller, EB has the chops to game plan and install an offense.

Andy is also pretty loyal to his guys, ones of which is Ron. We know Andy and Ron talked about EB and the possibility, and I don't believe Andy would recommend EB to him if he weren't ready as a playcaller. Andy genuinely seems to believe in him; and even went in front of all the owners last year pleading for him to get a shot as coach.",4.0,commanders,t3_114j751,False,0.0,:KC:,2023-02-17T11:31:26Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0003839373117979

Please point to when during the previous 58 minutes of the game a receiver got held out of his break or held at all? I wanna see it. The only one is the missed PI on the Eagles which doesnt seem like a great argument.

Did you know the average amount of defensive holdings called in a game in 2022? .74. Why the hell would only throwing 1 all game when the average is less than one be suspicious at all? He held him coming out of his break. Why would that be a business as usual play? It prevented a touchdown and it was obvious as seen by the picture in this very post.

Yes, by converting salary to a signing bonus, we can defer money to future cap years.

We did a similar trick to reduce Mahome's cap hit last year, and I think the year before, and we will certainly do it again this year. 

The main thing you're missing is that Mahomes' contract *is designed to be reworked every single year*. That absurd cap number Mahomes has in 2023? That was put there *on purpose*. It meant the team never had any choice about coming to him to rework his contract in the offseason. It also means that if Mahomes is ever unhappy at all, he has plenty of opportunity to let them know.

If he was younger, or more attractive, or white, I believe he'd be a HC with his current experience/criticisms.

For those who don't know, Mccoy was on our team in 2019 as our annual rental veteran on a cheap contract. He was benched before the playoffs.  Healthy scratch in every post season game including the superbowl but he was still on the 53 man roster.

So he gets a ring even though he hadn't contributed in the post season at all.  That's fine.  Lots of guys get a ring without playing. 

But then the next year he goes to the bucs.  Gets a ring with them too.  Same shit.  Plays a little in the regular season, isn't any good, healthy scratch for the superbowl.  Ring two, never plays a snap in a superbowl 

But instead of having a good sense of humor about it like Melvin Gordon, he's very very bitter. 

I'm pretty sure acho knows he hates being called a superbowl champ because it's understood he didn't really do anything to earn the title.

And the move to Washington is pretty easy to understand. There aren’t a ton of open OC jobs out there. EB wanted to go to a place where he runs the offense on his own without the HC coming in. Rivera is an Andy Reid guy, so I assume at some point their paths have crossed and Andy put in a good word about EB to Ron and about Ron to EB.

There hasn’t been 1 credible report about tensions between EB and anyone else in the building. There was that story written by anonymous authors that has since been deleted.
