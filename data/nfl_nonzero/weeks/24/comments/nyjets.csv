13778,99301,99301,NannigarCire,"Tannehill is getting brought up more and more as a foil to the Derek Carr saga, and i wanted to look into him a bit more and find that it's not convincing. For one, Tannehill has rarely been tasked with carrying the load for the Titans-, they're almost entirely based on Derrick Henry doing the work. He's had one of the lowest attempts per game in the league during his time starting for the Titans with a great offensive line plus the athletic talent of AJ Brown and some decent but not special supportive talent. As a reclamation project goes, he did a good job. But the difference is that Carr was performing at a similar efficiency while being tasked with throwing the ball at a higher volume and with much more emphasis placed on him carrying the football game. No one went into the Titans games trying to figure out how to stop the Ryan Tannehill passing offense, it would be malpractice to focus on it considering from 2019-2022 the Titans had the fewest passing attempts in the league. Whereas the Raiders were 14th.

The one season where Tannehill was tasked with carrying the offense, 2021, although the Titans did go 12-5, the entire Tannehill statline fell apart. From 2019-2022, Tannehill attempted 28 passes per game ranking at 55/63 QBs that threw at least 200 passes during that time, with quality efficiency during that time as a whole. In 2021 he threw 31 passes per game, ranking 52nd. Undeniably, that team is not great. It's AJ Brown, an elderly Julio Jones and a bunch of role players on offense. Derrick Henry gets injured halfway through the season and is out for 9 games. So it's just on Tannehill to make this offense work. Anyway assuming Ryan Tannehill's Titans Tenure as just one season, and then taking 2021 only, and then comparing those to all individual seasons efficiency stats for all QBs who have thrown at least 200 passes in any given year from 2012-2022, here's what we get:

Stat|25th Percentile|50th Percentile|75th Percentile|Ryan Tannehill 2019-22|Ryan Tannehill 2021|Derek Carr 2019-22|
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
YPA|6.8|7.2|7.7|7.9|7.0|7.6
Completion %|60.3|63.4|66.1|66.9|67.2|66.8
TD %|3.4|4.4|5.4|5.5|4.0|4.4
Int %|2.9|2.3|1.8|2.0|2.6|2.1
Sack %|7.5|6.1|4.6|7.7|8.1|5.4
Attempts Per Game||||29.5|31.2|33.7

So basically, Tannehill is being placed into a spot where he's not the engine of the offense, and he's effective when the offense doesn't rely on him but he's able to take advantage of what the offense gives him. It's unclear if he'd be effective when an offense both relies on him and gives him a better supporting cast. But that's where Derek Carr doesn't have the same questions- Carr's been tasked with performing at much higher volume (he ranks 37/63 in attempts per game) and has done almost as well as someone who isn't being relied on in his offense. I'd bet on a team where Carr is also somewhat hidden by an effective run game, his efficiency would also rise beyond what is already pretty good.

This is where the difference between the two players lies for me and why i'd personally still put Carr ahead of Tannehill.",4.0,nyjets,t3_1173wqx,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-02-21T18:21:31Z,nyjets,-0.0197139437545936

13795,99323,99323,NannigarCire,"Often times when Quarterbacks change teams, regardless of how good they are, they have a down year with the new team. Look at Brady's first season with TB, he started off the season poorly and really came on as it continued and the team adjusted well. Kirk Cousins first season with MIN just didn't click at all compared to his later seasons (look at the efficiency stats, 3 straights years of >7.5 YPA, goes to MIN- gets a career low 7.1 YPA, and then followed with 3 years of >7.5 YPA again). And very obviously, Russell Wilson- who did look exceptionally washed this year but i'd still be willing to take a bet bounces back next year. On the flip side, Peyton Manning had a pretty Peyton year when he hit the Broncos. 

It makes sense because most offenses are built around the QB- so when a new QB comes to a team everyone on the offense has to adjust including the Quarterback. So that first season is a lot of adjusting, and learning new tendencies, and becoming aligned with each other so on and so on. This is important because as the next season begins with whatever quarterback comes up, if the QB has a lesser year, people will be going fucking insane.
