A big chunk of that is probably the fact that people post online in specific moments and their thoughts and feelings are trapped in that moment despite being able to read the post whenever you'd like, so I don't doubt quite a bit of it is just people blowing off steam after an outcome they really didn't want to see, but I can and will never be able to wrap my head around someone believing it's fixed and still watching.

327,1731,1731,16billionDeadEyes,"As far as pure athleticism, I don't think Jones or Ogden belong in the same category as Williams. 

Jones and Ogden were elite tackles who deservedly made the Hall of Fame. Legendary players. But they were both just good athletes for their positions.

Trent Williams is the extremely rare combination of elite tackle and elite athlete for a tackle. The former rugby player tackle for Philly now and Terron Armstead are probably the only two tackles in recent times who even approach Williams' insane athleticism and while they're both really fucking good tackles, I don't think they're currently on any kind of trajectory that would put them in the HOF, whereas Trent is/should be a first ballot guy, no question. Larry Allen is another dude like that where he wasn't just an insane athlete, he was insanely good at playing his position.

And this is just talking about the crazy athletes who succeeded at tackle. Football, like most sports, is a game of talent **AND** skill and there are likely a lot of super athletic freaks who just didn't have the skills to be a tackle in the NFL, even with their freakish talent.

328,1735,1735,16billionDeadEyes,"It's really not about cap room. We have a bunch of cap room as it is and many of our most expensive cap hits are far from the real core of the team. 

Paying a QB/WR/WR(like if we retained Chase and Higgins, which I don't think is likely) isn't really the death knell people think it is. If you start from there, and **then** skew toward rookies and value signings for other positions (like is done for the WR position with teams who pay QB and then a few not-WR's), I really think that that is an optimal way to construct a roster. $224 million is the salary cap and $50 million, $30 million, $30 million(ballparking here) leaves you $114 million. That may seem outrageous with no other context, but KC literally has Mahomes at $46 m, $30 m each for Chris Jones and Frank Clark. They've still got three other players with double digit million dollar cap hits. So you can still have quality pieces (especially if you avoid getting them from free agency by getting good players from the draft) after paying a lot for three players and still be a very good team.

It's really about the guarantees and the amount of money needed to be put aside immediately. That is what looms ominously over Cincinnati with the contracts of Burrow/Chase/Higgins. Even if we decided that is what we wanted to do with the cap(which seems unlikely), I'm not convinced the Brown family and company would have enough to meet the requirements financially with how closely in time they'd all three have to be paid.",1.0,nfl,t3_116m4ff,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2023-02-19T16:18:39Z,bengals,-0.0292936140279288
329,1739,1739,16billionDeadEyes,"The same reason that I'm not an NFL player. The human body is not customizable. If you are the best you can be as a player, especially as a youngster coming up, at running back, that's your position. 

Remember: the vast majority of people who play football all the way up to the college level will never even be invited for an NFL tryout. And even as a backup player, the vast majority of people who are even capable of being good enough to play any position in the NFL would make a **lot** more money playing in the NFL than any other job they could reasonably expect to get. 

I'd venture to guess there are a lot of pro players that, as children, had dreams of playing some other position(especially QB), but if you're not a QB, or whatever position you believe is the ""best"" position, you don't have the option to just make yourself one through training and practice. If you don't have the physical traits to do it, you never will. So you play whatever position you are best suited for, provided you're intent on and capable of making the NFL.

Julian Edelman, for example. Probably would've made a shit ton more money if he stayed at QB for his NFL career, but we all know he never would've made a roster as a QB.

7943,56176,56176,DireFox1,"1. Mahomes

This one should be the most obvious, even though I wish I could say Burrow for first

2. Burrow

Probably the most precise passer in the league, great locker room presence, sneaky athletic, reads defenses like Hermione reads books

3. Lawrence

Him or Herbert have the best deep ball in the league, he's very athletic, definition of a playmaker even though he has accuracy issues

4. Hurts

Him or Fields have officially taken the title for best rushing QB from Lamar. Unlike either of them he's also a top passer in the league. Like Burrow, he's also a great locker room presence

5. Williams

Even being two years out from the NFL, I can see he has real potential. Very similar to Mahomes but less experienced. I think no matter where he ends up, he'll be top 10, but his position in top 10 will vary depending on how well his team develops him. 

6. Herbert

This is where it starts getting more shaky for me. Herbert has an incredible deep ball and is key to the Chargers offense. However, he has questionable decisions making on the field. Should be top 10 but isn't a lock in my eyes

7. Allen

Took a step back this year. Obviously still top 10 this year, but I'm not sure where he'll be two years from now, let alone five. He could be top 5 in the league or outside the top 10. I lean more towards him being in the top 10 but outside the top 5

8. Fields

This may be a bit of homerism as an Ohio State fan, but Fields is an amazing athletic talent with the ability to become an amazing passer as well. Get him an O-line and weapons and continue to develop him, he'll be in the top 10. 

9. Young

He's shown the ability to flourish in Bama with loaded rosters. However, he also had a mediocre year in 2022 when Bama lost a lot of it's high end talent from the previous years. Regardless, he's shown his ability and I believe he could be in the top 10, but it will also depend on the Texans (his likely landing place in the NFL) getting significantly better, a tough ask for them. 

10. Stroud

I am also tainted by homerism here, but I truly believe CJ is capable of being top 10. Amazing pocket passer and while he's currently uncomfortable using his legs he has shown great ability to do so. Like Williams, his success will largely depend on which team picks him up. Unlike Williams however, I think if that's the wrong team, he won't be top 10. 

Just outside:

Lamar

His proneness to injury gives me huge pause. He could be in the top 10 in 5 years, but do I think he will be? Probably not. Being a rushing QB definitely elevates an offense but it also gives a QB a shorter career. I have Hurts and Fields up there because they're both younger and have played a shorter amount of time. Lamar on the other hand doesn't have that benefit. In 5 years he'll be a 31 y/o QB. That isn't as much of an issue for pocket passers or even ""true"" dual threats like Mahomes and Hurts. But when it comes to rushing QBs like Cam Newton and Donovan McNabb it has proven to be more of an issue. 


Tua

There's at least some possiblity Tua won't even be in the NFL in five years. If he is, I could see him being top 10 but I also doubt it due to the effect so many concussions in one year will probably have on him. 

Hooker

Incredibly underrated going into this draft. He was the heart and soul of Tennessee's offense (along with Hyatt) and should have been higher in Heisman voting, though his injury obviously had an effect on that. Due to being underrated, I think he could have the benefit of being on a more functional team than say the Texans, Raiders, or Colts. Maybe the Titans could pick him up where he could arguably win out the starting job in his second year over Tannehill and Willis. 

Ridder

This is incredible homerism on my part as a Bearcat, I'll admit. But regardless, he showed talent and skill at UC. This is more wishful thinking than anything though.",2.0,nfl,t3_115uefq,False,1.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2023-02-18T18:40:38Z,bengals,0.0002501309435482
7944,56177,56177,DireFox1,"Is he though? I mean, it's no question in my mind that the Bears aren't trading Justin Fields already anyways but that's not really what his talking head is wanting to say. Bryce Young hasn't played a snap in the NFL and has looked rather average with Bama this year without a loaded roster. Meanwhile Fields has shown a lot of promise and has looked relatively good throughout this year and is the only real good thing the Bears have going for them right now. Plenty of QBs have found themselves in their third year (Hurts and Tua come to mind) and Fields has already looked better this year than last. While Young has shown he can play good football on a collegiate level, I don't really think he's shown he can play significantly better football than Fields, if better at all. Of course, maybe I'm just being a homer Ohio State fan, but regardless I don't think any of what I've said is really wrong.",0.0,nfl,t3_115mmwy,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2023-02-18T17:40:46Z,bengals,-0.0676354180656019

Now the actual amount of time we’re allowed to be practicing is severely limited, and then within that the amount of full contact practice we are allowed to do is severely limited.

Offensive linemen just do not get enough full contact reps to actually get good at football anymore. At least not to an NFL standard.

Defensive lineman on the other hand have a much simpler job. Just go to your gap and wreak as much havoc as possible. If you think about all of the restrictions placed on DBs when covering wide receivers, offensive lineman sorta face the same problem. Their job is easier than yours to begin with, add on the fact that the NCAA is kneecapping your development.

This part. You used weasel language (“might be related”) but the implication was that he interviewed poorly because white owners are uncomfortable socializing with black people. That is an asinine thing to imply here considering multiple black coaches have been hired over Bienemy in the same time frame he’s been looking for a HC gig. I gave you two examples off the top of my head. 

How you can attribute that to racism is interesting when there’s multiple key reasons directly related to football that would explain why people don’t want to commit to him. Which I mentioned in my last comment.

Then who do we play in the first round of the playoffs (our fifth consecutive time making it) that would give us our first playoff win in 25 years? The fucking Steelers, at home. 

We played good. We came back from a 15-0 deficit.. had the game in the bag with 2 mins left. Then we beat ourselves, and watched helplessly as Justin Tucker kicked it through the uprights for a 16-15 loss.

Hernandez earned a career-high 79.1 pass-blocking grade in 2022, which ranked tied for eighth among guards. His 3.0% pressure rate allowed ranked 13th at the position, and he held up on true pass sets, as well, ranking top 15 in both metrics. He's a bit more limited as a run blocker, failing to reach a season-long grade of at least 65.0 over his five-year career, but his above-average pass protection should make him an intriguing target for a handful of clubs. Hernandez finished the season on injured reserve with a pectoral injury, but there are no indications he'll miss time in 2023 as a result. The former No. 34 overall pick signed a minimum contract for 2022 but should be able to boost that a bit going forward.
