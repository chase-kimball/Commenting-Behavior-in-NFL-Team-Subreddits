Addison having the connection with Kenny makes that transition easier and i think most of the people who want to draft him are thinking the same exact way.

Also CB is a much deeper group and theres a good chance there will be some legit 1st round talent still available at 32.

TEs have a crazy low hit rate and low value which is why most analytics dislike picking them in the 1st unless they're elite prospects just like safeties although to a lesser degree.

WRs have crazy positional value but a very low hit rate which make them a very boom/bust pick regardless of how much of a ""sure thing"" they are viewed. Look at Jerry Jeudy...

CBs are probably somewhere around the middle and considered a safe pick along with off ball LBs even though 1at round linebackers seemed to have fallen from good graces in recent years.

The WR market very recently reset and Tyreek got $30m/yr and proved his value along with TJ and Aaron Donald. Edge rushers and WRs have insane value currently and LT is also higher than CB and generally viewed as a much safer pick for the ability to ""fail inside"" or even move to RT.

I like BPA in the 1st round this year more than any year in recent memory.

Swapping QBs in a vacuum infuriates me. ""Give Rivers/Romo/Ryan/Stafford/Luck the Steelers defense and they'd all have at least three rings, including two in one season!"" Sure, we can give all those QBs the Steelers defenses, but it's a package deal. Those QBs must abide by the following terms and conditions upon receiving the Steelers defense:

- Their starting offensive line shall be, from left to right, Max Starks, Chris Kemoeatu, Justin Hartwig, Darnell Stapleton and Willie Colon
- Bruce Arians gets to call a bunch of his vertical, slow-developing pass plays
- They'll have to play outdoors, on natural grass, often in poor weather conditions after October, against other AFC North defenses

In other words, no Pro Bowl offensive linemen, no QB-friendly system of offense, no climate-controlled dome, no fast surface, no sunny southern California, and no division rivals with shitty defenses. I wish those other QBs the best of luck preserving their pretty stat lines, because they'll need the best of luck to do so in those circumstances.

It's not just QBs who get their career stats taken out of context.

Bottom line, when the offense needed a yard, Jerome Bettis got a yard, even against the eight-man fronts that he dealt with for most of his career.

From 1975-1982, Terry Bradshaw played as well as any QB in the NFL. In 1977, he led the NFL in yards per attempt.

In 1982, he led the NFL in TD percentage, and tied a couple of guys named Dan Fouts and Joe Montana for the league lead in TD passes. As for 1981, it's worth noting that the Steelers had a record of 8-5 with three games left to play, but Bradshaw suffered a season-ending injury early in the next game, after which the Steelers lost out, falling out of the playoff hunt with an 8-8 record.

12813,72545,72545,EnjoyMoreBeef,"The Steelers have six one-and-done playoff appearances this century: 2007, 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020 and 2021. Their records in those seasons were 10-6, 12-4, 11-5, 13-3, 12-4 and 9-7-1, respectively. No team with an 11-5 record or worse can possibly be one of the best one-and-done playoff teams in NFL history, so let's remove them and examine two of the three that are left...

**2011:** In the AFC Wild Card Playoff against the Broncos, the Steelers had six healthy starters on defense by the end of the first quarter. Ryan Clark couldn't play in Denver because of the effect of altitude on those who suffer sickle-cell anemia. James Harrison and LaMarr Woodley were limited by a bad back and a pulled hamstring, respectively. Casey Hampton and Brett Keisel both suffered knee injuries late in the first quarter and didn't play the rest of the game. And that was just the defense. On offense, Maurkice Pouncey didn't play because of a broken ankle, and Ben Roethlisberger was limited by a high ankle sprain. Late in the first half, Rashard Mendenhall and Max Starks both suffered knee injuries and didn't play the rest of the game. In all, the injury list for the Steelers by halftime consisted of their starting QB, their starting RB, their two best starting offensive linemen, two of their three starting defensive linemen (including the starting NT), both starting OLBs, and their starting FS. It was a veritable who's-who of their star players. The only stars who were still healthy for the Steelers were Troy Polamalu and the starting WRs. Injuries are part of the game, but a large number of them can still undo a team.

**2017:** That was the post-season when the Steelers lost to ~~Blake Bortles~~ Leonard Fournette. From Weeks 1-12 that season, the Steelers defense allowed 96 rushing yards per game, but from weeks 13-17 and in the playoffs, the Steelers allowed 138 rushing yards per game. What could make such a difference? Losing the rising star they had at LILB who locked down the middle of the field. Ryan Shazier suffered a career-ending injury near the end of the regular season, and was replaced in the lineup by Sean Spence, a LILB drafted by the Steelers in 2012 who suffered a horrible knee injury as a rookie that he never fully recovered from, which necessitated the Steelers using a first-round draft pick on Shazier in 2014. (Between those two and Devin Bush, the Steelers have had terrible injury luck at LILB in recent years.) Even though the Steelers offense entered the playoffs with no serious injuries to their star players on offense for a change -- Ben Roethlisberger, Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown were all on the field together past the first quarter in only three of their seven playoff games from 2014-2017 -- the defense suddenly had a void in the middle that turned into a matchup nightmare against the Jaguars, who had the best running game in the NFL that season, and 164 rushing yards and four TD runs in that game.

The only one-and-done playoff appearance the Steelers had no excuse for was in the 2020 post-season. They beat the Browns 38-7 in Pittsburgh that season, and only barely lost to them in Cleveland despite resting all their starters, so shame on them for losing at home in the playoffs.

12846,72586,72586,EnjoyMoreBeef,">DL: Watt is perennial DPOY when healthy. He reminds me of peak Polamalu in his ability to single-handedly take over a game. Like Peak Polamalu, Watt plays In technicolor while everyone else is playing in black and white. Heyward is a probable HOFer who still plays at a high level but who unfortunately is old. Alualu is a shell of himself. They banked on him and Tuitt as to why they didn’t try to sign Hargraves. They lost that bet badly. I don’t even remember who the 4th D-lineman is.

Tyson Alualu was a dominant run-stopper. It's no surprise that the defense's ability to stop the run deteriorated the moment he broke his ankle. Unfortunately, he hasn't been the same since then, and he got benched for poor performance this past season. He'll be 36 in May, so I expect him to be cut. As for Javon Hargrave, his situation was similar to Mike Vrabel, being a starting-caliber player stuck behind other starters on the depth chart. His only opportunity to be a starter was with another team, which is why the Steelers let him go. The parting of ways was amicable. Unfortunately, when Hargrave left, nobody could have predicted what would happen to Stephon Tuitt. Tuitt was a Pro Bowl-caliber starter, but he became very injury-prone, and the death of his brother broke him. I hope he's doing well these days. And Cameron Heyward is near the end of his prime, so the Steelers should start looking for his eventual replacement.

>LBs: Highsmith is good not great. Bush is an injury bust since his ACL. Jerry Olsavsky or whatever his name is is a backup or maybe special teams player on certain teams. The fact that he’s a starter tells you this unit is troubled.

Alex Highsmith is not a game-changer like T.J. Watt, but he's good enough, much like Clark Haggans in relation to Joey Porter. As for Devin Bush, he's just the latest example of the terrible injury luck the Steelers have had at ILB in the last decade. First, it was Sean Spence, then it was Ryan Shazier, and now, it's Devin Bush. One suffered a career-ending injury, and the other two suffered career-altering injuries. Sometimes, shit happens, and it's nobody's fault. I expect the Steelers to address ILB with one of their first three draft picks. Whatever it takes to be less reliant on Robert Spillane, who's too good to cut, but not good enough to start.

>DBs: Fitzpatrick is of course an all-pro talent who makes a lot of mistakes because everyone else in the secondary is mediocre. Edmunds is a solid hitter and tackler but his coverage is for shit and he’s not very bright. Sutton and the other guy are forgettable.

Minkah Fitzpatrick is the hardest-working player on the team. Besides his own job, he often often has to stop RBs that the front seven failed to. I disagree with your assessment of the rest of the secondary, though. Terrell Edmunds might not be a big playmaker, but he's a good tackler, and the secondary looks worse when he doesn't play. I do not want him replaced unless the Steelers are *certain* they've found somebody better, or at least with more upside. As for the CBs, the only thing missing is a true shutdown CB. Levi Wallace is a good #2 CB, and Cameron Sutton is better off in the slot. Unfortunately, the Steelers were unable to coach up Ahkello Witherspoon, and I expect him to be cut.

So here's how I see the Steelers' needs on defense, ranked by priority:

He would be a great #2 but we already have wallace for that roll",3.0,steelers,t3_1155rrd,False,0.0,:sh::h8::sh: The Pickler,2023-02-17T22:54:37Z,steelers,0.12216171875

JPJ is good value at 17 but think OT is the right decision if its avaliable... if skoronski, johnson, or jones is available at 17 we need to pull the trigger. If not, we go best DB which is most likely JPJ, cam smith, or ringo and thats the order i would draft them. Forbes even at 32 is high.  I would much rather go DT at 32 than forbes.
