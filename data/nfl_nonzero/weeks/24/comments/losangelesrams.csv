Fortunately, we threw a back-shoulder fade type pass that was less prone to being picked off and it worked.

IIRC, we also had a receiver in the slot, between the OL and where Kupp was positioned on the outside. He ran basically a quick slant route in to the congested middle.

15347,151232,151232,VastAmphibian,"every dollar a team pays a player must be accounted for in the salary cap. there is no way to get around this. it doesn't matter if the form of payment is salary or signing bonus or whatever. the difference between the forms of payment is when that payment is applied to the cap. in short, restructuring every year doesn't work the way you said, but it does work and it helps the cap. detailed explanation below but it is lengthy so beware.


watson's contract was 45mil signing bonus and 185mil salary for a total of 230 mil over 5 years. the 45 mil signing bonus is prorated across the length of the contract so in terms of cap, it is 9 mil every year. and then add the salary for each year and you have his cap number. because his salary is the same every year (46 mil), his cap number is the same 46+9=55mil every year as well just like the title says.


watson's cap number was never 1 mil and it never will be 1 mil. his salary for 2022 was 1 mil but you still have to add the prorated signing bonus to get his cap number. so his cap number for 2022 was 1+9=10 mil but the portion of his salary while he was suspended was not paid and therefore was not counted so his cap number ended up being closer to 9 mil.


in a restructure, in almost every single case what is happening is the team is taking the player's salary and converting it into a signing bonus. this means that instead of the salary being applied to the cap this year, they get to prorate that same amount across the remaining years of his contract just like a signing bonus. yeah I know it's not a true signing bonus in the sense that the contract was signed last year but it's just the way the system works. let's take 2023 for watson. his salary is 46 mil. add the 9 mil of signing bonus and his cap number for 2023 is 55 mil. so let's take his 46 mil salary and convert it to signing bonus. it is year 2 of his contract so there are 4 years remaining. 46/4 = 11.5. so by doing a restructure, watson's cap number for 2023 will decrease from 55 mil to 11.5+9 = 20.5 mil. savings of 34.5 mil. but that's not it. every remaining year's cap number just increased by 11.5 mil as well because the amount has to be prorated. so the remaining 3 years' cap number went from 55 mil to 55+11.5=66.5 mil. his total cap number did not change. 20.5+66.5+66.5+66.5 is the same as 55+55+55+55. they just moved the numbers around.


now we enter 2024. 66.5 mil (46 salary + 9 bonus + 11.5 bonus) is too much of a cap hit so they restructure again. 46/3 ~ 15. 2024 cap number went from 66.5 to 15+9+11.5= 35.5 mil. but 2025 and 2026 cap numbers went from 66.5 to 66.5+15 = 81.5 mil. still the total cap hit has not changed. 66.5+66.5+66.5 is the same as 35.5+81.5+81.5


now we enter 2025. 81.5 mil (46 salary + 9 bonus + 11.5 bonus + 15 bonus) is also too much. restructure again. 46/2 = 23. 2025 cap number went from 81.5 to 23+9+11.5+15 = 58.5 mil. hmm that's still too much. there are only 2 years left so they're not able to split the salary very much. this is when they would consider extending his contract so they can add years and therefore split his salary more effectively.


by doing a restructure every year, watson's cap numbers went from 55-55-55-55 to 20.5-35.5-58.5-105.5. this is what they mean by ""kicking the can down the road"". you helped your cap for the first two years but you hurt it for the last two years and your final year's cap number is simply unsustainable. but that is future you's problem.",8.0,nfl,t3_117fulr,False,0.0,:Rams: Rams,2023-02-20T14:26:01Z,losangelesrams,-0.0122524419445343

15358,151252,151252,VastAmphibian,"ultimately the problem is that teams just don't know. is he getting carried by Reid and Mahomes? maybe, maybe not. so let's look at similar instances. the closest you'll get is McDaniels who had Belichick and Brady. he failed. twice. does not speak well for EB. what about his predecessors? Nagy and Pederson had Reid but not Mahomes. so that's a big difference off the bat. let's overlook that for a second. well Nagy failed. Pederson is doing well. so if you count both of McDaniels' hirings then you are looking at a 75% failure rate in recent memory. that's without even bringing up his background being RB not QB (and it is a QB league) or any of his background check red flags. so maybe you roll the dice on him with OC but it's not unreasonable for teams to not be willing to do that with HC.

I say it was easily as important if not moreso. First off, if both calls are made correctly, BOTH teams would've had roughly a 1st and goal at around the 2-3 yard line, and both teams would've scored a TD instead of a FG. The end result would've still been a 3-pt New Orleans lead with roughly the same amount of time left on the clock for the Rams to march down the field for the game tying FG - and maybe even MORE time would've been left. 

About the missed facemask: 

I agree with all the ""haters"" who push back on this missed facemask on one point: you DON'T have the luxury of going back and pointing out EVERY missed penalty and/or BAD penalty called earlier in a critical game as a counter argument to a horrendous call at the end. 

However....


The missed facemask on Goff is the ***only*** reason the missed DPI on the Rams if called correctly likely would have sealed the win for the Saints. The Rams were 2nd and goal from the 8. Goff finds no one open and scrambles to the left close to the sidelines and slides inbounds at the Saints 4 yard line. CRITICAL POINT: When you slide, YOU ARE DOWN. No one has to touch you to down you. As Goff slides, a Saints LB goes across Goff's body and actually slides out of bounds past Goff. In doing so, the Saints player reaches BACK with his hand - well after going past Goff and well after Goff's slide and is down - and gets his hand into Goff's facemask, pulling Goff's head sideways to the left. 

This is as clear a facemask on a play involving a QB as you can get. Inadvertent or not - the Saints player had NO BUSINESS touching Goff at all - let alone reaching BACKWARDS and grabbing his facemask. Instead of 3rd and goal at the 4, which the Rams failed to convert and settled for the game tying FG, it should've been 1st and goal half the distance to the goal at the 2, and the Rams should've easily scored within the same 2 plays it took them to get the game tying FG - but instead would've taken a 4-pt lead with the same amount of time left on the clock. 

Remember: when teams are down by FOUR, they won't milk the clock as much when they're already in FG range, because they don't have the luxury of knowing ""if we don't get a TD, at least we can kick the game tying FG"". So the Saints wouldn't have WANTED to leave time on the clock for the Rams to have a final drive, but they HAD to score FIRST in order to even TAKE the lead. Also, if the DPI is called, and it's 1st and goal at the 2-ish yard line with around 1:45 to go, the Rams would've just let the Saints ""March on in"" to the end zone; for the chance to get the ball back with plenty of time left to go down for the game trying FG.

There's no way in hell the Saints milk the clock down to less than :10 seconds as an example, to finally try to get the ball in the end zone for the go-ahead TD, because if they still don't get in, they don't have the insurance of knowing they can stop the clock to kick the go ahead FG, since they would be down by 4.",9.0,losangelesrams,t3_117yxna,False,0.0,Blue & Yellow Retro Ram,2023-02-21T08:15:29Z,losangelesrams,-0.0413882279939023

Actually, the Rooney Rule does that on it's own. Beyond trying to help black coaches, Dan Rooney also wanted to help out owners. He felt they were so quick to hire someone based off that they already knew the person or it came with a recommendation. He was adamant that long thorough coaching searches were good for teams and owners. Rooney family credits a rigorous coaching search, and not the Rooney rule, as to why they succeeded with Tomlin. The Rooney rule makes coaches look at candidates they other wise wouldn't, in the hopes they find a gem they other wise wouldn't have considered. It worked for a bit. More black coaches were hired and more quality coaches were hired.
