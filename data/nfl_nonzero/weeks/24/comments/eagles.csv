I see Eagle fans criticize the team all the time. Particularly towards the defense. But most of the  criticisms you posited are just not warranted.

“**Harder schedule**”


If this season has shown us anything it’s that you can’t judge how difficult a schedule will be.  Broncos,Packers,Raiders, Buccaneers we’re consider locked in for playoff teams but then reality happened.
Also free agency hasn’t even started let alone the draft. We don’t know the composition of the defenses.


We joke about the NFC Least but the Cowboy and Washington are top 10 in defense. The Chiefs were second in total sacks. If Jalen was going to regress in the face of better teams it would’ve happened by now

“**Teams will be more prepared**”

Planning can only take you so far and no plan survives first contact with reality. Also this question is rooted in the assumption that the Eagles won’t be more prepared or innovate

“**Kelce might retire**”

That would undeniably be a blow, but Kelce handpick successor is already in the building. Cam has been groomed by Kelce and Jeff for an entire season. You can’t get any better preparation than that.

Blitzing is used when you lack talent. The goal of a defense is to rush with the minimal amount of people needed to defend areas of the field with the most players possible.

If the best defensive football minds in the entire world aren't blitzing often (or are and they're getting beat when using it), then it's not a great idea.

When he was the Falcons’ OC, they were up 28-3 in the third quarter. He forgot what a running play was. They didn’t manage the clock and it was the easiest thing for them to change that would have resulted in a win. 

And this year’s NFCCG?

First, he froze on the Smith catch. On 4th and 3 you challenge that. But even if you are 100% certain it was a catch, you call timeout.  Why? Eagles offense was flexible and they went hurry up with no substitution. They were inside the 10. The 49ers needed to sub to a heavier defense to try to hold them to a FG. That he didn’t throw the challenge flag is understandable. But not calling a time out? He froze. 

Then there’s the fact that he didn’t know who Hassan Reddick was. He set his third string TE to block him one-on-one. No help. No chipping. And on the plays that he did this, Reddick recorded:

* 2 sacks
* 1 forced fumble resulting in turnover 
* 1 fumble recovery (second turnover)
* injured Brock Purdy
* 2nd turnover was on the Johnson injury

Yea, maybe you try to block the guy 2nd in the league in sacks?

15282,130196,130196,OverlyOptimisticNerd,"> Wouldn’t hurts make sense since he wasn’t taken in the first round and there wouldn’t be a fifth year option?

Due to the lack of an official 5th year option, the Eagles would need to use the franchise tag on him if it got that far. As a result, he has more leverage and more incentive to wait.

I broke it down - [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/115ixu7/pft_four_qbs_taken_in_the_2020_draft_hurts_burrow/j92rxax/)",4.0,nfl,t3_115ixu7,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-02-18T14:17:30Z,eagles,-0.085952734375
15283,130197,130197,OverlyOptimisticNerd,"My bet is on Tua, despite the popular pick being Hurts. All 4 QBs have a ""5th year option,"" when you factor in the franchise tag for Jalen Hurts. Here's their current 5th year values (NOTE: I used the 2022 QB franchise tag value for Hurts, but 2024 will be higher, with projections mostly in the $35M-$38M range right now).

* [Joe Burrow (#1)](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cincinnati-bengals/joe-burrow-47594/) - $29,504,000
* [Tua Tagovailoa (#5)](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/miami-dolphins/tua-tagovailoa-47598/) - $23,171,000
* [Justin Herbert (#6)](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/los-angeles-chargers/justin-herbert-47599/) - $29,504,000
* [Jalen Hurts (#53)](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/jalen-hurts-47648/) - $29,703,000

Given that any extension on Hurts would take effect after year 4, and the franchise tag will be higher than any 2020 draftee's 5th year option, Hurts has serious leverage here. QBs will want to be the last one to sign so that they can leverage the other QBs to get the most money. Burrow, Herbert, and Hurts have all earned that leverage given their level of play combined with having the 3 highest tag/5th year values.

But Tua? He's underperformed and had injury issues. He's the biggest question mark of the group AND has the lowest 5th year value. I see this going one of two ways:

1. Either he agrees to sign first, at a below-market value, trading higher money with more up-front guaranteed given his issues. **OR,**
2. The Dolphins don't take his 5th year option, instead using his 4th year as a prove-it year. If this happens, he's on a Franchise tag (like Hurts at this point). But, given his history, unless he grossly outperforms the other 3 in 2023, he's not going to get the biggest deal so will be the first domino to fall.

Jalen Hurts doesn't make the list because he has 1,040 career pass attempts (1,170 counting playoffs), and the minimum cutoff is 1,500. 

Hurts' career win-loss is 23-11 in the regular season and 2-2 in the post season, for an overall of 25-13 (0.658), which would put him in 17th place behind Stabler, bumping Young and the others down.

Given how his career started, he has a good shot at climbing that list. In 2020 he started 4 games on a depleted team. In 2021 he led a rebuilding team (with a then record dead cap hit from Wentz) to the playoffs. And we all saw what he just did this year.

Since that hit he's been, unfortunately, a bottom tier NFL QB.

So is 3 years of top tier QB'ing after a solid rookie season, plus a super bowl, enough to not be considered a bust, where after that he fell off a cliff?

I'd say no, he's not a bust considering the above.

Also I just can't fault a guy for getting his head scrambled from a dirty hit.

Verdict: Not a bust.
