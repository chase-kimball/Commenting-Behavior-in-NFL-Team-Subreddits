If you want to know how that went, just watch his first career start vs the Browns.

Then Matt Nagy and Ryan Pace, the GM who drafted him, were fired, and a whole new coaching staff is brought in.

Some of my favorite sleepers are:

Rashee Rice: I think he’s one of those who’s gonna outperform his draft position by quite a bit. He won’t light up the combine but he’s got good size, speed, and most importantly he has very reliable hands and a massive catch radius. He was also very productive in his senior season with 1,355 yards and 10 touchdowns. He has the potential to be a true #1 on the Bears.

Puka Nacua: some of the same reasons I like Rice apply here. Nacua had a very good senior bowl which will make him rise on draft boards. Similarly to Rice, he won’t blow you away athletically but he’s above average in almost every category, and in a class where a ton of receivers are below 6’, Nacua’s 6’3 stands out. Like Rice, he’s very consistent and productive and can make all of the catches. He’d be a very good day 3 pick.

Joe Tippmann: If you’re looking for a center in this class, Joe Tippmann might be the top center by the time draft day rolls around. He has incredible athleticism and size, and pretty good with the technical stuff, too.

DeMarvion Overshown: a converted safety, Overshown is an athletic, hard-hitting linebacker with good coverage skills. He is the definition of a HITS player and Eberflus would love to have him on his defense. The main thing with Overshown will be consistency.

And he did this with a far worse O Line and receiving corps than hurts. They also didn’t even adjust the offense to his strengths until about game 6.

But in the AFC we always knew that the Steelers, the Ravens, the Chargers, the Colts and The Patriots were the division holders and therefore going to the playoffs. 

So I don't think they wasted the window per se, I just think that the Packers window has a lot more obstacles and difficulties than any counterparts in the AFC. We put Rodgers in the AFC for his playing time and I think he's right up there with Brady, Big Ben, Manning, etc etc.

Been working on this in my spare time during work. Took data from Sporttrac, overthecap, The Athletic, PFF, and occasionally having to google some things, put it into one spreadsheet.

The ""projected"" contracts are from PFF and probably wildly off, but it gives a ballpark idea, maybe.  I wouldn't put a bunch of stock in PFF ratings either.  Sample sizes are different, and it's an imperfect system, but it gives a ballpark idea, maybe.

Not meant to be a ""tracker"" but more of a way to visualize the different variables, e.g. what free agent classes are deep vs. what draft classes are deep. I will update it on occasion but not often enough that it should be considered a ""tracker"".

I'll post it periodically in the megathreads, when the megathreads get posted and if I do updates.

The ""projected"" contracts are from PFF and probably wildly off, but it gives a ballpark idea, maybe.  I wouldn't put a bunch of stock in PFF ratings either.  Sample sizes are different, and it's an imperfect system, but it gives a ballpark idea, maybe.

Not meant to be a ""tracker"" but more of a way to visualize the different variables, e.g. what free agent classes are deep vs. what draft classes are deep. I will update it on occasion but not often enough that it should be considered a ""tracker"".

I'll post it periodically in the megathreads, when the megathreads get posted and if I do updates.

I like how dismissive you were of the roster in your follow up comment, as if that's not a legit reason for the passing game being bad.  Here's some facts about the Bears roster that affected the passing game:

[The 2022 salary cap was $208 million.  Bears spent $140 million.  That included paying Quinn and Roquan.  The roster talent was ass.](https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/11/16/bears-taking-advantage-salary-cap-packers-deadline-dan-snyder)

[Bears #2 and #3 receivers by playing time were Equanimeous St. Brown and Dante Pettis.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2022-snap-counts.htm)  When Mooney was out for 5.5 games, they were the #1 and #2.  Mooney was graded as PFF's 52nd best receiving as far as the passing game goes (not counting run blocking since everyone wants to shit on Fields as a passer).  Brown was #92, Dante Pettis was #108.  So, literally, Fields was throwing to the 92nd and 108th best receivers in the NFL for a huge bulk of the time.  I know PFF isn't a perfect system but that should give you a rough idea of their caliber.  I'd give you a link but it's behind a paywall.

They offensive line played fairly well in run blocking.  In pass blocking, they were ass, and it's hard to give exact stats on pass blocking, but their PFF pass blocking rankings for their respective positions were: Braxton Jones #42, Borom #44, Reiff #50, Schofield #15 (played in 40% of the snaps), Whitehair #38, Jenkins #40, Mustipher #30.  So that's one solid player in the pass blocking game.  I would give you a link, but the source is PFF which is behind a paywall.  I'm not even really trying to shit on the line either.  They got better as the year went on and did a solid job run blocking, but you can see why Fields may have struggled at times with all the fucking sacks.

Bears also had the worst fucking defense in the NFL.  Worst than the fucking Lions.  You know how bad you have to be to be worse than the fucking Lions?  Really fucking bad.  Why is that relevant?  Because it affected the play calling.

Getsy knew that the best chance the Bears had to stay competitive in any games is to run the fucking ball.  The offensive line was pretty decent in pass blocking.  The receivers were pretty decent pass blockers.  Montgomery and Herbert were really solid backs, and Fields is maybe the best rushing QB of all time.  That was the offense's strength personnel-wise.  It was also the best way to play ball control and keep the other team's offense off the field given how terrible the defense was. Add all of it up and maybe and that's why [the Bears ran the ball more than any other team in the NFL](https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/passing-play-pct)

Despite all those circumstances, filthy fucking casual fans like yourself, or hot take media, look at the box score and say ""wow the passing yards aren't great, Fields must be bad.""  And granted, Fields definitely needs to be more consistent in the passing game.  You know who shares that opinion?  Justin Fucking Fields, the front office, and the coaching staff.  They've been plenty clear about it in press conferences and interviews.  But there were A LOT of other contributing factors that affected the passing game other than Fields.  The front office and coaching staff know that, but they also know they gave Fields just about zero fucking help.  They also know that Fields has shown quite a few [""Holy fuck did you see that throw""](https://youtu.be/K4daJ45LcFY) passing plays, meaning he has the physical ability and talent to make just about any throw he wants.  [He was also PFF's most accurate passer EVER coming out of college.](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-chicago-bears-justin-fields-most-accurate-quarteback-ohio-state-pff-college-era)  So there's a foundation to build on and develop.

I haven't even mentioned that he had to learn two offensive systems in two years, but here's a mention of that as well.

Rushing wise, everyone wants to be dismissive of that for some absurd fucking reason reason, like rushing yards don't count and rushing TDs are worth less.  2nd best rushing season by a QB EVER, single game record for a regular season game.  Plenty of times this year, he was the best fucking athlete on the field.  You know who respects the fuck out of that?  [Opposing players and coaches.](https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/justin-fields-bears-quarterback-nfl-compliments).  He's also been pretty open about how many times he had to run this past year because he had to, meaning it was a broken passing play because nobody was open or that pass rush fucked it up.  Future years shouldn't be so run heavy, but his rushing ability is always going to help him in critical 3rd/4th down or red zone situations, like a Josh Allen or Jalen Hurts except with better rushing ability.  It also opens up the passing game with play FUCKING action.

And he still put up solid numbers overall, despite his terrible supporting cast: 3385 yards in 15 games (2242 passing and 1143 rushing, 225 yards per game), 60% completions, 7.1 yards per attempt, 25 TDs (17 passing 8 rushing), 13 turnovers (11 INTs 2 fumbles).  

Compare that with Year 2 Josh Allen with 3599 yards in 16 games (225 yards per game), 59% completion percentage, 6.7 yards per attempt, 29 TDs (20 passing 9 rushing), 13 turnovers (9 INTs 4 fumbles).  

Or Year 2 Jalen Hurts with 3928 total yards in 16 games (3144 passing and 784 rushing, total of 245 yards per game), 61% completion, 7.3 yards per attempt, 26 TDs (16 passing, 10 rushing), 11 turnovers (9 INTs 2 fumbles).

As a Bears fan, I think it's most likely we trade back with you over the Colts unless Ballard takes a different approach than he had previous years with moving up.  With Reich, McCown, and Caldwell, it seems every indication is that you plan to draft a qb and develop him.  Cost will be interesting,  but I'm excited to see how it plays out.  If you hit in qb with the other pieces on the team, you can dominate your division for the foreseeable future.

If Williams and Maye were in this draft, the option to trade up wouldn't be there.  You've got to hope your gm trades up and finds a qb who can develop like Allen, Mahomes, Lamar, Watson, etc.  Two of the prospects this year are better entering the nfl than those players were.  

>But who is going to cost the Panthers more in a trade, Aaron Rodgers or Bryce Young? Young is going to cost us, likely, a 1st, 2nd, and future 1st. You think the Packers would give us Rodgers for that?

Rodgers isn't being traded to the NFC, costs 100 million for 2 years of football.  There's really no convo here as it's not an option for you.  

>just not sure there is a huge gap between Young, Stroud, Levis, and Richardson.

The gap between Young in this draft to Richardson is like the gap between participants Mahomes and James Winston.  I've watched every snap Richardson has played and am a big fan, he's not going to contribute positive play at qb for 2 years.  Similar with Levis.  They are going to steuggle heavily and need patience.  Maybe they eventually vet to Youngs level, or Strouds, but to think they are kn the same level isn't real.  

>Still on the page of bringing in a guy like Levis or Richardson at 9 to develop with this staff while bringing in a proven veteran to be a bridge for a couple of years(Brissett or JimmyG). That or hoping that the Ravens don't tag/sign Lamar and you're able to bring him in and build your offense around him.

Maybe.  I think the big thing with hownthe Panthers are built is how much a rookie qb contract helps them.  They could potentially be laying big money to two tackles, 2 corners, an edge, and a wr, a rookie contract helps even that out.

20016,89772,89772,HopLegion,"I actually disagree a little here.  I think it's as simple as which team offers the most draft value.  It's easier for the Colts because picks 4+35  start with a lot more value than picks 9, 39.  Though poles may want to stay in the top 4, i have no real doubt he just wants the most draft value he can get.   He's talked at length about building through the draft.  The bigger the ""war chest"" of picks in regards to value, the better.  

Overall, I think Carolina will be more aggressive because they have known commodities like burns, so w3ill feel more comfortable moving future firsts.  Basically, if the two offers below are what's offered, I think beads would go Panthers over colts even if it means moving back to 9 because the value is higher.  

- Colts offer picks 4, 35 24 1st.

- Panthers offer picks 9, 39, 91, 24 1st, 25 1st.  

That would give the bears picks 9, 39, 52, 65, and 91 in this draft + multiple firsts the next 2 years.

This argument never makes sense because elite prospects aren't available for trade   Who is the best prospect s team has ever traded up for?  Elite prospects aren't available for trade up because they get picked by the team with the pick.  Anyone saying ""wait for next year and trade up"" is delusional because if those qbs hit expectations those teams who have the picks aren't trading them.  You have to be aggressive when there's a good option on the table.  The qbs this year is as good as it gets for prospects and bears being at 1 is a rare oppurtunity which happens once every 5 years or so.

>The Eagles gave up a haul to draft Carson Wentz in 2016 and he’s not with them anymore. Washington gave up a haul for RG3 and injuries derailed his career.

Eagles don't win their only Superbowl of the last 30 yesrs without Wentz (yes I know Foles got them over the finish line in the playoffs) they probably regret the early extension, not the results.  

RG3 won rookie over the year over Andrew luck.  Should the Colts have passed on Luck due to his career being cut short?   You can't predict injuries, RG3 had the talent and was on his way.

And mooney Started 12 games and once he was injured there was claypool, another receiver who had success prior to the bears but couldn't here. Herbert played in 13. Jenkins started 13. It's not like they missed the majority of the season as an excuse.  And is Braxton good or do we have to add caveats? Cody's 14 pressures allowed is the lowest since 2018. His 97.2 Efficiency is right along with his career average of 98. He was the same cody that was being hyped up all pre season and all season as being a proven starter. Alongside Jenkins and Jones.

There is plenty of talent to be an average NFL offense, especially if you're proclaiming Justin to be a top 10 caliber QB,  not to be pretending that anything above bottom 3 is overachieving. 

The giants achieved more with less. The pats achieved more with less and with a QB we're saying Justin is better than. The Panthers achieved more with less. The Falcons Achieved more with less. Arguably the Packers achieved more with less. The Titans WR corp is vastly worst. the Jets WR corp is as bad. The Ravens have 1 great TE and fuck all elsewhere. The Texans have one solid WR1 and fuckall elsewhere. The packers had a collection of WR2/3 like us. The broncos have a collection of WR2/3 like us. The steelers have a collection of WR2/3 like us, and we took one of their WR2/3s. The Saints without Thomas have a RB whose oft injured and fuckall. The jags had the laughing stock of free agency and fuck all. 

It's just insane how this sub wants to simultaneously praise everyone and shit on everyone. Fields, Mooney, Claypool, Jones, Kmet, Herbet...but we couldn't possibly be better then 5th worst offense because we don't have a WR1 and a shit center that poles re-signed...and we can't criticize poles for re-signing him either. Amon St Brown has as many 1k seasons as Mooney. It's not like every team in the NFL is the Dolphins. There is an extremely warped perspective of what offensive talent is around the league to think the Bears overachieved and the coaching staff warrants praise for 'getting the most' out of guys.

&#x200B;

The offense lacked talent to be top 5-10, it didn't lack talent to be league average if Fields is the guy. And 5th worst total offense, worst pass offense by nearly 500 yards, and 10th worst by points isn't reflective of the talent on the team if you want to praise coaching as overachieving the talent.",1.0,chibears,t3_117lnxk,False,0.0,An Actual Peanut,2023-02-21T19:50:45Z,chibears,-0.0250354594841815

27188,143167,143167,Petricorde1,"Mooney getting injured and Fields becoming good mostly coincided. From after week 7 to about week 12-13, where everyone I mentioned started becoming seriously injured, we had the best offense in the NFL and we averaged 30 ppg. So I would argue that our offense *was* humming before key injuries.

A lot of the teams you listed had offenses worse than us lmao. The Jets, Patriots, Broncos, and Texans had worst offensive DVOA's than us and the Titans, Ravens, and Panthers had nearly identical. 3/4ths of the teams you used as examples as offenses way better than ours just statistically weren't. And if you start counting our offense from week 7 (where, again, Justin Fields actually became good) then our offense was better than all the teams you listed.

And no, half the players you listed I'm not praising. Claypool is an absolute bum, Jones was a bottom 5-10 pass blocker in the league, Mooney is a decent WR2. I'd say the only two players that you listed besides Fields who I'm confident is a top 15 player in their position right now is Herbert and Kmet.

And we saw the offense without Fields multiple times - it was literally the worst in the NFL. When Peterman or Siemian played games, we were the worst offense in the NFL.

They're both slow burns. They take their time setting up the world in which they tell their stories at the beginning and then take things up a notch with each successive season. As far as ""picking up"" goes, I can hardly remember any big actions scenes in either the Sopranos or The Wire--at least in comparison to Breaking Bad, if that's what you mean. Then again, their narratives were never really about grandiose action set pieces. The stakes just get bigger (S5 of The Wire notwithstanding lol)

While I personally think both the former shows are better than BB, I'd consider them both to have a lot more similarities to Better Call Saul (another phenomenal show if you haven't yet watched; I actually like it a *lot* more than BB).

&#x200B;


Currently the 17th game is played at home for the NFC one year and the AFC the next.  Instead, it should be a neutral away game played at college stadiums, or international games.  The intention is to provide as many fans as possible who currently live 2+ hours away from an NFL stadium to be able to see an NFL game.

&#x200B;

The smallest NFL stadium holds 61.5k fans, and there are 63 college/other stadiums that hold atleast 50k fans (many are bigger than the biggest NFL stadiums).  We can whittle that down to 40 at least 2 hours away from a current NFL stadium, then 25 that would make good sense for what we're doing.

&#x200B;

Each game has two teams so there are 16 games to fill each season.  We want to leave space for the international games, so we can put each of the stadiums into 8 games, in groups of 2 to 4 stadiums.

&#x200B;

Each group has multiple teams, so each stadium would host a game once every few years.  So if a group has 3 stadiums, each would host a game every 3 years.  If the group had 4 stadiums, each would host a game every 4 years.

11. Canada \[Roaming between different Canadian cities\]
12. Mexico City
13. London
14. London
15. Europe \[Could be just Germany, or it could rotate around countries/cities\]
16. Rest of the World \[Would go all over the world.  Japan, Australia, China, India, Africa, Brazil, etc.\]

&#x200B;

For game 10 there are a few possibilities.  We could add more stadiums, add another Canada/Europe game, or make a few of the groups smaller.

&#x200B;

Advantages

* More fans get the opportunity to see an NFL game who can't/wont travel
* Get to see NFL games in classic or famous stadiums
* St. Louis and Oakland get to have some games back (San Diego tore down it's stadium and dosen't have a big college stadium)
* Get to try out different markets for an NFL team without committing to them
* Brings a NFL game to within 2 hours of all but 2 of the top 50 US Metro areas (Sorry San Diego/Virginia Beach!).  This adds 12 to the existing NFL teams.

Disadvantages

* One less home game for one side
* The ""Rest of the World"" game would suck for the teams involved.  Fortunately, each team would only have to do it every 16 years
* Potential problems filling stadiums

Good players on cheap contracts are nice, but not what the Bears need at this point in their development.  Non first round picks are great, but not worth moving missing out on the top non QB over. 

&#x200B;

What they do need is stars and game changers.  The question is what's the best way to get those.  

&#x200B;

IMO you need to take a shot at a top 5 pick, mid and late 1sts arn't going to have the same chance of being a star as those guys, though three mid 1st round picks would be more likely.

So it all depends on the offers.

Yes the Chiefs draft later than most teams. They also had two firsts which you're leaving out. 

You ignored my firs point so I'm assuming you don't agree that adding this draft class to say the Jets, Lions, Seahawks or really any team suddenly make them win the superbowl.

But let's humor you and disregard the Jets franchise changing draft. Let's compare it to the Seahawks also 2022 draft.

Woolen over McDuffie, Walker over Pacheco, Mafe over Karlaftis. The Chiefs could have taken each of them, and none of them were firsts. 

Better yet, they could have traded down out of each of their firsts for Walker and Mafe and still gotten Moore and a ton more picks. On top of that they got two good tackles the Chiefs could really use.

Chiefs had a top 30 to 40 draft of the past 10 years. They got 4 average starting caliber players. Most teams get 1 to 3.  Though 3 of  the 4 were first or second round picks and the other was a RB.

Its hard to compare that to the great drafts other teams have had when they drafted just as many or more starters, or drafted lots of starters and genuine stars. That's fine, the Chiefs didn't need stars, they needed safe, good players on cheap multi year contracts and that's what they got. They had the perfect draft for them.

If you have a top QB you pay them alot.  If you don't you pay your QB a little.

So if you have an expensive QB, that's less you can spend on the rest of your roster.  So a Mahomes is making 20% while a Mariota is making 4.5%.  That's 15.5% that the entire rest of your roster can be better than the expensive teams.

I also simply don't know what you mean in terms of poor arm strength or him being slow. He's obviously not Josh Allen but he's certainly not deficient in that category.

We make excuses for Kyle Shanahan for the years Jimmy G has been injured, but Nagy never even got someone in the same class as Jimmy G. Obv some of the blame goes to him as HC, but outside of 2018, the defense was just slightly above average, not actually good.
