11985,80807,80807,JBrundy,"Here is the problem with all those other runningbacks you mentioned… the runningback that took some carries away was actually really good. Thats kind of important. You can give carries to another runningback if you have 2 good runningbacks, not 1 great one and a shit one. Literally all of the other runningbacks you mentioned are/were nearly pro bowl level talents. Of course your gonna give them the ball. 

Charles was statistically better in literally every situation. 
They barely even used Jones more in short yardage and he had way too many carries on 1st down. Jones had 40 carries with 1-3 yards to go, charles had 27. And guess what? Charles was signify better in those situations. Charles averaged 4.6 yards per carry, jones averaged 2.8. He also got first down in those situations at a significantly higher rate. 

Christian Mccaffrey is about 205, why does he get all the carries? Tony Dorsett was 192, walter payton was 200, thurman thomas was 200. Ever hear of a guy named Chris Johnson? I hear he had some good seasons. Speed guy but he carried the ball a lot. Pleanty of small runningbacks got tons of carries, because they were good enough to do it, so was charles. 

Thomas Jones getting 26 more carries than Charles on 1st and 10 is one of the stupidest things i’ve ever seen. Charles should gotten almost every 1st down carry so the y could get Jones out there so that maybe he could get the last 2 yards on 2nd, 3rd and 4th because it would probably take him 3 downs to do it. But it would probably only take Charles 1 because he was much better in short yardage, and literally everything else. 

I’m not saying give charles 350 carries. But why not 275? Look at 2012 and 2013, charles had 285 carries and 259. He didn’t share the backfield with anybody. They had peyton hillis but they rarely used him, probably because he averaged 3.6 yards per carry. 

Charles has the highest yards/carry in NFL history. It was stupid to not give him the ball more. I don’t know how anyone can argue otherwise.",1.0,nfl,t3_118b9kk,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2023-02-22T14:56:36Z,ravens,-0.0123504017400079
11986,80808,80808,JBrundy,"I can’t believe you are this dense. Your really gonna have 15 2-3 yard runs all game and stall entire drives hoping for 1 big run? Guess what? Plenty of great speed backs in the league today, they still get the ball 15-20 times a game. I’d personally prefer 5-7 yard runs that extend drives, but thats just me i guess. 

The ravens literally do this with gus edwards and dobbins all the time. Give gus the ball in short yardage situations, give it to dobbins 75% of other situations. It seems to work out pretty well for them, they were only the greatest rushing team in NFL history. 

You don’t give a shitty runningback that only gets 3 yards the ball more than one of the best runningbacks in the league. 6.4 yards is better than 3.7 yards, no matter the style. Jones should get it on 3rd and 4th and short and thats about it, other than regular substitions when charles needs a break. 

This is the way pretty much everyone does it. Do you the browns giving Kareem Hunt 250 carries instead of Chubb? The jags traded away james robinson because he wasn’t better than Etienne, they didn’t give robinson more carries. The colts give it to taylor, the raiders give it to jacobs, the eagles give it to sanders, the giants give it to saquon, the list goes on.

His curl routes are the only non vertical routes that I have seen him run well, and that is honestly just because he's leveraging the threat of his straight line speed with his eyes and the way he runs the route, not because he stops on a dime very quickly.

The only aspect of his game that isn't below NFL caliber other than his insane speed is his hands which are average imo. Biggest concern with him is gonna be press coverage.

I have been saying, and will continue to say, that we can find talent equivalent to that of the usual suspects at WR everyone is clamoring for us to pick in the first (Addison, Flowers, JSN, Johnston) in rounds 2-5. This year, the best CBs are better than the best WRs, and the middle of the pack is deeper at WR than it is at CB (with the exception of a couple of lower-rated, low-floor/high-ceiling guys like Rezjohn Wright).

If there isn’t a CB we like still available at 22, and if no one is willing to give us the right package for 22, Bijan does give us a player with elite potential at a position that (a) has little to no learning curve and (b) that we already value and utilize more than most other teams. 

Something else to keep in mind is that we will probably be shopping at least one of Clark, Duvernay, Edwards, Gus, Hill, and maybe even Queen. If we can get some decent picks for those guys, or even do something like using Queen in a trade for a WR like Corey Davis or Adam Thielen, then we will have a lot more flexibility to draft BPAs regardless of position (or to headhunt guys we really want). 

I’d feel a lot better about drafting Bijan if we are able to secure more picks, but even if we can’t do that we will still have four picks to get a couple of WRs, a CB, and an edge rusher or guard. Will be interesting to see what kind of roster moves we make leading up to the draft, because depending on if/who we trade away or acquire, our positional needs could change quite a bit.",2.0,ravens,t3_117ctgw,False,0.0, :OLD2:,2023-02-20T13:31:17Z,ravens,0.0449186162576899

26724,157625,157625,StylezG_White,"Credit: u/uggsandstarbux for this. It includes roster moves as well as pick swaps. Here’s the comment I left on the original post:

First off, thanks for this. I’m sure it took a lot of time and effort on your part. I especially appreciate the roster moves you included.

As a Ravens fan, I’m like 50/50 on this. I’m not crazy about cutting Gus but I understand that it’s a possibility. I’m happy about re-signing Powers as well as the the Lazard acquisition.

Not a huge fan of the Bills trade; I’d hope we could get more for that trade-back to 27. But I’ll admit I’m no expert on valuing pick swaps so I’ll roll with it for the purpose of this analysis/feedback.

I wouldn’t be mad at the first three picks (JSN, Jaylon Jones, and Adeboware). I’m super high on Adeboware and if we can get him at 91 that’s a steal and a no-brainer.

But I’m not sold on Byron Young, although I do understand that lots of big boards would probably project him to be long-gone by 124. But according to your board, if Jaquelin Roy, Kendre Miller, Mo Ibrahim, Riley Moss, or Xavier Hutchinson are all still there, I’d rather draft any of them with that pick.

Re-signing Ben Powers does negate the need for a guard somewhat, but our depth at that position still scares me a little due to Zeitler’s age and Cleveland’s lack of development to this point. Plus the Ravens have been cursed with injuries the last couple of years. So if Mafi, Kirkland, and Scruggs are all still on the board, I’m giving them serious consideration as well and am picking any of them over Byron Young.

Cameron Latu at 199 makes no sense. Yes, we love us some TEs, but we have four very capable guys already at that position, three of which are still so young. Give me Ochaun Mathis, Deuce Vaughn, or Ricky Stromberg with that pick instead.

I have no problem with taking Aubrey Miller with the last pick.

One question: did anyone draft Keaton Mitchell (RB from East Carolina)? I didn’t see him on the spreadsheet and if he’s available with one of those later picks I’d throw him into the mix for us as well.

Anyway, if it were me drafting, and all of the roster moves and pick swaps remained the same, this is what I’d probably do:

27: Emmanuel Forbes

86: Adetomiwa Adeboware

91: AT Perry or Parker Washington (leaning towards Parker, although I’d probably go AT if I wasn’t confident that Parker or Xavier Hutchinson would be there at 124)

124: Xavier Hutchinson

199: Deuce Vaughn

205: Aubrey Miller or Ricky Stromberg (leaning towards Stromberg; depends on what we do with Patrick Queen)",7.0,ravens,t3_116jd49,False,0.0, :OLD2:,2023-02-19T12:00:02Z,ravens,0.0210544074338327

If we get a WR it will be a role player like Willie Snead was, nobody splashy.

We have a talented OLine for the run game, huge guys that straight maul DLines. We have the best and biggest FB in the league. We have a RB that averaged 6ypc coming off a knee injury (and before) who also put up 8 and 9.6 ypc games right after the clean up surgery. Oh yeah, and we have LJ.

We almost never got stopped running the ball we always just abandoned it. GRo would try to force his shit passing concepts to work, and abandon the run and by the time he stopped it would be too late to get the run game back rolling.

Not to mention with Bateman, Andrews, Robinson (who had really good hands last year), and Likely.. we have enough solid targets for Lamar to throw too. If you give them actual bonafide routes in a even semi competent passing game instead of what ever in Peewee football hell Roman was doing, I guarantee you will see a super dangerous passing game with the players we have already.
