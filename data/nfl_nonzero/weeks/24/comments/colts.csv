Brents has the straight-line speed to recover. His ball skills are tremendous, with good hands and the potential to take it to the house any time Brents gets his hands on the ball.

Can get up under a receiver’s chin and has the speed to flip his hips and run downfield. Brents has the quick and surprisingly powerful hands to jostle receivers early. But he’s at his best peeking into the backfield.

Has smooth body control with the fluid ability to plant and redirect in any direction. Plays fast and decisive, arriving to the play with fierce intentions.

Gives up his body in run support with a very good closing burst.

Tracks the ball well downfield and shows good ball skills, including the ability to go up and high-point it in contested-catch situations.

Tracks the ball well and has the natural ball skills for forcing turnovers.


**His reported weaknesses:**

Needs to develop a better understanding of route combinations and better overall vision.

Feet aren’t ideal, as Brents gets sloppy in his backpedal and can be sluggish when transitioning to close on the ball.

Needs to improve his footwork and balance in coverage. Transitions out of his backpedal too early and doesn't look natural moving in reverse.",8.0,colts,t3_114wc5k,False,0.0,Andrew Luck,2023-02-17T15:19:09Z,colts,-0.0173487744421085

Everyone gets what they want, but it’s obvious there’s some fuckery and most of these guys don’t know more about scouting than the average fan.

That being said, Richardson’s ceiling is clearly the stratosphere, and one thing I will say is that I’ve gone from intrigued by him to kinda convincing myself he could be the guy since we hired Steichen. If he and JBC can use Richardson as a plus-one rusher while still developing his mechanics, he could do a lot for us. The problem we could have on our hands is our receivers can’t get separation either, but again, with a new offensive mind at the helm and a QB who isn’t nearing the end of their career, I’m ready to be optimistic that we’re gonna have better game plans no matter who we get.",2.0,colts,t3_119gt5s,False,0.0,MegaStrachan,2023-02-22T22:33:31Z,colts,0.128928768

I totally agree that being able to move the chains with your legs is a huge benefit, but it just seems like with Richardson specifically, his accuracy is such an issue that it negates him as a dual threat. It’s just the opposite side of the spectrum of someone like Rivers who was a statue back there. When you don’t have to plan for both threats, it makes it easier to stagnate an entire offense, in the sense that instead of being able to drop back in  coverage  and only send your front 3 or 4 to rush against a statue pocket passer, against someone who only completes 52% of his passes at the college level and is a true running threat, I’ve gotta think I’m playing press man coverage and squeezing  down my ends against a dude like Richardson and forcing him to beat me on slants, screens, and three step drops.

Despite the fact that Wentz had a *much* better season statistically, I do kinda agree w you. I reckon the eval was that a lot of his terrible play was based on his decision making & shit like that. And I think they believed if anybody could fix that, it would be Frank. Altho I do remember he was the one pushing for Wentz really hard, so it’s a valid criticism of both Frank for thinking he could pull it off & of Ballard/Irsay acquiescing.

You guys have a rapist who is eating over 20% of your salary cap for the next 4 years, no first round picks for the next 2 years, and a defensive end who’s likely more than halfway through his career. I’m going to say it’s the franchise that’s had more than 1 winning season in the last 10 years. Also, y’all are literally the Cleveland Browns. How did one playoff berth convince you all that you’re anything more than the same trash franchise you’ve been since before anyone in this draft was born?
