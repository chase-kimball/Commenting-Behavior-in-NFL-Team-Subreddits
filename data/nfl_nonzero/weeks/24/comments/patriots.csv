30131,295599,295599,peppersge,"The NFL has massively higher labor costs than most industries. As a rule of thumb, you aim for labor to be \~30% of the cost at the most. That is seen in things like restaurants. Some industries that are heavily service focused and require a lot of human labor and skill  (e.g. health care) might approach 50%.

The NFL already mandates that 50% of the costs have to go towards a top set of employees. As a result, running an NFL team is an entirely different paradigm. You can't use tricks like making workers more efficient to reduce labor costs since the labor costs are fixed by law. The players have one of the most friendly contracts. Their pay scales with revenue and they are also in a scalable model that will not get diluted (it doesn't require the players to do more labor for a game that reaches 10,000 people versus 100,000 people nor will there be an issue of more players getting hired and taking up chunks of the pie). That contrasts with positions like retail where expansion comes with costs that prevents the benefits from trickling down to individual people (e.g. increased food sales don't necessarily benefit individual people since money from increased sales gets diluted out because they have to hire more staff to make the food that gets sold. That is not to say that people as a whole don't benefit as the presence of more jobs may result in employment opportunities that were not otherwise available).

That is not to say that a franchise isn't profitable, but owners probably end up having more potential to earn money by using the stadium and surrounding assets (e.g. parking) for other events.
