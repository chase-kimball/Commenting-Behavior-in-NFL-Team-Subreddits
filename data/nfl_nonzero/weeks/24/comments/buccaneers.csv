3902,24805,24805,BuctheFalcons,"For this mock I went in assuming that we cut Smith and Lenny, we either roll with Trask or sign a low-tier QB in FA, and that we make no trades during the draft. Dean and SMB probably walk in FA, but maybe we can keep SMB on a one year kind of prove-it deal with Dean walking. 

1.19 - Myles Murphy, EDGE Clemson. Murphy is a top tier athlete at a premium position. With Barrett coming off an injury that could permanently sap his explosiveness (especially with his age) and JTS failing (thus far) to show that he is THE guy going forward, it was hard to pass up Murphy here. He's a high upside player that could hopefully contribute year one as part of a solid rotation with Barrett and JTS. He was also BPA with the premium CB and OT prospects off the board. 

2.50 - Dawand Jones, OT Ohio State. Probably a boom or bust pick here. Jones is a monster of a man with good mobility for his size, however he has relatively slow feet much like our beloved franchise LT and resident football terrorist D. Smith.  If we ultimately end up shifting to a more run heavy scheme this offseason, it might protect him long enough to develop into a long term starter. 

3.82 - Moro Ojomo, IDL Texas. A higher floor play here. He didn't play as many snaps as you'd like due to the depth of Texas' DL, but he has traits that you'd like to see. Hopefully he can prove to be a solid rotational player along a younger DL.  

5.155 - Jaxson Kirkland, OG Washington. We need help on the inside of the offensive line. We need to do everything in our power to ensure that Luke Goedeke never takes another professional snap without earning his way back onto the field. It also doesn't hurt to build depth with an aging Mason and Jenson. 

5.175 - Mekhi Garner, CB LSU. He's a taller long armed corner. The goal here was to address depth at the position with some developmental upside if McCollum fails to make any progress. 

6.181 - Kenny McIntosh, RB UGA. He has solid size and great hands. While he was definitely more of a pass catching specialist for the Dawgs, he could have some rushing upside. Definitely slots in as a solid 2 or even 1B to White's 1/1A and provides good injury insurance assuming that we cannot afford one of the more well rounded RB FAs this offseason. 

6.196 - Cameron Brown, CB Ohio State. Another shot at grabbing/developing a rotational CB. If I'm going to watch dudes get toasted 20 times on Sundays, I want to at least delude myself into believing that they have promise and upside as a corner as opposed to our current situation where I justify the toasting by mumbling ""well at least they're a good special teamer"". 

7.323 - Drake Thomas, ILB NC State. A decent football player without a ton of athletic ability or great size. Hopefully a back-up for White and David while being a good special teams contributor. 

7.253 - Max Duggan, QB TCU. Dude plays with guts and has good legs. His tape from the TCU playoff run is more or less teaching tape for ""intangibles"". Not a great decision maker or NFL level QB just based on what he's put on tape.

If we stay at 19, or god forbid trade up, it’s a brutal pick. Sure it’s probably BPA and gives us a rock solid group of young RBs, but it’s not very good positional value. 

If we trade down a 1-2+ times into the mid/late 20s and accumulate a few day 2 or day 3 picks over the next two drafts I’ll be more on board. We just saw the Giants/49ers ride to the playoffs on the back of dual threat RBs and defensive play, and even the Falcons won a disproportionate amount of games given their horrid QB play/defense because their rushing attack was so good.

11311,74839,74839,Kreynard54,"So, if you understand what restructuring is, its usually paying out immediate money as a bonus to a player as opposed to breaking it up over the length of a contract.

**Im using fake numbers to simplify it below:**

So if Brady signed a 3 year deal when he got here for 120 million for example, you would think 40 million against the cap each year. thats most basic contracts without restructuring (I dont feel like googling actual numbers)

But what we did, to free up cap space after we won the super bowl, is after year 1, restructure his contract. We added 1 year to it these are called dead cap years, without him committing to the team to play, paid him a 40 million dollar bonus for his second season.

So far into year 2, hes at 70 million paid out before the second season has started in this scenario. Hes committed to this team for 3 years, but has 4 years on his contract.

Now that helped us in the short term lower his cap to say, 16.6 million, technically freeing up 14.4 million in cap space to re-sign players in that current year.  We did this with a BUNCH of players too.

What that effectively did, is lower his cap number from 30 million a year on the remaining two years, to 16.6 million in that case for that second year for three years. 2 are only committed to playing with us years.

Now, that money still counts against us. Theres 40 million that we paid out that we basically kicked down the road with a bonus/restructure, we moved it to his third year here and his 4th year without him. Due to that, His 3rd year of the contract he counted 36.6 million, and next year counts another 36.6 million in how the contract is structured against our cap.

Now hes retired so in this scenario and theirs an exception but not the one you think. If he signed with another team he counts the full amount against our cap. Theirs no way around it. If he stays retired, we get to split it with an extra year added on due to an exception in the rules.

TLDR: We paid him a lot of up front money to lower his cap number so that we could re-sign players, he wasnt being paid top dollar for a QB to begin with which was nice of him, but he did it basically to get immediate cash guaranteed.

Edit: Im not a math guy, but i wanted to give a ball park explanation lol, feel free to correct me on numbers.",1.0,buccaneers,t3_118a5td,False,0.0,:RedJersey69: Nice,2023-02-22T07:12:53Z,buccaneers,0.0446445430898292

I also like (but am hesitant) about him saying we won’t have a lot of different plays and will limit it to different plays out of diff formations. Sounds good because then players won’t have to think as much and can execute but I wonder how teams will defend us if we have a smaller selection of plays. Maybe I’m reading into it too much.

I think that All Pros and Pro Bowls help but if the numbers are up there, I think they will outshine the nominations. Evans has never been the best WR in the league at any year but he has been the most consistent top 10 player. Without a doubt he's better than Torry Holt, Steve Smith, and Reggie Wayne.

Additional stats: since entering the league in 2014, he is 2nd in TDs and 3rd in yards. Davante Adams has 6 more TDs, 788 less yards, and 86 more catches. Julio has 467 more yards, 38 fewer TDs, and 86 more catches. DeAndre Hopkins has 71 more yards, 12 fewer TDs, and 118 more catches.
