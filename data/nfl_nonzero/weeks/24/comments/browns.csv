So what is your point? If he isn't a project then he's majorly underperforming for someone who isn't a project. Also, he played over 50% of offensive snaps three times during his rookie year and ultimately played 30 more snaps than DPJ did in his rookie year. I wouldn't call it a starting role.

Sometimes Stefanski would put out a heavy set to draw the opposing defense into base 4-3/3-4 personnel and then run a play out of empty so a big LB is forced to cover a guy in space. Eagles run and pass out of the gun, almost always in a 3 WR set spread formation.  

It's almost opposite approaches. Eagles have been using the threat of the pass from the spread formation to create a light box for the run game, Browns were using the threat of the run from heavy/tight formations to open up the play action pass for Baker/Jacoby (and also to just bulldoze people in the run game). It's one way to maximise what your team can do when it's got a QB who can't always be trusted to run a straight dropback pass game - put them on rails with the play action game and draw the opponent into running loaded box cover 3. 

The incentives for Stefanski have changed with Watson. He's now got a QB who (in theory) is extremely good as a pure dropback passer and presents a run threat but has a strong preference for shotgun, and has a background in the spread-option-RPO stuff.

It's similar to what McVay did going from Goff (under centre tight formations, run first, strict guardrails) to Stafford (shotgun, spread out formations, LOADS of empty).

By all accounts, Bienemy completely falls apart in interviews when it comes to this. So while going in to the interview, Bienemy/Nagy/Reich/Mike McDaniel all faced similar uncertainty from management about their offensive prowess, the guys who got jobs were able to address it.
