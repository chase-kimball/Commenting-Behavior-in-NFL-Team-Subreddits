Durante su tiempo en la NFL, Montana sufri√≥ una variedad de lesiones, incluido un m√∫sculo de la espalda desgarrado, un hombro separado y un disco roto en la parte inferior de la espalda. Tambi√©n sufri√≥ una grave lesi√≥n en el codo que requiri√≥ cirug√≠a y lo hizo perderse casi toda la temporada de 1991.

Sin embargo, Montana era conocido por su capacidad para recuperarse de las lesiones y jugar a un alto nivel. Lider√≥ a los 49ers a cuatro victorias en el Super Bowl y fue nombrado MVP del Super Bowl tres veces.

En resumen, aunque Joe Montana sufri√≥ varias lesiones durante su carrera en la NFL, es dif√≠cil decir si era propenso a las lesiones en general. Pudo superar sus lesiones y lograr un gran √©xito en el campo.

Prep Time: 30 m | Cook Time: 2 h 30 m | Servings: 12

Ingredients:

Sauce:

1 pound sweet Italian sausage

3/4 pound lean ground beef

1/2 cup minced onion

2 cloves garlic, crushed

1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste

2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce

1/2 cup water

2 tablespoons white sugar

1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves

1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds

1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste

1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

The rest: 

12 lasagna noodles

16 ounces ricotta cheese

1 egg

3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced

3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:

In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 

In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 

Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.",8.0,nfl,t3_114n9fc,False,0.0,:Texans: Texans ,2023-02-17T09:41:44Z,texans,0.0144651271022019

My comment details why that doesn't work: because that money that gets restructured will still come due eventually, and continually offloading it for multiple seasons will absolutely cripple the Browns whenever that cap hit finally happens.

Most contracts aren't fully guaranteed, which is why people think you can just ""cap magic"" away massive, onerous contracts like Watson's. You can't. Even with void years, you're still paying that money out, and it's still going to negatively impact the teams ability to sign and retain talent.

Sure, the cap increasing year to year helps, but do you know how much it increases a year? Typically by $10-15M, not counting the weirdness around COVID. So even if they devote all of the cap increases for the next couple years to lessening the burden of Watson's contract, he's still going to account for a massive percentage of their cap expenditures.

29621,231514,231514,randomscribbles2,"I strongly believe we should trade down. Anthony Richardson, Brian Branch, and at least one of the three elite corners all have decent chances of still being on the board. We can trade down to 18-21 for an extra second rounder this year fairly easily I think. 

Then use that 20ish pick to get the best receiver still on the board since the worst round 1 receiver is still pretty close in talent level to the best this year. We need at least two receivers this draft since we're probably losing Cooks and the FA market is so bad, so WR is probably going to be the most unsolved position going into the draft other than QB. Start drafting that solution in the first. 

Including the likely returns of a Cooks trade, we have a real chance of getting 8+ picks in the first four rounds. That's a third of our starters getting upgraded or positions given real depth.
