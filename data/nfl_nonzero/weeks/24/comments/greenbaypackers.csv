The most common example of a cap hit restructure is probably converting yearly salary into a signing bonus.  A player‚Äôs salary hits the cap in the year it‚Äôs paid out, but a guaranteed signing bonus is amortized across the life of the contract.  So you can take that salary the player would have been owed, convert it into a guaranteed signing bonus, and suddenly you can spread it across several years instead of taking the hit this year.

37030,263229,263229,hmbeast,"Definitely some functional flaws with this, I agree.

I would agree that Gutey's propensity for drafting projects rather than pro ready prospects skews the data here. You could argue that Gutey drafts a type of player that is more likely to have a significantly lower wAV/game early in their career and a higher later in their career. Still, all we can really do is look at the data available, which does include two years of drafts of players that have 4+ years in the league, the point at which I'd argue 'developmental' projects should typically be paying off. Also, the same luxury was offered to the Chiefs, 49ers, and Bills for some years spanning this analysis, and the outcomes were quite different across these teams, which raises the question of if drafting 'developmental' projects is really a sound strategy in the first place.

Your point about Gary and Stokes isn't completely relevant here, though. I'm analyzing wAV per game, not wAV, so Gary and Stokes missing time doesn't impact their per game metrics. You could argue that Gary missing a year where he seemed to be ascending means his wAV/game is lower than it would have been if he'd played this year -- but since he still has a sample size of 56 games even with the injury, it likely wouldn't have a huge impact on his score.

They definitely didn't make all the moves they did last year with the goal of not being good, so I can imagine adding Rodgers would help that greatly with the offensive talent you guys have presuming Jacobs comes back.

Yeah, the defense needs help, but more moves can be made through the draft and FA (haven't seen what the cap space situation looks like yet). Also Crosby is a monster.",9.0,nfl,t3_115rf7i,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers,2023-02-18T16:31:23Z,greenbaypackers,0.04931953125

For example, if Woodson or White appreciate(d) their time as a Packer so much they wanted to retire a Packers I think it‚Äôs a huge compliment to the franchise.

That being said, playing with only one team your entire career is definitely cooler.",2.0,greenbaypackers,t3_117dxma,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2023-02-20T23:27:03Z,greenbaypackers,0.179340625
