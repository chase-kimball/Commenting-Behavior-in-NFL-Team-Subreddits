22722,160408,160408,SoKrat3s,"> Those are the same thing.

Those are not the same thing.  The Titans didn't *have* to trade away AJ Brown.  He only had an $8M cap hit this season.  That's almost all of what they gave to Robert Woods.  

>QBs will play worse when their surrounding cast is worse.

I don't think Wentz downgraded in supporting cast when he went from Pittman to T.McLaurin, J.Dotson, & C.Samuel.  

S.Darnold couldn't beat out B.Mayfield & PJ Walker.  
M.Ryan was playing terrible even before Taylor got hurt.  
R.Wilson still had Sutton & Jeudy, but played like an inexperienced rookie.  

Your statement is obvious, QBs can play worse with a supporting cast.  Obviously.  But I don't think that has anything to do with why those QBs were so poor.  
I didn't even list Carr, who was given Adams and was leading the league in interceptions before he was benched.  

QBs can be given all the weapons and still play poorly.  

>Like the 49ers.

The 49ers were 9th in spending at the QB position for the 2022 season.  
And I will keep repeating this, just because there are other talented players on the roster you cannot throw any QB on the 49ers and expect success.  They 49ers didn't win games just because of the other positions, but also because the QB position played really well.  If Purdy was just playing well, but not at a league-leading rate, the 49ers would have been a playoff team, but not a SB contender.

Kmet lead the NFL in separation rate.  Mooney was tied with Deebo for 4th in the NFL.  Claypool was 52nd - not terrible for a #2/#3 WR.  

Part of what you are missing is that Fields cannot throw a WR open.  He has to wait until they are wide open.  Which only makes all the problems we are talking about worse.  He sits in the pocket longer, allowing more pressure, more sacks, and leads to even worse throws that result in turnovers.  All because he doesn't have the basic passing skills.

>It wasn't just Silver reporting it.

There was no denial of the Silver report.  It was confirmed accurate at the time.  However the story was spun at the time as ""arm-fatigue"" and ignorant to the fact that Trey was recovering from being banged up in the Cardinals game at the time this report was made.  Having arm fatigue after getting hurt in a game isn't a shocking news report.  It's pretty standard in the NFL.  

>Schefter reported first that Lance was further behind expectations than fans realize, and that he was greener than expected. 

Kyle said from the moment he drafted Lance that there was no expectation on Trey winning that job.  He knew it was going to take Trey time to develop.  

Schefter has been confirmed, multiple times, to not actually have any ins to the 49ers decision makers.  He was caught red handed fabricating a story claiming he had a 49ers source when Kyle and John both said they never contacted him, saw him run a false story, and let him blow smoke for them.  This, just days before he was caught red-handed fabricating the Aaron Rodgers trade demand story.   

>Then Lombardo said that 49ers staff were ""continually underwhelmed"" with Lance.

These reports were always the most ridiculous.  
They were so underwhelmed with him that they turned to him for the very first TD of the season?  That they continued to work him in on plays for several weeks?

It's fairly well known that Rich Scangarello was disgruntled and its assumed he was the likely source of most of these ""leaks."" Which are more an attempt to throw shade at the organization then provide actual intel.  

> Then Ryan Harris predicted Jimmy would stay on the team this past season, due to what he was hearing about Lance.

The most illogical conclusion you could possibly make.  If there were doubts about Lance, Jimmy G wouldn't have gone all camp without a playbook.  He wouldn't have gone all camp being forced to work off to the side, by himself.  He would have been working with the rest of the team, preparing for the upcoming season.  If they just didn't believe in Trey Lance he wouldn't have been given the starting role at the beginning of the season.  

>My meaningless $0.02 is that I wonder if Lance's unusual throwing mechanics torques his shoulder or elbow in a way that makes him more prone to arm fatigue?

Or, crazy theory here, but constantly throwing without any rest, over and over and over and over and over and over again, leads to fatigue.
