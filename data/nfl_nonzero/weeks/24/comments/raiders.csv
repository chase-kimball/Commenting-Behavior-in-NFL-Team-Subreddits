23409,189823,189823,ViralOner,"Lol you're trippin. There was some debate at the time but Russell was definitely ahead of Johnson. Of course teams with locked in QBs didn't have him on their board but if you put specific team's roster context aside, Russell was viewed as the top prospect of the class. And yes position value factored just like it always does. There's only been 3 WRs drafted #1, the last was 1996 Keyshawn Johnson. I'll freely admit Calvin should have been the 4th but if we took him I doubt he has anything near the career he ended up with.

Later into the process when teams did background research some dropped him or took him off their board completely. So yeah the tide turned a bit within the league leading up to the draft. But at the end of the 2006 Sugar Bowl, if you had GMs and ""industry people"" list the general top prospects of the upcoming class, 80% had Russell. Mayock called his pro day the best he'd ever seen at any position.

Now if JaMarcus had the same college career and was coming out today, he'd be one of these anomaly QBs like Richardson. But at the time his size/strength was a new high water mark so the appeal was his potential. I remember people billing him as ""sack-proof."" And we blindly chased that ceiling ignoring every red flag. Comparing his hype to Luck may be a stretch, I was just trying to convey the point that JaMarcus Russell was as highly touted as they came and the revisionist history doesn't account for the vast majority of people who would have made the same pick. AL had issues and bad calls but I can't blame him for the pick based on tape.

If Reddit felt that the mods were truly inactive (pro tip: we're not) then they can work with the admins to have the mod team replaced. Ultimately this is a forum that's the functional equivalent of a Raiders fan Twitter account or a third-party forum dedicated to talking about the Raiders.

This is the part that makes the most sense by a large margin. We have no idea how Reddit will react once it has its IPO.

DC is scared to throw the ball in the RZ because he only has tight windows. That’s one of his flaws, he’s too protective of the ball at times, which holds him back from making some plays (also some mistakes).

What Tae dominates at is getting separation through his release and instantly catching the ball before the DB can catch up, since Tae isn’t the fastest guy. Another guy that excels at getting open in the RZ when left one on one is Renfrow. Last year, Renfrow finished with 9 TDs, doing a lot of the same stuff Tae excels at; outs, ins, motioning, slants. I can’t remember a single time we used that to our advantage in the RZ. 

Like when you’re inside the 5 it’s literally impossible not to get a TD with both of those guys. Run 2 WR 2 TE 1 RB, have the TEs line up on the offensive line.

Jones' passer rating was better than Derek's last year even though Jones' best receiver a lot of games was Richie James and the Giants ranked 27th in pass blocking. That said, he threw a lot less, I don't think he's on Carr's level as a passer, yet. But Jones has a big edge making plays with his legs, he ran for 708 yards and 7 TDs last season.

Long answer...

If you expand the description you can see what time they discuss different things, but most of the times are relative to the interview start at 26:55. So if you add 26:55 to the other times it'll be closer, but that doesn't quite work either because if you add that to the last one (1:41:45) you get 2:08 which is longer than the video (2:05).
