The fact that we got more production out of Michael Davis, than JC who we payed top dollar for is a bit sickening.

Personally I’m fine with ASJ, Davis and ___ as our starting 3. Whether that be keeping Bryce or replacing him. Davis shines in man coverage, that’s his best attribute. Previous coaches like Gus incorrectly used him as a zone corner. This dude has all the tangibles you want in a man-to-man guy, so hopefully that’s something we see 70% of the time next season. 

It also needs to be mentioned, that this year is Telesco’s and Staley’s final year, if they fail to provide talent and win games, best believe JC will follow them out the door *unless* he has some miraculous 8-int season considering the dude’s gonna melt the cap the next 4 years.

He’s only still employed BECAUSE HE WORKS FOR THE CHARGERS. Most other teams aren’t gonna keep a GM around for over a decade that can’t win his division a single time and can’t get the HC hire right either. 

There wouldn’t be any talks about Telesco if he was hired by another team in 2013, because he would’ve already been fired by 2017 and never got another shot again. He is only still here because Dean Spanos is who he is.

This is just a hilarious way of saying “unwilling to part with his mistakes”. Most other teams are willing to move on from mistakes instead of falling for the sunk cost fallacy. How long did we really need to start Jerry Tillery before we knew he sucked? 

The entire Telesco era has been littered with bad players starting over more competent ones purely because they were drafted higher.

Had he played more this year, we could've answered this question with our own eyes (partially at least because he could've still benefitted from MHJ).

>Olave and Wilson, the two best rookie receivers this year have come out saying he's the most talented out of the three and Garrett Wilson even went as far to say he's going to be one of the greatest receivers of all time.
