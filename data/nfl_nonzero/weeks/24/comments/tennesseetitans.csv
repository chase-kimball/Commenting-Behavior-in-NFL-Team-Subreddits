1776,18402,18402,Bieber_hole_69,"They can pretty easily get to $30M in cap space just by clearing Cunningham and Dupree off the roster and extending Simmons.

The real interesting part is where they go from there. With a restructure to Harold Landry's contract and extending Derrick Henry through 2024 they can clear close to another $15M.

Then there's the overarching question for this off-season, what to do at QB? If the team is not in love with one of the QBs in this draft to trade up, I think the best solution to the QB situation is probably to just extend Tannehill and keep him through 2024. You can reassess in the draft next year. His salary and a rookie's salary wouldn't be prohibitive to have together in 2024 if you wanted to draft someone and try to get out of a Tannehill's extension for 2025. But all in all, if Tannehill's gonna be the QB in 2023, it's probably best for both sides to extend him.

Derrick Carr isn't an upgrade over Tannehill and will likely cost more any way. I wouldn't take Jimmy G over Tannehill either. I'm sure there's a middle-ground to be reached for both sides that gets Tannehill on a manageable deal while giving him future security in return. The cap should also continue to go up, so his salary at current rate would look better in 2024 than it does now, and even now it's not horrific or anything, especially considering what Daniel Jones and Carr may get on the market.

If Tannehill was extended through 2025 and they converted $20,000,000 of his 2023 base salary to a signing bonus, it would lower his cap hit for 2023 by by a bit over $13,000,000.

If they wanted to get really bold with it and expect Tannehill, Henry, and Landry to be on the team in 2025 with salaries comparable to what they get now, with salary-to-bonus conversions and all the previously listed cuts and the cuts from today they can get to around $70,000,000 in cap space. The only issue obviously being you can't move on from any of those guys before 2026 without some dead money to work around...but if they think Tannehill and Henry aren't going to seriously decline and they can't find upgrades through the draft or free agency at better value...why not? Trimming the fat with the cap casualties previously listed doesn't make this team much worse than it already was, none of those guys were significant contributors and missed most of the season, (aside from Bullock, but he's too expensive for a kicker of his caliber.) There's a clear path to the Titans being top-5 or 10ish in cap space for free agency, it just all depends on if you are willing to stick with Henry and Tannehill through 2025.",12.0,nfl,t3_1197q2e,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2023-02-22T13:09:45Z,tennesseetitans,0.0408562849263046

To be clear, I'm not saying this about you specifically as I don't know where you fall on those issues but as a whole it feels like our fanbase doesn't treat the QBs equally as far as how much the circumstances affected them.

So, ruling that out, the only options I like are either keep Tanny and ride out what is essentially the last year of his contract or trading him for a few more picks and attempting to trade up to 1. I’m gonna try not to let this comment become a QB analysis, but the only QB that might be available at 11 that would be worth it is Richardson and he will not be ready to go next year. Consensus is that he needs to sit for a year, so to me he’s a more physically gifted Malik Willis. If Levis is available at 11 I would be ok with taking him as he seems more polished and can start day 1, though I’m not nearly as in love with him as a prospect as Stroud or Young. Only way we can get Stroud or Young is by trading up to 1 over Indy and Houston.

But of course trading up to 1 is a big gamble, we’d be giving up a lot of picks that we also need to rebuild the O-line, get a CB, add edge depth, add a receiver, etc. We’d need to hit on a lot of draft picks to get back into contention I think.

If we make the right cuts and can find a franchise QB in the next year or two... Simmons would still be in his prime on his 2nd contract... and Simmons is a player teams build a defense around... thus its foolish to cut him only to then look for his replacement in the best possible scenario.

Henry is a bit different... if Ran is a conventional GM then paying Henry is a bad idea and finding a cheaper replacement is the choice... however this decision may not be entirely conventional... as Henry does sell tickets and his jersey sale is one of the most popular in the franchise in recent memory. For this reason alone he might get a contract allowing him to retire with the team and act as a transitional bridge from our playoff runs to the next era in this franchises history.

Peter Skoronski - Doesn't have the required length/size to play LT at the NFL level... might be able to stick at RT, but most likely gets pushed into a guard/interior role. Is probably a great pick if you need a guard with a high floor.

Anton Harrison - Is an LT being a Great...ish pass protector, average to below average run blocker... doesn't have the best footwork, ends a lot of plays on the ground... I personally don't care for him in general but especially not on this team.

Broderick Jones - Probably doesn't have the size traits to stick at LT, probably has a better chance than Skoronski at sticking at RT, has a rare mean streak for an Oline guy most often seen from defensive players, might get pushed into a guard/interior role depending on how he measures out.

1 taking less means a smaller contract and 3% of a smaller contract is, naturally, less than 3% of a bigger contract. We could be talking tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars less for the agent.

2 if the agent isn't completely stupid, he knows that having his players be in a massive market means better endorsement opportunities. 3% of more and better endorsement deals is, again naturally, worth more than 3% of less or worse endorsement deals.

He could play on the tag and make 45m this year fully guaranteed and if he is good at all he will either get tagged again at ~55m or get the contract he wants. 

Barring a catastrophic injury he is  already all but guaranteed to make 100m over the next 3 years and if he performs at all he will make that over the next 2 years. 

Of course the injury risk has to be taken into account, but even guys as mediocre as Dak Prescott who have never even sniffed MVP will make 49m this year and 52m next year despite breaking his leg in half leading into contract negotiations. He got 126m  fully guaranteed. Kirk Cousins is another egregious example of a mediocre QBmaking bank. He has made 155m basically fully guaranteed from the vikings over the last 5 seasons. Remember the cap has gone up ~21% since then. I think we can all agree  Lamar is better than Kirk. So we can set the floor at 5 years 187.5m(155 * 1.21) fully guaranteed for Lamar. Otherwise, why not just play year to year and get those massive, and rising, tag values.

I think it is basically an impossible situation for as team because paying a QB what Lamar is worth kills the team, but he has no reason to accept less if he thinks he can be even above average for 3 more seasons.

> the secondary has become deep with talent

Well, that's a pretty lenient definition of talent deep with the most passing yards given up in the entire NFL.

>Jeffery Simmons anchors a line that should make an impact even with the loss of Harold Landry

Well, it did when Denico Autry was healthy. Too bad that Landry's absence took away a speed element of the pass rush as well as generally stressing the depth.

>The biggest move of the offseason was the AJ Brown trade with the bet being that the large AJ Brown contract would be too much in comparison to taking a shot on a first round WR (Treylon Burks).

Well, we thought that a large Bud Dupree contract was better than paying the other receivers and made a similar gamble on Jack Conklin. At least we got draft picks out of Brown's departure including a first, unlike the Texans did for a universally considered at-the-time-of-trade better receiver in Hopkins. Too bad Burks's rookie year was pretty snakebit with injuries, bad playcalling, and three QB's throwing him the ball. Wait, how the hell can I name worse moves we've made than the Brown trade?

>The Titans may not be on the top level of a stacked AFC but Vrabel has proven that his coaching and approach can make the Titans out perform their collected talent.

Fisher is from California, was a USC alum, and pals with Norm Chow (who he later tapped for the OC role) and he wanted to draft Matt Leinart.

Adams overrode Fisher's choice and forced Vince on him.   Fisher treated Vince like a pariah, causing Vince to act out and throw it in Fisher's face that he 'Had the Owner on speed dial' during meetings and be repeatedly late for meetings and practice.

Vince had done nothing but win at every level purely on his talent and athleticism, and when he found out the NFL was much harder, he responded with more acting out because he'd never had to learn how to take an L.

The ceiling for VY was lowered by his own attitude, but also by the fact that his coach never wanted him and refused to develop him and the owner enabling his shitty behavior.

AJ was at  his daughter birthday party, Jalen was there and joked about them playing together.

 Week in and week out Mike Vrabel kept assuring him he was going no where, but he never talked to Jon Robinson once. (From the outside, looking in..Mike Vrabel and Jon Robinson had very different ideas how this was going to go down. This comes up later in the interview, AJ says he was super angry at Mike for weeks, because Mike consistentky told him he was staying. He later goes on to admit he matured into the idea that Mike actually wanted the best for him.)

TN offered 16m for four years. He never says what he asked for(22 million per year, thanks u/), but he did say his team came in high to get the negotions rolling. Meanwhile, Jalen Hurts is blowing up Howie Roseman.

TN continued to stay at sixteen million.

Meanwhile this entire time, Jalen Hurts was gassing up Howie saying, ""this dude can be had for 24 million bucks.""

 Howie shot it down repeatedly until the morning of the draft and then he called AJ... AJ calls his agent.....

This  is mere hours before the draft, AJ's agent tells him that not only is 16 million per year Tennessee's number,....but the Titans have accepted Philly's trade offer if AJ chooses that instead. The Titans as a franchise are not only offering 16 million per year, they are refusing to negotiate or move from that number.

AJ at that point said his feeling were extremely hurt. He gives examples..For instance He +  Vrabel would go to each others houses.. They built a real relationship on trust and values.
Vrabes was there for him when he was suicidal. They were on a texting based relationship.

 Leaving to go to Philadelphia would mean leaving his daughter in Nashville. It would also completely betray everything AJ and the front office had built since he was drafted. He specifically goes on, multiple times to say that he felt the front office gave him a two faced response. One that told him he was values ""no matter what"" and a trade negotiation that did not reflect that, at all.
 
He felt like he laid everything on the line for them and got disrespected.which I would say, yeah, considering what we paid Ryan and derrick, it kind of was...

AJ also says that he would play for TN even if they were a bad team, he likes Nashville that much.

::Edited for spacing and grammar; still pretty shitty as all this pisses me off::

Said he cried for two nights after the trade.

The fact that JRob never talked to him and Mike talked to him constantly is super telling.

 JRob was so obsessed with the idea of value he basically got in his own way. 

AJ even said he would be happy with three years and then come back and do another two year contrac... 

Judging by everything Mike said, + how he acted on draft night...+ the way AJ felt about it..

Jon Robinson thought the fact that AJ Brown wanted to remain in Nashville, because his family lives in Nashville ,would manipulate him into being lowballed. He never brought AJ into a room. He never came off 16m, for a goddamned dollar.

The play as it was ran was a no read throw to a right comeback route. What Green said happened, is it was originally a left comeback route, that was probably signaled to switch once the defense lines up. The ball has already been decided. QB to X reciever. aJ Green didn't realize that he was the X reciever. So he did the job of the Y reciever, which is, don't give the opposing cornerback any reason to fuck this play up. Because he didn't catch the audible, that reversed their roles.

Everyone has a job. It's not backyard football and get open. Unless that's what the play actually dictates lol.

Most of the time, there are four or five people who can receive the ball on any given play. Usually 1-3 of them will be assigned to block. In a normal play.

The reason why I think it's both, the play was probably changed post huddle, that on AJ Green..the audible or signal..if it was flashed to quick or had a bad cadence that's on Kyler.

Edit: yeah if you watch it, AJ Green puts his hands up and under the corners chestpads and drives backwards. That's not something someone who thought the play was designed for them to be the reciever would ever do.

OL was already a big worry for us going into the 2022 season, especially once Lewan immediately went down, and it didn't take long at all for it to become obvious that it was a complete dumpster fire.
