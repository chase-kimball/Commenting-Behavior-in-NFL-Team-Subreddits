As far as the whole playcalling thing goes, personally I think it’s completely overblown in importance. Is sequencing important? Yes. But prep during the week is vastly more important. I mean it’s not even close. Getting players prepared for what they should expect to see and how to react when they see it, is more important than picking plays off a play sheet. And lest we forget, the coaches put together new play sheets every week for each opponent. Putting together the menu if you will. EB’s job in KC was to put  together the menu each week. And on gameday, Reid and EB shared responsibility in scripting how the food on the menu is served. Reid had 51% ownership of that role. That’s been a phrase thrown around a lot by Chiefs players and EB himself. So yeah Reid ultimately says what goes, but this idea that he does it fully autonomously is false. And he has a reputation as a hard ass, but Sheehan had a KC reporter on his show on Friday, and I guess that in your face style is more a thing he did earlier on in KC, but he’s a lot more mellow now.

I think there's a disconnect b/c to me, that's the absolute ceiling I would pay him right now.  If he would take that, fine.  But I'm pretty sure he's going to want more.  I guess we'll see.  

Problem is the guys on that list ahead of him make a lot of game-altering plays.  In the last 2 seasons Curl has 0 INTs and 0 FFs.  

Yes the defense is better with him, but I have a limit to how much I value that in cap space.  We're not in a bubble.  Take off your homer goggles and look around the lg and see what teams are getting for their big safety contracts.  I get it it's cool we got him as a super low draft pick and he blossomed, but try to be objective and see if you don't expect more production from a top-10 safety contract when you see the other guys on that list.  

And to really get people upset at me, I would take Curl's money and pay Payne and prepare to pay Forrest next year.  Forrest lifts the defense as well as makes those game-altering plays.

Kyle Shanahan--Agreed. No way he stays after Mike is fired.

McVay--a real tough one, but agreed. He was with us since 2010 so it just stings we let a prodigy go, but I think we were only a year short (I think if we knew what we had in Mcvay after the 2017 season if he was leaving we could make a legit argument to keep him instead of Jay). The fact rams hired him as youngest ever and it was only Jay's second year made it tricky. Maybe we could have offered him assistant HC and promise he gets our gig if Jay falters. But doubt he takes that. Still, look at the Caps. They fired Trots after winning the STANLEY CUP because they thought they had a prodigy in waiting they didn't want to lose. Didn't work out that way, but good orgs take shots.

&#x200B;

LaFleur, McDaniel and KOC is where we seem to disagree. Your argument appears to be we fired them so how could they be HC. or assume they would be promoted from their existing roles to HC.

&#x200B;

What I am saying is a functional org realizes the talent they have and, like McVay, keeps them after Shanahans leave. Why do you think that would have been hard? LaFLeur went to Notre Dame after us. McDaniel went to the Browns so maybe his allegiance to Shanahan woudl be too much, but again if you believe in him you can keep him like we did with McVay who didn't leave.

&#x200B;

Then what I am saying is any of those could/should have been OC instead of Matt Cavanaugh in 2017-2019 and been primed to either i) get promoted to HC as we should have fired Gruden before 2019 or ii) been in prime position to get promoted to HC instead of hiring Rivera.

&#x200B;

I mean it sucks KOC was only OC one year when Rivera was hired but that's our orgs fault. Either he, McDaniel or LaFleur should have been retained and properly groomed to be OC instead of Matt Cavanaugh and in a position to take over.

&#x200B;

Instead what happened? We let two of them walk (one to college ranks) and the other was OC too short a time period to get a HC gig and was fired by Rivera.

No functional org lets that amount of talent walk to appease the likes of Jay Gruden (who coached for one year in 2022 after being fired in 2019  lol) and Matt Cavanaugh) who went on to be a senior offensive assistant for the Jets lol.",2.0,nfl,t3_114z22a,False,0.0,:Commanders: Commanders,2023-02-18T13:30:23Z,commanders,0.0225245679396376

From Wikipedia:

McCoy was sporadically used by the Chiefs throughout the season as a change-of-pace back behind Damien Williams and Darrel Williams, often receiving games off for ""load management"" by Reid due to McCoy's age.[174] He finished the regular season with 101 carries for 465 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns to go along with 28 receptions for 181 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown.[175] He was ultimately made inactive for much of the postseason, playing just one snap in the Divisional Round against the Houston Texans, as the Chiefs went on to win Super Bowl LIV over the San Francisco 49ers.[176][177]

McCoy finished the 2010s decade having gained the most rushing yards in the NFL during the decade with 10,434 yards.[178]

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

See also: 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season
McCoy signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on August 4, 2020.[179] He made his Buccaneers debut in the team's regular season opener September 13, a 23–34 loss against the New Orleans Saints.[180] Overall, McCoy had a very limited role due to depth of the backfield unit, which contained Ronald Jones II, Leonard Fournette, and Ke'Shawn Vaughn.[181] He totaled ten carries for 31 rushing yards and 15 receptions for 101 receiving yards in ten games.[182] He won his second Super Bowl against his former team but did not play in the game.[183] He became the fourth player in NFL history to win consecutive Super Bowls with the second Super Bowl being won over his previous team.[184]",1.0,commanders,t3_1186utp,False,0.0,Fuck Dan Snyder,2023-02-21T11:01:55Z,commanders,0.0055728331181674

Size matters when carrying the ball out of the backfield through d linemen. Curtis is shifty AF in open space with elite speed (similar to AG, but a little smaller; shorter,lighter, and faster).

You could argue that the injuries have slowed Curtis down. I don’t know what the current ball-in-hand clocking is. I know Terry is clocked at elite speed (top 10) with ball in hand. 

I’m hopeful we’ll unleash him and AG this season with gadget plays that leverage their shifty playmaking abilities in open space. Whereas some folks want to see Curtis used more as a RB in certain situations, I actually want to see AG used more as a WR.

If our TEs end up sucking (I’m hopeful, but it may be the typical Washington Commanders fan blind hope), let AG burn LBs in coverage then. 5 oline, Terry, Jahan, and Curtis lined up as WR, Howell under center with B Rob and AG in the backfield.

Pick 4 is worth 491

Pick 16 is worth 305

Daron was #13 pick in 2018, worth 336 at the time

If we assume next year is a #16 also, that’s 610 for those two picks. 

Daron being the dominant player he is now (proven in the NFL as the 3rd best in sacks at the position in 2022, and about to command ~$20M AAV contract), makes an argument against his current value compared to the #13th pick in the draft (valued at 336), but let’s assume it’s the equivalent of our 2nd round pick at this point (#47 is 124).

You are advocating for giving Chicago 734 value in exchange for 491 to select Will Levis. That’s almost a 50% premium to pay for arguably the 3rd best QB in this year’s draft who has a lot of question marks around his potential in the NFL. Meanwhile, we have Sam Howell that the team has repeatedly indicated they are excited about.

I think this is the year to play it conservatively/safe when drafting a mid-round QB, and if Howell doesn’t pan out, you stack the chips to go all-in on a QB in 2024 or 2025, depending on the prospects.
