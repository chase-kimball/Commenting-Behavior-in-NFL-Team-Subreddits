Because football is a team sport and the Giants are a better team than the Bears, and part of that is because the Giants have Saquon Barkley, a top 5 back in the NFL, while the Bears are devoid of any legitimate weapons. How many playoff appearances did Jones have while Barkley was injured?

> Bears rbs had aproximately 1550 yards this year. Giants rbs had 1650. So that 100 yards of rushing is better than having two wrs that would both be number 1s on the giants.

Good lord what kind of backwards logic is this lol. The Giants have a worse o-line than the Bears, our RBs had fewer rushes and our QB had 400 fewer rushing yards to keep the defense honest. If you would rather have Mooney and Claypool than Saquon then idk what to tell you.

The reality is teams overpay for QBs so GMs either have to overpay (market value) or stick to their guns and likely lose the guy they want. We're in a tough boat despite holding most of the cards in negotiations. 

1. we don't have to pay more than the tag amount in year one. That should be part of the guarantee amount for any new DJ contract.
2. year two should be some sort of roster bonus + low salary fully (mostly?) guaranteed + incentives.
3. Year 3 should be our out year. Roster bonus + reasonable salary.

**The question isn't what AAV should be, it's what the true contract amount will be and over how many years. That's guarantees.** So if DJ wants $40MM AAV, that may work, but we should only guarantee around $65-70MM so we can bail in 2 years if needed while only dishing out a true AAV of around $35MM",1.0,nygiants,t3_1192twm,False,1.0,:Giants-logo-vintage:,2023-02-22T09:54:19Z,nygiants,0.0460549313678155

1. His entire salary for the 2023 is ***NOT*** guaranteed. This means a team can acquire him for just a pick(s), and give him a new contract. My assumption is a team looking to trade for him will have already worked out terms of a new contract with him. The acquiring team would do this because they can get a cheap vet and not have to battle it out w/ other prospective teams.
2. Why would the Giants do this, you ask? If we can't get him to renegotiate his contract, then we'd cut him and get nothing. If we trade him, at least we get a pick or two. The dead money impact is the same regardless. We can designate a trade or cut either post June or not, so we can make the cap hit the same regardless of which route we take. The difference is we get a pick(s).
3. Why would LW want to get traded and make the acquiring team give up a pick(s)? Because if the Giants so deem, they can actually wait until after June to cut him instead of making it a post June designation.

QB market right now is stupid expensive. Brett Farve held the line at 19% since 1997 until Mahomes' record contract in 2020. That's 23 freaking years of 19% of the cap being the most a team ever spent on QB at signing.

Since then, the QB market exploded and it seem like it'll only get worse with Lamar, Burrow, Hurts.

Sucks to be DJ cause he of course wants to be paid like those guys and I think he has the potential to reach some of those guys, but it's way too expensive.

The Giants or any team, should not be signing anyone not named Mahomes to that much % of the cap. So, DJ please stay way under that Farve line.

Btw, the alleged $45 million average per year (APY) would be \~20% of the cap right above Watson's old contract. At $40 million it would be at \~17.8% similar to Goff's deal. Still historically expensive for QB, but in this market, if Schoen wants a long term deal, I don't think DJ would take much less.",31.0,nygiants,t3_118huah,False,0.0,:Azeez_Ojulari: Azeez Ojulari :Azeez_Ojulari:,2023-02-21T23:15:42Z,nygiants,3.177144233e-05

Taken from: https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2015/2/20/8072877/what-the-statistics-tell-us-about-the-draft-by-round

The idea of Saquon being easily replaced by a day 2 or 3 RB doesn't line up with the stats that say otherwise. It is extremely hard to replace RB in the draft, especially later on the bust rate is high, there's no guarantee. 

This data was also from the time where RBs were getting paid alot, 8.2%+ of the cap like CJ2k, AP, Portis, Lynch and Bush so they were a hot commodity. The market was oversaturated and no longer worth it so it made sense for teams to move away from big contract RBs at the time.

Now the RB market is being so undervalued that I think it's a good time to take advatage of it. Lets say Saquon agrees to 13.25million, he'll be at 5.9% of the cap.

He is good value buy 5.9% of the cap because there are not many offensive weapons on non-rookie contracts that can produce as much as Saquon and at that cap percentage for the Giants. 

No need to make an unnecessary hole on the roster when the Giants can fill it. It would best to use the draft picks to fill the other holes on the roster, which Giants have plenty of.

Tuli can fit the bill as he's a solid prospect and shows similar traits as Leo.

Sydney Brown - Versatile back has played around the field. If Love leaves he would be a good replacement, however if Love stays then draft best available here.

Even the action of a team trading down requires another team to trade up. NFL teams have dedicated teams that spend more time analyzing this more than any of us on and yet teams still trade up knowing they'll likely lose value for their guy, even for non QBs. 

One example is the Eagles trading up for Devonta Smith and the Cowboys getting Parsons + Golston. Im sure Eagles know they lost value but they still ""got their guy"" who was important for them this year nearly winning the SB and even blocked a rival team from getting him.

There is no framework for starting points or price floors. It's entirely possible that Schoen says ""This is what we can afford, otherwise we're going to tag him and beging taking phone calls."" Answering that by saying ""Yeah but back to back tags is 70"" doesn't help that situation.

There are obviously many ways to skin a cat, but drafting a QB while you're rebuilding your team is a waste of the rookie contract advantage, and the number one reason why most bad teams stay bad.  

Build your team first, then take advantage of the rookie wage scale to make your playoff run while you have a QB making 1/6th what the top guys are making.

Passing yards, whether or not you want to acknowledge it, is a team stat. If you don't have WRs capable of getting open or getting YAC, you can't magically get a big yards total. We might be the only team in the NFL that genuinely did not have starting caliber WRs. A QB cannot throw deep balls to guys who aren't capable of beating coverage. There's a reason you see deep balls in a WR's highlight reel, and a reason the WR position has the league's 2nd highest franchise tag price.

IMO, and I'm sure others will disagree, but IMO it is like a fader:   

The more advanced your QB, the less reliant on the rest of the roster your wins are.  The less capable your QB is, the more talent you need elsewhere in order to win.  

The notion that ""this is just what QBs make now, so you either have to pay one or draft one"" is (again, IMO) a lazy binary.   

Jones on a $30-$33 mil salary opens extra room to grab a top 15 guard and let's say a solid WR2. That alone makes a big difference to an offense. Jones on a $38-40 salary gives you one of those. Jones on a $45-48 (lol) makes even using the phrase ""extra room"" pretty much impossible.  

It's likely that he will develop into a franchise QB who can work the deep routes and the shallow routes at the same time while still learning to navigate the pocket and keep track of the run lanes, but *as of today* he is not that guy. Going back and watching even after the midseason ""shift,"" he's still reliant on a passing game that keeps the receiver ""within arm's reach"" so to speak, and avoids the deep ball almost entirely (go back and watch Jones to Slayton his rookie year vs. 2022). As he develops and is able to keep track of more reads *and* the pockets, the playbook will grow for him, and he'll learn to run an offense.  

Simply wearing a QB number isn't enough to get that contract.  

Jones is really good and definitely has franchise QB potential, but as of today, he is replaceable.  

IMO we can blame Judge and Garrett for losing those two years, but also imo it doesn't matter.

>Daniel Jones is looking for at least 45mil aav  

Peace, Danny.  That's too much for a system dependent QB who had the lowest deep ball responsibility in the football league.  

I like him a lot, but he's still a guy who has to develop. He's not a $45 mil starter. I don't even really like him that close to $40. We're a rebuilding team. We can't afford to pay that much to a guy who still has a season or two before he starts to look complete.  

Very frustrating if the FO goes that route, and moreso because the 5th year option felt like a no brainer last season.  

My only hope is these leaks are just the beat reporters spinning each other's wheels and aren't actually coming from the front office.

*Edit: looked it up, here's the quote from the Schwartz piece:*  

>*Jones’ presence in the huddle in 2023 is really not up for debate in the minds of general manager Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll. Jones will return for a fifth season as the starting quarterback, one way or another. The Giants prefer it to be on a multi-year contract (five years is optimal for the team) that eases the salary-cap hit in 2023 (five years, $190 million is in the ballpark), but the fallback of the franchise tag of $32.4 million for the 2023 season is available, though an option neither side wants to see transpire.*

That was bugging me.  lol

I didn't realize that [PFF has Hyatt as its top WR](https://www.nfl.com/combine/tracker/participants/wr/all-colleges/) (pre-combine).  His NFL comp was Desean Jackson.  Not bad but I'm starting to think WR is a round 2 pick.

Also, Kiper and McShay were saying this isn't a very deep draft class.  I'm just now noticing that there are only a handful of ""year one starters"" (10 rated at 6.7 or better).

I could see finding a way for Branch (CB) or Sanders (LB) to land in our laps.

The OL prospects are incredibly underwhelming after Skoronski.

JFC - I might even be okay with Bijan at 25 if he slips through and we have no Saquon.  I don't know if that would be the most popular pick, but he might actually be the best value if available.
