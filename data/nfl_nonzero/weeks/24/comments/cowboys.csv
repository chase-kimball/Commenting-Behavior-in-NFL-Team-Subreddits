One would think if the ""loaded team around"" him excuse was valid, he'd have started to take games over at that point out of necessity, but he didn't. He just folded.

Many hail him as the leader of those teams, but the true leader was Michael Irvin. Aikman might have been *a* leader by default due to his position, but that's it. The moment Jimmy was gone, Aikman pouted and whined about every coach we had after that. He drove Chan Gailey out of town because he was a crybaby about not liking the new offense.

And then in the end, when many veteran quarterbacks start to hit an elite level of their careers because of their experience, Aikman took his ball and went home.

* Throws off his back foot way too frequently for my taste but has the arm strength and mind-boggling accuracy when doing so to get away with it.

Carson Wentz didn't take his team to a Super Bowl, but yes because that's literally how the QB market has operated for any debatably-top-15 QB ever since the 2011 CBA.

&#x200B;

>I'm very confused what you think his value was if $30M/yr is somehow wildly unbelievable.

Depending on when he signed, just a hair above the highest-paid non-Mahomes QB at the time (like what actually ended up happening in 2021) because I have watched how the QB market has operated for the previous decade. Every top QB contract would set the record for the richest contract in NFL history with 2 exceptions: QBs extended shortly after Rodgers' 2013 extension and after Mahomes' 2020 extension. From Joe Flacco in 2013, Andrew Luck in 2016, Derek Carr and Matt Stafford in 2017, Jimmy Garoppolo, Matt Ryan, and Kirk Cousins in 2018, through Wentz, Goff, Roethlisberger, and Wilson in 2019, Watson in 2020, on to Dak's in 2021. To believe that Dak's side was somehow on their own volunteering to get paid under market, especially after seeing what he eventually got paid, seems like believing in fantasy to me

By all accounts, it was Dak's side that wanted the shorter deal (to re-up with another market-topping deal sooner) and the Cowboys who wanted a longer deal (for more flexibility with spreading out and moving around cap hits).

32965,280538,280538,kirlie,"There is no ""consensus"" about Dak.  People tend to be unreasonable where he's concerned.  The same thing happened to Romo.  Dak is a good, but not ""elite"" QB and that's ok.  Most teams will never have a Mahomes quality QB and fans seem to think they're easy to find.  ALL QBs need a decent O-line and receivers (including Mahomes).  I've watched both Mahomes and Burrow struggle with bad O-lines and lose Super Bowls.  What makes Mahomes different than Dak is that Mahomes can occasionally turn nothing into something.  But, Mahomes also has a really solid O-line, a great play caller, Kelce always open and a decent group of receivers.  Dak had an inconsistent O-line, an inconsistent play caller and Lamb.  Our receivers other than Lamb were the lowest in the league at getting open.  Dak was forcing the ball to the receivers and taking alot of chances because he didn't really have much to work with.  Add to that he had defenders in his lap most games and a play caller that didn't know how to scheme guys open.  

This is where the unreasonableness comes in.  People think that because Dak got paid, he should be able to win the game on his own.  NO QB CAN!  Football is a team sport.  ALL QBs need pieces around them.  Some of the interceptions were Dak's fault and sometimes he doesn't read the field correctly.  But, the receivers, O-line and Coaches aren't really helping him out.  Interceptions were never really a problem until this year.  Unfortunately, the years we had good receivers and Dak played well our Defense wasn't good. If Dak wore any other helmet, he'd get more respect.  But, because he's a Cowboy, people are just ridiculous with their takes.  And Cowboys fans are the WORST when it comes to their Dak takes! There are fans that would really rather have Cooper Rush over Dak! But, they forget that it's our Defense that won Rush's games.

I think Dak is still better than Lawrence right now but I can’t deny Lawrence has a higher ceiling. Same goes for Herbert who I think Dak is just as good right now, but I think Herbert will be the better QB going forward. 

I’d take Dak over Lamar as a thrower, and I’m not sure Lamar’s rushing is enough to outweigh his deficiencies throwing the ball so I would probably take Dak over Lamar. 

I’m still taking Dak over Hurts all day. Hurts just was in the perfect situation this year. One good season (where he still threw less TDs than Dak) is not enough to convince me he’s better than Dak. 

Taking Dak over Stafford, but you could argue either way. Same goes for Cousins who is in the very good, but not great tier. 

Dak is easily better than the likes of Goff, Kyler, Tua, and Carr. I always laugh when people rank those guys over Dak despite the fact he’s outperformed all of them over the course of his career.
