**College stats (2019)**  
*1. Joe Burrow - 148.4 Rating. 71.8% Comp*  
*2. Tyler Huntley - 122.6 Rating. 60.9% Comp*

  
**Deep Passing**  
*1. Tyler Huntley - 146.2 Rating, 6 TD, 0 INTs*  
*2. Joe Burrow - 135.4 Rating, 12 TDs, 1 INT*

  
Huntley was every bit of an accurate downfield passer in 2019 even if the offense didn't call for many shots downfield. On all throws targeted at least 10+ yards past the line of scrimmage, only Joe Burrow and Justin Fields saw more success than Huntley did in 2019. On those throws, Huntley connected on 60.0% of them but saw nine passes dropped and had a conference-low four interceptions. When looking at his season as a whole, he led the nation with an adjusted completion percentage (factors in dropped passes, throwaways, spikes, etc.) of 82.6% and going even a step further, Huntley threw an accurate pass at the country's fifth-highest rate, throwing an accurate pass on 65.0% of his attempts. Huntley is an incredible athlete but also an underrated thrower when the play called for it we just didn't get to see enough of those downfield attempts this season.

4529,22481,22481,BlackandPurpleHeart,"It's just fucking sad man this organization chose Greg Roman over Hollywood Brown, attracting competent receivers and making Lamar happy. They chose to ride with Bateman and a bunch of practice squad, xfl, and other teams 4th and 5th wrs. Bateman has promise but hasn't showed enough that he can be a number 1 only thing he's shown is he can't play a full season. They brought in 36 year old desean jackson not learning their lesson from years ago when they brought in old man Dez bryant coming off not playing in the nfl for 3 years.

They give Lamar piss and shit as weapons and then expect him to win games when he has to rely on players to come back healthy. Jk and gus had missed like a season a a half or more.

The oline went to shit after 2019 and it wasn't till this year it finally got back on track but I will never forget or forgive this organization last year bringing in washed alejandro villanueva who was so bad last year he was a liability.

Greg Roman gets progressively worse the ravens don't look at the 49ners or Bills histories with him as their OC. Even tho our wrs suck the scheming is so bad that you have men like kurt Warner, steve smith sr, Steve young, dan orlovsky, dez bryant, willie snead, Hollywood brown, even Lamar himself and just the other day add Ochocinco criticizing this offense, scheme and roman. Yet nothing changes.

We haven't had a fucking wide wr score a td since week 3. Greg Roman is the only guy in the nfl who can take a top 3 TE in the nfl and make him disappear because Mandrews face has been on a milk carton the last several weeks.

Edc keeps favoring building defense and any postion not wr. We had 11 picks last draft didn't trade up and didn't take a wr. At trade deadline I'm willing to bet my last dollar that they knew bateman was out for the year but they didn't trade for a wr. Then like a day or 2 later boom bateman out for the year.

If your Lamar honestly why the fuck would you want to be here outside of loyalty cause they drafted you. I love this kid I thought he'd be a raven for a long time he loved it here even got ravens wings tatted on his chest. One of his chains is a play on the ravens shield logo he's showed he wants to be here. But the organization has taken him for granted and I think deep down he has started to feel neglected and disrespected.

If I'm Lamar I would ask for a sit down with Steve Bisciotti, Edc and harbs and ask the real questions. Why am I not getting the same love on offense you guys show on defense? Why do I not get the same help most of my qb peers are getting around the nfl hell even some college teams, do you not belive I can be a legit passing qb in the league? Why is Greg roman still here? Why are we running this one dimensional system? I know he won't ask this one but I would Why the fuck is steve saunders still here?

> Look at how spread out the Bengals‚Äô wide receivers are in the passing game, compared to the tight splits of the wide receivers in the running game. Look at Burrow under center on the running plays, and Burrow in the shotgun on the passing plays.

> There is a chasm in the Bengals offense between the running and passing games. Cincinnati still majors in under-center zone running schemes, just like the Rams do. But while the Rams‚Äô passing game has always extended off of those zone runs with play-action fakes, long rollouts and boots, deep crossers with quarterbacks on the move, the Bengals have become a shotgun, spread-out, quick-game passing attack. The passing game in Cincinnati has lost its connection to the running game.

> This split creates predictability. The Bengals run on 80 percent of their under-center snaps, which is the sixth-highest rate in the league. When running from under center, more than 80 percent of their plays are zone runs, which is the third-highest rate in the league. And when they try to run anything else, they don‚Äôt execute well.

> . . . 

> The Bengals have a siloed offense right now. When Burrow gets under center, he is going to hand off the football, and the Bengals are going to run zone. They‚Äôre going to add extra players to the center of the field and condense the formation in order to do it. When the Bengals need to throw, Burrow is going to get in shotgun, and the Bengals are going to spread the field. They may throw the occasional changeup, but if you‚Äôre going to be that predictable on offense, defenses will gladly take a peek at your cards, and play their hand accordingly.

It's not quite the same problem just because of personnel and systems, but is is nearly identical in terms of the result. The Ravens are tipping their hand on a lot of plays, and when Lamar's in, it works because he's that good, rifling the ball into tiny windows to Andrews on a pass and running options better than anyone to exploit which way the defender goes.

You say that like the only way to get a good WR is through drafting top ten and getting a jamarr chase or devonta smith. Hill, diggs, Adams, Metcalf, Allen, Godwin, Moore, deebo, mclaurin, Jefferson, only one of those names was taken in the first, and he was taken 22nd. 

The problem isn't that the Ravens lack the draft capital to get a good WR, the problem is that the Ravens did not invest anything into it.

I'm not saying that if we draft a receiver he's a pro bowler, but we have the ability to draft receivers above the practice squad level, and we absolutely have the draft capital, but we're choosing not to. I don't know if that's on Harbaugh for deciding that his roster doesn't need it, EDC for choosing not to go after it more aggressively, or Roman for not pushing to make it a bigger part of his offense over the years, but it is absolutely not a case of the Ravens not having the ability to draft it.

We ran it once in the fourth quarter.

It's not like the Browns figured the ground game out either, the second-to-last play of the third quarter was Dobbins going 37 yards.

If there was any singular game on the entire calendar where playing to Greg's strengths and running the ball five million times was the logical call, it was this one. And he did it once the entire fourth quarter.

(44 of 60, 73.3%) The reasoning was simple: Browns pass defense isn't amazing, but it's not bad. They sit around average in most stats vs. the pass. As the graph shows though, their run defense is *horrible.* 

Even if we weren't a run-first team, the gameplan would be to ram it down their throats first, second, and third, and maybe occasionally play-action when they get fed up and start loading the box. Over their last ten games, they're giving up 141.4 yards per game, and 136 over their last five. Do that all year last year and you'd be 30th and 28th, respectively. 

We have the disadvantage that they know exactly what we're doing since A. we're a run first team, B. we've done it to them already this year, and C. we've got a backup QB on a short week with limited practice snaps due to an injury, so they are going to completely sell out for the run. That said, while I have been a critic of Greg, if there is one thing he should be able to do with aplomb, it is ram the football down the throats of a bad run defense.

I don't think it's a sole factor; this is a problem that dogged the Ravens under Ozzie and it's one that has continued with EDC. Even if you want to hang your hat on the Hollywood pick, consider who was drafted behind him (AJ Brown, Deebo Samuel, Terry McLaurin, and DK Metcalf), he would be considered a bust compared to those players (though the Patriots took Nael Henry as their first that year so it's not really the worst pick in that position for that draft). I'd say, in the course of Ravens history, if you want to talk about the best wide receiver pick, it's 100% Torrey Smith; if you want to talk about the most successful wide receiver pick, it's Brandon Stokley (but only some of that success was with the purple and black).

I....I don't know. I can't really put a finger on it. Some teams are really good at drafting one position and shitty at drafting others. The Steelers can throw a dart at a draft board and pick a future superstar at wide out but struggle on the whole drafting corners. A half-excuse is the fact that normally, because of team success, the Ravens are picking after some of the top talent at the position is off the board; and the organization's philosophy that if they are going to move in the draft, they don't want to give up big time draft capital to move up and would rather accumulate a lot of picks by moving back. **I'm not blaming it solely on that**, but when you look at the organization, traditionally, they don't move up in the draft, more often than not they move back in the draft, and they take the best player available with their picks. When you look this last draft, for instance, the run on most first round wide receivers was done before the Ravens were on the clock. I am not saying ""this is the way,"" but it has been and continues to be this franchise's philosophy for picking players.

What I think happened this season was that the Ravens overvalued the wide outs they had on the roster. They thought Bateman would continue to show improvement similar to what he did at the tail end of last season. They thought Duv would be somewhat of a swiss Army knife and enough to compliment Bateman on the other side of the field. They **have** dropped a lot of draft capital in recent drafts on the wide receiver position, and maybe they thought a little too much of what the resources they had and wanted to address other positions on the team. Or, by sticking to their BPA formula for drafting, maybe they thought other players around those positions could contribute more than a wide receiver could.

I'm not justifying the Ravens lack of talent at the wide receiver position, I'm just shooting off my two cents.",5.0,ravens,t3_zrslvf,False,0.0,3 Eyed Raven,2022-12-21T13:40:40Z,ravens,0.0067406852903003
