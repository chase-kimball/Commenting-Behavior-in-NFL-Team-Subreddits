If coaching staff made it a true competition rather than offensive players trying to get on the good side of the new clear-cut QB1 i would imagine Najee runs away with the offensive captain title singlehandedly rather than sharing it.

It would be retribution if he and DJ ball out after the past few years considering it seems like they have a solid connection and have faced similar criticism from the fanbase.

Skoronski projects as a guy that the offense wanted Dan Moore to be and while hes not the most fluid mover, he is a road grater and has good use of leverage.

+ He‚Äôs a motivator. He‚Äôs a guy players want to play for. That alone helps attract free agents, gets guys going in big games, and creates a bond within the team.

+ Seems like a strong talent evaluator. I know every coach is involved in one way or another when it comes to the draft process, but other than maybe BB, Tomlin seems right up there in terms of his involvement.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this team SHOULD be better next year.

If it gets worse, barring some major injury issues, I don‚Äôt know what the problem is.

But I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre easily a playoff team. Buffalo, KC, Cinci are all better. Miami seems like they‚Äôre going to be good for awhile. New England is in playoff contention every year. The Chargers are a good football team, who will still likely make the playoffs this year after being completely ravaged by injury. The Browns will be good if Watson is even 1/2 of what they think he is. Baltimore is always a threat‚Ä¶ they were the 1 seed last year before Lamar went down, and look good this year. 

Then the teams that are shit this season, like Vegas (literally record breaking choke of a year), the Jags (Lawrence looks better, offense is fairly well rounded and a nasty D), us, and Denver who has one of the best defenses in football, and I can only assume Wilson isn‚Äôt going to struggle to put up 10 TDs his entire Broncos tenure.

So to me, unless KP blows up and has a 25+ TD season and looks legit which he hasn‚Äôt shown anything pointing in that direction (not turning the ball over is great, but that‚Äôs more game manager than the Mahomes/Allen/Burrow/Herbert/Lamar type of QB who will go and actually win you games) this offense will continue to struggle, and we‚Äôre going to need monumental defensive performances weekly to drag us to the playoffs, which this defense hasn‚Äôt exactly shown they can do for 2 years now, outside of maybe 2 guys.

All that said, I can‚Äôt see us competing for the north next year, and we‚Äôre definitely not a Super Bowl team.

+ Chicago (potentially)

+ Denver (depending on Russ)

But this season to me is a huge disappointment. Coming into the year, we had an easier schedule on paper, with an overall better roster than we had last year, yet last year we managed to squeak out 9 wins and a playoff berth despite having a historically shit offense. We didn‚Äôt score a TD in the first half of a game in like 2 months or something, which hadn‚Äôt been done in our franchise in like 90 years, figured it doesn‚Äôt get much worse, and the D should improve as well, considering we were dead last in run D. 

Fast forward to now, our offense still never scores and the D took a step back overall, so we‚Äôre going to end up as a sub .500 team.

I‚Äôm not overly optimistic going into next year either.

The Rooneys are cheap.

We don‚Äôt have a hall of fame QB and all pro talent surrounding him to offset coaching deficiencies anymore.

Either they go out and spend money on our coaching staff so we‚Äôre not an absolute joke on offense like we have been for 2 years, or continue to accept mediocrity (we‚Äôre not even mediocre anymore we‚Äôre just shit) for the sole reason of saving money.

Really think about the investment into this offense. 1st round QB. 1st round RB. 2nd round TE. 2nd round WR. 3rd round receiver in Diontae. FA signing at RG. FA signing at C. 3rd round RT. 4th round LG. 6th round LT. 

Literally, excluding LG and LT, everyone is a 3rd round pick or higher, or an FA signing tasked to come in and start.

Well in my opinion, doing that is fine as long as you‚Äôre competitive. You push the problem later down the line while you can still win.

The issue with doing that is when/if you‚Äôre not competitive, it hits you like a truck, and basically halts any positive adds through free agency, because you no longer have cap space. You can‚Äôt really sign any impact players, so everything is bargain barrel bullshit signings. Now it all has to be solely built through the draft, as we currently have ~$14M in cap space going into next year, with several starters needing new contracts.

I am optimistic about our offense.  We continue to improve each week. We have been controlling the clock and keeping the turnovers down. We have a young line that is learning from their mistakes. I really like how we are involving everyone.

Defense on the other hand.  Our DL is old and overpaid. We are one TJ injury again from imploding. Our ILB are small and get run over. We don't have a lockdown CB.

There are many glaring issues at many positions, and it is going to be a process to address it all. 

I personally wanted to pick Tyler Linderbaum last year. He is tearing it up for the Ravens now. But we have picked who we have picked, and the goal now should be to patch up the biggest holes. 

Nothing wrong with picking best available in the draft. If you have a franchise changing player there, take him. I wouldn‚Äôt reach for o line either if they have a later round grade. But if we think we can run it back next year with Dan Moore and Dotson, I think we are making a big mistake.

26161,182202,182202,StrictlyHobbies,"Total rushing yards are objective. They are actually measured as compared to things like how much displacement an offensive line gets and if the block was successful or not. This is on the offensive line, the back, and the play call/scheme. There is plenty of blame to go around for lack of production. I‚Äôd argue that total rushing yards are more directly tied to the ability to generate first downs on the ground. You abandon it when you start getting stuffed and it is leading to long down and distance, which has happened a lot this year. 

Najee is the RB1 with significantly less YPC than other starting backs. Better than last year, yes. But still not sufficient enough. Warren and Snell and McFarland have gotten touches in obviously passing situations, or when the defense is leading and playing back for deep passes. I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs fair to argue that because Warren has 4.9 YPC, this means the o line is actually doing well in run blocking.",2.0,steelers,t3_zn3jjb,False,0.0,Acrisure,2022-12-16T07:45:53Z,steelers,-0.0112425032386198

*‚ÄúBut when they put it on a receiver‚Äôs back when every time he makes a play on Sunday they say ‚Äòoh that looks like Michael Irvin.‚Äô If he drops a pass it‚Äôs ‚Äòoh Michael Irvin wouldn‚Äôt have dropped that.
