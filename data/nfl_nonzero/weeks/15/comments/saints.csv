Tampa has to win 2, not 1. Winning out for us puts us in a very good position.

27114,247923,247923,myxanders,"No. You and anyone who thinks this only watches the Saints. There are a lot more ineffective, boring, unadapting offenses throughout the league.

Yes, we run fewer screens and presnap motions than anyone else. Believe it or not we do run some outside zones, but Hurst is adequate at best, Ramczyk is having easily his worst season (which no one here ever seems to talk about) and Trautman keeps losing blocks on the outside. Oftentimes there's no outside for Kamara to go to. When your best OL are (a healthy) C and RG you tend to run more inside.

Carmichael has shown to be bad at playcalling once the game goes on. His scripted plays to start this week were great. I think it's reasonable to ask him to be more creative during the game, absolutely. He's been disappointing but I do think saying he's the worst (I assume you're just talking about OCs and not DCs) coordinator in the league is hyperbole.

27115,247925,247925,myxanders,"This post doesn't include Calvin Throckmorton or literally any of our middling DTs so it's not remotely close to accurate. I'd also argue there are worse players than you mentioned purely based on the fact they don't see the field.

Tyrann has been unspectacular and a downgrade but worst player? Nah.

Kamara is not even close to 10 worst players lmao.

Callaway isn't the worst he's just got a reduced role because he's not starting quality despite the hype most people here put on him last year.

Davenport has been solid and gets pressures but not sacks. Easily the second best DL this season behind Cam.

Harris was serviceable for a game or two but there's a reason he was a PS guy so sure I may agree.

Adebo has had a sophomore slump and he had a costly PI against Tampa. I wouldn't put him in top 20 players on the team but I wouldn't put him bottom 10.

Landry has been fine when healthy. Again not spectacular but not top 10 worst.

Turner has been hurt and has had flashes. Similar to Adebo in that he isn't among our best but I would say there are worse players on the team right now, particularly on the DL.

Jameis played hurt and he wasn't very good outside of 1 quarter of play. Again, not sure I'd call him worse than 50+ other guys who have played for us this year.

Dalton has been steady at QB and not great. But the last few games we haven't been winning or losing because of Dalton. 3 out of 4 games now he's been exactly what we needed of him.

The fact you only included guys in positions with easy to look at stats or easily memorable plays/fuckups shows you're not serious about this list.

27893,257815,257815,physedka,"Just a theory, but I think the rushing ability is more of a liability in the media's eyes. I have long suspected that they have an inherent bias against running QBs because they know that injuries will be more frequent and it will hurt their bottom line in terms of eyeballs and ad revenue when they are sidelined. The sports media likes to hype matchups and especially the main heroes of those matchups. Everyone tunes in to watch Lamar Jackson's Ravens but no one tunes in to watch Tyler Huntley's Ravens when Lamar is on the sidelines. Just look at all the work that has been done to protect the pocket passers via rules changes over the past 40 years. The NFL and the related media knows where their bread is buttered and they invest in it.

That's not to say that the pure pocket passer archetype QBs can't get hurt, obviously, but it's far less frequent than anyone running with the ball down the field regularly. I once thought it was more about racism against the higher number of dual-threat QBs that are black going back to Randall Cunningham days, Michael Vick, etc. But I think it might be more about the risk in the media's eyes. They would rather hype something like a Tom Brady vs. Aaron Rodgers matchup because the odds are very high that they will both be on the field when the time comes and playing without injury.

So going back to my original point, I think the media disrespects Hurts because they think that at some point, he's going to get mangled while running down the field and it will hurt their ratings when he's on the sidelines or if he's not playing at a high level. I'm not advocating for this position - I'm just saying that I think it factors into the talking heads' positions on various topics.",4.0,nfl,t3_znh0li,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints :Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-12-16T10:46:59Z,saints,-0.0044874460342763

29480,271627,271627,steakfarts,"I think all these micro stats they push now are crap and made up.  They mean nothing.

I am also a stats guy, but they are success based probabilities.  The one that triggers me is the real time win probability.  All it basically says is while you are leading you are more likely to win, and the more winning by the more likely, until the other team scores than not probably winning.  It is meaningless, just something to talk about.  No duh, while I am up I am more like to win.  If we are tied it's 50/50.

Take catch probability, if we were to really model it.  It would depend on the type of route, the accuracy/velocity of the ball, the weather conditions, the receiver, the pass rush pressure affect, the sun or light in their eyes, the sideline, the coverage type, the actual cover person, etc.  It is extremely complex to really model, and for what?
