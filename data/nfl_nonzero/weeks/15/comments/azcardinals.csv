27396,236411,236411,yngbld_,"I have a few thoughts...

1. If Tom Brady were drafted to the 2018 Arizona Cardinals, he may have ended up being considered a bust. I think people tend to drastically underestimate the importance of a player's first NFL team.
2. If Josh Rosen had been drafted to a more pocket passer-friendly team (like, say, the Patriots), he may have developed into a starter or a very solid backup. Having said that, I think the league as a whole is tending to favour mobile QBs more and more, so he may never have been considered above-average.
3. I think public and sports media perception of him was muddied by the fact that he was a confident, politically progressive atheist. So when he stuffed up, people were more motivated to pile on.
4. There seem to be a lot of people who generally agree with me, so he became strongly associated with the ""He just didn't get a proper chance."" meme.

I genuinely feel bad for him, and I wish he were drafted by literally anyone else, more for his sake than for ours.",3.0,azcardinals,t3_zpzy51,False,0.0,:Australian: Australia,2022-12-19T16:32:22Z,azcardinals,-0.0152385794744808
