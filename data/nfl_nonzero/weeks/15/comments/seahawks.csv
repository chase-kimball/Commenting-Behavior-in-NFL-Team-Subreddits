I think re-singing Neal makes sense regardless of splash plays -- especially given that he won't cost much, *and if we're cutting Diggs* (next comment . . .), we'll need some experience/depth at the position. Neal could essentially take the place of Diggs -- he's not been used in that role, but his measurables show that he's faster/quicker than Diggs, and should be able to cover ground in that role if he can adjust to the position. At a low cost, that buys us time and give us average starter quality at that position.

I say cut Diggs no matter how he ends this season. The dead cap money is worth more than paying him for another year for this kind of performance ($8m in dead cap vs $13m in salary).

And 100% bring back Goodwin. He doesn't cost much and is the best WR3 we've had in years. If someone can push him down to WR4, even better.",9.0,seahawks,t3_zrzxgd,False,0.0,:sea1:​,2022-12-21T15:40:17Z,seahawks,0.0346845268819007

8532,64679,64679,Esuu,">But realistically the Denver pick will probably fall out of the top 5 (assuming they go 1-2 the rest of the way)

There's still a pretty decent chance of a top 5 pick even if they lose to the Rams. As it stands right now the worst we could pick(assuming SoS stays about the same) with the Broncos going 1-2 beating the Rams is 7th overall. Because:

* Loser of Cards/Falcons picks behind us
* Loser of Panthers/Saints picks behind us
* Every other team has at least 5 wins already

To get to the top 5 all we need is:

* Colts beat the Texans(or Charger or Giants) - now we pick 6th
* Loser of Cards/Falcons game wins one of two. For the Cards this is Bucs/49ers and for the Falcons it's Bucs/Ravens. - now we pick 5th
* Loser of Panthers/Saints game wins one of two. For the Panthers this is Lions/Bucs and for the Saints this is Browns/Eagles. - now we pick 4th
* Rams beat Chargers or us - now we pick 3rd

So as simple as the Colts beat the Texans and Rams beat us week 18 and we're picking 5th. Add in something like the Saints beat the Browns but lose to the Panthers, and Falcons beat the possibly Lamarless Ravens but lose to the Cards and we're picking 3rd. Not out of the realm of possibility.

It's obviously much easier to pick in the top 5 if the Broncos lose out, and by that I mean we always pick in the top 4 at the worst pending SoS tiebreakers, but picking 4th or 5th is fairly likely even if they beat the Rams.",2.0,seahawks,t3_zqgk9g,False,0.0,​,2022-12-20T11:53:02Z,seahawks,-0.01853682601956

Mahomes can do some truly unbelievable things, but it's a double edged sword because sometimes he will try some crazy shit when he doesn't need to and be a bit reckless with the ball. We got some ball hawks that can really take advantage of this. 

Defense is going to give up yards (and some points) but if they can bend but not break, get a few big stops, and timely turnovers. We got a shot

On the other side Geno MUST take care of the ball and eat as much clock as possible. Hopefully K9 can get back to form but either way Geno has to find a way to move the chains.

But it's hard to win when you do neither of those things. 
The reoccurring theme in the losing streak is going down multiple possessions early. With the offense out of their comfort zone especially with issues running the ball. Geno has been anxious makes increasingly riskier throws turning the ball over and just having a hard time adjusting. It's just going to get worse with the league getting more film on him 

I'm not trying to shit all over Geno he has played well for the most part. It would be a completely different issue if he was under contract.

When things are going good he his great. When we can run the ball play from ahead to 1 score down he is calm, accurate, takes care of the ball. Just trust the process and we got the W.

When the run game breaks down, normal throws aren't there, down by 2 possessions. He is anxious, making increasingly riskier throws, trying to force things or do too much, and turning the ball over. 

Of course the loss isn't all on Geno, you can blame any number of things, but it was a winnable game and the kind of QBs that win SBs can adjust and overcome adversity and find a way to win. Geno always seems to be able to make it close but just finish it. 

The Seahawks aren't about being a 7 seed playoff team hopefully winning a game. The Seahawks are about winning divisions, deep runs, and winning another SB.
