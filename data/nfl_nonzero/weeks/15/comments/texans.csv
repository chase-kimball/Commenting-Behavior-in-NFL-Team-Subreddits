First thing about your analysis is, not every first rounder is going to work out. Figure that at least 25% are going to bust (that doesn't exactly work out with small sample sizes, over those 6 high firsts you could have 2 or 3 flat out busts and still hit your average over 10 years, but, whatever). That rate goes to \~50% in the second and 60% in the third. So of those 16 guys, on average, maybe a little over half are going to even be on the roster going in to year 5, and maybe half of them are starter caliber, and if you are lucky, 1 or 2 is elite.

You also play a lot more than 22 guys in an average game. Ignoring depth for injuries, guys get spelled and rotated out for different packages, and there's special teams to consider (kickers are poeple too) so you will see a lot more than 22 guys on the field on any given Sunday, and we need all of them. A roster is 53 for a reason.  


We can and will improve incrementally over the next few years, and Caserio is a process oriented guy so unless we just really luck out with a QB and a coaching staff, we should expect to still be bad to middling for the next two years rather than taking a big leap in any given year.   


All that said, we could have been at 6 wins this year but for some true fucking cowardice on Lovie's part and the absolute atrocity of a Cronenberg creation that is Pep Hamilton's offense. We should have started 4-1 and won the last two games. A 4-1 start might have given us the momentum to beat the Titans, and we wouldn't have started Allen for 2 games so we might have beaten the Browns, and with a real offense (and a refusal to simply take a knee) we could have potentially upset both the Chiefs and the Cowboys.

Believe me, I wish it was a faster process, and I had a whole lot of hope coming into the season, but we got effed up pretty bad by the coaching hire snafu. I really don't think that we were supposed to have a coaching change, I think that the plan was to have Culley for at least 2 years right up until the point where Flores came available. I think that Caserio saw an opportunity, and probably had a conversation with him, but got torpedoed by Flores being litigious.   


Regardless of what happens with Lovie though, as soon as we fire Pep we ""should"" become a better team, like, immediately. That doesn't mean we'll be good, but that 4-6 wins next year in a new system with a very young team is a step up, and 6-10 wins the following year would actually be a pretty resounding success from a team that's been as bad as we've been.",3.0,texans,t3_zppody,False,0.0,:doodle16:,2022-12-19T09:39:52Z,texans,0.171692313957476
