Sorry, but if there's one thing I more than often see in general NFL based comments it's how ""bad"" the referee callings are. Yah, duh... they're not perfect. But in those specific cases I never can't help wonder: why didn't the coach challenge those ""*obvious* mistakes""? Maybe because it wasn't all that obvious as some fans want to believe in the first place?

But some Steeler players definitely seem to have an arrogant streak over 'm and I think it's awesome that the referee's don't only acknowledge it, but also take action.

Going by the chart here that is a massive trade, ie russian roulette.  Pick 2 is 2600 here, our entire draft is only worth about 1500, then we'd need to trade away another 1100 points of future picks which would be like next year's 1st, or several other mid picks.

Also every other QB needy team will want to look at trading up too and bid against us, so it could drive the price up even more.

This site's value formula could be debatable but the point is that could be a crippling trade if it doesnt work, or even if it does. So it may not even be feasible.  I'm not saying definitely dont do that, but it isnt like a simple thing to pull off

edit: even if we lose more and pick 10th, our draft capital is rated equal value to the 2nd pick

Jimmy G would be an upgrade, but he isn't realistic because he's not going t want a 1 year minimum deal.
