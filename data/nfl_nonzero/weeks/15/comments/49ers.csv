Everything they've said about him has made it seem like he's got the mental make up that you absolutely must have to be an NFL QB. And I agree it's way more important than arm strength. But watching guys like Allen and Mahomes it's hard not to put a premium on arm talent.

His two outings were disasters, but we may not have seen the best comparison. 

I like Purdy a lot, though. My dream ceiling for him would be a Romo type, but clutch. Trey's ceiling felt like a Jalen Hurts type. We were all high on Trey's personality coming out of the draft, but he has yet to prove that he can be the man, and the type of grown up that can lead a team. Until he's done that he's nowhere near being a Hurts type. 

Romo may have never won an MVP, but he was pretty damn good for a long time. And with Brock's intangibles and his work ethic, that seems very achievable and would be dangerous on this team.

Kyle will pick the QB he feels the most confident in, and honestly at this point I'm inclined to think based on field performance that's going to be Purdy unless he shows a massive regression - which is completely possible.

Willis earned 7 Pro Bowls and 6 All Pros(5 first team and 1 second team) as well as leading the NFL in tackles in two years and Bowman earned 4 All Pros and 3 Pro Bowls. They were also a critical component of the 2011 Niners not allowing a single rushing touchdown in 14 straight games setting an NFL record.

Main difference I see here is Greenlaw and Warner have cemented themselves in Niner history, whereas Bowman/Willis have helped to define linebacker history in the NFL.",3.0,49ers,t3_zqhmth,False,0.0,:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy,2022-12-20T10:53:24Z,49ers,-0.00065859375
9282,72909,72909,GoatShapedDestroyer,"If Purdy makes a deep playoff run with the team(and looks like he has) then we go into next year with an open competition between Purdy and Lance in camp with the lean likely towards Purdy. There's no reason to trade Lance at this point, and people likely wouldn't given what we'd want for him, and it's become very evident that having a competent/capable backup QB is important. To that point as well, between both Purdy and Lance we'd still have a properly cheap QB room even with Lance's first round contract, and we have him for another 3 years if we take his 5th year option. Kyle has shown that he makes players earn their time on the field, he's not the person to hand over the keys because of draft position and Lance will need to show some serious improvements to make that QB1 spot over Purdy, assuming Purdy continues playing at the level he is.

There is almost no way Jimmy comes back next year as he's a FA and will want more money than we're willing to give him and if Purdy looks good in the playoffs and (potentially) helps win us a Super Bowl there is low incentive to bringing Jimmy in at a high pricepoint. Jimmy will have several potential landing spots next season as a starter and while he did get injured again this year, his time on the field did show the league enough that I think he's guaranteed a starting spot somewhere and that his shoulder injury last year has fully recovered and he's playing well.

My expectation for the offseason is:  
QB1 - leans Purdy due to body of work  
QB2 - Lance unless he has an amazing camp and shows up Purdy. I don't expect this due to injury + the fact that even this year media reported that Purdy looked very, very good in camp. He battled for that QB3 spot and beat out Sudfeld enough to the point that the org felt comfortable eating the 2mil we paid him to be our backup.

Of course all of this is irrelevant if Purdy regresses significantly and starts to really shit the bed, but that's why this conversation is moot until end of season so we can truly evaluate a larger body of work with Purdy.",3.0,49ers,t3_zqse47,False,0.0,:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy,2022-12-20T10:46:35Z,49ers,0.04508856498232

17048,122871,122871,Nickppapagiorgio,">True - but I think the scenarios in which the 49ers finish below the #3 slot are, from what I can figure, even more unlikely than the scenarios in which they finish #2 or even #1. 

Its exceedingly unlikely. Right now it's a 15 game parlay to get there. If you went to Vegas and bet a 15 game parlay, you'd be given somewhere in the vicinity of 15,000 to 1 odds. This will more than likely resolve itself this Sunday, or in the 10 am games Christmas Eve, and the 49ers will have clinched a top 3 seed. before even kicking off against the Commanders. However if it's still in play at kickoff for the Commanders game, its not a 15 game parlay anymore. It's a 10 game parlay that will become a 9 game parlay with a loss. 9 game parlays have odds down to 360 to 1. It's still low, but it would requires you to put this away, and not let it linger.


>We own the tie breakers against the Seahawks, Vikings, Bucs due to head to head record and currently our 6 - 0 record in the division be better than the Lions 5 - 1 record. It also seems pretty unlikely that the Eagles are going to lose out the string and bring any of the NFC East teams into play.

The 49ers have already clinched, so the Seahawks no longer matter in any of this. Under NFL tiebreaking procedures, multi team ties are always broken within the division first, before attempting to break them with teams from separate divisions. The 49ers will not have to use the 3 team tiebreak procedures for any tie involving the Seahawks.

For the teams outside the NFC West, division record is a tiebreaker for teams within the same division. It's not a tiebreaker used for teams from separate divisions. The 49ers going 6-0 in the division does not matter when dealing with the Lions, Vikings, Bucs, etc. You can find the NFL tiebreaking procedures on the NFL website [here](https://www.nfl.com/standings/tie-breaking-procedures). The 49ers wouldn't win a 2 team tiebreaker against the Lions if they finished tied due to them having a better record against common opponents. The 49ers would win a 2 team tiebreaker against the Buccaneers, but would not win a 3 team tiebreaker involving them, because one team must beat both of the others, or lose to both of the others for head to head to be invoked in a 3 team tiebreak. The next tiebreaker down is conference record, and the 49ers will not have a better record in the NFC than Tampa if they finish tied. The 49ers have to win a game, or have Tampa Bay and Detroit lose a game to get them to both permanently go away. Until that's happens I don't think you can rest. I also don't think you can rest if Philly goes down this weekend, as the 1 seed becomes more plausible.

If they win this week, they'll be tied with Seattle and a half game back of the 7 seed with 3 to play. Yeah, they quite possibly have to go 4-0 or at the very least 3-1 to have a chance, but they look like they could do it.

Some guys come into the league pretty close to their ceiling. Some guys come in with lots of low-hanging fruit left for coaches to pick.

If you go somewhere like Alabama, your QB coach might literally be an ex-NFL head coach. By the time you get to the league, you've already had years of NFL-level quarterback coaching.

With all due respect to Iowa State's coaching, Brock Purdy's QB coach was a young guy hired away from a Division III school.

It's why when Daniel Jones entered the league after 4 years under David Cutcliffe, and still was only a 59.9% passer at Duke, I was worried.

It doesn't appear that he's on any limitations, and each chapter of the playbook looks wide open. (I say that like I actually know what's in it) lol

The kid is cool, calm, and collected. He sees the field well, and his ability to rapidly get through his progressions is impressive. He's changing the plays at the LOS, calling hot routes based on coverage, and while he's had a few close calls, he's generally taken good care of the football. He's proven that he can see disguises in coverage and play well against pressure and coverage.

He has demonstrated the ability to go off script, make a play when something is there, and throw it away when it isn't. He doesn't get flustered by pressure, and his eyes are always downfield while climbing the pocket. He was sacked against Miami three times and still let it rip. I think that it has been proven that just because there is pressure on him, it doesn't mean he will play poorly.

Tom Brady proved to the league that you don't have to be a super athlete to win Championships. The QB position is a mental game between oneself and the other team. The ability to process information quickly and make decisions with that information is far more important than anything else. What good are you if you are a physical freak, but can't read a defense, or get through your progressions, or your decision-making is terrible? It's mostly mental. They say it's 50/50, but it's probably more like 60/40. I say that based on my personal thoughts and have not read peer-reviewed research on the topic. lol

tl;dr He has proven he can make all the reads, handle pressure and coverage, and take care of the football. Somewhat sneaky-athletic and can make plays when everything breaks down. He's young, and that's his only glaring ""flaw"" right now. He will face adversity, and can he come back from behind?
