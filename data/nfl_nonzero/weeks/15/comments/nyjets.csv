After Favre left us in 2008 we were a team ready to win now without a QB (sound familiar?) We had to trade up for Sanchez. Sanchez was raw but did enough for us in his time here. Year 3 Sanchez we began to lose weapons around him on the OL and skill position. He was more heavily relied on to win but was unable to. Due to poor drafting and bad prioritizing of assets, we didn’t correctly replace his positions. Sanchez eventually failed here. 

In comes Geno to the same situation as Mark - bad OL, minimal weapons. We had an almost miracle season 2016 with Fitzmagic but the foundation of that team was based on bandaid players - older with no long term outlook here. 

Geno and Fitz are gone and Maccagnan continues to draft poorly and mismanage assets. We finally manage to land Darnold who…surprise surprise…comes into a team with minimal OL protection and little weapons to work with. Not to mention a terrible coach hired by ownership. 

In the years past I think it was easy to point blame at GM, roster and coaching but right now Zach has (so far) the best roster since our older playoff runs and what seems to be a great GM/Coach combo.

They don't run this defense often enough in this game for me to clearly get it even in retrospect, i think this was the only time they ran it.

IMO Moore's open because the Cloud defender over him is completely turned around. if you throw a medium pass over there, you hit Moore on the sideline because you're exploiting the depth of the cloud drop against the timing of the wheel- he's so far off that the wheel has an opening if you throw it with a lot of anticipation and the cross will pull (and does pull) the cloud over and turns his back to the wheel, making him out of position to cleanly recover. At least that's how i view it, but honestly i can't say for sure if that's right or wrong.

I also don't think the completion % is a good barometer of that, last year he was averaging 8 air yards per pass (23rd in the league amongst multiple game starters) and now he's averaging 9.5 air yards per pass (6th in the league amongst multiple game starters). Your completion percentage drops as you throw deeper. That's just how it goes for most guys.

I also see a lot of those same issues, but last year they were even worse. He is better than last year. And a lot of these things, like processing, he's met an NFL threshold for. I don't really care about the standard of him being the #2 overall pick. Like, that doesn't matter anymore. The cost is already paid. So it's just about evaluating his play, regardless of the context of how he was acquired. He should be doing better because he's far too athletic to be unable to make an accurate pass just because his base is wide etc

*i looked it up on PFF because they have stats by depth of target for QBs, and his accuracy behind the LOS and short has improved by 2-3% while his intermediate and deep passing has gone down by 3-5%.

i just watched a lot of videos of people talking about it. i don't know how correct i am about a lot of stuff which is why i mention when i don't know things, but there used to be a lot of videos of NFL players talking about how to do things, coaching clinics you could watch, ex-nfl players teaching mechanics. Larry Fitzgerald has some fantastic videos on how a WR should run a curl route for example. Then i started searching for ex-NFL guys who were talking about the game and reading their stuff to understand what was going on, and eventually when you just watch stuff and try to analyze it you're forced to figure out. I think it took me 9 full games of analyzing QBs to understand what a ""pre-snap read"" was and that was after half a year of reading random stuff.

Not having the context of how other QBs play shows up in his work constantly as he is just writing from the hip on what good/bad plays are based on what he sees from other jets QBs, most of whom have been bad. His missed Moore analysis here shows the lacking imagination/context because he’s talking about the corner needing to peel off Garrett but in a cover-3 that corner was always going to be held by Garrett because that’s what they’re taught to do against the vertical stems. So when the safety rotates off the *right hash vertical, that’s all the tell the QB needed that he needs to start a soft drift towards the right to make time because the only player carrying Moore is a damn Linebacker. And because the safety is the one rotating that means the outsid CB is going cloud while the slot CB is going flat (IE will not be following Moore). *and if there's any thought that he might carry Moore, White should check it and once he sees that he isn't, know that he's got a play available.
