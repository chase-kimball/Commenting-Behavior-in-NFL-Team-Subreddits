I had my Sweetness jersey on instead of the standard solid blue shirt with overalls that was part of the uniform (cuz fuck the rules, we were 12-4 and I was gonna support my goddamn team in the playoffs). 

We had a huge TV in our inpatient ward area that we would leave on throughout the day for AFN to play and provide background noise as all of us walked around the shop to do our jobs. But that day I was adamant we have on the motherfucking NFC WCG. I kept getting pulled in a million different directions all around the shop for various taskers so I could never see more than about 30 seconds of the game.

But the final seconds come up on me. Fuck maintenance, we're about to pull out the last second upset after the Tate tuddy in the last minute. I'm telling bosses to fuck off I've gotta see this. Coworkers are gathering around the TV. I'm clutching my buddy's shoulder. Another Bears fan colleague is swearing up a storm next to me. I'm making shallow jumps here and there cuz I don't wanna stop moving.

Scales snaps the ball to O'Donnell. Parkey sends it. It looks good in the air. O FUCK WE'RE GONNA GET IT O GOD LETS FUCKIN GO!!!

Look at just last week against the Eagles. Wrs going into the game were St Brown, Pettis, Jpnes jr, Pringle ,Webster (of the PS). And Fields loses arguably his best WR early when St BRown goes down.

Oline: Starting RT and C are backups, going down to the 3rd string. LT is a 5th round rookie who has been looking good, but still needs obvious growth. Starting RG gets hurt early.

39864,238447,238447,dafoo21,"This type of weather in Soldier Field does slow down the offensive game. With the Bills not having a reliable running game outside of Allen, this should make the game closer than it should be. 

Recently, somehow, the secondary, filled by patch work of practice squad players from the bears and other teams, has been looking ok. The top 2 bears picks came back last week and they bears D did confuse Hurts a bit. But, they give up big plays and will get flags called on them, due to being so young. 

I can just see Allen slipping out of any kind of pressure the bears get, which is not much, and a couple big plays make the difference in the game. Allen probably will be able to sit back in the pocket.

I know the Bills D has been dealing with injuries and has been slipping recently, but not sure in what stage those players are at to return. Bills rush D has been meh lately, after being amazing in the beginning. This will be a huge help for the bears to stay in the game, as they only pass the ball 38% of the time and want to run the ball. Luckily, in this possible weather, the offense might get a small advantage over the Bills D, only because thats what the bears are great at, running the ball over and over successfully.
