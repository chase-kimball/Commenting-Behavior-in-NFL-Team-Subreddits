Raiders vs Steelers: Home field advantage to Steelers gives them a slight bump, plus they‚Äôve been on the upswing lately.

I don't trust the owner, who has overruled smart people in the Browns org in the past on several notable occasions (drafting Jonny Football, hiring Hue Jackson over Sean McDermott, hiring John Dorsey and going with Dorsey's choice of Freddie Kitchens for HC, etc), and people in football don't trust the owner either - which is why we found ourselves in a situation where Stefanski (who, as you say, was not being sought by other teams) was the best candidate willing to talk to the Browns when we were replacing Freddie Kitchens.

> ps: freddie kitchens? if we only had 3 games left, stefanski might just get past his record of 6-10. 

Every year, every schedule and every defeat is a different context. That the Freddie Kitchens led Browns won any games at all was entirely down to the roster. 

It's difficult to explain just how uniquely awful the Freddie Kitchens experience was or how bad things were here back then relative to now if you don't choose to remember. I'll point you to this anecdote from this podcast episode...
