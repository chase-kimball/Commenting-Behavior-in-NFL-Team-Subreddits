8340,74381,74381,GoCurtin,"When NFL players try to improvise, what are they basing their play off of? Because more than 90% of NFL and college laterals are simple garbage. But if you take a quick peak at the basics of rugby, you'll quickly learn some basics that would help any offense, defense or special teams player make better ""improvised plays"" in the future.

1. Don't give the ball to a teammate who can also be tackled by the same guy who's about to tackle you. The purpose of the pass is to take you and at least one defender out of the play so that the ball can stay alive in your teammate's hands.
2. The player receiving your pass should normally be attacking (running forward) into a gap left by the defense. So many NFL players just chuck the ball backwards to someone standing still. 
3. Don't wait until you have zero options left to lateral the ball. The focus in rugby is on the BALL moving forward and being scored.... we don't care who scores it. So players need to find teammates in attacking positions and pass to them when the time is right. NFL players seem to be just ripping at their emergency parachutes. 

These rules are quite similar to how one improvises a fast break in basketball (but imagine how easy it'd be if the basket were the entire width of the court) . It's not rocket science. But if so many teams are going to run lateral plays.... you'd think they should at least put in a couple minutes a year to understand the basics.",1.0,patriots,t3_zpdf74,False,0.0,#43 Ebner,2022-12-19T05:00:48Z,patriots,0.0213627874536869
