I mean you saw him against Minnesota last time. Yes one of his three TD passes was on a blown coverage, but he also threw a perfect bomb to Chark on a tightly-covered go route. And also threw accurately throughout the game on intermediate and short routes.

Of course having an elite OL helps Goff; just as having arguably the best WR in football helps Cousins. But I am not sure how you watch the Vikings-Lions game and still deny that Goff is playing at a high level.

Instead of obsessing over who between them should have made the pro bowl, we should all be making fun of Bears fans for thinking Fields—with his 1.5 to 1 TD to INT ratio, and 11 of 13 2022 starts under 200 yards passing—is already an elite qb, i.e. Mahomes-tier.",13.0,minnesotavikings,t3_zsaryt,False,0.0,lions,2022-12-21T23:48:37Z,detroitlions,0.0022083914619704

Regarding Tua, very few serious analysts said (or say) he is incapable of being a starting qb in the NFL. What people said (and say) is that he has limitations (below average arm strength for a qb1), is never going to be an elite qb, and should never have been taken before Herbert.

Of course not. And yes he absolutely has this ability. It resulted in a gimmie TD against the Lions. 

But a big reason that Fields is able to find open men down the field sometimes is that defenses do not respect the pass as much when they play the Bears. Because the Bears call passing plays so infrequently, defenses are running cover 1 and cover 0 all the time, so there is often no safety within range of a downfield receiver.",3.0,nfl,t3_zs7hhi,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2022-12-21T21:22:06Z,detroitlions,0.0337052576303155

The Bears do lack talent but I believe the extent they lack talent has been exaggerated to make excuses for Fields. Claypool and Mooney are not what you are looking for in a WR-X, but they are capable starters. Montgomery is a an above-average RB1. Braxton Jones is an above-average LT already.

In addition to problems with passing accuracy, turnovers (10 INTs), it seems like Fields holds onto the ball too long, which is why his dropbacks result in sacks at a higher rate than any qb in the NFL.

Do you know why Fields has so few attempts? It is because his coaching staff wants him to limit his passes to situations where the defense is playing the run.

Fields is getting such a disproportionate amount of cover 1 and cover 0 situations, without safeties playing deep, that is why you have a disproportionate number of deep balls in the attempts Fields does make. 

By the way I would never argue Goff is elite (i.e. Mahomes, Allen, and Burrow tier). I would take Fields over Goff because Fields makes plays with his legs and has the potential to be an elite QB.

Homer take. Even say Goff this year. When he was committing turnovers including multiple pick 6s, the lions were 1-6. He plays smarter and they are 6-1 in the last 7.

First drive was great until we were inside the 5 and did 4 straight runs while getting stuffed for nothing. Defense and bad offense by the jets bailed this out not to mention the punt return team

There were a ton of bad defensive play calls like have no safety over the top before half time and a deep ball was converted. 

There were a few horrible defensive calls that luckily the jets offense wasn't prepared for and screwed up. 

Offensive play calling was stale and predictable most of game.

We won but there was a lot to clean up coaching and play calling wise. Goff had all day to throw and we couldn't scheme a WR open or he would do a first read throw behind the line to gain.

Not to rub salt in your wounds, but wasn’t that pretty much expected? The drop off from Trevor to the next QB was already seen a massive before the draft. As physically talented as Wilson is, he still wasn’t seen as all that close to Trevor in terms of physical attributes. He certainly was a top 3 worthy pick given his talent, but he was still less physically gifted than Trevor and still was seen as needing a lot more development too.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that Wilson is a victim of circumstance here. His talent alone was worthy of a top 3 pick in most years, but it just looks so much worse when you put him next to Trevor. This isn’t an indictment on Wilson, it’s a testament to how insanely talented Trevor is. There was a reason there wasn’t even a debate if he was going to be the number one pick.

The only QB as physically talented as Trevor is Josh, and I cannot think of anyone all that close to them in the past decade.

You realistically can’t hold them to the same standard. I think you need to evaluate him in a vacuum… but I agree with most Jet’s fans here, even then it’s not great.

I wouldn't worry too much about it if I were a Jet's fan though. They have a hell of a coach who will eventually get that true #1 QB.

All it would take is one disgruntled ref. A guy who's been in the league for 10 years and never gotten his crew picked for a big game, to blab to anyone who'd listen.

I think it's all just confirmation bias and a large sample size.

""Oh, refs missed this big call at the end of Sunday Night Football to end the game."" OK, but what about the 14 other games that week?

I think internal bias as an effect as well. Top WR matched up with rotational DB, WR doesn't get, DB must have interfered. Top DB matched up with a WR3 and he doesn't catch it, must have been good coverage.

I've never coached football, but I have coached (high school) basketball, and there are just a million things going through your head that clock management has to compete with.

When you're on the couch watching the game, after each play is over, you're probably like me - sitting there watching the clock tick down, wondering if/when they're going to call a time out. But that's literally all we're thinking about, because there's really nothing else for us to focus on. When we sit on the couch, we're not hooked up to headsets with coordinators and players looking for our decisions on everything. We aren't listening to calls for lineup groups and play calling talk and other radio chatter while mentally running through ""if this happens then I should..."" predictions on situational decisions you might have to make (like you've been doing all game long) - all after already having gone through a long, brain-draining game.

It's a skill that a new coach needs to develop, because they've never had to do it before, and never had to learn to juggle it with all of their other concerns and responsibilities.

It’s a video of Carter and some other Georgia players mixing it up with Missouri players in pregame warmups.   
Nothing significant happens in terms of physical fighting but I see Carter as really acting like a punk here and I question how that would mesh with this team in the locker room.   
I realize this is a small sample and likely not indicative of his character but it’s enough to make me pump the breaks and have some curiosity.  What stands out to me is the defiance of his coaches and others - seems like a punk move.   
Sure this could be seen as “chippy” or “competitive” but I feel like this hits a bit differently.

But these stats often go hand in hand. A QB throwing for more yards will lead to a higher passer rating. A QB throwing more interceptions will negatively impact the same statistic. Advanced stats agree too, they like more passing yards, hate turnovers.

But this is why W-L is an incredibly stupid statistic to evaluate a QB. It is the *only* stat in which you can perform well and have it not matter. As an example, Kyler Murray in 2020 vs the Dolphins threw for 3 TD, 0 INT, 283 yds, while rushing for 106. He lost that game. It increased his overall stats in every way, except for W-L.

But statistically in the NFC, Goff only really ranks below these three: Hurts, Garoppolo and Geno. Since Jimmy G is likely out for the year, it makes sense that he's out of the running. Although Goff is slightly lower in passing yards than Kirk, he's well ahead of him in passer rating, QBR, EPA, ELO, pretty much all the [statistics](https://twitter.com/greerreNFL/status/1563938913768484866?s=20&t=MtYzziDtGSLPoWwBImDsYA) that have been shown to correlate with a team's margin of victory.

Which brings me back to the point both of us agreed on. Kirk's on a team with a better record (and one that pythag def disagrees with), and it's that why he's voted above Goff.

There will be life threatening conditions. We will have a blizzard warning for Friday and maybe Saturday (for the west side).

The major worry right now is widespread power outages with the temps in the teens and wind chills below zero. 

Also, with the holiday traveling really ramping up right around when the storm is suppose to be it’s heaviest, getting stranded in your car could be a real possibility (make sure you have an emergency winter kit if you are traveling on Friday/Saturday).

There are people in the meteorological community (serious people that have no reason to embellish) talking about a real possibility that the roads could be closed down to all but class three vehicles (snowmobiles, four wheelers) and emergency vehicles on Friday. 

The central/east side of the state should be through most of the storm by Saturday morning (winds will still be bad though). The west side is  going to get hit by some heavy lake effect Saturday that could add an *extra* foot by the time Christmas arrives. 

This is a serious situation, if you make sure to plan ahead and can keep off the roads for a couple days (I know that’s going to be difficult for some) then you should be okay.

Also not a bad idea to have somewhere you might be able to go if you lose power and don’t have a generator. Especially if you have small children or are elderly/have elderly living with you.
