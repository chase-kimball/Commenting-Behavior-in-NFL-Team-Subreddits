16054,126037,126037,MillennialSN,"To people who don’t follow Dallas closely, here’s the 411 on what has caused recent declines for the Cowboys:

1. Losing Anthony Brown & Jourdan Lewis for the season. Brown was a solid #2 corner for us who finished top 5 in pass breakups a season ago & Lewis was a top 10 slot corner. The replacements for these guys have been Daron Bland, who’s played well in terms of risk-reward. Similar to the Diggs of last year, he’s a risky guy who will go for picks but allow a lot of yards. Kelvin Joseph is the guy who’s replaced Brown - he’s a former 2nd round pick who is likely off the team after this season. Just a total bust. Think of him as a poor man’s version of Eli Apple on the Giants a few years ago.

2. We can’t defend the run. This has been all season. The outside run has notably killed the Dallas defense throughout the year, and while the same could be said for the inside run, it had improved under the Jonathan Hankins acquisition. He’s missed time the last two games. Additionally, LVE reinjured himself against the Jags and that didn’t help, he may miss more time going forward. Also, Parsons has been battling small injuries for the last 5+ weeks now - nothing major & he’s produced, but somethings off. Parsons was outrun but Jeff Driskel for a first down two weeks ago in that tight Texans game.

3. Dak hasn’t looked himself. Cowboys fans will hate me for this (I’ve gotten “go kys” in my dms for saying it in that sub), but it’s true. While he’s had his share of unfortunate picks, many of them are on bad throws way overthrown or way behind his receivers. It’s clear as day he’s missing Amari Cooper. In fact, his 2021 splits on games without Amari Cooper look exactly like his 2022 stats. Aside from CeeDee Lamb, this receiving corps is not good, lowest in the NFL in separation.",1.0,nfl,t3_zrn8af,False,0.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,2022-12-21T12:18:45Z,cowboys,-0.0017979845388075

This city's history is steeped in a very post-war industrial boom while Philly feels historic and colonial with a dockworker twist. Very nice change of pace. Also, it's so clean! Also, I ate so much that I won't be hungry ever again.

Very jealous of your public transportation system. The orchestra was phenomenal and the new Sue exhibit is sooooooo good.

42992,338065,338065,thatguyoverthere202,"Our 2 and 3 CB are out for the season so outside of Diggs you’ll find Kelvin Joseph is going to get picked on. I’d expect some chunk plays by whoever isn’t lined up across from Diggs who has been one of the more consistent DB’s in the league this year contrary to the recent narrative. 

Run defense is suspect and our o-line is ranked #30 in pass block win rate, so those pretty much outline the weaknesses. 

As far as good, Dak has taken a step since destroying his leg and looks similar to how he played prior to injury. We’re playing risky which comes with more turnovers, but you don’t lead one of the highest scoring offenses in the league without some risk. The combo of Pollard/Zeke has looked to be on par with pretty much any run game in the league, as well. As stated, we’re probably the second best in the league at getting to the QB, so I’d expect Lawrence to get hit at least a few times. 

If the cowboys decide to play like they did during the Vikings, Giants, Colts stretch, we could win by 30. If they play like they did against the Texans we could drop the game. So who knows how todays game goes.
