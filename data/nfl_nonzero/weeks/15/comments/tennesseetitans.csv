Cap mismanagement by J-Rob.  No reason to have cut him.

We’re 0-17 on paper to half the people on this subreddit. It’s nauseating to read through on weeks we’re coming off a loss.

1898,18550,18550,Bieber_hole_69,"Okay, but genuinely in this fanbase there is a weird mentality of thinking every halfway decent player the team decides to move on from is getting a raw deal or something. [Look at the thread about Martiota getting benched.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/dihv9x/rapoport_the_titans_are_making_a_qb_change_ryan/)

A guy who did almost nothing of note for this team, and yet acting like it's a national tragedy the guy got benched because he was playing like shit. And it was the right decision to make, clearly.

And now that the team decided, ""huh, maybe we shouldn't mortgage the future any further to go all-in on Tannehill's remaining window as a starting QB,"" it's the same song-and-dance around here that somehow the Titans have committed some mortal sin against Tannehill because they haven't done absolutely everything to give him a perfect situation.

It's not your comment specifically, but it is definitely this post and some of the sentiment that is the exact same thing with this fanbase and the weird mentality of it. It's unfair of me to just put your comment on blast, but it's a recurring theme in this subreddit year-after-year. Same thing with all the threads bemoaning how AJ Brown or Corey Davis was somehow wronged by this franchise, what more does everyone want the Titans to do for these guys? How many other fanbases act like this so consistently with non-Hall of Fame caliber players?

What little has this team done to support him overall in his time here? Paying Saffold, extending Jones, paying Humphries, drafting AJ Brown, drafting Nate Davis, trading for Julio, extending Henry, drafting Isaiah Wilson. Even if all those moves didn't work out, they still definitely invested heavily in providing Tannehill some support while he's been here. They went all-in on him for 2 years after deciding to run it back in 2020, did you want them to keep on doing that for 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, etc? Clearly after the playoff debacle last year the team decided he wasn't going to be the guy to win us a Super Bowl, so they pulled back to give some leeway and prevent us bottoming out with nothing to show for it like a team in the Falcons' present situation is doing.

What more did you want the Titans to do for Tannehill? Make him owner and let him decide how to run the team? Would it have been the best interest of the franchise to trade picks and spend more money for this year?

He was a for-sure first round bust that was likely a career backup when he left Miami. Four seasons later and he's viewed as a Dalton-line tier QB that can get a team to contend, but isn't quite good enough to win it all. All the national criticism he's received after 2021 for being a playoff choke artist aren't the fault of the Titans, nobody held a gun to his head and made him throw all those interceptions against the Bengals.

He's earned $100M since leaving Miami. Pretty good turnaround from the Dolphins *paying him to not play for them because they wanted to get rid of him so badly.*

I don't mean to sound combatative, but what the fuck are you guys on lol? What more do you want an NFL franchise to do? If you guys were running things we'd be starting 38-year-old Derrick Henry getting 1.2 YPC and 44-year-old Ryan Tannehill in 2032 while paying them each $50M/year just because we should feel some kind of sympathy for them because they had the compassion to come play for this franchise and earn a lot of money?

It's the NFL, it's a business and the goal is to win as many games as you can. Roster decisions are made with that goal in mind, not the feelings and desires of the players on the team. Ryan Tannehill has done fine for himself while he's here, I don't think there's hurt feeling on either side because of it. It was a good situation for both parties for many years and we're approaching the point where both sides are moving in different directions. The Titans owe Tannehill nothing and Tannehill owes the Titans nothing. He's been great for the team and he's earned a lot of money because of it, that's the nature of professional sports.",10.0,tennesseetitans,t3_zqqyc7,False,0.0,11,2022-12-20T10:01:28Z,tennesseetitans,0.0369048668560868

We may have won a Super Bowl with him last year if he didn't play the worst game of his life at the biggest moment.

I love the guy, but are you acting like he got a raw deal from the Titans? The Dolphins gave him away for peanuts just to get rid of him and with this team he turned into comeback player of the year and got a $30M/year contract out of it. What more could the guy have ever asked for? Aaron f'ing Rodgers got worse treatment from the Packers as far as the offensive roster around him, and Tannehill hasn't had half the career Rodgers has had.

I swear fans of this team really do have an issue with putting any halfway decent player on an untouchable pedestal, PK has always been right about that. Who else is could have given Tannehill half the chance to revive his career as the Titans? He's been great for us, but he's not an unimpeachable hall-of-famer like you're treating him as in this post. You think he'd turn any contender in the NFL into a Super Bowl winner? He can get another team to the playoffs for sure, but what were the limitations of our team in 2019 and 2021 that kept us from winning a Super Bowl?

First play, terrible design, Tanny gets sacked. Second play, Derrick gashes then for 7 yards. Currently at a net 1 yard positive on this set of downs. It's third down. It's tied in the 4th quarter and you have a kicker who as you pointed out can't kick the long ones. Your rb is approaching his 7th 100+ yard game of the year (league lead btw). And your QB has a bum ankle so they aren't able to move around as easily. So what do you do? Obviously try a pass play that immediately breaks down and causes us to lose 9 yards. 

You have to come away with points there. You have to pound the ball with derrick. We know from Mike Keith he was already pissed about not being used in third down situations, this is the perfect time. If he gets the first down, great. Of not, that's fine.

That is, 'number of seasons as a starter' is a reasonable starting point if you're trying to measure, say, how good a particular draft class is, or what kind of player you can expect to get with the #13 pick in the draft.

The Bengals lost to the Ravens the first time so they will need to beat the Ravens in week 18 to win the division. Bengals remaining games Patriots, Bills and Ravens. If the Bengals finish 2-1 as long as the one loss is not to the Ravens they win the division. Bengals would be the 5 seed if they beat the Patriots and Bills but lose to the Ravens.  
Could see this game as the SNF contest even though both teams would already be in the playoffs it could be the difference in seed placement for each. Bengals could be the 2 seed with a win over the Ravens if they beat the Bills in week 17 or the 5 seed if they lose.

It would also be better than a Titans/Jags win and in game where the winner of the game has a losing record at the end of the season.

The Chargers have the easier path to the 5 seed in the AFC. The Chargers have the Colts, Rams and Broncos as their final 3 games. If they go 3-0 no other AFC team can beat them with tie breakers at 11-6 for the 5 seed.

The Dolphins also have the 5 seed. They would need to go 3-0 against the Packers, Patriots and Jets. But they would need the Chargers to lose one game and for the Bengals to win the North.

Those good teams don't normally need a QB so therefore they are going to be drafting the best of the rest and getting better. Which then makes it harder for those bad teams to get better. Yes the salary cap helps with the parity but so does bad teams landing franchise QBs. The Bengals would be just as bad as they ever were if it wasn't for Burrow. With your draft order the Chiefs would of had the #1 pick during his draft class. So some QB needy team would of had to sell off 1st for the next 5yrs to move up to get him. And with that the rich of the Chiefs get richer with those extra 1st from someone else. Your draft order would not create parity like it is in the NFL.

The Texans are going to be getting a franchise QB and the Jags already have one. If the Titans can get ahead of the Colts in the draft it puts them in position that the Colts will either have to trade up ahead of the Titans to get a QB. The reasons being the Titans probably think that Willis might be the answer but wont know till next year also with that teams that want to trade up ahead of the Colts for a QB might look at the Titans for that reason. So that would give the Titans more draft ammo. Titans could be around the 8-11 spot with a 7-10 record so an example when the Bears traded for Fields they moved up from 20 to 11.

Malik Willis is a 3rd round rookie. He has shown flashes and has shown improvement. He has also shown that he is not ready to lead an NFL team to anything approaching a decent season. Worried about this weekend but excited for Willis to get a lot of in-game experience.

In terms of whether he can be the QB of the future for this team, I don't know how anyone could know yet. Even great rookie QBs look rough their rookie year.

44495,256512,256512,neimsy,"Ok. That makes more sense. I disagree with the 23 number, but that's fine. The problem is pretty obvious though. Good QBs don't become available. You either have to suck horribly and get it right in the draft. Or you have to get super lucky in the draft. Or you have to wildly overpay and overcommit to a guy like Russ or Watson.

My vote is very much for making this team better. Tannehill led us to a #1 seed. I'm aware that he had the worst game of his life after that. But he led this team to the conf championship in 2019, where we lost to the SB Champs.

The Tannehill hate is absurd. He took a sack that he needed to avoid yesterday. Other than that, he played well enough to get the win if he had an offensive line or a WR who could get open. But he has neither. Plus, the line has already let him lose both his ankles this season.

I for one am hoping we limp into the playoffs and have a good game or two. But this team has very very real problems. And in my mind, none of them are Tannehill.",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_zp8ujn,False,0.0,:Titans2:,2022-12-19T08:32:49Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0017186996002622

With all of these injuries and the playoff pressure bearing down on teams, health is even more important. Our data shows that by Week 13 health starts to take a front seat to many other factors in determining wins and playoff berths. So let's look at who were the healthiest and least healthy teams going into last weekend based on thepredictors.com BUS rankings.

Healthiest Teams Ranked by BUS Score:

1. Jacksonville Jaguars - 88.0

2. Kansas City Chiefs - 82.8

3. Philadelphia Eagles - 82.2

4. Chicago Bears - 81.0

5. Pittsburgh Steelers - 80.4

Least Healthy Teams Ranked by BUS Score:

32. New Orleans Saints - 52.5

31. Los Angeles Chargers - 56.6

30. Tennessee Titans - 57.0

29. Denver Broncos - 58.1

28. Arizona Cardinals - 58.2
