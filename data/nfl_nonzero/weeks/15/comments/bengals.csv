If you listen, they’re quite high on Burrow. They put him in the top 5. For comparison, he has Hurts at 10. They’ve been lukewarm on Tua for most of the year.  They watch a lot of film while also considering analytics.

Taking my homer hat off, I don’t necessarily disagree after watching Herbert last week. He’s more physically gifted than Burrow. But Burrow has intangibles. Read the Athletic article on his sideline throw; he’s found another level metacognitively. I’ll take that all day.

The Bengals sucked ass in the first half. On offense they had 3, 3  and outs, and an INT. It doesn't get any worse than that.

On defense, Brady was slicing and dicing them, making them look like fools. Also, the Bucs running game is dead last in the NFL, but looked top 10 in the first half.

Brady was 79-0 after being up by 17 points.

Also, we lost Hubbard to an injury.

The defense looked lost, the offense looked lost. It was bad, very bad.

Then out of no-where it seemed like someone had a voodoo doll of all the Bucs starters and starting pinning them non-stop.

I don't go in many game day threads, but I was in the one yesterday and everyone who was complaining had every right to complain about that first half, it was terrible, and there didn't look like there was a lot of hope to not complain.

But our boys pulled it off with a little help from all the mistakes by the Bucs.

With each comeback win like yesterday, it helps heal decades of let-downs by this team.
