A quote from [Daniel Popper's ""Final Thoughts"" article today](https://theathletic.com/4019737/2022/12/19/chargers-titans-week-15-analysis/): ""In Herbert’s four best EPA/dropback games of the season, Lombardi has called play action on at least 48 percent of Herbert’s early down dropbacks, according to TruMedia. In Herbert’s four worst EPA/dropback games of the season, Lombardi has called play action on less than 38 percent of Herbert’s dropbacks. That included Sunday, which was Herbert’s third-worst EPA/dropback performance of the season. Herbert used play action on 37.5 percent of his dropbacks, according to TruMedia. Against the Raiders in Week 13, which was Herbert’s second-worst EPA/dropback game of the season, Lombardi called play action on just 25 percent of Herbert’s dropbacks, according to TruMedia... The next week against the Dolphins, Lombardi made play action a feature part of the game plan.

2261,6800,6800,A_Livins,"The red zone offense is terrible compared to the players we have. Prime example against the Dolphins when they get into a goal-to-go situation and throw a grand total of zero passes into the end zone, instead throwing short and trying to rely on a receiver making a guy miss.

If the team gets behind the sticks in a drive, he calls too many quick hitters to try and chip away at the yards, which defenses have clearly keyed on, instead of attacking.

Said play-calling also applies to early downs. It feels like this team wants to get every drive to 3rd and short, instead of attacking on first and second downs.

He tends to drift away from what works too quickly. The Chargers operate very well in the play action game, but it will get left behind for drives at a time.

Herbert is one of the best QBs on the run, and yet we'll run a ton of plays that keep him in the pocket and under distress instead of rolling. Look at how the offense moved up and down the field against Miami, and tell me why they can't lean on that more often.

I also think calling TOs to leave more time on the clock disincentivizes going for two.

More time = more likely for the other team to respond with a FG = less payoff for the same amount of risk if you go for two

>BREAKDOWN

>Playing quarterback in the NFL is supposed to be hard. But it doesn’t look hard when you watch Herbert play. He simplifies the most difficult aspects of the position to the point that it can be tough to appreciate (or even recognize) what he’s doing at first glance. While Herbert is celebrated for his arm strength and athleticism, which allow him to do remarkable things on the football field, those attributes don’t fully explain the record-breaking success he’s enjoyed over his first two seasons.

>Outside of Tom Brady, there isn’t a quarterback who gets through a progression quicker than Herbert. In an instant, he’s able to recognize whether a receiver is open or will come open—that’s harder than it sounds—and to act accordingly. While most passers will look at one or two receivers before checking down or taking off on a scramble, Herbert routinely gets to his fourth or fifth read. And it doesn’t take very long for him to do it.

>BIGGEST STRENGTH: ARM TALENT

>Usually when we say a quarterback can “make all the throws,” we’re just saying they have a strong arm. With Herbert, it means more than that. Herbert can literally make any throw. He can throw the bullet passes, the touch passes; he can throw deep, he can throw short, he can throw over the middle, he can throw to the perimeter. And it doesn’t matter what’s going on around him—the ball is going to get to its intended target.

>BIGGEST WEAKNESS: CREATIVITY

>My only gripe with his game, and it’s a small one, is Herbert’s strict adherence to offensive structure. Sometimes he gets through his progression a little too quickly, or opts for a checkdown rather than trying to make something happen out of structure. No coach is going to complain about that, but given his immense talent, it feels like he’s leaving some big plays on the field.",105.0,chargers,t3_znjrj3,False,0.0,bolt,2022-12-16T11:26:24Z,chargers,0.0467468386479409

Brandon Staley, head coach, L.A. Chargers. The second-year Chargers coach has gotten enough guff for clock management and fourth-down management in his short time running the Chargers. So let’s give him some back-pats for excellent end-of-game management in the Chargers’ 17-14 win over the Titans. With 1:07 left, and the Chargers up 14-7, Tennessee had the ball at the L.A. 21-yard line. Tennessee had no timeouts left. The Chargers had three. Staley had two choices: hope that Tennessee wouldn’t score and the clock would bleed out, or use timeouts in order to give his team a real chance to get in field-goal range in case Tennessee scored a TD to tie it. “I wanted to give my quarterback [a chance] in case the Titans scored there,” Staley told me afterward. But there was something else. Mike Vrabel, the Titans’ coach, might choose to go for two to try to win the game. So Staley knew he had to try to preserve some clock in case Tennessee was up one, or the game was tied. With the ball staying in bounds and Tennessee advancing, Staley used a timeout at :59, at :54 and at :51. After the third timeout, Tennessee scored on a quarterback plunge. Vrabel went for the PAT. The Chargers took over at their 23-yard line with 44 seconds left, enough time for Justin Herbert to move the offense 52 yards in six plays to put Cameron Dicker in place for the winning field goal. “The situation wasn’t ideal,” said Staley, “but you’ve always got to find a way to put your team in the best position.” That’s what Staley did Sunday.""",2.0,chargers,t3_zq2ydw,False,0.0,Chargers,2022-12-19T20:44:34Z,chargers,0.0418636740618296

Odds are low that this guy even ends up in the end zone this year given that our other speedy receivers capped out at 3/3/3/4 TD respectively in their best seasons, and of those guys, only Benjamin ever averaged 2+ receptions per game in any season with us (unless you include Carter this year, who hasn’t been used as a deep threat and has about the same yards per catch as Keenan Allen’s 2022 and career average)",3.0,chargers,t3_zrye2d,False,0.0,Austin Ekeler Fan Club President,2022-12-21T16:01:25Z,chargers,0.081484765625

34739,199125,199125,costopule,"There’s an art to how much you pay out for each side. 

Nobody is risking a ton of money for a small payout, even if it’s a very likely outcome. You’d only set this line to get people to stop betting on a near-certain outcome and get a higher portion of money going towards the underdog. 

Similarly, no one is betting on a low payout for an unlikely outcome. That is why the payouts are so much higher for underdogs, sometimes many many times higher than the favorite’s payout for the same amount wagered. 

Fewer people think it’ll happen, but a higher payout means more people will take the bet because the bettor will make a big profit if it somehow does happen, which invokes a “might as well just in case” attitude in some bettors.

Ideally, you’d want a payout high enough for each side that invokes a lot of wagered money, but low enough that one side doesn’t pay out more than the other side wagered.

Example: Favorite -214 and underdog +120 (I have no idea if this line is realistic). This line invokes $15,000 in bets for the favorite and $10,000 in bets for the underdog, a total of $25,000 in bets, but gives a $22,000 payout ($7,000 over wagered money) to the favorite and a $22,000 payout ($12,000 over wagered) to the underdog. Favorite hits and earns the book $3000 vs underdog hits and earns the book $3000. (These are not usually the exact same number. Even here there is actually $9.35 in extra money for the favorites that I’m leaving out for simplicity)

They don’t care which outcome will happen, they played the line and win no matter what. They make profit out of exploiting the market of bettors’ expectations, not off true odds of something happening. 

Yes they have the more likely outcome as the favorite most of the time, but if bettors like the unlikely outcome to a large enough extent, they can move the line and even make the more unlikely outcome the betting favorite if it helps them even out the money. If every bettor sees a trap game coming, the book will make the worse team the favorite.",1.0,nfl,t3_zq0mqr,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-12-19T18:00:14Z,chargers,-0.0186294893370938

They work to find a line that puts similar money on each side of the bet, and that’s what they would use the algorithm for. Their models are built to work towards this goal of having profitability on every bet. 

If you have a heavy favorite, they’re going to decrease the payout for that bet and increase the payout for the counter bet(s) to incentivize bets coming in on the unlikely side and disincentivice bets coming to the likely side. Their models help with this part, setting the line to even out the money. They’re not as focused on getting correct outcomes as they are on getting close to even money on each side.

Patriots and Jets need 2.5 or 3 wins to jam up the wildcard, otherwise they’re 9-8 at best and tied with us. We would have the tiebreaker over the Patriots because of common games, and we would have the tiebreaker over the Jets because of AFC record. 

Both the Jets and Patriots would need a tie with the Dolphins, or else only 1 of the 3 could beat the Chargers’ record. Only with a tie, 2 of the 3 could. 

The Dolphins can’t be the one of the 3 that wins, or else the Jets and Pats, who are a game behind the Dolphins, would both end up behind the 9-8 Chargers. If exactly one team must win next week, we would root for the Dolphins. 

Everyone else who can finish 9-8 would lose the tiebreaker to us (Titans* and Browns by head to head, Steelers and Ravens by AFC record). Only the Raiders can steal it by having a better divisional record, so they have to lose for us to clinch if we only win against the Colts.
