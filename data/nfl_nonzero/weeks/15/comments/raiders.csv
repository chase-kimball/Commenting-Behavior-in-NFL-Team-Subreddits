8254,65201,65201,HaploOfTheLabyrinth,"I personally think Josh got used to calling plays with a big lead knowing he had Bill Belichick's defense so playing conservative was always the right choice. However as we all know the Raiders defense for the last two decades is hot hot garbage so he is going to have to fix that AND adjust his playcalling in the meantime. 
Also this team won way more close games last year than is normal and made the playoffs giving people a false impression of the roster. This team has big holes (interior oline, and all 3 levels of the defense) that they will need to fix before consistent winning becomes the norm. JMD has called some great plays in crucial moments only for players unfamiliarity with the scheme and plays blow it up. Tae and Renfrow running into each other, Waller tipping the ball away from Tae last week, and on 3rd and 4th down when Jacobs has to get one yard and the terrible guard or center play blows it up in the backfield.
Give Derek one more offseason to master this offense, for JMD to update the scheme to better fit the players he is now more familiar with, and Zeig to begin fixing the defense and I believe we will see great results. They have 3 years and this is year 1. If after next year the defense plays great and the offense is balling and we are being held back by JMD or Carr then we should reevaluate but until the glaring issues are fixed people need to temper their expectations a bit.",4.0,raiders,t3_zrrqds,False,0.0,:TecmoBo:,2022-12-21T20:42:02Z,raiders,-0.0240190515207883
