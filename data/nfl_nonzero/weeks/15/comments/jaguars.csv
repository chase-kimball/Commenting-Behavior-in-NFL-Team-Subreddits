It's still possible, but the amount of luck it would need is kind of absurd.

Week 16

•	⁠Jags beat the Jets
•	⁠Saints beat the Browns
•	⁠Bengals beat the Patriots
•	⁠Colts beat the Chargers

Week 17

•	⁠Jags beat the Texans
•	⁠Ravens beat the Steelers
•	⁠Dolphins beat the Patriots
•	⁠49ers beat the Raiders
•	⁠Rams beat the Chargers

Week 18

•	⁠Titans beat the Jaguars
•	⁠Broncos beat the Chargers
•	⁠Dolphins beat the Jets

This scenario would guarantee the Jags a 7th seed. This scenario would also guarantee the Jaguars a playoff spot. A win in week 18 would establish home field advantage, while a loss would establish the 7th seed.
