I was in college for the music city (forward lateral) miracle and first trip to a home game was in 95. I’ve always watched at least 10 games a year forever, but now it’s like a drug problem. I want them to win everything once. Just once. Just so I can witness it. But it’s also different now. I have to plan around the games. I actually give a shit about who the people are outside of the game too. I’m rooting for them personally as much as I do the team. I want them to win it as much for us as I do for them.

I think everyone has not cared about the disappointment as they do now. Even in 2020 for the Hail Murray, I was like “if you told me in September they’d be 7-3 right now, I’d be fucking stoked!” Now it’s pretty freaking idiotic to think not blowing good teams out - with all the injuries, all the setbacks - is disappointing. As fans, we need to be goddam grateful for how good our backups (and some of the common shit upon starters) actually are. Do they miss sometimes? For sure, but they’ve been winning games (can’t win close games, remember?) Good coaching, good team bonding, finding a way.

I assume you rooted for a different team until VERY recently. You're welcome to join us but learn about what it means to be a Bills fan. And by that I mean, know we have suffered. Not quite Lions level but pretty bad. And def worse that the jete.

If you're not new, chances are you listened to national media too much this offseason and it skewed your sense of expectation and reality. The bills never had more than \~20% of winning the super bowl based on the numbers. ""Favorites"" is a relative term. 

If we don't get it done we have many years of Josh to come, and even more of McBeane if all goes well.

>	Note: Though a fair-catch kick is not a free kick, the rules for a free-kick formation apply (6-1-3)

Free-kick formation rules [can be found here](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2022-nfl-rulebook/#article-3-free-kick-formation). A free kick is a kickoff or safety kick that puts the ball in play. So free-kicks and fair-catch kicks share the same set of rules regarding the formation teams follow. 

>	Until the ball is kicked, all receiving team (Team B) players must be inbounds and behind their restraining line, and at least eight, but no more than nine, players must be positioned between their restraining line and a spot 15 yards behind their restraining line (the “setup zone”). (See Section 2, Article 1, Item 2-b.)

When you’re lined up for this free-kick you also don’t have the opportunity to “fake” the free-kick to go for a first down. The only way the kicking team can maintain possession of the ball is

49657,352247,352247,trotsky41,"Mahomes advanced numbers are significantly better. He is ahead by significant margins in QBR, Ben Baldwin’s QB composite score, and PPF grade. (All these metrics take into account rushing/fumbles/penalties etc). While the offense as a whole is similarly efficient. 

Allen is 3rd, 4th, and 2nd in those same metrics respectively, and other than PFF he is grouped in the same second tier as Tua and Hurts (obviously different circumstances for those QBs). 

PFF for pass blocking as a whole is 13th (what you cited is what I’m assuming is PFF offensive line play - doesn’t include TEs, RBs), yet also rank 1st in ESPNs pass block win rate. The Bills also rank 6th in pass block win rate. The Chiefs line is obviously better but maybe it’s not as clear cut by HOW much better.

I also think Diggs, Davis, Mackenzie, Knox is better than Kelce, Juju, Valdez-Scandling, and Hardman.

Using more traditional rate stats, Allen’s TD% is slightly lower, his INT% is slightly higher, and his sack% is slightly higher. 

I think all things being equal these QBs, Allen and Mahomes, are in the same tier. Mahomes though has had the better year. 

But to be real, being in the same tier as someone who’s on track to be one of the greatest QBs ever is a hell of a feat. It’s not so much a knock on Allen just recognizing how damn good Mahomes has been.",0.0,buffalobills,t3_zrxltp,False,0.0,bills :bills-logo:,2022-12-21T17:07:38Z,buffalobills,0.0030647282522861
