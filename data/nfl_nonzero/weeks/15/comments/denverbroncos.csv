Sounds like Paige is asking for these guys to come in for a week or two as advisors and offer their opinions on how things could be improved, not in full time roles like GM, HC, or OC. 

For a 4-10 team with a brand new ownership group and rookie coaching staff, I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad idea. However, it would probably be best to pick just one or two of them as to avoid it becoming a distraction.

I don’t see how it could hurt to bring in Peyton Manning to talk with Russell Wilson about leadership and transitioning to a new team.

For the coaching staff, I remember Hackett said in his initial interview that he was partly inspired by Mike Shanahan’s offensive schemes.

4739,20408,20408,BobertJrThe3rd,"I think it’s really hard to not like Nathaniel Hackett the person just because he’s such a humble guy, and he’s had just about the worst luck a head coach could have in his first season with all these injuries. He’s shown he’s willing to learn and adapt from mistakes and I believe he would do a lot of things differently in a second go around.

I don’t think the Broncos should give him that shot. We have a roster that we expected to be in playoff contention (Before injuries I suppose), and yet here we are at 4-10 celebrating a win against a QB committee of Colt McCoy and Trace McSorley. Hackett has sunk too far into the quicksand and the results of this season have lowered our confidence as fans and shattered the league’s remaining respect for our team. 

We should be celebrating Russell Wilson as he passes legendary QBs on the all time records. Instead, we’re here watching other teams fans go out of their way to post apologies and condolences on our subreddit while we see countless posts about how many bathrooms are in Russell Wilson’s house compared to how many touchdown passes he’s thrown this season.

I would love to see Hackett turn things around and become a top coach in the league because I think he is a good person and I want to root for his success. But someone must be held accountable for the historic failures of this season and it won’t be our $250 million quarterback with an exemplary ten year track record.

I also don’t believe it’s worth holding on to Nathaniel Hackett simply for the hope that Ejiro Evero stays with the team because I think Evero has put together a good enough season to garner serious looks for a head coaching gig.

10161,61018,61018,IamLiterallyAHuman,"Well, the team was established as a founding member of the AFL in 1960, which merged with the NFL in 1970.

The team kinda sucked up until the 1977 season when we made our first Super Bowl, only to lose 27-10 to the Cowboys. A few years later in 1983 we got John Elway, the best QB in Broncos history, who essentially carried the team to the Super Bowl multiple times and getting blown out, finally winning in 1997 and 1998, where he didn't actually have to carry us, instead we were carried by Terrell Davis.

The 2010's we had good QB play, but not elite, made a Conference Championship in 2005 but lost to the Steelers, drafted Jay Cutler the next year who was decent at best for us before being traded in 2010. 2010, was to put it mildly, terrible. 4-12. The next year we got John Fox as our coach and Tim Tebow(who we drafted the previous year) as our starting QB. What followed was a hilarious/miraculous run to the playoffs, with multiple 4th quarter comebacks to get to 8-8 in the regular season. We faced the Steelers at home in the playoffs and won in overtime on a clumsily thrown 80 yard TD pass to Demaryius Thomas(RIP).

2012 was great until it ended abruptly. We signed the GOAT Peyton Manning in free agency and started 3-3 on the season. Then waltzed to 10 straight wins and were on the verge of getting to the Conference Championship when Rahim Moore decided to be a complete idiot in defense and let up a game tying touchdown in the final minute of regulation. We lost on a field goal in second overtime. 2013 went mostly the same way except we made the Super Bowl, just for it to be mysteriously cancelled(to this day, no one knows why, or you could just look it up)

2014 was good, Manning started to decline and we had an early playoff exit again. Fox was fired and replaced by Gary Kubiak. Manning fell off a cliff in 2015, but our defense was incredible, we went 12-4, winning the first seed in the AFC, beating the Steelers and then the Patriots on the way to Super Bowl 50. Our opponent was the Panthers, who just had a magical 15-1 season. Easy win. 24-10.

Since then we've gone downhill with Manning and Kubiak retiring, and not knowing how to get a good QB. We've had our moments but otherwise it's been painful. Demaryius Thomas passed away last year as well.

We had hope this season as we made a move for Russell Wilson, but coaching has proved our undoing this year.


The current roster is interesting, we have a great defense, good offensive weapons, and someone who should be good at QB, but are underperforming on that front. The names to remember on defense are Pat Surtain II and Justin Simmons, on offense it's Russell Wilson, Jerry Jeudy, Courtland Sutton, and Javonte Williams(who's knee is unfortunately not at all healthy rn).

One last thing, the Raiders and Chiefs are rivals and are never to be respected. FTR, forever and always.

Edit:

I should add that Pat Bowlen was a great man and owner of this team, it's rare that team owners are beloved by the fans but we loved Pat. Another thing to add is that the team has an intimate connection with the State of Colorado, as the state doesn't have good college football and while hockey and basketball is good, the state is obsessed with football and thus the Broncos are Colorado's team, you can't really separate the two.",18.0,denverbroncos,t3_zs2ue7,False,0.0,3,2022-12-21T16:50:17Z,denverbroncos,-0.000789379209604
