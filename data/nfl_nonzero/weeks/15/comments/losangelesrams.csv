Genuinely the only position I think we're weak at is RB and Edge. So if we can hit at those positions then great, also the FA class for RB is one of the best it's been in a while, expect the Rams to aggresively pursue some of these big name guys.

Everything's a hypothetical at the end of the day, anything could happen. But considering we have a competent FO, a top 5 coach, a top 15 AT WORST QB, Top 5 WR, the best defender in football, the best rated ILB in football and a top 3 cornerback it's kinda hard for me to see a world where we're not a threat if we're not badly injured.

18214,162476,162476,Ziiaaaac,"Lot of people writing the Rams off after this season and saying 'It's finally caught up to them'.

Something important to note: Rams have all their star players already signed for next season, and they're already in the positive with Cap. Yes, they only have 2.6m cap space for next season but the Rams are also one of the most prolific Cash over Cap teams in the league because Kroenke is fuck you rich unlike some other owners who are just rich. 

Couple that with a full suite of draft picks other than their first for the first time in like 3 years and I'd expect the Rams to be a serious threat again next year injury permitting.

Injuries happen and I've been saying it for a while but I think the Rams and 49ers are very comparable teams right now no matter how much both sides hate each others guts. The Niners went 6-10 in 2020, and then in 2021 they made the NFCCG. What did they do with their 1st rounder in 2021? Drafted Trey Lance who did nothing for them in their 2021 run - so how is that any different to not having a 1st rounder for a one year turn around?

I don't think it's homerism or egregious to expect the Rams to be making a deep playoff run next year.

Stafford has one maybe two years left in him. Let him sit behind Staff as our backup and get intimate with the system, then when Stafford is gone he can take over the reigns as the starter. He'll only be 29. We can easily get 5 years of good QB play out of Mayfield.

In my opinion, this is exactly what Mayfield needs, a chance to settle down and get out of the turmoil he's had of what? 7 different coaches in 5 years?

Now he's got McVay, easily the best coach he's ever had. This way when it comes around that Stafford is done we don't need to risk it all on rookies.

And it's true. This defensive scheme is built specifically with the goal in mind of giving up a little throughout each of their opponents' offensive possessions - but the key was having a more superior for their own offense to score faster, and more often to the point that eventually the opponents offense had to abandon the slow, plodding dink and dunk passes and have to start going for bigger real estate per play. It was then and only then that the QB pressures increased, and the gaps in the secondary got much much smaller beyond 10 yards past the LoS. 

But when the Rams offense wasn't clicking, it exposes this defense because it affords the opponent the comfort of knowing they're safe to continue taking what the Rams defense is giving them.

Every game last year the Rams lost was the result of poor turnovers leading to the Rams falling behind early and having to dig out of a hole.

Arizona's DADOT is 5.9 yards, Rams is 6.3. Only 4 other teams are under 7.0 (SF, KC, DEN, IND).

The Rams rank 2nd to last in Prss% (Percentage of pressures per pass play) to only Atlanta. Ironically, despite lack of depth per passing play, the Arizona Cardinals...rank 4th in Prss%.

So there's validity statistically that the Rams soft cover buffer does indeed result in lots of dink and dunk passes. But there's no direct correlation that simply allowing so many of these dink and dunk passes automatically leads to lack of QB pressures, since Arizona has no issues getting to the QB with even more short passes allowed.

The Rams rank 28th in QB Hurries, 25th in QB Knockdowns, and 26th in QB sacks. None of the aforementioned teams (SF, KC, AZ, IND, DEN) are anywhere to be found at the bottom of any of the rest of these lists despite a frequency of short passes seen against them. 

I did (and still do) dislike Morris' fabric detergent soft coverage schemes (most of the time), and he could stand to adjust at TIMES to a press coverage instead where warranted.

But one note about Morris' ""bend but don't break"" defensive scheme? The Rams rank 2nd in the NFL at RZPct (Percentage of opponents' red zone drives that result in a TD) at 41.5%; which is 2nd only to Denver's 37.5%.

I mean, that game alone didn't lose us the division as we lost it by 2 games (***) but it was a game we lost by 11 we had no business losing like at all. Miami had a grand total of 145 total yards of offense.

In fact, of the 28 points they scored, their offense accounted for a grand total of 34 yards. It was Goff's disastrous turnovers that erased every great defensive play that broke the team's back in that one. I made a Tom Hanks-style Zoltan-like wish that Goff would just go away after that game I was so mad. 

In retrospect though, a lot of that was because McVay put Goff in a position that maximized the potential that those mistakes would occur, rather than minimized them. It didn't absolve Goff of his mistakes, it just pointed out that despite the heapings of shit dumped on him after games like that; and McVay did a lot of the dumping - which to be fair he later softened and acknowledged more of his own fault at that; but the damage had already been done). 

I'm so glad to see Goff doing well now, he totally deserves the praise.
