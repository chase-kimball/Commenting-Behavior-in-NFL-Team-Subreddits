https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/xvljuh/oc_adot_vs_time_to_throw_for_qbs_through_week_4/ 

I could only find this about his aDoT compared to other QBs its only through week 4 but, i think it's still relevant. The graph really shows how short the passes are but, also shows he has a lot of time to throw. They also count scrambling as part of those seconds so I think its a bit skewed (he is 3rd in scrambling attempts). 

What a better O-line can do is help DJ stay in the pocket and develop those mid to deep passing more on top of helping Saquon. It would make converting 3rd downs much easier.

- this was one of the most exciting games I’ve watched all season

- Giants 97 yard drive was one of the best drives I’ve seen us put together this season, maybe over the past several seasons

- Despite not throwing or running in a TD, DJ played pretty well. Dude was throwing DARTS all night and came in clutch when we needed him too

- Saquon wasn’t much of a factor until the last drive. I did like him getting 8 targets, I don’t think we use him in the passing game nearly enough overall

- Hodgins and Richie James both played damn good, caught some clutch passes that we NEEDED

- slaytons routes seemed extremely limited… hitches and outs. Not really any opportunity for YAC.

- THIBS!!!!!

- Did Thibs have the best overall defensive performance of the season? 12 tackles, 3 TFL, 1 FF, 1 FR, 1 TD, 1 sack, and was constantly generating pressure. Holy shit.

- Late in the game I texted my brother saying “man, Dex, Leo and Azeez haven’t been showing up much… they need to make a big play each to wrap this up”. And a few minutes later, Dex with the hit on Heineke that lead to the Leo fumble recovery in the red zone, and then Azeez with the critical sack shortly after. Guys showed up when they needed to.

- not our secondary though. Holy shit they’re a mess back there.
