When I was talking about going to therapy, a friend of mine told me he’d grown up hearing that was a ~white people~ thing. 

A lot of Black people I know who struggle with mental illness didn’t even realize they had clinical depression or anxiety or whatever. My understanding is stuff like that is swept under the rug or passed off a lot of the time unfortunately. 

Plus, minorities have to deal with a whole other side of depression and anxiety that white people don’t have to, specifically because of the colour of their skin. The amount of bullshit unwritten “rules” that Black people in America are forced to follow just to be treated decently is staggering.
