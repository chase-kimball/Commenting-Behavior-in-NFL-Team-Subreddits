15867,140145,140145,PleasantParfait48,"Anonymous reddit help is the best help. 

I had a really uncomfortable situation at work this week and I half want advice half want to vent.

I (woman) work in a property management office. There are a team of all men who work in the maintenance department. I have a very friendly relationship with them. We laugh and joke, mostly about football stuff but also about all the housing/construction related issues that happen around here.

This week, I was sitting next to one of them at our holiday party. He made not 1. Not 2. BUT 3 dick related jokes. 

The first one I tried to brush off. Context: we were making little gingerbread houses and I said ""Yuck, this icing isn't very good."" and he said ""I bet you've had worse things in your mouth."" I ignored it and was like mmmmaybe I misheard him?

The next one I was squeezing icing from a tube onto my lil house and he was like ""Wow you really know how to work that tube."" Ok that one was pretty blatant so I was like ""You are being inappropriate!"" But also laughed a little because I didn't want to cause a scene.

Finally, someone handed me a cookie and it was really stale. I took a bite and I was like ""wow, this is really hard."" and he said ""Didn't realize that was a problem for you."" ETA: that one was the most abrasive for me so I just sat there stunned and didn't say anything while I ate my stale cookie.

SO, we have three dick related jokes, all surrounding holiday baked goods and I'm left thinking WHAT THE FUCK MAN? Like, I love to laugh and joke with my coworkers, but I am not interested in having jokes made about my sexual proclivities. It's not funny to me and it makes me really uncomfortable.

I don't know what to do because I am **not** interested in reporting this to HR or his boss. It's just not happening. So I'm left with just....trying to avoid him I guess? What would the men/women/HR people of r/nfl do?

34666,311262,311262,oldirtybradford,"Just making a comment - but here are my thoughts on Simm's ""analysis"" :

The entire offense is based on Jalen's dual threat skills. His ability to threaten a chunk play on the ground or the air on every single play makes it easier on the entire offense - O Line, Backs, Receivers, everyone. It allows the eagles to run plays like the triple read that was shown a lot early in the year (Throw the flat vs QB keep vs give to RB).

Putting someone like Minshew in, even assuming there is no drop off in pass production, completely changes the way defense can attack the Eagles, and the plays Sirianni can call.

Simm's entire premise here is nonsense.",0.0,nfl,t3_znh0li,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2022-12-16T12:08:47Z,eagles,-0.0591086079999999
