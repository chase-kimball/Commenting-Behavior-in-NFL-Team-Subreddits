2. We've got third stringers out there on the line and the line still isn't absolutely horrible
3. No player was saving our season. Let's keep our picks
4. ?? Licht's last 5 classes have been really solid. 2021 is the weakest but we still got a serviceable edge in JTS and our now starting center in Hainsey. 2018 had Vea, Carlton, Cappa, Whitehead; 2019 had Devin, SMB, Dean, Edwards, Nelson; 2020 had Wirfs and Winfield (rest of draft was a miss but those two are worth it); 2022 has literally everyone rounds 1-6 on the roster and contributing significantly. The Aguayo and Trask picks weren't pretty in hindsight, but Licht is far from bad at drafting. Finds gems late and never whiffs early
5. Like? Gage has been solid when available. Neal/Ryan have had a large impact in the secondary. Julio has looked like a WR1 during flashes. I wish we had kept Suh, but Hicks has been great in the run game when healthy.

Licht has been a great GM. On top of solid drafts and signings, he's the reason we got Arians, Arians is the reason we got Brady, and Brady is the reason we got a ring.",1.0,buccaneers,t3_zq3j28,False,0.0,:wi: Wisconsin ,2022-12-20T09:02:44Z,buccaneers,0.0186771476729099

Another thing, I understand he has contractual obligations to the media. I didn't know he had any requirement to speak to them after the game depending on if the media requests him or not. That changes things a bit because that means in a way he has already agreed this is okay in some form.

I agree that he has some obligation to the media. The extent to which he owes something to the media is very much a gray area. Also at some point he would have to answer to this. When, where, and how is completely up to him however.

Dude's already upset and ready to go home to his family like he always does and he has to answer to these people. Who are going to profit and write stories off his blunder, yet offer little to nothing to him. 

I get that's their job, but I also get Gio having little sympathy or not being in a giving mood after what happened. 

Could this have attracted less attention by Gio being easy going and more open to questions? Probably, but that's not the point. You shouldn't press someone who doesn't wanna be pressed.

2021,12438,12438,Anangrylavalamp,"1.) We needed a long term answer for our QB. Free agency was a risky option and Brady was not a for sure thing for more then 2 years. 

2.) Our depth was fine to start the year injuries make things look worse in hindsight. We have multiple players out for the year. 

3.) This year had the most deadline moves in nfl history. Our options were not realistic at the time. The truth is neither of us know what the team did or did not attempt to do at the trade deadline.

4.) I will give you the 2021 draft and our Logan hall pick but so far our latest round of draft picks have played meaningful snaps this season.
Round 2 (57) – G Luke Goedeke
Round 3 (91) – RB Rachaad White
Round 4 (106) – TE Cade Otton
Round 4 (133) – P Jake Camarda
Round 5 (157) – CB Zyon McCollum
Round 6 (217) – TE Ko Kieft

5.) Our free agents this year have been disappointing but injuries played a big role. He gets a pass due to the many signings that lead to our super bowl win.

End of the day the team has a losing record and Jason will have some tough decisions to make this year. He shares a good part of the blame but more so because of the team's failure to pressure our coaching staff to make changes.",7.0,buccaneers,t3_zq3j28,False,0.0,:RedJersey14: Chris Godwin,2022-12-19T15:28:05Z,buccaneers,-0.0456282311693842

Offense utilizes their good players, when others are hurt… Somehow that makes them bad. I’m not big brain like you, so I’m not sure how having a good offense makes you a bad offense. To me, you saying the offense scheming up 2 guys to win a game suggests they’re pretty good. But we’ve never seen that before. Mahomes notoriously has never won a game basically only using a WR AND TE. Nope. Never. And if he did, that’s evidence their offense sucks. BIG BRAIN!

A good offense never goes down in a game. That’s why Brady has never came back from behind after looking bad. Same with Mahomes. These guys have notoriously been bad and poorly coached all their careers. Right?

A bunch of good players are gone now, so the offense isn’t as good. Big, if true.

Our offense put up 30 a game like it was nothing. This was true both when we had Gronk, AB, and CG and when we didn’t. Your argument that talent is the reason we were good is just dumb and ignores the fact that we had a bunch of guys who aren’t even in the league anymore and we still put up great offense. Where are BP and Grayson playing? What about Johnson? These were guys we used, when we lost all of this talent you say we had. We still put up 30 a game and destroyed teams.

9738,64930,64930,JaedenStormes,"Yeah, no. This team has immense talent. It just isn't playing like it,.and half of it is hurt.

The HC, OC, STC and strength and conditioning staff gotta go.

Let me break your post down.

1. All indications, including Tom himself, said Tom wasn't coming back after that year. He had to take a QB high, and they liked Trask better than whoever they thought they'd get at 32 the following year (since they expected to repeat)

2. Our current team has four starting caliber CBs, four starting caliber and three HOF candidate WRs, and so many TEs even without Gronk that Kyle Rudolph is getting paid to eat Cheetos. Last year we were down to WR7 and CB8. No team is built to withstand that and not have dropoff and in the salary cap era, none ever will.

3. You have to have a willing partner and you have to have something the other team wants more than what they have. We are going to lose a LOT of quality players in the next few years as our core hits their contract renewals and all the borrowing from the future we did to maximize Tom comes due. We are going to need every draft pick we can get, and it's entirely possible Licht saw then what we see now, the 2022 team isn't going anywhere and it's not worth selling out the future for a present that's already lost.

4. In last year's draft, we got Rachaad White who beat out Lasagna Lenny for the starting RB job, and not one but TWO tight ends that are getting enough play time to keep Rudolph in street clothes. Plus, they got The Real Punt God. McCollum needs some more time, he has been hurt since early in camp and has no reps. While Goedeke and Hall still have some growing to do, that's not abnormal for where they were drafted and it's wayyyy too early to give up yet. The likelihood that a first or second rounder improves in year 2 is MUCH higher than the likelihood that your 3, 4, 5, and 6 turned into three starters and a solid rotational player.

In 2021, you've got Trask which the jury is still very much out on. JTS is a solid pass rusher. Not a world beater yet but that's to be expected from what is essentially a 2nd rounder. Hainsey has started at two OL spots as a 3rd rounder. The others that year were a bit of a miss, but that's not abnormal for 4th through 7th rounders on a team with enough talent that they won the Super Bowl. Any GM in the league would take that as a two year resume, even without landing on earlier home run picks like Godwin and Dean (in the 3rd!), Carlton Davis (a 2), Wirfs, Vea, Winfield, D White, SMB...

5. Admittedly the signings weren't as great this year. But only with the benefit of hindsight. 

Nobody in the league thought Otton and Kieft could play this year, and everyone was screaming for a vet TE to replace Gronk. Rudolph was best available. 

The trade for Mason was a desperation move for someone Brady had chemistry with after Marpet upended the board with his sudden retirement. 

Gage had never had a massively injury prone season until this year, so he was a safe bet plus weakened a division opponent. Everyone in town wanted Julio even if he could only stay healthy a few weeks because we didn't expect Godwin to be back for real until about now. Logan Ryan and Keanu Neal have been good when they have played, and were added as extra depth after the unit being decimated last year.

As for resignings, they basically had to take Fournette because Vaughn wasn't ready and nobody knew what to expect from White. Arguably the worst FA deal is the one he didn't make, bringing back Suh. But he wanted more money ($10m) than his production was worth.

Essentially, the FAs look bad because of injuries you can't always predict, and because the rookies he drafted did unbelievably well.",6.0,buccaneers,t3_zq3j28,False,0.0,:buccobrucewhite: ,2022-12-19T18:24:57Z,buccaneers,-0.0066757714994572

11632,79920,79920,Lansdallius,"So the first half was actually pretty good in all three phases in terms of both coaching and on-field play, it was just overshadowed by that catastrophe of a second half.

If that fake punt doesn't happen maybe we keep the momentum going and hold on? Even a real punt might have made the Bengals work more and kill some more time. 

All the same, this was a coaching failure that the entire team collapsed. Brady had a bad half too, and it's worth asking how much he really has left, but the fact that neither Brady nor the coaching staff had any way to rally the team seems to indicate the team as a whole is quitting. I hope I'm wrong, and maybe they'll figure out how to get at least two wins against three other awful teams to win this clown car of a division. If they could put 60 minutes together like the first half, they get to the playoffs and maybe they can redeem themselves against Dallas.

It sucks that Bruce Arians stepped down. I think he really believed in Todd Bowles and Byron Leftwich, and it's not like they didn't have a track record of being effective in 2020 and 2021. I thought it would just keep rolling too. For the Bucs to be competent again, it's probably going to take a full teardown. New coaching staff, new QB. Aside from the young talented players, I think everything should be on the chopping block. Hopefully Arians has other guys we could try that might have a fresh voice, because this staff looks overmatched. Rebuild from the ground up. It'll probably take a while, but Licht did build the 2020 team over time. Maybe he can do it again.

Bowles and Leftwich should have been fired a while ago but Brady looks like he's running on fumes. This team is getting blown up this offseason, and Brady will head to the booth if he's smart. He's had a legendary career, and two great years with the Bucs and a Super Bowl are part of it, but Father Time's caught up with him.

27233,166528,166528,idaho22,"Luke was an right tackle in college.

I was responing to this part of your post:

""According to social media, switching from tackle to guard is the “easy” solution for a tackle who’s struggling. Not so fast my friend. If an offensive tackle has good hands, generally has good movement skills but might lack some foot quickness to play tackle, then moving inside could be productive. If an offensive tackle is struggling with his strike and punch location, plus has bad feet, then moving inside is a no-go. Things happen fast at guard. Your hands must be ready for action now. And if you miss with your hands, your base better be good so you’re able to recover.""

Luke G seems to be the complete opposite of a good move to guard since most of what I have seen is he has terrible hand movement. At 6'7 he somehow seems to have tiny arms (or maybe they are too long, I have no idea). He is missing with his hands from what I could tell. However, it could also be that he had no lateral movement in the inside. My gut says he will stay at guard but there also is a chance that since he was only an offensive lineman for 2 years he didn't develop good technique to play right tackle.. plus we have Wirfs. There is an offshot chance in hell he is better at Right Tackle, Wirfs moves to Left Tackle (in 2 years) and it's not a huge move for Goedke.

The bigger question is if he was playing on the right side his whole career.. that is Mason and Wirfs side. So since he's been hot dogshit maybe he's a Geoff Schwartz who won't develop properly if he's forced to play 1. a different position 2. a different role.

I'm sure the coach can figure this out though. At least it's promising that he has upside for development due to some of these reasons and he's not automatically hot garbage.",1.0,buccaneers,t3_zqogdu,False,0.0,:atlantasucks: atlanta sucks ,2022-12-20T08:57:15Z,buccaneers,0.0232853320263896

Not as easy for 7th round picks who never really made it in the NFL like Geoff Schwartz. Schwartz was \*decent\* at best but he really was only good for a year or two and got a large contract as a result but never was a pro-bowl or All-Pro level player.

This answered my question to some degree and I super appreciate the response. Basically the answer is ""it depends."" In some cases it's not difficult and in others it is.

I guess the good news is based on your ""not so fast part"" is maybe Luke G is a better Tackle than Guard.

Also, since last years playoffs, I have been trying to like Bowles but I still believe he alone ruined our chances for a second SB. Just the fact that we scratched and clawed our way back from being down 27-3 meant a LOT had to go our way. Why test our luck and call that blitz?
