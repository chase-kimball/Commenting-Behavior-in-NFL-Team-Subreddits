16000,126971,126971,Pentt4,"If youre not going to get a QB in 2023, which I doubt, and honestly don't want Ron picking in a lame duck year (I think its possible to have a new gm but no new Coaching staff lead by an interim JDR due to being late to the table with the ownership change) then they need to do everything in power to ensure that they get one of the top 2 picks in 2024. They will not be able to trade into that opportunity. I think they are far closer to that position than most people here would like to admit. A couple of fluky bounces go the other way (the drop vs the Jags, the drop vs the bears) and this team is eying a top 10 pick. 

Now I hate the stigma people attach to ""tanking"". Feel most people view it the wrong way. Im not talking about the coaches or players purposefully lose games but the FO can tactfully maneuver the roster in a way to have it be bad while preparing for the future. 

Here are some non crazy moves that can be made.

Payne Tag and Trade. I know some love him but paying 2 DTs in the 2020s is just not a good roster building maneuver. Its too much money into one position. 

Trade Sweat or Chase. I lean towards trading Sweat. Chase right now is still the face of the franchises future. For as good as Jon and Terry are they arent faces of franchise type of players. Also coupling with the comment for Payne. Paying both DEs in the 2020s isnt the smartest play. At this point Id lean to only keeping 2 of the 4. More money to spend on the offense and back 7 of the defense. Analytics continue to push that coverage is far more important that pass rush. 

Trade back in 2023 for as much capital as you can for 24. Thats an easy given. If you cant still attempt to move back and collect picks. Draft high end talents that requires some developing that you don't really count on in year 1. Unlike this past draft which was full of high floor guys that were drafted solely for their ability to contribute year one and not for their ceilings.

Players Im cutting or attempting to trade that has minimal chance of being here beyond year 1 of the new staff. Currently they are slated right now to have roughly 20 mil in cap before making a single move. Wentz Samuels Fuller Leno Roullier Norwell Lucas JD Mccain Gibson(Dont like resigning RBs. They rarely live up to value)

With these moves they get up to 100 mil in Cap space. They would have a tremendous slate for a quick turn around with a new staff. Front load some contracts of guys in need of resigning like Curl. 

We would be BAD in 2023. Zero QB. Zero Oline. The offense would be horrendous. We'd however have a fantastic draft pick. A boat load of cap space with rollovers. All with out losing really any of our youthful base. On offense you still have Terry and Dotson (Not super high on his ceiling but a fine player). On Defense you still have 4-5 legit building blocks for the defense in Chase JA Jamin BSJ Curl and possibly Forrest.  You luck into a Caleb or Drake Sweepstakes and this team could be in SB contention by 2025.",-5.0,commanders,t3_zro5tb,False,0.0,:GoldW:,2022-12-21T09:18:55Z,commanders,0.0112041732550726

Last night should have been a slam dunk sell out, especially with the metro running late. But nope, swathes of empty seats in the upper deck and a sea of blue on their side. Any other team would have sold out the stadium 2x and there'd only be pockets of away fans.

Not criticizing people for not going - lord knows there's plenty of reason not to at this stage, more a sympton of the problem that is the Snyder ownership. If we can't fill our place for a division game with play offs on the line then what the fuck are we doing at all?

TLDR: Snyder out and someone build a new stadium, ideally on the site of RFK.",2.0,commanders,t3_zpq1k4,False,0.0,:21:,2022-12-19T14:42:47Z,commanders,0.0542097612389395
