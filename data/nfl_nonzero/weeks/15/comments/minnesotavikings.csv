25055,155631,155631,VikingPain,"Baltimore won't let Lamar out of the building. They'll franchise tag him if they can't re-sign him.


What I'll do is give Kirk a two year extension to add-on to his one year next year and keep him here for another 3 years while lowering his cap hit. Kirk and KOC are really close and Kirk is playing the best ball of his career and is only 1 year into KOC's scheme (JJ also likes Kirk too).

But Kirk is also 34 right now. He's an Iron Man but I worry about the hits he takes and Father Time is Father Time. 

Matt Ryan, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, Big Ben, Eli Manning, Philip Rivers, and even Aaron Rodgers all fell off in play in their late 30s. Tom Brady is the exception, not the rule.


So going by that logic you need to protect yourself either now or next year by taking a QB (that they like) in the draft and giving that rookie the chance to learn under smart people like Kirk and KOC without the stress of having to start right away. Ideally, the rookie will sit behind Kirk for a good 3 years before he steps into the starting QB position.


Kirk will be 37-38 by then and if his play has fallen off, a transition would be a seamless one if either you let Kirk go or he retires. You don't want to screw up like the Saints and the Falcons and have no plan once their starters age out.



Best case scenario would be if someone like Anthony Richardson drops to us. You take him and bet on his raw physical talent and groom him for 3 years behind Kirk and KOC.",20.0,minnesotavikings,t3_zq0tt2,False,0.0,RETIRE #84!!!,2022-12-19T13:58:55Z,minnesotavikings,0.0340801465615156
