8049,56270,56270,Darkagent1,"Great question, unfortunately there isn't a great definite answer to this but I can give you a bunch of in generals.

So for football, the vast majority of under varsity games are played at 430 or 5 pm, there are very few games that begin at 4 pm anymore. So in general, there is very little time taken from work to referee. All other games occur on Friday nights (usually starting at 7 or 730) or Saturday (which if you work a job that requires Saturday work during the day then refereeing may not be a great option especially for college). These work fine with 8-5 work schedules. I personally know referees with a bunch of different jobs. Everything from accounting to software to airline crew.  The one thing that you do kinda need is flexibility. There are days you may need to take off at 330. In general that won't happen and in general you can get out of games that require you to do so but every situation is different.

The one super benefit of refereeing is it is completely voluntary. If you don't want to work on a day, you do not need to work that day. And no one will say anything about you taking it off (unless you are bailing on your crew for no reason or something). It's a hobby and it's understood as a hobby and life and job comes first. 

As for game checks, they can vary from 90 dollars for a JV game to 110-120$ for a varsity game with some mileage.

It always makes me laugh the accusations of fixing NFL games. The rules don't really allow for it and its way to complex to get everyone on board. Occam's razor here people. The simpler answer (that the rules are too complex and just don't say what they should say) is probably the correct one. 

Not to say the NFL is perfect in how its officiated and ruled. It most definitely is not and this rule is a great example of how even well officiated plays still end up with issues.

>A rushing defender is prohibited from committing such intimidating and punishing acts as “stuffing” a passer into the ground or unnecessarily wrestling or driving him down after the passer has thrown the ball, even if the rusher makes his initial contact with the passer within the one-step limitation provided for in (a) above. When tackling a passer who is in a defenseless posture (e.g., during or just after throwing a pass), a defensive player must not unnecessarily or violently throw him down or land on top of him with all or most of the defender’s weight.

This particular Sunday I had to go into work right before the Raiders/Charger game started and my office at the time was one exit up from where Qualcomm stadium was, would have to drive right past it.... So I'm stuck in the traffic for the stadium a bit on my way (expected) and I see all these police vehicles demarking a whole lane and I'm like well that is not normal. As I drive past 5 raiders fans in hand cuffs sitting on the side of the highway looking sad af lmao. They must have gotten into a road rage incident (maybe outstanding warrants, they're raiders fans). I wish so bad I was able to get a photo of it at the time but there wasn't really any time in the moment.

I thought it was really hilarious though that they couldn't even fucking make it to the stadium before being arrested.

I was also at a Chiefs/Chargers game the one year and a Broncos and Raiders fan got into a fight .

27622,179285,179285,ReallyFnCleverName,"Lots of people have this ""chiefs get the calls"" narrative and they prob haven't watched a game of ours all year. No on watching the Texans game could come away with anything other than a super one sided reffed game. It was right there with the Vikings game this week, both were atrociously one sided and refs had huge parts in both games. Better team won both games but they had to overcome so much more than they should have over and over again. 

We had a blown dead forward progress review, which has never happened before ever as far as I know (which decided a turnover that wasn't called on the field). Texans ended with like 5 or 6 first downs on 3rd down straight from penalties. Mahomes got swung by his neck on a sack and McKinnon got the people's elbow wayyy after he was tackled, both no flags. Our DBs were getting PI calls for literally just being near a receiver.. we had the one illegal contact against us when a Texans WR truck sticked one of our DBs lol

No way you can be a fan of the league and be okay with games that get called like this. Refs are terrible, I don't specifically think there is bias. I just think this league has a huge problem with consistency and refs understanding the actual rules of the game. Something needs to change as far as refs are concerned...
