Which we did because we didn’t do enough for Fields this off-season and we had no fourth so that was a desperation move to grab a skill position before the fifth. Another thing, if you knew next years FA market at WR was bad why not address that void this year. Either through FA or through an early draft pick? They spent like 10 million dollars on a WR room and that error cost them the 33rd pick this year. Braxton Jones has been a surprise. Still not sure if he’s starting cause he earned it or our if desperation. He needs competition next year. Gills been good for the most part.

So of the 20 Million guranteed, lets say 15 had to be fronted to a trust to meet that amortization schedule. That would be on Mark's accounting for next 4 years regardless if he was traded right this second. Which could not be an incentive to trade as he is strapped for cash in a loss of a great WR. 

 A perfect example of this is ARod was on Rangers books until I believe 2015, a full 12 years after traded to Yankees due to guarantees. MLB and NFL do share some of those practices. 

Which means IF the Bears acquired him this second. They are only responsible for the salary impact unless Poles and the McCaskey's decided to restructure.

2025: 44 mil

2026 44 mil

To the cap space, yes it does grow every year however that is 1/5ish of the cap space in 2025 also that is when Fields would be up from his rookie deal which would possibly be also a 40 mil impact to cap if things stay they way they are assuming not extended during 4th year in 2024. Tying up \~40% of cap space on two players is never worth it.

 Also, with the Bears wanting to move to Arlington park, tax breaks or not there is cash the McCaskey's have to front for that as well.

This one was never true. It was just one of those lame hot tales that came out predraft, similar to those questions about his work ethic that were bogus. Anyone who actually watches him would know he is good on his reads.

Again, look at who he’s throwing to. His completion percentage and yards per attempt are good, but you can’t get volume when your WR1 is Byron Pringle.

Literally every single position on the Pats outside of QB is better than the bears. You really have no clue how bad the bears are if you think it’s even close.

OC will probably try to limit QB run calls (shoulder), so dont expect rushing attempts/scrambles that he had just 4 or so weeks ago. But, hes obviously still going to run the ball. Hes alot faster on turf and the game in DET is inside. He will do much better than against BUF in freezing cold, which made him slower.

Wilson has a distinct ability and style, in part based on his physical gifts and limitations.

On top of that, age is beginning to catch up with some of his quicks that enabled him to extend plays to ridiculous lengths in Seattle.

On the other hand, the Broncos OL is an injury-riddled over-matched unit, the Broncos WRs are talented but are at best less experienced with Wilson and at worst just not the same fit as DK and Lockett, all while there is very little institutional or coaching experience on the team now when it comes to dealing with these kinds of tough situations.

Failure to adapt to changing circumstances is the surest way to massive underperformance, and much of that would normally be coming from the coaching staff. 

The entire offensive scheme is also kind of bad, and even if implemented in a better way would still be a bad fit for the QB they paid hundreds of millions to, and their talent strengths.
