Watt is definitely a HOF'r but Campbell was one of the best ever at his position without a doubt as well, Moon broke some serious (artificial, but important, and it's important to note that there are others who also helped bust those both before and after, but I think it's fair to say  Moon was a catalyst here) barriers and is a legit HOF QB.   JJ is great, but it is definitely arguable that Houston has had others who were better, even disregarding other sports.

JJ is has had an amazing career, but I also think he is humble enough to still realize that he walks in the path of giants.  I  suspect that's part of the reason he worked  so hard to get where he has ended up.

No huddle all game isn’t plausible, I agree. But you can certainly run it a few drives each half in key moments. Maybe it’s to get to mid field. Maybe it’s when you get to mid field. Maybe it’s when Brady gets a unit he likes the matchups on.

9404,63427,63427,ImDeputyDurland,"The biggest point I make in our stalled offense is that our o-line is too hurt to adequately protect Brady. That’s the biggest reason our offense isn’t what it was the past 2 years. Our offense legitimately can’t function enough to let routes develop. There’s no scenario, even with perfect coaching, that this offense is top 5 in the league again. Not with this line protecting Brady. At least IMO. 

Now where coaching comes in. Basic ways to minimize that O-line being bad

1. Play action. It makes the defense honest and rushers need that fraction of a second to figure out whether to tackle the RB or rush Brady. Brady sometimes only needs a fraction of a second, so our offense looks better. 

2. Pre-snap motion. This allows Brady to figure out almost exactly what the defense is doing so he can place his throws better and release them earlier. 

3. No huddle. Get a matchup you like and keep the pace going. It takes more energy to rush a QB than to block for one. Keeping the tempo fast tires out the defense and prevents substitutions. Allowing the Line to be better equipped to hide the fact that they’re not very good. 

Also all of these things helps out the run game because a good pass game sets up the run. 

We’re a bottom 5-10 offense right now. Doing what we do best would make us a middle of the pack offense. Which is legitimately all we need to make a run at a super bowl.

>	Privately, Allen and Gruden appeared to have few boundaries in expressing homophobic and transphobic language. In one email from 2015 that includes Droste, McVay and others, Gruden crudely asked Allen to tell Bryan Glazer, whose family owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers where Gruden coached until 2008, to perform oral sex on him. Allen said Glazer would “take you up on that offer.”

Then, After the that was published, Gruden was [removed from the Ring of Honor](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/13/sport/jon-gruden-buccaneer-ring-of-honor-spt-intl/index.html)

Rams: Last minute drive after playing like shit all game

Yeah, sure the games against the 7-8 Packers, 7-8 Steelers, and 6-9 Browns were also all down to the last drive more or less.

But they shouldn't have. Aside from the Packers (who played bad most of the season) we should've controlled Steelers and Browns and it shouldn't have been down to one last drive.

Ravens was the only game where we should've won if we were composed out of the Ls. We played ok against Packers too. 

Only 2 good performances in those Ls in my mind.

I don't watch much college, and even though this was just 3-4 years ago... the hype for Tua was UNREAL.

It was ""oh, if we get Tua we'll become a great franchise for the next decade!""

Teams went hard years in advance trying to get Tua cause he's supposed to be the next big thing. He was supposed to be..what Josh Allen and Mahomes are right now, for example in lack of a better term...

And then...he got injured. Not too massively but..he had an injury.

So this guy went from ""HOLY SHIT WE WOULD GIVE EVERYTHING TO GET"" to.. ""Eh.. i guess he aight, idk""

?????

From ""guaranteed #1 pick"" he dropped as if the media never hyped him up that much.

Miami tanked and tried too hard to get him...and then he got injured. And  then Fitzpatrick did Fitzpatrick things and ended the dynasty of Brady and Patriots. So they fell down the draft order...........and they still somehow got Tua lol.

And then....people just..didn't care about him..and kinda wrote him off???


This is a long message and I am sorry for it. I wanted to even make a thread about this for a while.

I don't get it. There should be something named after Tua like..idk some ""Tua Tagovailoa Term"" that exposes narratives in media.

In a 500 days he went from:

""NEXT BIG SUPERSTAR!!"" to ""EH, HIS CAREER IS PROBABLY FINISHED, INJURIES SUCK"" to ""GREAT GET FOR DOLPHINS AT THAT DRAFT SPOT"" to ""EH, [flop] 2.0, NOTHING SPECIAL, HE SUCKS"" to ""TUA IS LEGIT DOLPHINS ARE GREAT!""

The answer is when we are desperate and down, we let Brady call his own plays in no huddle and we move the ball. It's not a coincidence when we run no huddle, we are getting chunk plays and even the shotgun draws we run get us yards. It's situational awareness and I don't think Leftwich understands that, or Bowles if he is telling Byron he wants more power running. We aren't built for that.

Plus, Evans isn't getting targets because the type of routs he runs. Weeks ago he said he's been running more go routes. If our OL sucks and can't protect Brady beyond 2 seconds, then a GOOD offensive coordinator will have Evans run shorts routes. But we keep Evans running longer developing routes and if Brady is able to target him, he is rushing the throw while being hit and it is leading to picks. I'm tired of seeing Bucs fans saying that Brady is washed, doesn't understand how to make reads, or is being a liability in the offense.
