Lol this is funny. I get told to stop sucking his dick in a DM at least once a month.  Is Kellen going to be named HEAD COACH of the Cowboys?

>so you think Murray is that much better than Dak? Or are you implying that Moore could get to AZ, then trade Murray to some gullible team and then he could draft a QB? Because I’ve watched more than a few AZ games and Murray is a hot mess. At his best he might be up there with Dak but generally speaking he doesn’t play at that level for long. Not to mention his meltdowns and piss-poor attitude.

So much to unpack here. Murray isn’t flawless but his pre injury athleticism and arm talent are elite. He’s been successful despite his coach/coordinator and with a more talented staff behind him I think he’ll be successful.

They also strengthen bonds with the teams management if they stay on the same team, and could possibly get another job as a non-player if they’re lucky.

I don’t care about the Broncos, so I don’t know how they’re using him, but they don’t have a DLaw, Micah Parson, etc. on their defense do they? I know they have a good defense, very highly ranked, but isn’t it because they play good team ball, and not one player is just monumentally better than everyone else on the field?

I never had anything against the guy, and respect the fact that he went out and got paid with a contract he liked better, but I do find it painfully ironic that he chased the money, and his career will now be shorter because of it. Pretty sure the only reason people don’t talk about how bad of a signing he was is that he has Russell on his team. Also ironic because I bet he thought he was going to a contender.

In another sense I also like to think that all teams have a certain karma for a set number of plays where these set number of played will go for and against them. Philly just had that good karma go for them early on, on the pick-six. Sure there were other good ones, but the pick was one of those “karma” plays. (I hope all that makes sense, as it’s a little confusing and I’m not sure I explained it properly). 

Finally, Josh Sweat also just made a stupid good play. Usually you expect the ball to be batted down in the situation, but Sweat had the athletic ability and hand catching ability to just grab it and take it in for a score, so that was impressive to see.

I have a pure red coffee cup in hand this morning, no christian imagery in sight. It's coffee, not cocoa. Cocoa is the drink of the enemy. I saw that my neighbor put out a nativity scene, so I brought out the heavy guns....a light up sign that says ""happy holidays"" pointed towards their home. That should deter them for a week.
