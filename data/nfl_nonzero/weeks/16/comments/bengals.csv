Start with going to Nashville on a complete whim with my girlfriend to watch the Bengals play Tennessee in the divisional round. I‚Äôd never seen a Bengals playoff game live at that point in my life. Also wasn‚Äôt very sure we‚Äôd beat the number one seed in their house with the defense they had and Henry coming back. But I was still excited to go. None the less my GF and I drove 10 hours to Nashville from VB and watched one of the wildest playoff games that never gets talked about and froze my ass completely off. I‚Äôll never forget the whole trip as long as I live

Second would be Seeing the Thursday night game this year live. With the exception of Tua getting hurt, I truly enjoyed that Cincinnati experience. We took our friend who‚Äôd never been to a live football game before and saw her have this moment of like ‚ÄúI get it, I see why he loves this so much‚Äù sharing these things with friends and family is such a joy.

Beating the chiefs to go to the Super Bowl. I absolutely couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd see a Super Bowl Bengals team in my life but it happened. One of my best friends from the military passed in 21, and we first bonded over being Ohio boys and fans of the Bengals. So that made it all the more special. 

Finally going to Tampa a couple weeks ago. The game was wild to watch but it was crazy to feel the level of respect that Bucs fans had for our team. For the first time in my life as an opposing fan, I felt like people looked at us the same way I used to look at the patriots or packers or Steelers. Like fuck I don‚Äôt wanna play these guys.
