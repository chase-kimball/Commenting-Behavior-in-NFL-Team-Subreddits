*You're* being fooled by Eli here. Eli is relaying, at it's simplest, what the coach calling plays relays. The point of the segment is to show the complexity of these playcalls as they're brought up in the huddle. It's been a common insightful segment over the years within NFL media ([NFL Films](https://youtu.be/GKVteUGl-dE) [Broadcasts](https://youtu.be/-br0bBFdxyU), etc) especially as offenses evolved. Most of the time the playcaller will call out the full play. Because you might notice that the playcaller's sheet usually has a lot more depth to it than a QB wristband.

You'll see when Taysom checks in at QB, Andy will look at his wristband and relay something quick to Taysom (likely a number), and Taysom will read the full play once he's in the huddle. That's an instance where Pete would likely call a play number and not the full play.

You can check any QB mic'd up and not one will say ""hey guys it's play 57"". That doesn't mean shit to anyone without a wristband.

> at millions per year your ass best know play 57 and all others

Wristbands change every week. Play 57 today won't necessarily be 57 next week, but Right Flip Zebra Scat will remain Right Flip Zebra Scat week to week. It's a lot easier to learn the lingo once then to learn which play corresponds to what number each week.

This is the audibled play when the QB sees something they don't like from the defense. Most QBs will say something like ""kill kill"" which let's the offense know to switch to this play.

Have we underperformed relative to our talent this season? Yes. Have there been game we look unprepared or flat? Yes. Have there been games where we shoot ourselves in the foot and it costs us the game? Yes.

That said, the past 6 weeks we've looked like a competitive team in each game. The 49ers game was the only one over that stretch where it didn't feel like we controlled the flow of the game. The defense, despite missing Pete Werner, who was having a Pro Bowl caliber year pre-injury and Marshon Lattimore, a top 10 CB when healthy, has been overall solid over this stretch, giving up no more than 20 points a game.

I think the offense is sorely missing 1) more playmakers besides Taysom and AK 2) some creativity in the scheme. Last in the league in presnap motions. Last in the league in attempted screens. We're still moving the ball but I think there's another level of play were capable of.

The first half of the season we were very undisciplined. DA's coaching decisions have been very conservative. For the first couple months it seemed the offense and defense could never find success at the same time. Not to mention we've been decimated by injuries for a second year in a row. But the past 5 games we've cut down on penalties overall (still some bad ones), starting to at least keep the turnover battle even, and our offense is putting together sustainable drives while the defense is doing an overall good job of shutting things down.

He doesn't appear to be losing the locker room, the team is steadily showing growth. He's put together a defense that's been reliable for years.

- If this team can win without All-Pro Cesar Ruiz, then it can win anything.

- Taysom and Kamara are our offense. Andy is managing perfectly fine.

- Man, if we could get consistent tackling from our run defense then this unit (even while banged up) can keep us in anything.

- Not a whole lot to add here. Overall solid if unspectacular game. Refs made it scary at the end but ball don't lie. Still alive.

- I am a fan of bird teams not from Atlanta the rest of the weekend.

- Dang it sucks to see a once-promising young QB look so rough out there. And by sucks I mean it feels like a classic Hallmark Christmas movie moment. Truly feeling the magic of the holiday season rn.

- Fuck the Falcons. Edit: They're officially eliminated from playoff contention. Another great day of football.

- We've scored exactly 3 points on offense without All-Pro Cesar Ruiz. Obviously the major element affecting this squad.

- Our list of injuries is starting to resemble a Christmas wishlist for every kid in America in length.

- Pete Carmichael is so frustrating because there's very little creatively presnap, and when there is something he abandons it/doesn't evolve it. His game sense is a massive step back from Payton, more than expected preseason.

- If we never see a pop pass from Kamara out of that direct snap, see the previous point.

- In the first quarter we tackled well. Second quarter it's like the Browns were covered in butter.

- Cam Jordan is still good.

- All I want for Christmas is a takeaway by our defense (and a Saints win).

- What I blame Dennis Allen for: poor discipline defensively. What I don't blame Dennis Allen for: plays called on offense, because I'm smart enough to know he doesn't call plays on offense.

- Guys, if watching this game is making you so miserable it's ruining your holiday then please for your sake, our sake, and your family's sake shut it off and go spend some time doing something you'll like.

So if AK is back there in shotgun on 3rd down, the defense will blitz early and often. AK will be forced to stay in and block and Dalton doesn't handle the blitz well or move well outside the pocket. If the Saints have Ingram in, the defense is less likely to blitz because Ingram is good at picking it up and would rather drop 7 into coverage to challenge Dalton to find an open man. Unfortunately, it often looks really stupid because you end up with Ingram catching a dump off out of the backfield when you would logically think AK should be the one out there catching that. It's not a designed dump off to Ingram - it's just what the defense gives Dalton. 

Defenses didn't do this to Brees because he was really good at reading blitzes and getting through his progressions remarkably quickly even under fire. Our OL was also a little better back then too. Defenses tended not to blitz Brees and instead played him soft to minimize damage. That's how we ended up with the Slant Boy thing and Kamara looking like a receiving god out in the flats.

28185,265946,265946,shyguyJ,"Not really purgatory at all, unless we decide to keep trying to plug the holes on a sinking ship.  

There is a very simple - not easy or quick (and by no means guaranteed), but *simple* - path back to being competitive. But it means letting the ship sink, and then taking the time and steps to build a new one (I'm running out of steam on the ""ship"" analogy...).  

Basically, we need dispel any ideas of ""retooling"" or ""revamping"", and embrace an actual, full-on, meticulously thought out rebuild.

However, if a rebuild doesn't happen, a small critique of your list: lack of weapons on offense is not accurate.  Lack of a left side of an offensive line is MUCH more glaring.",4.0,nfl,t3_zxg2ym,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2022-12-28T13:43:53Z,saints,-0.1270546810699588
28186,265949,265949,shyguyJ,"Oh yea, I don't mean ""actively"" tank.  Loomis helped create the current situation.  He can stay and help fix it, or he can ride off into his Pelicans sunset.  Any new GM would theoretically need to display competence, which SHOULD include a plan to rebuild the team. Loomis or the new GM should not be ""on the hook"", so to speak, for the rebuilding process.

Dennis Allen is under contract.  Unless he pulls a Payton, he is here next year.  If he learns how to not be a completely overwhelmed, overmatched, ""keep doing what you're doing"" shitbird and actually connect with and command the respect of his players by the end of next year, great! Then he can stay on and steer the ship forward. If not, bye Felicia.

Players is a huge mixed bag.  Those under contract, well, they are under contract.  To those we want to resign or pursue in free agency, it should be obvious and made clear what the plans for the team are.  There should be no illusions or false sales pitches.  ""Look, we have some adversity ahead of us, but we have a plan to weather it, and we see you as part of that plan and as part of the path to winning again once we are through it.""

So yea, instead of ""actively tanking"", to me, it's more like, ""look, we are getting under the cap for 2024 no matter what, so these are the resources we have, and that's it. For better or worse, due to financial restrictions and our past decisions trying to win another one with Drew, you're all auditioning for your job in 2024. If you can make something magic happen, even better.""
