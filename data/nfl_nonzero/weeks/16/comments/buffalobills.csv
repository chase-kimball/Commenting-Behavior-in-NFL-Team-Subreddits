7849,46800,46800,Das_Man,"Bills fan here. First things first nerds: I love you all and I love your football team. Now that's out of the way, lets talk. Obviously most of the Bills focus is on Allen, but I think there are a few other players that will be key:

James Cook: Our RB2 is really starting to show some fire, and getting him involved in the run game will be huge in terms preventing Allen from having to play hero ball (which is powerful, but chaotic).

Matt ""Bane"" Milano: As Mike White can attest, Milano is the breaker of men, and he needs to have a truly massive game if the Bills have any hope of slowing down the run game and pressuring Burrow. 

Tre'Davius White: Our all-pro CB has been back for a few weeks after tearing his ACL last year, and he has understandably been a bit rusty. While his definitely heating up, he will need to be red hot on Monday, as the Bills' pass defense has been sus af lately. If he's not, there's a very strong chance Burrow will cut us apart.

26785,189590,189590,UberHansen,"You are right about the time of claiming but way more context is needed in this debate than you are providing.
 
 
Gabe Davis is significantly better than Isaiah Hodgins. The Bills were never going to play Hodgins over him (Or Diggs). If you honestly believe that Isaiah Hodgins is a better WR than Gabe Davis then there is very little reason to continue this discussion.
 
 
As for McKenzie there is a valid argument that he hasn't played well this season but that doesn't mean that Hodgins was his replacement. The Bills needed a slot that could sit in soft spots against zone and/or beat man quick off the line. Neither of those things does Hodgins excel in, he was never going to play slot for the Bills.
 
 
As for OBJ, the Bills were discussing adding him before the season even began. Struggle at WR was not the reason that discussion existed.
 
 
Further the cut of Hodgins coincided with the Tre White activation. The Bills needed room for White in order to avoid sticking him on IR again but knew they would simultaneously need to carry another DB to help ease him in due to his injury.
 
 
As for Special Teams, this isn't Madden you need aces in that facet of the game. The Bills have arguably the best coverage unit in the NFL specifically because they carry players like Taiwan Jones, Tyler Matakevich, Siran Neal, and Jake Kumerow (WR) when healthy. Those deep depth players don't see the field often enough to take up just a depth spot on the roster all but mandating they contribute on Special Teams.

26786,189591,189591,UberHansen,"He was lost in the depth of a talented WR core.
 
 
The Bills early season WR trio was Diggs & Davis with McKenzie/Crowder in the slot. This fit the Bills primary personell grouping (11) which allowed them to also have Knox & an RB on the Field.
 
 
That means that at best Hodgins was WR5 for the Bills, a position that MUST play Special Teams. The Bills gave Hodgins plenty of options on Special Teams in Preseason and he was flat out horrendous which is why Special Teams Ace, Jake Kumerow, earned the job over him.

But I beg any and all new fans of the Bills to watch Four Falls of Buffalo, the ESPN 30 for 30 on the early 90's Bills superbowl runs, which is available if you have Disney+ I know for sure, may also be available through ESPN+. I own it on Prime video.

I was born in '89 and grew up a Bills fan in Buffalo so seeing that film crystalize all the stories I'd heard about those teams was super special. And as a new fan I think you all will enjoy getting in touch with a little bit of the history and local culture that surround the team.

The identity of the Bills and Sabres, the City of Buffalo and Western New York at large are all deeply intertwined. You'd be hard pressed to walk around any town in WNY for more than five minutes without seeing a Bills flag or hat or shirt. We eat, sleep and breath it. 'Go Bills' is a common substitute for 'Hello' when passing a stranger on the street.
