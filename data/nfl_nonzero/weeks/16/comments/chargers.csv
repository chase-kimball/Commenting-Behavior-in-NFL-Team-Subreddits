Anyways, we were working on the extension for Gates(maybe Rivers, it was someone important) and Weddle's was going to be worked on after.

People blamed the shitty chargers organization but we had other players in the same boat who asked permission and were granted the ability to watch the half time show and were not punished.

The Chargers and their ownership were easy to dogpile on so it got twisted into the organization being the bad guys and Weddle being the poor man left out to dry.

Besides they played well vs the dolphins which is anything but a poor offensive opponent. And to then go against the Titans with Henry one week later, requiring a totally different gameplan, and actually limit him somewhat. Thats what good coaches do.

It helps weigh these common stat categories against each other and measures rate instead of volume  (completion% vs Y/A vs TD% vs INT%, which are just the rates of the most common volume stats). If you’re trying to compare base production rate, passer rating is a rudimentary way of doing that. 

Whose passing is more productive per attempt? QB with high Y/A and TD% vs QB with high comp% and low INT%? Passer rating will tell you! (According to its own arbitrary category weights biasing the results of course. How many yards is a TD worth on 25 attempts? You decide!)

It doesn’t take into account rushing stats, sacks, down and distance, depth of target, YAC, how good the coverage was, QB pressure, whether they made the correct read, how many dropped INTs, how ball placement affected the ability to run after the catch, basically all the elements that give you full context of what a QB did given all the possible variables in a single play. There are other stats that incorporate more context into them, but many of these things are difficult to quantify, so there isn’t a true all-encompassing formula for QBs. 

That’s where we end up with PFF scores who try to do it in a subjective manor and everyone hates PFF scores because of how inconsistent they seem to be at times.

I’ve been to enough games where I’m a fan of the visiting team to know that’s not the greatest idea, especially at a Raider game, that’s not the best idea. You already have a target on your back and being a little loud amplifies it. It sucks but unfortunately that’s the way it is. There was some light shit-talking between Jerry and the other fans throughout although nothing too crazy. And Jerry wasn’t being all that obnoxious…until towards the end of the 4th when the Pats took the lead to go up by a TD. Jerry yelled “Raider fans go home!”

As soon as I heard that I knew that would set some of these folk off, especially because it was late in the game and the booze was hitting people.

The lady and the people they were with, who were sitting directly to my right, then started yelling back at Jerry and getting in his face as was seen in the video.

He absolutely did not deserve it and I’m glad to see the public is on his side and the Karen is properly getting roasted. One thing I forgot to mention is earlier in the game I went to the bathroom and the Karen sat in my seat for some reason.
