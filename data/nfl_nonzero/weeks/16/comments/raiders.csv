I will add to the stirring. 

Derek Carr has brought on Raiders fans an era of hope. As fans we expect more a so it hurts more when we lose. I can say in 2006 it didn’t hurt to lose. In 2012 it didn’t hurt to lose. We expect more from the Raiders now and Derek is a big reason for that. 

The Raiders have a chance to make the playoffs in any year Derek remains healthy.

5. 2018 week 16 MNF against the Broncos. At the time we all assumed that was the last game in Oakland. Somebody brought a Silver & Black casket. Dwayne Harris ran it back and we controlled that game start to finish. People stole seats and tore signs off the walls. We smoked freely in the stands. People jumped on the field and got arrested lol. Everybody understood this was our last ride. [The vibe was unmatched.](https://twitter.com/Tulare_All_Day/status/1077720458403885056?t=oSsnf5OLmXF73_8DFqNf0Q&s=19) It definitely softened the blow in the 2019 loss to the Jags.

4. Charles Woodson 2 interceptions against Peyton Manning. All the talk was CW never picked off Peyton before this game. I guess it felt so nice he did it twice. To date Woodson is the only defensive player to win the Heisman. Would you believe he won it over Peyton Manning *and* Randy Moss?

3. 2016 win over reigning NFC Champs Carolina and prime Cam Newton. Mack's pick-6 happened in my endzone, he was amazing all game. That game was a dog fight both sides of the ball, both teams, all game. The most impressive throw of a football I've ever seen in person was the [88 yd bomb](https://youtu.be/1DT-JEsqzmo) Cam threw to Ted Ginn. It was jaw dropping. If you played or watched football in person it looked unnatural. He threw that ball off his back foot from the CAR 2 to the OAK 46 on a frozen fucking rope. That's 52 yards with no arc, maybe 12 feet off the ground.

2. 2017 TNF prime time win against KC where we damn near had to score 5x to get that W. Everybody remembers that game.

1. Charles Woodson's last game at the Coliseum, Christmas Eve 2015. My wife told me if I missed this game I'd never let it go so I left her and my kids to spend it with 50k+ of my extended family. The speech he made at the end... Just wow. In those last seconds of my life where it all flashes in front of my eyes that night will have a frame.

I am from the school of thought that it is the coaching that has brought last years playoff (plus DeVontae) team down this year and not the players abilities.  I watched as two of the leagues best route runners ran into each other.  I’m watched Carr hesitate to throw the ball this year as well as his ability to audible into plays he liked disappeared.

Even with this years stats I think Carr is better than 2/3 of the league and until someone suggesting we move on from him comes up with a better alternative, I think we fire McDingaling and his staff and rehire another coach and fill our gaps on the defensive side of the ball as well as depth on the offensive line.

Games where we should be running, like Saturday, we go pass-heavy. Games where the pass is working, like the Rams game, we keep trying to run it with little success. On Saturday the Steelers and their elite d-line kep pressuring Carr in the 2nd half, so what do we do? We run a play where we move Jacobs out wide and Carr in an empty set. Once I saw that I knew he was going to get sacked, and of course he did. 

Even the defensive play-calling is incredibly bad. We didn't even go prevent defense on Baker's final drive in the Rams game.
