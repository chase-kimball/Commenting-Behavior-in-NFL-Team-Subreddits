With the shape of our roster, I'd like to see a trade back personally, but only if it keeps us in the top 5 or comes with a likely high first and second next year (gotta be ready for that trade back up next year ;-p ). If we do use the pick though I'd like us to grab Jalen Carter. Interior pass rush is premium, and he would be an immediate boost to our run defense.  Will Anderson might possibly be generically a better prospect, but it feels like A) every year has a generational EDGE guy, and B) this year specifically we are in a good spot to also end up with a very good EDGE rusher if we start with Jalen Carter and choose to grab one while the opposite isn't true.

22636,176883,176883,bingmyname,I understand why he does them and it's usually to get a better angle on his throws especially if a defender is charging at him.

22637,176884,176884,bingmyname,"There will, in most cases, more than likely be a QB in the class you're ready to draft one. Even if you don't love the prospect, the good thing about having the actual architecture to develop one is that you can mask his weaknesses much easier instead of expecting him to elevate a bad team. And having an architecture doesn't even necessarily mean that you have a fully built team. It just means that you have stability in the front office and a coaching staff you're sure about while having either a good line or good weapons and even better if both. That's an appropriate situation to bring in a rookie that you're not in love with- otherwise you're setting him up for failure. If you believe he can transcend all of that he's probably Patrick Mahomes. If you think you can get a structure in that same year, you're inherently gambling. That's fine to me if you LOVE the prospect otherwise you're asking to get hurt. Having those extra picks gives you a bevy of moves you can make, so continually taking risk isn't the smartest thing to do. That would just be wasting the pick. Texans fans are just impatient and don't want to watch an actual rebuild all for it to fall apart, and I understand that. But you have to maneuver this situation properly whether fans like it or not.   
 
And lastly, there are enough sustainable options out there. Mills already gives you a high floor in your QB room, especially if he takes steps forward from being so raw in throwing the ball. But even if you don't like that, you can get Jimmy G, perhaps Sam Darnold or anyone who can operate this offense sufficiently until you've established an appropriate structure. That shouldn't take more than a year if you get your drafting and coaching hires right. I didn't say you had to build a full team first.",4.0,texans,t3_zvnp7t,False,0.0,:H-Town-Cal:,2022-12-27T00:05:04Z,texans,-0.0001373096270509

22645,176893,176893,bingmyname,"There's no one size fits all formula. Caserio needs to maneuver this off season carefully though. He's got a lot of options so I don't ever agree when people say he HAS to get a QB or anything of that sort. The best bet is to go bit by bit with this. First figure out what you want to do with the coaching staff. Then when you make your decision you evaluate the team and the draft of prospects and talk it over with your coach and scouts and develop your draft board and strategy, just like they do every year. If you like the QB at the spot you're selecting or want to trade to a different spot to select him and can do it, then by all means go ahead. If they want to skip the QB class this year then just bring in a vet to compete for the starting job with Mills. Get talent on this team no matter what. That's the objective. If you do take a QB then you have to get him a good environment. You're already risking it taking a QB because you don't have any infrastructure to support him so you're effecting gambling that it'll all work out and they'll grow together. So in order to do that you really should LOVE the QB you're taking. Otherwise you don't need to rush it. Trade down or take one of the elite defensive prospects.
