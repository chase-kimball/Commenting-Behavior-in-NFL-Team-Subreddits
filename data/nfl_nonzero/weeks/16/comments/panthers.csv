Well, that's a red flag on them when looking at an aging QB with a style that befits a young QB.

I'd argue that both front offices didn't pay attention to the dirty details and instead got distracted by the dream, rather than looking at reality.

What I think this is, rather than a statistic, is an indictment on what the decision makers see and do. Let me take a small side tangent for a second that will help me make my case.

In the news recently has been the bankruptcy of FTX and apparent massive fraud committed by Sam Bankman-Fried and others. One person who, *to this day*, defends SBF is Kevin O'Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful from the TV show Shark Tank.

He was asked when he originally invested if he did his due diligence. He said that yes, he did. Pressed on it, he essentially asked his buddies who were other money guys if they trusted him. And pressed further he said he didn't need to see numbers, he could get SBF on the phone to talk personally.

That's a paragraph of him saying ""No, I didn't do my due diligence but I'm better than that. I've got something better than that."" No, he doesn't. It is and was all bullshit.

Same thing with how NFL decision makers make choices. Wilson was PRESSED by the NFL media to be a Top 3 pick. It was the conventional wisdom of the day. The Jets had to see all of the media and think, ""Well goddamn, people are freaking out about this guy, he's gonna be the truth!"" That's 80% of their due diligence right there.

The other 20% came from reviewing [scouting reports like this](https://walterfootball.com/scoutingreport2021ZWilson.php).

Let me save you from having to click on the link.

The scout gives upsides and downsides. The upsides are a massive bullet point list. I'm not going to post the entire list of positives because there's like 30 bullet points and this post is long enough already. But to give you a sampling:

* Powerful right arm
* Can make all the throws in the NFL
* Pushes the ball downfield
* Accurate passer
* Can throw a hard fastball into tight windows
* Good deep-ball accuracy
* Throws a pretty deep ball

But then there's the negative, and it's more on the field stuff. The telling bit is in the summary. And here, it's spelled out, clearly, that he's an asshole. It's notable that this was told to the scout. It wasn't something he found out first-hand.

>In speaking to a director of college scouting from a NFC team that is in the market for a new quarterback, they outlined the makeup concerns with Wilson:  
>  
>""Johnny Manziel comp without the \[drugs\]. \[Wilson\] is fun to watch, but is he a 1-year flash in the pan? He's a backyard baller who is fun to watch.  
>  
>""Someone will grab him in the first. I doubt he gets to the second, because once the third quarterback goes after Lawrence and Fields, there will be a run on them. \[Wilson\] has character concern, rich kid who is an entitled brat -uncle owns Jet Blue -, parents are a pain, not a leader, selfish, and he's a know-it-all.

Any decision maker with critical-thinking skills that outweigh his ability to be influenced by the NFL media would know, right there, that this isn't the man for the job.

I don't think this is something that gets chalked up to statistics. This is something that points to the decision maker making a bad decision.",2.0,panthers,t3_zt5y6r,False,0.0,Roaring Riot,2022-12-23T07:34:47Z,panthers,-0.0129074177210825

The NFL Shield is correct while the Chinese fakes use the plain white shields, plus in every fake, they are too cheap or lazy to stitch it well where the thread follows the outline of the shield instead of just making a lazy pass over it.
