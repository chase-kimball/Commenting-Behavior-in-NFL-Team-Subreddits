You’re 7-8 right now and Geno has regressed already. Hell, Russ put up more points against the chiefs than Geno did. Hate to break it to you but you’re already living in the mediocrity. Also I’ll bring this up anytime I can: your front office tried to trade Russ to the BROWNS in 2018. They tried to send him to QB purgatory. He put in a no trade clause in his contract after that. So, in reality, your front office wanted to move on from him before he wanted to leave. Oh but he was vague about wanting to leave/stay before leaving? (Which maximized his trade value btw) what a sin. Also half the people that have hated on him after are from people who have major character concerns themselves (Richard Sherman is obvious but Earl Thomas got kicked off the Ravens for being a shit teammate) he’s also still good friends with DK and Lockett, so clearly everyone there didn’t hate him. I honestly feel bad for y’all that you’ve been media narratived into hating the best QB you’ve ever had.

“Not only will Miller, a 2017 Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree, be rehabbing his knee with the expectations of returning to the field for the start of the 2023 campaign, but he’ll be spending his newly found free time shadowing Bills general manager Brandon Beane.

Miller, 33, has previously expressed interest in becoming an NFL GM after he retires, going from the gridiron to the front office like former standouts John Elway (Broncos) and John Lynch (San Francisco 49ers).

“I know what great teams look like,” the two-time Super Bowl champion says. “I know what Super Bowl teams are made of, not only from a player standpoint or coaching standpoint but what the strength and conditioning coaches look like, what the janitors look like, the cafeteria workers. I know what the food’s supposed to be like.

“I’ve been familiar with great teams and I’ve been around great teams. Becoming a GM and being a front office executive gives me the opportunity to still stay connected to the game that I love so much.””
