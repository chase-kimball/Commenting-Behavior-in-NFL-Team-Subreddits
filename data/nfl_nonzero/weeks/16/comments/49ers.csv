No disrespect intended to the Eagles — they probably don’t deserve to drop a spot when they just almost beat Dallas with their backup quarterback. But given that the Niners have looked more or less as dominant as the Eagles have over the last 2 months, I feel like we should be close enough where there’s at least a solid argument for either being #1 (along with some top AFC teams potentially as well).

If you’re looking at records, the Niners had a poor start to the season, but it has now been 2 months since the last time we lost — and not to mention that exactly coincides with when CMC became starter, which justifies weighing our recent success more (e.g. it’s a different team with him from what we were in the first 7 games, and that’s without even bringing up the injuries we had early).

Case in point is [this chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/zw4c12/offensedefense_epa_through_second_half_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) (courtesy of u/wallstreetriversyum), which puts the Niners in a tier above even the other elite teams in terms of aggregated offensive/defensive performance. I don’t think the Niners are far above everyone else or anything, but it’s hard to ignore what we’ve been doing over the last 8 weeks (though I will say that Hanzus has always been higher on the Niners than other rankers so this is also his bias / tendencies showing a little bit).

Overall it’s hardly an overreaction to drop the Eagles just one spot for a team whose current win streak has now matched Philadelphia’s undefeated torrid start.

Before you bring up Seattle, I would say that they got hotter near the end of the season and had not yet reached their peak when we beat them in week 7 — and then of course when we played them near the end, we got walloped 42-13.

On the other hand, the 2019 team had to contend with a still good-not-great Seattle team and the presence of two other NFC superpowers. Green Bay and New Orleans both also went 13-3 that year — we crushed Green Bay in both games and scored an epic win over New Orleans. The Ravens were also a juggernaut that year (14-2), and we barely lost to them on a last second field goal.

The 2012 Ravens got hot on their run to the Super Bowl, but the 2019 Niners had to contend with the Chiefs who have been borderline dynastic with their run in the last half decade.

If the ball bounced off only Tatum, or if it bounced off both Fuqua and Tatum (in any order), then the reception was legal. The rule stated in the pertinent part that if an offensive player touches a pass first, he is the only offensive player eligible to catch the pass.

It seems way more plausible that Tatum, who was running upwards directly against the direction of the ball, would’ve caused Bradshaw’s pass to ricochet backwards so much.

I think the better argument for Oakland is that the ball touched the ground — there’s really no way to tell though since there’s no good camera angle.

We told Tom Brady no, because at that point of time, coming off a Super Bowl appearance, whereas Tom had come off of a Wild Card round exit with him playing poorly, there's just no way you get rid of Jimmy for Tom. Hindsight is 2020, but Tom would have changed the system, no guarantee he even gets along with Shanahan, and most teams probably thought they were getting 2022 Tom Brady, not the one who played in 2020.

You don't know Jimmy G, he isn't Aaron Rodgers who would throw a passive aggressive fit after his replacement is drafted. You are basically faulting the 49ers for having Trey Lance as the starter and ""lucking"" into Jimmy G being the backup. 

Why not criticize the Chiefs in 2018? They got rid of established veteran Alex Smith for a talented but unrefined starter in Patrick Mahomes who also did not play all but 1 game in 2017. He had an all-time 2018, but if Mahomes got hurt in 2018, and thus the Chiefs had to use their back up (Henne I think) their season would be over. 95% of the teams in the NFL would have their seasons ended if their starting QB was out for the season, so it is odd of you to say the 49ers mismanaged the situation when they are part of the 5% of teams who was able to move past not 1 but 2 QBs getting hurt.",1.0,nfl,t3_zwauvk,False,0.0,:49ers: 49ers,2022-12-27T14:27:54Z,49ers,-0.0738024023497231

So if the point is that the strength of schedule isnt very strong, including teams (within the same division) who *also* dont have a very strong SOS could potentially inflate or mislead the overall SOS. 

As we both know, SOS doesnt tell the full story, but it is relevant when were talking about whats potentially the ""best"" team in the NFL.

The Eagles have faced maybe ONE opponent that had at least 2 of one of these things: a top 10 QB, a top 5 offense, a top 5 defense. 

And the only team I can think of is the Cowboys who meet that criteria, but even then theyre in the same boat as the Eagles because they both have statistically easy schedules. 

The combined record of the teams theyve faced (outside their own division) is: 60-88-2. The only team theyve faced thats above .500 is the Vikings, outside their own division (who I didnt include, because their schedules are almost exactly the same). 

Just to add, if I applied that to us, the record of teams weve faced outside our own division is: 67-82-1, which really isnt all that different. But the difference is that most of the key parts of this team are *still young*, and are from that 2019 team where we were beating all sorts of good teams, even last years team over achiveved a bit and this was all BEFORE adding an all-pro RB to shannys scheme.

Youre dead wrong on the ceiling thing being ""irrelevant"" though since ceiling plays are typically what wins rings anyway.

Hopkins gets banned for a good chunk of the season, Hollywood Brown isn't enough to carry an offense, the playcaller doesn't take as much advantage as he should of their star RB, and suddenly the offense is abysmal.
