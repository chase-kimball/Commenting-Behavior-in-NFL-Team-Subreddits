Good call on this one. You‚Äôre right this was a bad throw. But this and the actual interception are the only throws I can recall that were sketchy. 


‚ÄúThere were at least 2 others, I remember at game speed, that could have been picks, one hit the back of the LB's helmet (maybe in double coverage) Right side.‚Äù

The helmet one you refer to hit the back of the defenders helmet. Which is why it wasn‚Äôt a risky throw, it was actually a smart play. The defender had his back completely turned to Watson so he wouldn‚Äôt have had an opportunity to intercept it. Maybe a PBU if he gets his hips turned around fast enough but there‚Äôs no way he catches it. The issue on that throw was ball placement, he made a good read. 


‚ÄúI think everyone should look better this week in better weather, after all the pressure to win has been removed.  I assume 37 attempts minimum.‚Äù

Where are you getting these numbers from? Is 37 just some archaic number you pulled out of your ass? There is no magic number for pass attempts. It‚Äôs all about balance and following the flow of the game. This is how teams lose. They walk in with a predetermined number like 37 and don‚Äôt adjust when they need to. Throwing the ball 37 times just to throw the ball 37 times is dumb af. 


‚ÄúI already read all the articles about Watson‚Äôs private quarterback coach being his BFF and going on a 45 day vacation together. So I know how demanding that coach is on Deshaun.

I read the whole article and there‚Äôs not a single line there to support your view. You‚Äôre saying that because he‚Äôs friends with this guy he must not have a very strict routine? It would be more alarming if they *weren‚Äôt* friends after spending that much time together. This is the same QB coach he had from high school, through college, and now the pros. The same guy that helped him develop into one of the hottest high school recruits in the nation, the same guy that helped him keep his fundamentals in tact during a National Championship winning season, the same guy that helped develop him into a first round draft pick. The same guy that helped him become an instant star in the NFL and helped him during a potential MVP season were it not for injuries. But because they‚Äôre ‚Äúfriends‚Äù all that means nothing and he must be coasting? That‚Äôs fucking stupid. He didn‚Äôt coast his way to all those accolades, he worked really hard and a major component to that success was his QB coach.

5312,34361,34361,DangoAteYourBaby,"‚ÄúYou're allowed to Disagree, I  agree with about half of what you've said above from my perspective and probably 75% in principle. I'm a little bit frosty that Watson wasn't more polished in his fundamentals upon return, while supposedly working with his personal QB coach supposedly 4 day's a week throughout his suspension. Like i said, it's not the game speed that appears to be his main issue thus far.‚Äù

To me this just shows that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick either I just don‚Äôt know how else to word it. 

Why do you think it‚Äôs so hard to play QB in the NFL? Why all these guys coming out of college look amazing on their pro day when they are throwing against air but suck ass when they play their first NFL game? It‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt in a live game at their pro day. There‚Äôs no 300lbs nose tackle headed for their grill. It‚Äôs not like they all just suddenly forgot their footwork. In a live game situation your fundamentals will fall apart. Everything is rushed. EVERYTHING. So it shouldn‚Äôt have been surprising that he needed a few games to get back in rhythm. In a live game fundamentals are the first thing to fall apart. That and making the correct reads, going through progressions, etc. But the game is starting to slow down for him again, you can see that because his fundamentals are getting back to normal and his decision making has been much improved. 


‚ÄúIt's my opinion that Watson did she same thing Baker did his whole tenure here. Cockily rely on his amazing God given talents vs training the fundamentals necessary to achieve the highest levels in the NFL.  Everyone in the NFL except Demetric Felton, Tommy Togiai & Harrison Bryant is a next level athlete.‚Äù

And this opinion is wrong and based on ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù rather than actual documented evidence that he has done everything he could to stay in shape. If you wanna ignore all the reports about how hard he‚Äôs been training and believe that all these people are lying then that‚Äôs on you, but you‚Äôre wrong and making an assumption based on a gut feeling or whatever. But by all accounts from people close to the Browns, the people that would actually know, he‚Äôs done everything possible to keep up with the team. He studied the playbook on his time off, that‚Äôs obvious to anyone paying attention because he‚Äôs been consistently making the right reads which shows he understands the offense. You don‚Äôt make those reads at the level he‚Äôs making them if you didn‚Äôt work on it. He threw with college guys when he wasn‚Äôt allowed near the building, which is really his only option in that situation. And he continued to work with his QB coach. He did everything he could do given the circumstances. 


‚ÄúThis is the Cleveland Browns. I'm not saying we're cursed, but if curses exist... Well, I would like to hear arguments we aren't, in that instance.‚Äù

Hard to disagree here, but I think it‚Äôs more the refs hate us and less voodoo curse. 

‚ÄúWe need our players to be taking this shit seriously. We are often not just vs our opponent, but also the recipient of horrible calls at times, because the refs have no respect for our franchise and don't treat us as equals. AKA the cards are stacked against us more often than not.‚Äù

What makes you think they aren‚Äôt taking it seriously? By all accounts everyone shows up to practice and works their ass off and when they don‚Äôt they are reprimanded (see Winfrey)


‚ÄúAgain, our receivers dropped some catchable balls, but so did the defenders. At least 2 could have been picked by my count.‚Äù

Show me the plays where the defenders dropped balls. This is not the case. 


‚ÄúWatson has to take this more seriously than Baker & I can't imagine Watson having more motivation to prove everyone wrong, on the field.‚Äù

This is the same point you made earlier, what are you basing this opinion on? Because the objective facts indicate he worked really hard to come back in good shape.

5314,34363,34363,DangoAteYourBaby,"‚ÄúI'm not saying he's washed, and I've seen very few competent posters here say that. I'm saying plainly Watson appears to me to have been slacking vs training hard, because his issues don't appear as much as game speed, but as throwing rust.‚Äù

My bad, I misunderstood you and thought you were saying he‚Äôs washed, I shouldn‚Äôt have lumped you in with all the idiots saying that. 

But I will say I disagree with you about his preparation. It has been well documented that he did all he could to stay in shape. Given that he wasn‚Äôt allowed in the building for the first 9-10 weeks of the season and had to throw to college guys I actually think it‚Äôs surprising he‚Äôs improved as much as he has, in terms of chemistry with the WR‚Äôs. Figured it would take much longer for them to find a groove. But I think the fact that he wasn‚Äôt even allowed in the building should have a greater weight than you are maybe giving it. 


‚ÄúThis last game was NOT good‚Äù

If you only look at stats then I‚Äôd agree with you. But he was throwing straight rockets in 30mph winds. His guys let him down and dropped several crucial throws. 


‚ÄúWe lost to a mediocre dome team from the DEEP south‚Äù 

I fail to see how this is relevant to Watson. We are looking at Watson, not who we lost too. 


‚Äúat our home stadium on Lake Erie,  throwing the ball 31 times, (mostly out of bounds...), BY DESIGN, in 30mph wind gusts...‚Äù

I feel like this only proves my point. He was throwing in those conditions and his balls were MONEY. If guys catch the ball the stat line and score completely change. You can‚Äôt blame Watson because the weather was freezing and our WR‚Äôs hands were numb. That‚Äôs a fair critique of the game plan, but not of Watson. The fact that he still rifled the ball around all day and was able to cut through those winds is actually a positive. 


‚ÄúMost importantly, we lost to 35 year old, Andy Never Won A Playoff Game in his LIFE Dalton‚Äù

Once again, how is this relevant? Did Andy Dalton play defense? 


‚ÄúWatson had some decent throws,  Watson had guys dropping balls‚Äù

True, and this proves my point. 


‚ÄúWatson ended the game with 31 attempts 135 yards & 48.39% completion percentage, with a pick for good measure.‚Äù

Which I would bet money that if you adjusted these stats to reflect the drops his numbers would be much better and we win the game, probably closer to 60% and 2 TD‚Äôs which further shows that looking at stats does you no good without first watching the game for context. 


‚ÄúGuys do need to catch, but it's definitely shit all around for everyone, especially the fans.‚Äù


Agreed! 

‚ÄúWatson has been significantly worse than I expected. ‚Å†I don't think this is the end of the world, but I feel a bit swindled‚Äù

Then your expectations were too high. I‚Äôll admit game one against Houston was WAY worse than I thought it‚Äôd be. But he has rounded the corner and looked good last game, if you know what to look for and aren‚Äôt just regurgitating stats. The stats mean nothing without context and the context here shows he‚Äôs getting better. He was never gonna play at an MVP level this year. What matters is that he improves and he *is* improving. 


‚ÄúI'm concerned that the game plan was to throw 31 times in a windstorm on the lake when the football was harder than Nibbler's Dark matter shits, & a quarterback that's rusted like the Titanic‚Äù

Completely agree here. The game plan was dumb af considering the weather and the fact that we had Chubb and Pocic is back. With Watson still shaking off rust this wasn‚Äôt a smart way to approach the game, should‚Äôve leaned on Chubb more. That being said Watson surprised me and played well within the game plan. His receivers let him down is all. And I know we only started throwing more once we were behind, at least I‚Äôve seen some people justify it that way. But we were only down a touchdown, and had 4 redzone opportunities and threw to the endzone every single play. WHY. We should have ran to get us closer and then go from there. We shouldn‚Äôt have thrown on 4th and 1. I‚Äôm okay with the game plan for the most part, my grievance is the situational play calling. Run the freaking ball on 4th and 1. QB sneak it, whatever. And don‚Äôt throw all four downs in the redzone. And if you are gonna do that, at least throw some dink and dunks to get us closer to the goal-line rather than direct every pass to the fucking endzone.  


‚Äú‚Å†Whether it's DePodesta's call, or Kevin's, that's a fireable offense, right there IMO‚Äù

Reactionary BS. One game is not worthy of firing someone. Offense has looked great most of the season and we owe Stefanski and Watson the opportunity to spend an offseason together. Next year if things are shitty than I agree it‚Äôs time to look at the offensive staff, but not this year. 


‚ÄúNobody's saying Watson‚Äôs trash. Trash human? Likely... Playing like a rusty backup? Yes‚Äù

Plenty of people are saying that, I mistakenly lumped you in with that crowd so my bad.

But yeah he‚Äôs a garbage human. You won‚Äôt hear me defending him there. 


‚ÄúDefinitely room for improvement. Hoping to see significantly more improvement before the season is up‚Äù

Yeah I‚Äôm with you. It‚Äôd be great if he shows up as the Watson we saw when he played for the Texans against the Steelers. Would love to sweep those fucks. Not likely though. 


‚ÄúWatson‚Äôs performance thus far has been bad‚Äù

Agreed, but he is improving and I know I keep saying it but that‚Äôs what we should be looking at. It‚Äôs too early to say he‚Äôs arrived and it‚Äôs too early to say he‚Äôs washed. We just need to look for improvement and hope next year he‚Äôs back to his old form. and so far he‚Äôs checking off the right boxes. His decision making is better, footwork, ball placement, and release speed have all improved each game. He‚Äôs shaking off the rust and that‚Äôs what matters.


‚ÄúI'm hopeful & moderately confident he will be Top 15 next season.  Hopefully top 10. Thus far Watson‚Äôs Top 40... & I've heard that tune before enough to know that's Likely lack of adequate preparation‚Äù

I feel you. I think he can be top 15-10 to start the year next year and then as the season comes to a close I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôs closer to top 5-7. And I‚Äôve already said my peace on his preparation.

Anybody that expected him to come back and be an instant MVP candidate had unrealistic expectations. It‚Äôs too early to form an opinion about Watson. And that goes for those saying he‚Äôs washed and those saying he‚Äôs our savior.

10426,74448,74448,JohnnyFire,"My thesis is this: every time Haslam has cleaned house he's had his hands in the pot to get his way. Baker was the QB of Dorsey, who couldn't turn a 7 win Browns squad into a playoff contender after one year and a splash trade for a WR who didn't want to be here.

So when Baker got hurt, Haslam saw his way out. I am 99% sure that he told Stefanski to play him regardless of the injury so that if they failed he could move on. Convince the fans that it was Baker holding the team back, OR go all the way with him. Why the fuck else would Stefanski not turn to the backup who had been able to get him one game away from a Super Bowl?

And then, with Baker gone, Haslam then goes to Berry and tells him upgrade QB or else. The only QB who was available that was a pure upgrade on paper was Watson. Of course it was never going to work but if Haslam loves one thing it's overblown, moronic, all-in moves at the worst possible times. See Odell, Manziel, the 5 WR's taken in 2016...hell 2017 included a bonus trade up too.

None of these trades work when you are constantly inconsistent and have absolutely zero culture or accountability. Haslam has passed the buck to now 6 head coaches, 5 front offices, and 10+ starting QB's. He thinks he's Jerry Jones and can handle being the final point for the team but he isn't. He has no football acumen and it shows. And he also has no patience and no common sense - fire anyone, sign anyone, just win that elusive Super Bowl.

Instead you end up with a rusty and (in the kindest words possible) emphatically problematic QB who will never live up to potential, a team who's glaring holes are now more obvious than ever, and coaching staff making panic decisions because they know all of them are getting fired on January 9th now, even if it isn't their fault.

Kev is fired at seasons end. Berry gets fired when with no picks and no cap space he can't salvage this team next year. Watson gets cut or traded after the bottom falls out. And Haslam will try to sell the fans on the next snake oil his brilliance has cooked up.

14280,105509,105509,PsychologicalGuest97,"I appreciate the effort here, however, three points

1.) This is not surprising given the amount of time he‚Äôs missed

2.) Analyzing a 4 game stretch is not very useful

3.) The metric used here may not be the only ones we ought to looks at when assessing Watsons value

Choosing to analyze 4 games after Watson missed the last season and a half, and comparing that to his career prior when he was more up to game speed is kind of weird. Again, this should not be at all surprising. I know you mention that in your post but it really is something that bears repeating.

Additionally, rolling averages are useful in identifying long-term trends which would have been otherwise missed by occasional variations.

With this in mind, I think looking at 4 games is not very useful. It can be useful when looking at micro-trends, but any prescriptive statement regarding Watsons performance, holistically, might give the wrong impression. This is made worse when accounting for the context of him being out for over 700 days. Moreover, it would be erroneous to declare Watson as a bust, since that label is given to players who will never play to their expectations again ‚Äî we don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the case yet.

I think it would be interesting to look at how he does next season though. You would have a larger sample size to derive the data from and also can easily compare it to other seasons. I think right now we don‚Äôt really know if this trend is indicative of Watson never being the QB he used to be.

Finally, only looking at passer rating and any/a may not be the the only variables worth looking into. In terms of getting value from Watson, I honestly think the best metric to include here would be EPA. Obviously there are others that are informative, but EPA is great because it controls for expectations. This would have been a great variable to incorporate.

Alright, let‚Äôs run through this for the 10,000th time:

1.) Baker played a role, but was by no means the main contributing factor to why the Browns won against the Steelers in 2020.

2.) Baker sucks *right now*, and the season prior. The degree to which the injury influenced his play might not have been as significant as we originally thought given how he‚Äôs played this season. He could very well prove me wrong next season but as of now, I can only go off of the work he‚Äôs produced. Thus, keeping him another season would have been a waste for this franchise

3.) The way he conducted himself in front of the media created unnecessary discourse, vis-√†-vis him refusing to talk to the media after the Lions game. This negatively affects the team since it serves to become a distraction.

I will say this though - a lot of us fans just want our team to be relevant, but this Watson situation is the epitome of monkey paw curling, making this miserable for a lot of us. Yeah, we probably got the franchise quarterback we've been looking for 20+ yrs to get, but we gave up 3 1st rounders that could've helped our ailing defense, and a hell of a lot of good faith to get him.  We might finally have a franchise quarterback and we can't even feel good to root for the guy. But for our team to be relevant, he has to play good.

33785,231735,231735,randobot456,"Preliminary: this is just a take on his on the field play and nothing else. 

I realize a lot of people aren't really watching the film of Watson, and instead, I'm just glancing at box scores and listening to talking heads.

The tape tells a very different story than the box scores, which is that Watson has continued to improve each game gradually.  

Two games ago, it finally started to look like he was comfortable and was taking control of the offense,  but that receivers still need to learn how to play with him.  What do I mean by that?  When Baker and then Jacoby were at the helm, you got like 2-4 seconds, and then the play was over.  With Deshaun, he has the ability to extend the play and create plays out of nothing like we see with Mahomes or Allen.  This does require the receivers to CONTINE with the play, which they haven't really been doing, and find open areas of the field.  

This past game was an absolute shit-show due to the weather, and Watson was making some throws that were absolutely perfect despite it.  Some throws sailed on him (wind), and a few were straight dropped, either by the receivers just missing them (including the 1 int), or slipping and falling, but Watson looked like he's just about back.

I expect to see a big game before the end of the year and think he's in for a bounce back year in 2023.",2.0,nfl,t3_zxlwpi,False,1.0,:Browns: Browns,2022-12-28T16:38:06Z,browns,0.0039711204831854
