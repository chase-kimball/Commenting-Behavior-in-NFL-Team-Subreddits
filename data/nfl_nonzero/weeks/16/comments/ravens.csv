In that case we have a misunderstanding, because that was the reason I brought Snead up in the first place. I wasn't naming Snead to say that we should sign him in 2022 because he will be an upgrade over DRob, because he won't be. I was naming Snead because he's a recent example of the Ravens signing a veteran who is clearly not a WR1 type player and does not require the requisite overpay those types of players command in free agency, but who was a clear positive impact on the Ravens offense during his tenure. The reason I bring him up is because the most common response to ""We should add more depth at WR"" in the offseason was ""We can't afford the type of money Jacksonville gave Kirk or Miami gave Hill,"" so I feel the need to make clear that ""Adding a WR"" doesn't inherently mean ""Adding a WR1,"" and that at least for me, it was more about adding depth than trying to go grab Davante Adams or Stefon Diggs.

Personally, I disagree. Robinson as a Chief and Snead as a Saint both had excellent QBs in pass-happy offenses where they were the #2 or #3 WR depending on the year, but on per-game basis, Snead's performance with Brees behind Cooks, Colston, and Thomas (3.6 catches, 48.1 yards, 67.4% catch rate) are all higher marks than Robinson's performance with Mahomes behind Hill, Kelce, and Hardman. (1.9 catches, 22.6 yards, 66% catch rate) It is not a massive difference, but looking at their production prior to Baltimore, I don't see the argument that Robinson in 2022 was a better signing than Snead in 2018.

> But beyond that, what you’re saying is reasonable. But that’s not what most of the bandwagon kids are saying. They’re ripping EDC and calling for his job for not trading the farm for a WR1 even though nobody good was available for trade post-AJ Brown. But guess what? Titans weren’t going to trade him to a team they face in the playoffs every year. 

And if the criticism were reserved to that kind of nonsense, I'd have no problem with it. As I said though, the problem that I have is that any kind of critique or opinion about ways the front office could do better are treated as uninformed whinging of wet-behind-the-eat bandwagoners. I don't deny that there are people in the sub that make 105.7 callers seem like the School of Athens, but I know from being on the receiving end of it that a lot of thought-out, well-meaning criticism gets treated with the same level of vitriol.

> It’s not unforeseeable, but the Ravens philosophy has always been right player, right price. We don’t overpay or overdraft players. Notice how despite the amount of injuries we’ve had, we’ve stayed competitive? That’s because of our roster building philosophy. 

And I've defended that philosophy, but that doesn't mean it's above reproach. It's a good philosophy, but like any human endeavor it's imperfect, and I see nothing wrong with discussing those imperfections candidly.

> The vast majority of posts the past couple seasons haven’t been level headed discussion of the teams flaws. It’s been toxic doomerism. We’re 9-5, but somehow the Browns sub is more positive than ours.

And again, I have no problem with calling out bullshit. The problem I have is that a lot of people treat any kind of criticism or thought beyond ""I support this decision emphatically"" as braindead screeching. I don't object to disregarding and belittling bad-faith arguments, I object to inherently treating every divergent opinion as bad-faith.",0.0,ravens,t3_zthz2a,False,1.0, :19:,2022-12-23T10:45:56Z,ravens,-0.0105398434727671

Doing so is 100% justified given the shit some people get up to. (Anyone remember the ""Drawing Ronnie Stanley every day until he plays"" asshole? Or the morons calling Hamilton a bust after two games?) 

The thing that bothers me though is that it's a pattern that feels like it extends to basically every critique or dissenting opinion, even ones made in good faith. People pointed out in the offseason that we have no depth behind Bateman and Duvernay, so adding a WR, even just a WR2 type guy like Snead, would be prudent in case one of them got hurt. They got ripped, people hyped up Proche and Wallace as the next Tim Patrick and we'd push good talent off the roster burying them with a veteran just like him. Bring up the same thing now, and it's treated as some unforeseeable fluke any criticism of the decisions about it is treated as baseless hindsight. That's the most top-of-mind example because of what happened to Duv this week, but it's far from the only one.

I don't think we need to worry about rust. 

The rust issue originated from the 2019 playoff game against the Titians, due to the fact that we had a buy, and rested key players in Week 17 against the Steelers as the No. 1 seed was a lock.

We were not prepared for Titans, and there were many other factors other than rust in the 2019 game;  the Titans out-played us and played a better game.

Lamar Jackson plays very well in Week 1 every year;  I don't think rust will be factor.  I believe his optimal health is is best factor.

The rest may even have the opposite of so-called rust.  He might be hungry to come back, and play his best.  The man is, after all, betting on himself.  What better time than to go all out through the playoffs.",2.0,ravens,t3_zw0u13,False,0.0, :BAL: ,2022-12-26T21:47:12Z,ravens,0.0406162366380606

Formation (Green Right Strong Slot) Protection (Spider 2) Route (Y Banana)

Green Right – The Green tells the offense that the formation is a base formation which includes two backs (FB and HB), two receivers (X and Z) and a tight end (Y). The Right tells the Z and Y receivers to line up on the right side of the formation.

Strong – This tells the fullback to off-set to the strong side, or the side where the tight end is, instead of lining up on the base I formation.

Slot – This tells the Z receiver (receiver on the strong side) to move to the slot.

Spider 2 – This is the protection. This tells the offensive linemen to slide protection post-snap. Note that the first two letter in the word Spider is SP for slide protection.

Y Banana – This is the entire route combination where the fullback is the primary target. It’s telling the fullback to fake a block on the defensive end and run to the flat, Y receiver to run a corner route, the Z receiver to run a shallow cross, the X receiver to run a go or come back and the RB to cut the defensive end. The QB does a play-action and throws to the fullback in the flat.

Harbaugh is 2-4 in the postseason over the last 9 seasons.

He was on the way out in 2018, then Lamar came and literally saved his job. Injuries saved him last year and a favourable schedule this year. He’s failed to fire our key weakness which is Greg Roman. And harbaugh has to be held responsible for that. 

Regardless, harbaugh is still a “good” coach. He’s the type of coach that will get you to either the wild card game or the divisional game and lose, but at least recently he’s not the type of coach that will take you to the championship game or the super bowl. 

He seems to be a perennial “nearly” coach but never makes it all the way (I’m talking about after his SB win so a solid decade of seasons)

I think this team can easily progress by at least firing Greg Roman and hiring a decent OC, but harbaugh is unwilling to make that decision.",15.0,ravens,t3_zvb0fk,False,0.0,Poor Mans Taysom Hill,2022-12-25T19:13:05Z,ravens,0.0746451277440383

Dolphins 8-6:

Vs Packers
@Patriots
Vs Jets

Likely 10-7 I’d say. Probably one loss and 2 wins which would put them at 10-7 for the year.

Chargers:
@Colts
Vs Rams
@Broncos

They’ve got a divisional game in there where the broncos finish spoiler.

Likely 10-7 but 11-6 is possible.

Therefore, if the ravens win against the Steelers they are practically guaranteed to get the 5 or 6 seed (rather than the 7)

Getting the 7 seed would require:
Ravens to lose out
Dolphins to win 2/3
Chargers to win out
