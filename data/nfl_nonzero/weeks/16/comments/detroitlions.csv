The only RBs under contract next year are D’Andre Swift (1 more year) and Greg Bell (2 more years). Most seem to agree Swift won’t be re-signed, and we’ve all seen how often he’s unavailable or playing limited snaps. It’s unclear if Craig Reynolds or Jermar Jefferson will be around beyond this year, either.

So even if Jamaal’s back next year, I think they’re gonna need some more juice. I wouldn’t rule out a Day 2 or 3 pick being used on RB. (Also curious how cheap they could bring back Justin Jackson for. He’s proven to be a good-value find by Brad Holmes.)

None of our RBs have stepped up as receiving options, so we really struggle to keep defenses honest.

An all-purpose TE would do the same. Hock was decent, and I think Mayer will be better, and we took Hock at 8. Taking a better TE in the late teens is a no-brainer. Mayer reminds me more of Kittle than he does of Hock, he’s huge, thicker than both of them actually, and a very good receiver.

He has it in him to absolutely crush mediocre teams, but when he's faced with equal or superior talent, he crumbles, and takes the team with him. Now his on field talent is fading due to age and injury, and we're left with what we see. 

His relationship with the organization is obviously bad at this point, even if they became desperate to keep him around and it shows just how mismanaged they are. I feel like the organization slammed the window on him winning again almost out of spite. Really, it's the most schizophrenic situation in football. You had them draft another QB, not bother with any first round receivers or really other effective first round offensive talent for years..  yet then they pay the man. The way they draft you feel like they were trying to get him to have a bad season and run him out of town.. but then they turn around and they make him the highest paid quarterback in the league.

38962,237336,237336,bmgiannotti,">What makes you think Stroud's ceiling is a ~15-20th best starter in the NFL?

Nothing, because that's not what I said. I said you'd hope he'd be Goff as a passers with better athleticism. We wouldn't even be having this conversation if Goff had plus athleticism.

I also would not put Goff in that range regardless. If he were that I don't think it would be a question at all if we ought to replace him, but instead with whom we ought to. I think Goff has shown enough in his full body of work that he's an average to above average QB.

>Stroud can adjust his arm angle to avoid swats (which Goff clearly can't if you saw the Panthers game).

Dude has one game with a few batted passes and suddenly it shows what kind of arm talent he has. He has 11 batted passes this year. That's fewer than Burrow, Herbert, Lawrence, Allen, Fields and Cousins and FOUR of those came this week for Goff. This is such an absurd overreaction to one game. 

>How are they even similar? Goff doesn't have Stroud's arm.

I and other analysts that I follow don't agree at all, especially when you compare them coming out of college.

Quotes from Dane Brugler of the Athletic:

""The third-year sophomore doesn’t have elite arm strength, but more importantly, he understands ball placement and touch.""

 ""I had Detroit passing on Stroud at No. 3 because I question if the Lions decision-makers will view the Ohio State quarterback as a clear upgrade over Jared Goff. Is Stroud the missing piece who can take a team to new heights? I’m just not sold on that line of thinking.""

One scouting report from SI drew a direct comparison to Goff:

[In an NFL that has seen a recent rise in creative passers, where does a player like Stroud fit? As much as it pains me to say it, I see a player that is very similar to Jared Goff in a lot of ways. Goff was a number one overall pick due to his accuracy in college, and he wowed evaluators with his highlight reel touch throws.](https://www.si.com/nfl/colts/draft/2023-nfl-draft-cj-stroud-ohio-state)
