I think this is the most compelling reason for his struggle

>My point about bad schools is that for it to translate to the modern NFL, I’d expect him to absolutely dominate the schedule.

IDK if this is really important. Matt Ryan's college stats were not dominant, and in fact he only had one good year as a senior, he's a pretty great player. Mahomes at Texas Tech had a losing record (and it was used against him in the draft process).

>I also don’t know why he’s excused for the two other years he had that were completely below average.

on this though, Wilson's first year is pretty good. He started 7 games as an 18-year-old freshman, and put up a fantastic 66% completion with 8.7 YPA. Those are good numbers. The sophomore is a downer year but the offseason going into it he had a shoulder surgery on a torn labrum (iirc), which has killed a few QBs that are better than him. I think that's why it was easy to overlook, and i'd personally overlook it again with a future prospect that has a similar blemish on their record",1.0,nyjets,t3_zvw26e,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-12-27T11:28:01Z,nyjets,0.0474318767486527
14137,99730,99730,NannigarCire,"i mean Wilson does hold BYU records, his comp % is the highest in a BYU season all time. He can't beat Detmer's career stats because Detmer played 4 years while Zach only had 3, but also BYU found Zach to be talented enough that they wavered their 2 year missionary requirement that they keep for almost every BYU player. I also didn't see him live, only in cutups leading up the draft, and i just thought he was a fine prospect, not special like the Mormon Mahomes nickname but not much different than most 1st round prospects. The deep balls were less than they were sold but the quick release, movement, avoidance, and abilities to read around the field were promising for a 20 year old. And Wilson did shred the competition he faced, his season is insane 73.5%, 11.0 YPA, only 3 interceptions on 336 passes. Yeah, looking at it you can find jump balls that receivers took away for sure, they did build a good jump ball team with tall guys even if they aren't special and, not to compare, but because i recall these arguments around Mahomes time about air raid, big-12 competition, so on and so forth, like these reasons as ""the reason"" fall sort of flat. I think so far the only thing that can convince me of my own miss of Wilson is not properly valuing the size of his pockets at BYU since that is the only major difference and his fear of getting hit has been shown over and over

although i wish i got to see the all-22 because seeing them now from other people who had them, some issues are way more obvious on the 22. i think personally, i'll avoid using the broadcast angle for any college QB scouting in the future",1.0,nyjets,t3_zvw26e,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-12-26T22:26:51Z,nyjets,-0.0666182576987479

Maybe it is just as simple as he is scared in a pocket that isn't totally clean

*let me put it this way about competition, there is probably a greater margin of difference between LSU Justin Jefferson + Jamarr Chase + Terrace Marshall and every single defender they faced in Burrow's final year, than there was between Dax Milne + Gunner Romney + Neil Pa'u and every defender they faced in Zach's year. Just as mucha s Zach's destroying inferior NFL talent, he's playing with inferior NFL talent too. Did any of that BYU OL get drafted either? So it's just a messy point of evaluation, but the All-22 angle does reveal a lot of the issues that were harder to se on the broadcast cutups, even if the accuracy is the only one that i'd say is currently carrying over",2.0,nyjets,t3_zvw26e,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-12-26T22:19:38Z,nyjets,-0.0336343407064471
14139,99732,99732,NannigarCire,"Idk where adjusted accuracy under pressure is from or why it would matter, every statistical regression that’s been done for future predictive value has found performance under pressure to be valueless compared to not under pressure which makes sense considering QBs are not under pressure about 90% of games. I also don’t buy this competition argument bc there are not a small amount of guys in the NFL who have seen moderate to extreme success coming from extremely bad (Romo, garoppolo) or overpowered programs (Wentz) in recent history. the bigger receivers argument has some potential merit but even then the guys he played with are all sub-200 pound guys who aren’t even significantly tall at WR minus Neil Pa’u who wasn’t used any more significantly than any of the other players on that team. Like is having Gunner Romney, a guy who didn’t even make it onto an NFL praxtice squad the reason Zach hit 75% completion?

To me all of these are circumstantial pieces of information that are better used as descriptors of why things may have happened than actual reasons for why he played so well the final year of college play. Because if any of this basis was true then why did Wentz hit the NFL so well in his early seasons, why is Carr from MWC conference having a 10 year career, etc etc etc. the player should be analyzed on their own merits is what I’m saying

14142,99736,99736,NannigarCire,"as everyone knows there's a non-zero chance that derek carr hits the market this year. a lot of people will be hating on the idea, i'm not the biggest Carr fan (i was one of his earliest haters even, my twitter display name used to update with Carr's career YPA because it was so fucking awful despite his undeserved hype) but the last 5 years of his play have been significantly better than the first four when people pretended he was an MVP candidate. He's also been on teams that are constantly bottom 8 on defense, both in yards and points allowed during these last 5 years. Multiple times bottom 3, even. This has been an awful team and now it's coached by one of the worst coaches in football in McDaniels. Carr's had two years in his career where his defense was top 16 (not top 8, just top 16) and in one they went 7-9, Carr was ok, the other 12-3 with Carr as the starter and Carr was 3rd in MVP voting (highly undeserved imo). But the guy would be an automatic 9-12 win with the current Jets. It's almost unquestionable. His lapses in judgment are not ideal but not uncommon in players that are firmly in the tier 2/3 of QBs, who can forget Tony Romo, Philip Rivers, or Ben Roethlisberger putting up random 3-4 interception games once or twice a season. It's not the end of the world, and with a defense that's good at getting the ball back there's a good chance of the Jets surviving those.

This late in his career, and not really likely to get a huge payoff- Carr has a chance of taking less than the top market value for QBs which opens up more money to re-sign defenders and keep adding FAs to what should be one of the most attractive FA teams this yaer. That's a huge success by Douglas, considering where we were the last 2 years.

And for the classist thing, I’m honestly dead serious when I say that. You hear guys like Booger on TV saying “he’s from a rich family. He’s never faced adversity in his life. He’s had everything handed to him.” And that was also said in the comment above yours (spoiled brat). Where exactly has that impacted his play? Where exactly have you seen that (outside of literally that single interview)?

Onto “didn’t fight for the job, just moped around”.
WHAT? WTF does that even mean???? Did you want him to cause a locker room stir and attack Saleh or something? Want him to slander Mike white in the media? Want him to call the team out? If you payed attention, he spoke to the team after his own benching and said he’d work to earn his spot back. That sounds like the exact type of “fighting for it” I want to see. Idk wtf you wanted.

He got benched and by all respects he handled it as well as he could unless there’s something I missed. And yea he came back and sucked. NEWS FLASH, he’s bad at football.

16115,106790,106790,OrangElm,"First: im assuming we keep Mike white. With than assumption we can bring in

1. Crazy town dream QBs: Lamar, Rodgers, Brady, Dark horse Geno? (none of these are happening).

2. Higher upside guy who can also step in if needed:
Jordan Love, Carson Wentz, Daniel Jones (he’s honestly looking good this season with AWFUL weapons), Mid-round QB.

3. Vet to sit behind white or maybe push for starting role if White regresses (if for reasonable money): Brissett, Jimmy G?, Matt Ryan?, Carr?, Andy Dalton?. All guys who bring a vet presence to a team, but aren’t very exciting.



Baker doesn’t really fit either of those categories imo. We’ve seen him destroy the production of offenses with solid weapons multiple times now. He also isn’t the type of guy to come in with a vet presence for the team (if anything he’s a bit polarizing). I don’t hate him, but he’s not a guy I’m looking for.

My take: obv we try for the dream QBs, but it likely doesn’t happen. After that we prep for Mike White at QB and try to bring in Love (at a reasonable price) because he’s prob better than any QB we can draft. If not him, then bring in Wentz (who was shockingly solid on the colts 2 years ago if you look at his numbers) and draft someone developmental to sit. We could also go after Daniel Jones. If none of that, I’d rather Brisset tbh who is by all indications a super locker room guy with experience, but I can see why people would want baker over him.
