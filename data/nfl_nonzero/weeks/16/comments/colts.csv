340,2336,2336,603er,"Definitely agree. Though some might say it’s warranted. I think the defense is certainly good and the oline unfortunately regressed this year. Had that not been the case, I think they would have been decent. 

Ultimately, I’m sort of glad the colts failed this year. For several years they’ve been in a terrible purgatory of being bad enough to miss out on the playoffs (or lose in the first round) but good enough to miss a top draft pick. 

This team needs a new face. And hopefully they draft a QB in the first round with a top 5 pick. A reset is needed.  They finally are out of their mediocre purgatory and can hit that reset button. It’ll take time to get to a playoff caliber, but hopefully it can at least get us back on track.
