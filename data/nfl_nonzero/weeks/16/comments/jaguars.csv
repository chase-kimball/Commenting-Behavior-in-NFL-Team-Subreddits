For Jalen, we all knew he had the talent to half the field for the defense and make it easier by being a shut down corner. But his ego got bruised and so he had to 'sit' with an 'injury' like an immature kid. 

He's playing professional football and if that doesn't give him a reason to be the best on the field at all times then his motivation isn't playing the game. So he quit. I have a hard time respecting someone of that talent and a leader of the team just out right quiting in what is a team sport.

16145,122833,122833,NotSoFakeID,"Those tricky jags will always have a special place in my heart because of the call and the context. That entire game was such a great moment and was a bit of a rallying point for the team.

That game was the week after Gus Bradley got fired after losing to the Texans in 2016. I was at the Texans game and it was horrible, we blew a lead and the game ended on a Blake pick (to AJ Bouye I think, funnily enough). But it was worth it to fire Bradley. 

Fast forward seven days and we shake off the awful mediocrity of Gus by immediately beat down the Titans with a great performance by both sides of the ball. We had lost nine straight before this game. Ramsey gets a pick six, Blake catches a touchdown. It was interim coach Doug Marrone‚Äôs first game. Without this win, I don‚Äôt think 2017 can even happen. We probably don‚Äôt retain Marrone without this win, we also probably don‚Äôt land someone like Calais in the off-season if we finish the season on an 11-game losing streak. Also, if we don‚Äôt win this game we end up with the 2nd or 3rd pick in the draft instead of the fourth, where we might have even become involved in Mitch Trubitsky (oof).

Those tricky jags set the stage for our entire 2017 run, adding Fournette, Marrone, and Calais, and I think that game against the titans would be talked about a lot more if we ended up going all the way in 2017. A very interesting moment in Jags history.
