No QB can spin coal into gold - you need something to work with.  Most importantly is the O-line.

My main complaint is that the QB is not going to get anywhere if you put a bunch of stiffs on the O-line together and expect them to never get hurt.

RAMS need to put more effort into the O-line than what they have done with either Stafford or Goff.  

You don‚Äôt need 1st round picks, but you need big, tall, strong, and long armed players with intelligence and mobility.

This isn‚Äôt something you find with UDFA.

Noteboom sounds intelligent, but he isn‚Äôt long armed, tall compared to the guys he goes against, or even very strong.  Von Miller easily bull rushed him in the first game of the season and I knew then, he will never be a good LT.

Sean McVays losing season (yes, singular) was injury-ridden, but competitive. The players never quit on him, and he‚Äôs getting productivity out of nameless and cast-off players. 

He has created a culture that players want to play for. The Rams are a win now team that is setback by injuries, not a team fading into the sunset. 

* The best defensive player in the league is ready to go next year, should he want to keep playing, and I don‚Äôt think his ego will let him go out at the bottom. 
* The Super Bowl MVP, Triple Crown winner is still in his prime and is tough as hell. He‚Äôll be back. 
* A HOF, SB Champ QB coming back with some hard earned vacation time. And should he decide to ride into the sunset in the next couple of years, we either have Mayfield (a talent QB who has been failed by coaching) or a coach that can be effective with most QBs (Wolf and Perk are blunders - they should be gone after this season).

I could go on with players like Higbee, who is now the record holder for all major categories at TE for the Rams, Wagner and Ramsey who are elite players, even with some off games in what is just and off season. We have so much upside and talent.

If I was Baker I‚Äôd have an honest convo with McVay and Stafford. If Stafford thinks he‚Äôs got 3 or more years in him, Baker should bet on himself somewhere else if someone offers a starting chance on decent team (like Raiders if they move from Carr). If Stafford thinks he‚Äôs leaning retirement after a year or 2, I think Baker would appreciate stability on a team with the best coach he‚Äôs ever worked with. 

He‚Äôs proven to McVay and Rams fans that he can run this offense with the 3rd string.

If I was in Baker's shoes right now I'd be thinking about taking a paycut and staying at the Rams. If Baker hunts for a starting job and ends up in another bad place with bad coaching required to be 'The Saviour of the organisation and bring them to the promised lands' again then it could potentially be it for his career. 

There's only so many times that the league is willing to take a chance on you; Browns didn't want him, Panthers didn't want him. If someone else decides they don't want him then there's a good chance no one will pick him up.

Take a nice backup paycheck at the Rams to sit behind Stafford in McVay's scheme and get a chance to work on your craft with little pressure. Romo was saying it today that Baker never used to use his eyes to move the defence in Cleveland. I don't know how much that's true, I only have Romo's word for it, but if it is true he's already learning more tricks. 

We'll gladly keep him as a backup and I'll gladly take him as our starter once Stafford hangs it up. Two years tops I reckon for Stafford, Baker will only be 29 and then can sign a nice new starters contract with McVay as his coach - I would think McVay would stick around, he likes Baker.

Baker had money counting towards the cap for the browns. He also was going to have to be re-signed the next season, which also hurt his value. The browns ate part of his cap and baker even took a pay cut to get traded. 

Sean was a coach. He doesn‚Äôt count anything towards the cap. He also retired, so cancelled out his pay going forward, unless he unretires. Those two situations are so different, hence why they could yield WAY more than a 7th round pick. 

All that being said, Dennis allen has been god awful even in a division that is a dumpster fire, the locker room would be more than fine to have their former HC back so I don‚Äôt get that narrative either.

It's the very reason people love to sh*t on guys like Ramsey, saying he's washed.
