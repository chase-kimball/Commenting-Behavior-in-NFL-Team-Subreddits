11110,86743,86743,ILoveZenkonnen,"He's done pretty much as well as you can ask for considering who he is playing with imo. Isaiah Hodgins and Richie James were our leading receivers vs the Vikings and they both came from practice squads. Despite that, the Giants were still competitive in that game largely due to Daniel Jones. It’s been the same story all year really (with help from Saquon ofc).

Daniels Jones is never going to be a top 5 guy who’s going to make jaw dropping plays every week but the Giants never needed that to win. That’s not our M.O. Chris Simms said it best. Jones is very much in that Eli/Phil Simms mold where he won’t be a MVP level guy but he can still be pretty damn good with a team that’s worth a shit around him.

He’s also improved as a QB every year so far despite being surrounded by complete shit coaching and teammates. Now he’s tied for the lowest INT rate in the nfl and his fumbles aren’t even mentioned anymore. Ranked #12 in EPA last time I checked. Many QBs would have been ruined here but Jones got better little by little and I think people sleep on that.

The potential is there at least. We really need to get him some god damn receivers. When Jones gets that, an improved interior OL, and a 2nd year in this offense I think we will truly see him shine.

Brady (decision-making & longevity)

27499,227229,227229,heavymetalchemist,"My problems with you people and now you're gonna hear about it.

1) The offensive line is a mess, with Andrew Thomas as the only exception. Ezeudu hasn't played to the level he was selected at and I wanted Parham over him as a guard in the draft. Feliciano is lackluster and needs to help communicate with the rest of the line. Evan Neal has had a rough rookie season and I think he will turn out to be a stud, but a bunch of the other rookie tackles have outplayed him. 

2) Our receivers are either injured, off the street, washed or disappointing. Slayton looked like a steal his rookie year but has dropped off since then. Golladay is permanently in the dog house and I feel bad that I was excited he signed with us in 2021. I should have known a Gettleman offensive free agent should have been a bust. Robinson and Shepard looked good but are injured and could be weak red zone targets.

3) Jones has played alright, I think he's earned another year or two but he's a game manager at this point. 

4) The defense needs to stop acting like it's got cover corners. Adoree' is out as the other corners can only cover for a bit. 

5) The coaching staff has done pretty well with the weaknesses we have on the roster but they need to really develop these players and I'm not sure if they can. Neal was supposed to be the most pro-ready tackle in the draft but he's had a rough start. 

6) The Front Office: I still think Mara's a stuffy old man and he needs to adapt to the times. The tuff issue is on him, as according to other fanbases he's one of the most powerful owners. As is the stadium being a Madden stadium template. He can definitely do better. Joe Schoen has done well so far, but I'd appreciate if he appeared more at games or even talked more than once during the season. Gettleman and Reese talk once during the season and would hide out during the games. Gettleman only talked to the media to blow his own horn or to protect his job. I don't know if I ever heard Reese's voice and the man was more evasive than Lomez and Bob Sacamono.",1.0,nygiants,t3_ztoz6m,False,0.0,:Giants-logo-vintage:,2022-12-23T19:53:45Z,nygiants,0.0007094565809583

- what a heartbreaker. I was floored when the FG was made.

- This was DJ’s best game of his career, and he’s strung together several great performances recently. DJ seemingly had 1 bad ball yesterday, and that was the Pat P pick, just needed to be ~3 feet to the left. No doubt in my mind that he’s our QB for the next few years, and it’s great to see what he can do with what he has around him now… I look forward to seeing him in a re-tooled offense.

- I wish we got Saquon involved in the game sooner. It seemingly took most of the first half before he was getting the ball.

- Our WRs stepped it up, DJ was throwing DARTS all day long and several clutch catches were made

- it’s hard for me to hate on Richie James. The dude was targeted 12 times, made several catches when we needed him to. Yes, he also has a few critical drops, but the dude is a practice squad talent getting 12 targets. Can only ask so much from him. Wandale or Shep would be getting those targets if they were healthy and if either of them dropped 4 of 12 targets I’d feel differently

- I loved how often we blitzed yesterday. I’m all for being aggressive and frankly, we need to be to make up for our lack of talent in the secondary.

- we have a solid core of defenders and that gets me excited. Love, McKinney, Dex, Leo, Azeez, Thibs, Adoree. we can absolutely build around this, even if we lose one of them in FA or trade down the road.

- Hodgins is getting better every week, it’s great to see. I expect to see him integrated even when Wandale is back and we (hopefully) have a shiny new WR from the draft.",20.0,nygiants,t3_zuzrt0,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-12-25T09:19:37Z,nygiants,0.0247053261557505
