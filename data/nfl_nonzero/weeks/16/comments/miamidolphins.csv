3861,27957,27957,BizarroCranke,"All of this can be a little tricky sometimes. Granted this is coming from an NFL employee:

[NFL CMO Dr. Allen Sills: Tua Tagovailoa showed ‚Äònothing that would have triggered‚Äô concussion protocol during game vs. Packers](https://www.nfl.com/_amp/nfl-cmo-dr-allen-sills-tua-tagovailoa-showed-nothing-that-would-have-triggered-c)

‚ÄúWhat our spotters and our unaffiliated neuro doctors are looking for is any blow that transmits force to the head or neck area, followed by that injury behavior,"" Sills explained to NFL Senior National Columnist Judy Battista in an interview that will air during Tuesday's NFL Total Access at 7 p.m. ET. 

""And so, there are many blows to the head that occur during a game. We are always looking for the blow plus the injury behavior and obviously if we see any injury behavior, then there‚Äôs a call down made to evaluate that player. Also, if a player identifies any symptoms or a teammate, coach, official, anyone else identifies symptoms, that also initiates a protocol. 

So many people can initiate the protocol and in this game on Sunday, none of those factors were present. There were no visible signs present, even though there was a blow to the head and the player did not report any symptoms, despite being in contact with the medical staff throughout the game. So, there was nothing that would have triggered the protocol in the moment.""

It‚Äôs just who do you trust, an NFL employee that may legitimately have the players best interest in mind, or are they protecting their employer? 

Plus, I hope any of these terrible situations leads to players ditching the competitive player aspect and be 100000% transparent with their conditions, even if a stupid playoff possibility hinges on their involvement. At the same time, more and more coaches need to protect the player from themselves too. 

I‚Äôve never met Mike McDaniel, but the guy seems to look at Tua as a close friend and son with some of their interactions and interviews. Again, don‚Äôt know him, but I don‚Äôt see McDaniel doing anything that would put Tua in a bad spot.

Now that Tua hasn't been able to see or hit those plays as often as before, it may be time to go back to shorter stuff. But the only game that I'd say McDaniel was at fault for was the Chargers game.

Figured out too easily? We have wide open guys running every other play that are missed due to the QB. Of our four straight losses, only one can be argued being due to our scheme being ""figured out.""

Against the 49ers we had at least one weapon open literally 80-90% of our plays, but Tua had a bad game. Against the Bills we put up 29, which should be enough to win you a game, especially against a top 3 defense. Against the Packers, we put up 20 in the first half, then wasted 3 possessions in the second half due to three interceptions. 

Prior to this game our defense was #2 in offensive DVOA, which adjusts for strength of opponents. The team ahead of us? The Chiefs.
