It's incredibly difficult to separate ""the best player"" from ""the best scorer"" especially when the media vote on it because it's much easier to sell subscriptions talking about the big point getters than the guys who set them up or just play defense.

Why is there no talk about the Chiefs missing the playoffs, and Patrick Mahomes not being thought of as a Top 5 QB after this season ends? This is a very plausible (if not likely) scenario.

I've been very surprised this off-season about the lack of discussion around the Chiefs missing the playoffs, and even more so surprised by Patrick Mahomes consistently being Top 2 on most QB lists.

To start, I don't believe Patrick Mahomes was a Top 5 QB this past season. But I understand that when you've had as much success as he has to start a career, it takes more than 1 season to knock you out of the Top 5. 

Additionally, as I'm sure I will be asked about it, I would've taken Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Justin Herbert, Joe Burrow and Josh Allen's seasons above Mahomes. I also believe Matt Stafford played better than him this past season, *but do not believe Matt Stafford is a better QB than Mahomes.*

There are a number of reasons to think that by the end of this season, Patrick Mahomes will not be a Top 5 QB, and without him being at that level, the Chiefs will miss the playoffs in a loaded AFC.

My analysis also is largely based on the talent Mahomes has had to start his career. I believe with a Top 5 All-Time Tight End, a Top 3 All Time Coach, and the best ""speed"" WR to ever play in the NFL, he has had a situation most QB's can only dream of, and that has led most to falsely rate his individual play.

&#x200B;

1. Well the Chiefs offense had a good EPA/play last season, Patrick Mahomes PFF grade was very poor. His 77.1 grade ranked 11th among all QBs. As we all know, PFF is not the gospel, but it is the best indicator of QB play we have, as EPA/Play, QBR, Passer Rating, etc is all heavily dependent on how good the rest of the offense is. With two HOF receivers and a HOF Coach, the rest of the offense is going to be quite good, and drive up those stats.
2. Patrick Mahomes did not show an ability to adjust to different defensive concepts last year, and success this year will rely on him adjusting constantly, due to inferior receiving talent (compared to previous years). His struggles when Tyreek Hill was taken out of the game in Cover 2 scenarios were something that plagued him all year, and in the playoffs.
3. The loss of Tyreek Hill. This probably could be #1 on the list. Chiefs fans will point to Mahomes stats in 5 career games without Hill, but neglect the fact that 4 of those 5 teams won less than 7 games those years. No one is doubting Mahomes ability to beat up on 7 win teams without Hill, that will happen. But against strong competition, the loss of Tyreek Hill will be a massive factor. This was shown in the 2021 playoffs. Against the Bills, Tyreek singlehandedly took over the game in the 4th quarter. After a drive to put the Bills in the lead, Mahomes threw a 10 yard dig to Hill, who then took the pass another 50 yards to the end zone, out running the entire Bills defense. Then with 13 seconds left, it was Tyreek's speed that allowed for a big completion on play #1, and then, the Bills were clearly terrified of another Hill 60 yard masterpiece, that they left a Top 5 TE all time in basically single coverage! Allowing for an easy completion and Field Goal. Tyreek Hill is a true gamewrecker, he makes everyone on the field better, because of the attention he has to receive. The Chiefs and Mahomes will miss that dearly, and it will show.
4. Travis Kelce's age. Kelce is 32, and with each year it becomes more likely to see a drop off. I don't think a massive drop off is likely, and even with Kelce at full strength points 1-3 apply. But if he does drop off, then I expect Mahomes drop off to get worse.
5. The schedule. The Chiefs have 3 easy wins on their schedule, the rest is loaded with top teams and top defenses.
6. The Chiefs without a Top 5 QB, do not have a playoff caliber roster in a loaded AFC with a very tough schedule. 

&#x200B;

In summary, I do not believe Mahomes played like a Top 5 QB last year (11th PFF Graded QB) and believe that his play will decline further this year due to the reasons above. This decline will help lead to the Chiefs missing the playoffs, which will in turn strengthen the belief among most fans that Patrick Mahomes is no longer a Top 5 QB in the NFL.

I would expect at year end, the Top 5 to be Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Justin Herbert, Joe Burrow and Josh Allen. With another 1-2 QBs making the jump in front of Mahomes (hard to predict exactly who, just as it was hard to predict Burrow, Herbert, Mahomes, Allen before their breakout years)",25.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_zv7bp5,False,0.0,Nick Bolton #32,2022-12-25T16:51:02Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0042986031823889

40351,266369,266369,click_808,"I can’t stand Aikman, but in his defense, the QB shouldn’t be leading their receivers directly into an oncoming trainwreck if they can avoid it. 

Either throw it slightly behind to make your receiver pump the breaks, a bit under to bring your receiver up and away from the defender (and out of bounds) or don’t throw it to him at all.

Even if you make safety of your receiver the opponents’ responsibility, it’s unwise just from the fact that those situations have a high chance of having the ball immediately pop out for an incompletion or interception, or your receiver getting injured, which, obviously is worse and than just taking an incompletion.

Again, Aikman is an ass, and James is fully responsible for that dirty hit, but yeah, QBs are expected to try to do their part to protect their receivers to an extent.

But my qualifications are just that I’m just an armchair QB who makes silly Paul Rudd gifs, so you know, grain of salt.

The Arrowhead record still stands.
