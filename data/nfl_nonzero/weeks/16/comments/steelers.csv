We drafted Kenny because we probably expected him to go earlier and didn‚Äôt want to roll into the season with just Mason at QB. I loved the Mitch signing when it happened and I love it even more now.

It‚Äôs been a quiet step forward by Tomlin that he‚Äôs getting the job done consistently against weaker opponents that‚Äôs mostly gotten overshadowed by Canada hate.

I think a lot of us, myself included, overreacted to the early L‚Äôs on a very front-loaded schedule and decided we‚Äôre a bad team, when in reality, we‚Äôre an extremely average team where a few bounces here and there are the difference between a wildcard spot and a top 10 pick.",0.0,steelers,t3_zvq29n,False,0.0,:tomlin1a::tomlin1b:Encroachment,2022-12-26T12:23:15Z,steelers,-0.22119453125

This is the reason Minkah was asked to play CB in Brian Flores defense in Miami but he is/was a bigger player and better suited to play safety and coming down on receivers and making hits or using his length and IQ to  defend passes in the deep half of the field.

I feel like Brian Branch is more comparable to Minkah but neither are the same caliber either physically or in terms of football IQ/awareness. I agree Malachi is probably a 3rd round pick but i would disagree on him being clearly labeled as a safety and rather teams view him as a potential year one starter at slot CB or at least immediate starter at ST.

A 2nd round pick for a slot CB would be far too rich for a team who generally looks for them as UDFAs but Cam Sutton played the slot for a while and was a 3rd rounder and looks like CB1. I just worry Moore doesnt have the athletic upside to play in the NFL at a high level.

I really like Ringo because of his size and ability to make up ground while in zone coverage or Gonzalez for just being hyper aggressive and a heady player who can jump routes for INTs (e.i Trevon Diggs)

I think its probably more of a wishlist than a realistic pick but i really like Brian Branch who plays safety/slot CB if he falls to the middle of the 2nd but i wouldnt take him sooner.

That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs questionable.

Ben had 2 accusers. One was proven false. So it turned into a 1 case thing, where he wasn‚Äôt found guilty, and was a ‚Äúhe said she said‚Äù kind of deal, where they eventually settled out of court. Because he settled, people can think or believe whatever they want. People will defend him, or people will call him a rapist. It is what he is. By definition, he‚Äôs not a rapist, and was a free man.

It‚Äôs a little different in a social context when 1 (again, technically 2, but one was PROVEN false), person accuses you of something, compared to 30+ people. By definition, Watson isn‚Äôt a rapist. He wasn‚Äôt convicted. If you read between the lines, no NFL player who has messages given to him free of cost at the teams facility is going out to 30+ different masseuses across the greater Houston area, where they all have different stories of him requesting/forcing sexual favours. 

The differences couldn‚Äôt be any more drastic. I‚Äôm more inclined to believe 1 person lied in Ben‚Äôs case, as opposed to 30+ lying about Watson. If Ben did rape the woman, he‚Äôs a piece of shit.
