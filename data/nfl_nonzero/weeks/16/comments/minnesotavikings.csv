2877,7853,7853,Ajax_Malone,"It’s easily the worst metic to compare eras. It doesn’t take into account context. From wiki:


> Total QBR takes each individual play and measures the expected points added (EPA) for each play. Since every play situation is different, there is a different value for EPA in each case. A team can expect a 0.9 net-point advantage when it is 1st down and 10 yards to go on their own 20 yard line. For the next play, suppose the team passes the ball 8 yards to reach their own 28 yard line on 2nd down and 2. The offense can now expect a 1.4 net-point advantage. EPA is the difference in the expected points at the start and end of a play. In this case it is 1.4 - 0.9 = 0.5 EPA. In a way, the offense has added a half point in potential score based on this play. Similarly, if a team loses yardage on a play, their EPA in that situation would be negative.


> Total QBR takes EPA and adjusts it based on the difficulty of the play. If a quarterback is under duress and avoids a sack to throw a 10-yard pass, Total QBR will reward the quarterback in those situations more than a 10-yard pass with much time to throw. In addition, it understands the importance of depth of target: the quarterback is rewarded more for a 40-yard pass compared to a 10-yard pass where the receiver ran for an extra 30 yards.


> There is a discount on trash time. A 40-yard pass as time expires (without scoring a touchdown or field goal) is much different from a 40-yard pass with enough time to score points.


> Total QBR takes into account the level of difficulty the opponent team's defense is based on the opponent's’ defensive FPI, among other factors.

Cousins is actually having his BEST statistic year here assuming he throws for at least another 200 yards.

  
Cook is on par with what he generally has in a healthy year

JJ's emergence has been dominant, to say the least. Theilen's demand for attention since Diggs left has caused JJ to get open more often, but JJ has formed into the most viable target in single coverage. 

  
Adam Theilen's ""regression"" has been due to target sharing and improving the team around him. He still gets open, he is just no longer the first look and that's okay. Fitz did the same thing in Arizona when they acquired more talent. Adam still sits in the pockets between the zones, but Cousins usually has already delivered the ball or been sacked by the time Theilen settles. That's at least what I'm seeing on the tapes.  


No surprise Kendricks and Smith are always near the top. Hicks was a surprise this year. If his coverage was better, he'd be one of the best LBs in the league, based on what I see. His match-ups are almost never favorable and he's often beaten in coverage by speed.

Longest pass thrown in a game was Mayfield 70.5 yards. I believe longest pass recorded was Culpepper in the pro bowl 76 yards. It’s incredibly rare for a QB to throw a 60+ air yard pass. Tua’s pass traveled 56 yards in the air. He took a crow hop but he also releases the ball incredibly quickly with a super fast motion and rotation. Likely because he was scrambling and trying to avoid being hit. Could he have led Tyreek into the end zone? Maybe. I’d like to see the whole route. But I guarantee this is definitely not the maximum throwing distance for Tua just based of his step and release.

And for scheming, does the player get the ball on RPO when the cb is 10 yards off of him?
