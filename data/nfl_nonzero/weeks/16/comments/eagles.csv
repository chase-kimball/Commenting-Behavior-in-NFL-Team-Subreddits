I get this mentality a bit but at the same time if you've never won one it stings like crazy.

But going entirely aggressive the whole time would not have been the answer either. Two back-breakers happened when the team either purposefully or accidentally played aggressive rather than “soft”.

The TD to Lamb came on a cover 3 where Slay didn’t do his job and tried to jump a short underneath route rather than do his “soft” sideline job.

The 3rd and 30 came because either Slay stupidly played a cover 4 like a cover 2 (underneath/trail coverage) or the playcall was cover 2. In either scenario, playing “softer” would have prevented it. 

People will make it one way or the other (that we play too soft). But really the story is that we were situationally not good. We played not soft enough in two different situations where deep balls killed us. And we played too soft in other scenarios that allowed Dak to pass too freely.

Then again, we got 6 sacks, a pick 6, and we forced the Cowboys into 15 3rd downs, of which they converted only 8 (and 1 of the remainders they converted on 4th). 

That’s honestly what we want from the defense. Force 3rd downs and then get stops. And we did that. Stopped them 7 times on 3rd down. Problem is they were usually in field goal range when it happened.

I frankly don’t understand the negativity after a loss like this. We had to play on the road against a very good team *without our league MVP quarterback.* Just think what would happen if this were the Vikings or Giants, or “any NFC team not named the 49ers” in our shoes. They’d get murdered. We know this because we already saw it happen.

But us? Not only did we nearly win, we *should* have won. We hurt ourselves with bad and untimely errors on both sides of the ball. Dallas was not the better team for most of the day.

Maybe you don’t see this as a consolation prize, but I see it this way: The Eagles have lost twice this year. The league currently has two formulas for beating us. They are: 1. Control the ball for 50 minutes, 2. Score 40 points and hope the Eagles make repeated unforced errors. And that’s what it takes to just *barely* beat us.

I only see one real negative out of this loss, and that’s the injuries. Hope Lane and Maddox and the others will be okay.

Relax, yall. We’re locking up the bye next week at home. We might get a rematch against Dallas soon enough. Maybe this time we’ll both have our *actual* quarterbacks, for once. I’m looking forward to it.
