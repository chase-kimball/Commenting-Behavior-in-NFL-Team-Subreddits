1885,18533,18533,Bieber_hole_69,"It's worked as well as anyone could have asked.

Not much else they could have done that off-season other than sign Brady instead, and I don't think anyone could have predicted he would be a better option than Tannehill after their respective 2019 seasons. They were a game away from the Super Bowl the year before and had one of the most efficient offensive stretches in NFL history to end the season, what option did they have other than run it back?

They had already franchise tagged Henry, so that wasn't an option for Tannehill.  So they signed him to a 4-year deal that paid him about as much per year as the franchise tag number was for 2020.

To put it into context, Teddy Bridgewater got $8.5M less AAV than what Tannehill got. Guarantees were bigger for Tannehill, but still shows his contract was a bargain compared to what QBs were getting on the open market at that time.

The only mistake was the restructure they gave him to fit Julio's contract under the cap in 2021, but even then if they had won a Super Bowl last year nobody would give a fuck about the restructure. And all it does is hamper their flexibility to cut him before next year, but even then it's still an option if they desperately want out.

They've gotten three years of mostly top-12 QB play for about top-12 QB money.

But outside the pocket and on the run when he can’t set his feet? There aren’t many that can sling it better than he can. It’s a specific kind of arm talent.

The issue then is that not every play can be off-schedule, and sometimes he panics and reverts to what he can do best even if it’s unnecessary to roll out of the pocket. And in the NFL you can’t play like that, you’re going to throw picks, take sacks, and your o-line are going to get holding penalties. When you have an elite o-line like he did at BYU, you can let every pass play develop for 6 seconds or whatever so his arm can shine, but that doesn’t fly in the NFL.

He can be great when the play breaks down, but not every play is going to break down. And he can’t succeed with the poor fundamentals he has in the pocket.

Sending away a potential 2022 MVP because you want to double down on the idea that you don't pay wid recievers giant contracts, was not only a terrible idea, it has been patently proven this year to be a grandpa idea of managing a football team let's look at the four teams that offloaded their superstar WR1 for money.

Chiefs - Alright.
Green Bay - fail
Baltimore - fail
Nashville - fail
Dallas - ok, maybe but imagine if they didn't

.AJ brown was the egregious example bx the damn finally broke. But Robinson has a provable track record that he preferred Value over Elite talent. Look at the people he let walk. Look at all the injured players he drafted high for the Discount. This isn't a strategy for 2020, it's a strategy for 1990.

He was both weirdly conservative in his search for value players, and loose and aggressive with his drafting guys already injured. It was a bad combo.

I mean...all these people freaking out about this game and saying ""fire everyone fire the players burn it all down""...you do realize that we can barely even field a full team at this point, right? How are you expecting us to win against normal (even bad) NFL teams with NFL players? Half our roster is practice squad guys. 

This sucks, but what can you expect? Just hope that Tanne and some other people make miraculous recoveries for week 18, and see what happens. This game and the Cowboys game are gonna be rough.
