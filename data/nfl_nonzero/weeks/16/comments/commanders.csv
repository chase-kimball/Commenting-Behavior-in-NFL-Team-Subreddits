""Where'd you grow up?""

""Dallas""

""Wait, like the football team?""

Imagine any conversation you've ever had about football, and it's pretty obvious that you're talking about football when you're talking about it. You don't accidentally switch subjects. 

""Man I love football""

""What's your favorite team?""

""Washington""

""Wait, like the bullets? They aren't even a team anymore!""

You've even had countless conversations with people who used the city name instead of their team's spirit animal, and fully understood it. You go every game with announcers saying cities instead of the specific cat the team has on their helmet. 

Likewise saying only a team name is fucking asinine in the same scenario of zero context. 

""What's your favorite sports team?""

""Lions""
