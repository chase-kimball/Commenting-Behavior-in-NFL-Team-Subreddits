2736,21318,21318,BtownBrelooms,"Extremely busy with the holidays so extremely short blurbs this week, hopefully I can have some good write-ups for the final regular season week. Hope everyone is having a great holidays! 

(Disclaimer: quite often my picks are based on ""feel"" over statistical proof. Similar to analytics, stats are merely a tool and not a guide to picking games. Sometimes you just have to trust your gut.)


Previous week: 13-3 (Overall 149-89-2) 


**__Week 17__**


 **Cowboys over Titans**: With NFC East title still an outside possibility, there's no way I see the Cowboys allowing themselves a letdown game. 


**Falcons over Cardinals**: After missing out on a Christmas upset, the tank rolls onwards. 


**Lions over Bears**: Wouldn't be surprised if the Bears played spoiler here but I'm personally rooting for and expecting a win-and-in for the Lions next week. 


**Chiefs over Broncos**: Is there a tiny bit of fear about a ""recently fired HC"" buff for the Broncos? Not really, I'm pretty sure everyone on the team has checked out or will after this week.


**Patriots over Dolphins**: The Tua situation has me very sad and honestly I think the season is pretty much sunk at this point. The dysfunctional Pats survive and remain playoff relevant for one more week. 


**Giants over Colts**: Giants are an optimistic reminder for the Colts that things can completely 180° in one season. But that's next season, Colts are garbage right now. 


**Eagles over Saints**: The ultra rare ""winning helps your draft selection"" game. In all seriousness, Eagles will take care of business and wrap up the division. 


**Panthers over Bucs**: Panthers are a tough team to overcome if they build an early lead on you and can bleed the game clock out. While Brady has been his best when behind this season, the stink of needing to overcome a 10-point deficit to best the Trace McSorely-led Cardinals still lingers. Brady will probably find a way to win but I'm not going to bet on it.


**Browns over Commanders**: In a weird way, I feel like the pressure is off the Browns now that the playoffs are impossible and we might start to see the team gel. Also Commanders making the switch from Heineke to Wentz has me a little nervous. 


**Jaguars over Texans**: Jaguars don't *need* this win to take the division but it would go a long way in making sure the culture shift instituted by Doug Pederson is a long-term one instead of a short-term one. 


**49ers over Raiders**: 49ers are hot and will continue to roll against a Raiders team that has a lot of self-reflecting to do in the off-season. 


**Jets over Seahawks**: With Mike White back, I expect an added energy from the Jets offense against a Seahawks team that seemingly has hit the ceiling and fading down the end stretch.


**Packers over Vikings**: I joked a few weeks ago about the media talking up the Packers after they start a win streak, but it is important to realize the Green Bay offense is finally getting healthy so this might be real. I see the Vikings dropping one more before the post-season and this one feels more likely than next week vs the Bears. 


**Rams over Chargers**: The Chargers have a playoff spot locked down, so wouldn't be surprised to see them let off the gas a little. Rams also probably want to remind the Chargers that SoFi is the Rams house and the Chargers are just tenants. 


**Steelers over Ravens**: Death. Taxes. Mike Tomlin getting a . 500 record or better. Memes aside, I think the Steelers get the victory to split the season series between these two rivals. 


**Bills over Bengals**: Complete toss-up game for me, don't really have a specific reason for this pick so I won't be surprised by either winning.",9.0,nfl,t3_zxe9tb,False,0.0,:Cardinals: Cardinals,2022-12-28T10:51:57Z,azcardinals,0.0120288516385683
2737,21319,21319,BtownBrelooms,"I think identity is the key word in why it has worked for Wilks in Carolina but it didn't in Arizona.

Wilks seems to embody the Panthers mantra ""Keep Pounding"" with a tough and physical style with a strong run game and a tough defense. Arizona was not ready for an identity switch from their explosive ""No Risk it, no Biscuit"" personality under Arians, which I'd argue is more finesse than power. It's also why the team immediately started improving under Kliff's Air Raid until the wheels fell off last winter.

Ultimately, I feel that Wilks wasn't a bad coaching candidate, but was instead the wrong one for our team, and that unfortunately hurt his reputation.

Also his refusal to play rookies and get them crucial snaps to help develop early in their careers is just asinine.

Kliff probably wants a prototypical yes man QB that will call the plays exactly as he schemes them up. Sit in the pocket, hit the open man. 

Kyler wants to win and as soon things don’t go well for a few drives in a row he’s going to start looking for the home run play and the hero ball stuff to try to get some momentum building. Hence the improvising and wanting more freedom at the LOS. 

Maybe I’m wrong but that’s just the impression I get from watching the games, especially on the sideline since you never see them interact positively.

> Those with inside knowledge of the Murray-Kingsbury dynamic say the once-close pair, whose relationship dates back 10 years to Murray's recruitment as a high school quarterback, have gone periods without much interaction.
> 
> ""It's not good,"" a team source said last month. ""It seems particularly bad this year.""
> 
> Before Murray's injury, another team source described their relationship as: ""They're cordial,"" adding, ""it's not the relationship you want from your quarterback and coach.""
> 
> Kingsbury and Murray did have a productive talk before a Week 13 matchup with the Chargers, with a team source saying they charted a plan and ""knew what was needed"" from each other.
> ""I'm not losing confidence. Never will,"" Murray said that week. ""The season hasn't gone the way we've wanted it to so far, but again, it's not over and that's got to be our focus.""
> 
> But Murray was late to a practice prior to the Week 14 meeting with the Patriots, a team source said, adding to Kingsbury's frustration with the quarterback.
> 
> Murray, who is slated for surgery around the start of 2023, has not commented publicly since the injury. The state of Murray's contract makes his return to the Arizona starting quarterback job a near necessity. Arizona gave Murray a $230 million contract extension before 2022, with a reasonable cap hit of $16 million against dead money of $97 million in 2023, which is considered prohibitive for a trade. The trade market for a player coming off a serious knee injury also likely wouldn't be robust.
> 
> Kingsbury has five years left on a contract that runs through 2027 and comes with a hefty buyout if Bidwill decides to move on. Typical coaching contracts are fully guaranteed, so if a coach gets fired he continues to get paid as if he's working -- or he and the team can agree on a lump-sum payment. And typical extensions kick in immediately as a new contract, a source familiar with coaching contracts around the league said.
> 
> Agent Erik Burkhardt, who represents Murray and Kingsbury, declined comment for this story.
> 
> And though Kingsbury has said all the right things about the team's efforts to turn it around with Murray back in charge in 2023, the promise of another tense season behind the scenes could be difficult to swallow, and Kingsbury is the more easily expendable of the duo.
> 
> If allowed to stay, Kingsbury will likely need to outline to Bidwill his plan to fix the Cardinals' mess and ""really talk about what's happened,"" a team source said.
> 
> ""Changes need to be made,"" a source close to Murray said.
> WHILE THE FUTURE of the quarterback and head coach's relationship is at a crossroads, so is Keim's relationship with the team.
> 
> Whether Keim, who essentially hand-picked Kingsbury and sold him on coaching the Cardinals, is back in 2023 after his leave of absence ends is another question looming over the franchise. His decade-long tenure as Arizona general manager is an amalgam of bold productivity and curious missteps. Keim's rosters have yielded four double-digit-wins seasons -- including three with the Bruce Arians-Carson Palmer marriage that Keim helped orchestrate -- but he also missed badly on quarterback Josh Rosen, the No. 10 overall pick in the 2018 draft. The second head coach Keim helped hire, Steve Wilks, was fired after one season. Off the field, Keim pleaded guilty to an ""extreme DUI"" charge in 2018, serving a five-game suspension and paying a $200,000 fine.
> 
> A common refrain leaguewide is Keim has ""nine lives"" as Cardinals GM, a survivor in a field with typically little room for error. But league observers are curious whether Bidwill is disenchanted enough to clean house -- and pay enormous buyout money on contracts for the head coach and general manager that run through 2027.
> 
> Billionaire owners, beneficiaries of the league's massive television contracts, seem less worried about picking up the tab on hefty contracts for coaches and executives than for players such as Murray. By way of example, Tennessee Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk fired general manager Jon Robinson in early December, 10 months after extending his contract.
> 
> By most accounts, Keim and Bidwill maintained a strong relationship for years, but that has soured this season, said a source with direct knowledge of the team's inner workings. The roster is largely unspectacular outside of the high-end talent at the skill positions, with one player named to the Pro Bowl in 2022. That falls on Keim's doorstep.
> 
> As for Murray, his recovery and rehab is the priority for an organization that invested hundreds of millions in a franchise quarterback. By the time offseason workouts start in April, Murray might be the only one of the triumvirate left with the Cardinals.
> All of this will fall on Bidwill to clean up. Would he target a high-end coaching candidate such as Sean Payton, who is believed in league circles to be seeking a high level of personnel oversight? Does Bidwill promote from within if the general manager job is open, or does he hire an external candidate for the first time since 1994 when his father, Bill, named Buddy Ryan head coach and general manager?

> That date would mark the peak of the Kingsbury era. Since then, Arizona has gone 5-14 in regular season games without recording back-to-back wins over that span. Ten of those 14 losses have come at home.

> 
> While the Cardinals struggled in all three phases during 2021's concluding stretch, it was Kingsbury's version of the Air Raid offense, brought with him from the college game at Texas Tech, that received scrutiny as Arizona faltered.
> 
> The offense, designed to attack vertically and ranked sixth and eighth in the NFL the previous two seasons, has fallen to 21st in the league this year. Nearly every offensive starter has missed significant time because of injury, and several offensive coaches have been let go. Three of the team's five opening day offensive line starters are currently on injured reserve.
> 
> All of this has made Kingsbury ""miserable"" this season, a team source said.
> 
> ""We're not built to run Kliff's offense right now, and it kills him,"" the source said.
> 
> Screens, short passes and good decisions from the quarterback can force defenses to loosen up and allow Murray, or whomever is playing quarterback, to win over the top with outside targets. But the scheme has become predictable at times, some NFL coaches and defensive players who faced Arizona told ESPN, and when the Cardinals can't run the ball effectively, it's easier to take the other elements away.
> 
> Another core issue fueling division was Murray's feelings about the offense.
> 
> 
> While one source close to Murray said the quarterback wanted more freedom at the line of scrimmage, particularly with running plays, multiple sources said plays designed to get certain playmakers the ball often didn't come to fruition, either due to miscommunication, a play breaking down or Murray improvising, and the disjointed attack created unpredictability for some of the team's pass-catchers.

> In addition to the on-field issues, clashing personalities began to doom the Kingsbury-Murray relationship, trickling down to the rest of the locker room, as 2021 spiraled downward, and continuing into 2022.
> 
> Kingsbury has been labeled a players' coach over the years by many on his staff and in the locker room. He's well liked and has support among his players. Conversely, Kingsbury's aversion to confrontation chafed some players at times.
> 
> As one longtime ex-Cardinals player said, Kingsbury's go-to line in meetings, especially after bad performances, was that ""everybody has to play better."" While that approach fosters good relations, the player said, calling out bad performances by name can be necessary at times.
> 
> ""It's a very comfortable work environment, but he won't rip anybody, and if the head coach won't do it, it's hard for the offensive guard to do it,"" the player said. ""I think that's some of what's gone on with the QB."" A team source added that Kingsbury's personality doesn't lend to calling players out.

14047,123402,123402,SerShanksALot,"> TEMPE, Ariz. -- Two days before the Arizona Cardinals were eliminated from playoff contention after a lifeless 24-15 loss to the woeful Denver Broncos on Sunday, Kliff Kingsbury was asked a question in a year full of them.
> 
> ""You've been obviously a head coach for a minute now here and at Texas Tech ..."" the question began before the fourth-year head coach interrupted.
> 
> ""Ten years,"" Kingsbury pointed out, referring to six years in Lubbock and four in Arizona.
> 
> ""It feels like 100,"" he added.
> 
> The weight of the past few seasons -- especially this one -- has taken its toll on the 43-year-old Kingsbury to the point that multiple people close to him have openly wondered whether he would walk away after the season.
> 
> There is also a very real possibility that Kingsbury, with a 28-34-1 head-coaching record in the NFL and without a playoff win during his tenure, will be fired by owner Michael Bidwill, though multiple team sources see a path where Bidwill gives Kingsbury another year, due in part to injuries ravaging the roster and a personnel department in flux.
> 
> Kingsbury's future with the Cardinals has long been rooted in his relationships with three key people -- quarterback Kyler Murray, general manager Steve Keim and Bidwill. All three of those relationships have soured to varying degrees the past two years.
> Murray was lost for the season when he tore his ACL in his right knee three plays into a Monday night loss to the New England Patriots on Dec. 12. That event occurred after Murray and his head coach had grown increasingly distant throughout Arizona's disappointing 4-10 season, according to multiple Cardinals sources.
> Two days after the Patriots loss, the team lost its general manager when Keim took a health-related leave of absence. Keim's short- and long-term future with the team is still unknown.
> 
> Whatever the circumstances, multiple sources said Keim had far less of a presence in the building in 2022 than in years past, making it challenging for the head coach and general manager to coalesce on personnel matters.
> 
> Keim was not made available for comment on this story.

> The decision about Kingsbury's future, and the direction of the organization, will fall to Bidwill. Multiple sources inside and outside the Cardinals organization said the relationship between Kingsbury and Bidwill has not been without its own share of tension, though the two men, along with defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, regularly meet for film sessions and one-on-one postgame meetings.
> 
> 
> But given the on-field results, any semblance of a relationship with Cardinals ownership might not be enough to save Kingsbury.
> 
> ""They hold him accountable for wins and losses,"" a source close to Kingsbury said, before contending that Kingsbury hasn't received the resources he believes are necessary to win.
> 
> A source close to Kingsbury said the coach wanted to fire offensive line coach/run game coordinator Sean Kugler well before he was dismissed last month for allegedly groping a woman before a game in Mexico City, a claim Kugler is disputing through NFL arbitration.
>
> Kugler suddenly lost opportunities to contribute to offensive planning meetings months ago, according to a source close to Kugler, but the belief from multiple Cardinals sources was that Bidwill didn't want to pay Kugler's contract buyout. Kingsbury loyalists cite the situation as evidence of the coach's limited control in Arizona.
> 
> ""He knows that it's not a situation that lends itself to him being happy and successful and at his best for that organization, which he wants to be,"" a source close to Kingsbury said. ""They won't let him. They won't let him be great.""
> 
> Bidwill has also directly questioned the effort of players -- generally the domain of the coaching staff -- telling the team in a recent scene captured on ""HBO Hard Knocks"": ""I'm as f---ing disappointed as everyone else in this room. I can see who's really doing it. I can also see where people are sometimes cutting corners.""
> 
> The poor performance of the team, the fractured leadership structure and the deteriorating relationships mean it would not be a surprise if time was called on the Kingsbury era in Arizona, via either a firing or the coach stepping down in the coming weeks.
