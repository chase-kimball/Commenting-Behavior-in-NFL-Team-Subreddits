After that game, Mac played some really sound football for about 6 weeks which he won‚Äôt get credit for, up until the Raiders game where he perhaps played the worst game of his career. Mac certainly has a lot of issues, his pocket presence is not good at all, and he started the season making a lot of mental errors, but he really hasn‚Äôt had a real chance. He‚Äôs been dealing with a bottom 5 receiving core, pretty bad o line, an atrocious play calling in his second year. This doesn‚Äôt excuse his play this year, but he deserves another chance next year with a viable weapon to throw to and play caller. As far as the character concerns, he is certainly in a frustrating situation but he needs to get his act together and be a composed leader for his team, and the people mad at him for not tackling Chandler Jones are a bit ridiculous. Mac probably is going to be a Tua or Jimmy G type quarterback in his career, which is enough to lead a competitive team with help around him but he won‚Äôt elevate a roster.

It's not the only thing that matters, I mean look at Calvin Johnson, but Tua got better with Hill, Allen got better with Diggs, Eagles and their WR1, and look at the regression of GB losing Adam's.

15689,139290,139290,Perswayable,"Stamina and wear and tear. I‚Äôd make the argument our CB needs are more pressing than WR due to Jones and Mills. We also have no real reliability with the position due to Gilmore and Jackson leaving. However, Meyers is the best we got right now and losing him is not good without a replacement plan and I don‚Äôt find Jones to be the solution but rather an addition. 

Meyers may absolutely be overpaid. If you want 2 of the best WRs in the upcoming draft, you‚Äôd probably need a top 12 draft pick to acquire Addison or Johnston (I prefer Johnston due to 6‚Äô4 and 215lbs part of TCU and Addison more slot worthy). If we lose both games, we have a shot if the argument is we need a WR. This leads to OL concerns because regardless of which WR we acquire, it means nothing without more protection. So, at minimum, we would need to focus our attention on two OL positions and a WR1 which none are really available in FA. Beckham is, but after 2 ACL injuries and him somehow wanting $20 million a year, he may not be viable for that price. If we could get him for $12-13 then our focus could be on OL.

 Bill will need to decide whether we invest defense heavy or offense heavy. Offense heavy will require a lot, and I mean a lot, of repairs. But free agency looks relatively bad for OL and WR unles you think Juju is a WR1 which I do not.

So, turning him into a WR and drafting rookie CBs and expecting them to be first day starters probably wouldn‚Äôt be reasonable. Admittedly, I do not know enough about CB FA, and even then OL is a concern for such a young and promising QB and RB",6.0,patriots,t3_zv7xdc,False,0.0,:3-28:,2022-12-25T16:15:01Z,patriots,0.0250959655756414

15692,139294,139294,Perswayable,"Not sure which direction I feel we should be going in. Losing to divisional teams and not making the playoffs really sucks, but dropping from a potential 12th pick overall to 18th at a minimum hurts. Before this weekend we were 17th and now dipped to 14th with Steelers and Green-bay winning. In the draft, a lot of edge, DI, and QBs will be selected earlier. My hypothesis is, because we need a OL or WR a high pick guarantees a really highly graded position player in at least one of those positions. I‚Äôd argue Bill would not trade down. If we dip below 12th, you start losing the the best 2 WRs (Addison and Johnston), the 2 best OL (Debate between Paris or Peter Skoronski). However, on the plus side, trading down, ogives a decent amount of remaining CBs or off picks such as the top RB, safety, or TE. You could probably go even lower for the remaining OL or WRs. My analysis is probably underestimating the third WR available, which is Jaxon Smith. So, maybe the position isn‚Äôt as important as I‚Äôm arguing with the way the mock drafts are going (Unreliable). 

Top QBs possibly 5 in first round or so, 3 in top 11.
Top RB is not projected until 25th or so.
Top WRs  there are 3-4 in first round projected 
Top TE projected top 16
Top CBS 4 in first round 
Top safety projected around 24th and the next best isn‚Äôt until 55+

Tl;dr: If you want the best WR/OL in terms of projections, you want a top 12 pick. If not, it probably doesn‚Äôt matter since we aren‚Äôt going for QB or Edge probably.

15706,139310,139310,Perswayable,"1. Bourne is not a true WR1. We need to stop perpetuating the lack of a true WR1. Look at teams such as Dolphins and Bills and the increase in QB performance when a True WR1 was acquired. Look at Greenbay slacking because they lost their true WR1. Look at how easy it is for Purdy to score with offensive weapons when he was literally the last person drafted this year. We could get away with no true WR1 when we had Edelman as a God slot, Gronk as a God TE, and Brady as a GOAT QB‚Ä¶not to mention Prime slater God special teams and God Adam V as a kicker when we still couldn‚Äôt score. WRs like Meyers and Bourne will catapult even further when CBs drop in quality because top CB needs to focus on an actual WR1. 

2-3. I agree with.

No one on this sub with like me saying this, but I hope we actually pick up Beckham. No top WRs will probably drop to us in the draft, there is low quality in that position this year, and FA WRs are not good. Pretty sure Bourne is a top WR FA. At least Beckham is taking the right amount of time to heal (Actual research suggests 18-24 months for healing for his injury) and, due to no other real threats, we have a lot of money available next year.

1-2: Relocate Patricia to a role he actually has experience in. 

3. No chance Quentin Johnson will be available for us. We are projected for 14th overall, but if we lose the last two we realistically could hit between 10-12. There was a 2.6% chance according to ESPN before today‚Äôs game we‚Äôd have a top 10 pick (8th probably the highest). Even then, not sure he would be on the board. Number 1 WR dropping to position 12 is nearly improbable, but it would depend on what Houston does with their second pick securing either number 1 OL or number 1 WR to help cooks who is currently pissed. This is all because their first, first draft pick will probably be QB.

4. Orlando Brown Jr can be franchised a second time with Kansas City if they do not secure a big deal. He may not be eligible, then. Not sure if he‚Äôd throw a fuss though because he did stall training camp stuff and Kansas needs to be worried about destroying rapport. [edit Jenkins was extended and will not be a FA] Another top OL hitting free agency would be Packer‚Äôs Jenkins, but he is also coming off injury and Packers could tag him too, I think.

5. I do not know much of this one. 

6. Relocate. 

7. And, not to mention, former experience in Pays system! I agree with this one. 

8. Root for the Raiders tonight, if they win that helps our draft stock. If we lose the next two games, there is a slight chance we could draft top 12 and secure the top OL who is currently right now scoring the highest pass block rating in PFF‚Äôs 8 year college tracking history. I agree. Build through draft. But, it‚Äôs also going to matter who is available in both. As an example, if we can secure Beckham Jr, draft top OL. THE WRs will probably be gone unless we are top 10 pick and even then I‚Äôd still making the argument our OL is our BIGGEST weakness. 


Build OL secures safety with QB throwing, increases holes for our run game, and securing one dominant WR will increase deep ball threat, improve screen passes due to dropped coverage. We may lose Henry after next year (Post 2024) due to his costs and can‚Äôt rely on the additional help for blocking.

I'd rather be pissed at Thorton missing long ball catches, and giving him the experience to improve as well as the offense, than frustration with the same outside sweep or 2 yard passes at 3rd and 15. 

But, also with that being said, we had four offensive weapons out (Harris, Henry, Parker, and Smith) and it really showed how abysmal the offensive line is. 

We have a second year quarterback with atrocious OL, atrocious play calling, limited real offensive weapons with no true WR1, and we have the balls to ask for Zappe. There is a reason Brady left and this was foreshadowing. 

If we invest in 2 OL and a true WR1, I genuinely will die on the, ""we will look great"" hill. It opens up the run game to a promising RB and gives Mac real weapons similar to what Eagles, Allen, and Tua needed in order to shine. Hell, even Mahomes has Kelce.

I excluded goal-to-go plays, but there are some weird ones in those situations as well.

30847,303408,303408,samacora,"Not particularly true. Especially in the modern day of rugby, a bit like NFL, field position is king so you will have teams get in to kicking battles to win the territory battle and then attack from there. 

And the key way to get the ball back in rugby is through ""winning the tackle"" as it's called. Which means knocking the player back in the hit rather than losing ground, as losing ground in the hit allows the attacking team to do a more efficient ruck, which leads to quicker ball back to the scrumhalf and inevitably quicker ball back out to the players to exploit numbers in the line. And then obviously the gaining of ground. Where if you win the tackle you force the team back and then eventually force them to kick from an non advantageous position and gives you good field position to attack from 

I would argue that the ""real"" reason for a disparity in hit ""power"" or collision ""power"" is the pads and the down system in the NFL. The down system allows NFL teams to have rest periods in between plays they are also allowed sub out players back and forth if they tire. So when a player goes in they have the pads and rule set that allows them to literally go full pace all out every play and torpedo into anyone with no control, there is no downside to being overly heavily, in a lot of cases players are **encouraged** to pack on as much extra weight as they can to add weight to hits. Whereas in rugby there is no team for defense, team for offense and team for special teams, the 15 players that start do it all with no rest period after every play which means that there must be a balance between being heavy strong fast and fit. An NFL O line or D line for example wouldn't be able to last a half in a rugby match without being out on their feet and being exploited by the opposition in the attack. 

Add to that the ruleset and pads in rugby compared to NFL and the players are encouraged to win collisions with technique and timing rather than brute uncontrolled power as this is learned behaviour from being a kid up. You learn how to hit hard while protecting yourself and the other player from injury for obvious self protection reasons but also so you don't let your team down by giving away fouls in the tackle box constantly and if you do you won't make it far anyway

So I think the differences are more nuanced than that as are the reasons behind the hits we are talking about",2.0,nfl,t3_zxe430,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-12-28T15:20:04Z,patriots,0.02387941463504

30851,303413,303413,samacora,"Yea I've said it a lot and people always get weirdly and stupidly defensive over it. But how tackling in American football from college up to pro is either taught, encouraged and or glorified has just led to a situation of really inconsistent quality of tackling. It's genuinely shocking to me how bad some NFL players tackling technique is.

But I think this comes directly down to the core rules around NFL tackling in general plus having the helmets. 

In rugby it's a penalty if you tackle someone and don't attempt to wrap your arms. Whereas in the NFL you can, essentially, torpedo into someone with your head aimed out of the way not really looking. And this seems to be the default go to for a lot of players, especially anyone looking to make a ""big"" hit. As the padding is taking all the damage and you'll more than likely be fine between your helmet and upper pads. But what this has lead to is people just launching like missiles that have no last minute aiming and zero control so if a player jukes, slips or is tackled you can end up nearly decapitating someone. 

The hit on Herbert, last yea I think, is a perfect example, dude lines up his shot torpedo's and looks away, Herbert at the same time gets tackled from behind , drops a few inches and then gets decapitated by the torpedo which is now lined up with his head even though it was initially aimed at his chest.

But the Tua situation is different when you look at his first concussion that started this train, but rugby rules also cover this as whiplash concussion are well known about. It's illegal to whip a player to the ground on purpose like that DLine did. And I don't care what anyone says you don't get that much velocity to the ground unless you are purposefully whipped and whipped as hard and fast as the Dline could manage. It's the tacklers responsibility to safely complete the tackle in rugby 


But the NFL argument on the other side is, if we don't get him down quick and he makes a pass as the defender is slowly placing him on the ground then it's all for naught. And given that qbs are pushing the rules and getting away with extra yards on things like runs to slides and skirting the sidelines to get more yards before going out (mahomes cough cough) I can see the defensive side of the argument that says fuck that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's what happens when you try and patchwork fix things with here and there for years rather than making proper genuine upgrades through rule sets and rule interpretations. I think at this stage the NFL should just disband it's competition authority and just carbon copy the RFUs because when you look at both over the same span of time.

30852,303415,303415,samacora,"In rugby the protocols would basically nearly force this at this stageof severity. If you sustain a certain amount of concussions in a short timeframe you are forced to take extended leave until your brain is fully recovered. It's crazy that in the NFL they just roll over the same redundant concussion protocol no matter how many you've had in a certain period of time. 

It's like the opposite of how proper care works. Concussions are cumulative based. The more you have over a shortened period of time the exponentially worse it gets and is for you. 

Iike in rugby this Tua situation would have never ever occured to this level. He would have been ruled out to play for at least one of the games he got another head injury and would already be out for the rest of the season probably now.
