15142,86924,86924,OpabiniaGlasses,"Calling those moves ""bad decisions"" really sells them short for how terrible they are. 

We're talking about one of the worst coaching hires in NFL history in Hackett. He's about to be a one-and-done embarrassment and I do not trust the guy who hired him to make the decision on who the next head coach should be. Especially when we know who Paton did interview (Hackett, O'Connell and Dan Quinn) and didn't interview (Daboll and McDaniel) for head coach.

We can argue about hindsight when it comes to trading for Russ. Personally, it was the #2 option I favored behind drafting a QB and ahead of trading for Rodgers (of the most-talked about QB moves they could have made in the off-season). But Paton made an evaluation on Russ and pulled the trigger on that trade. Obviously there's injuries and offensive coaching incompetence working against Russ, but there's still plenty of things that are still his fault alone, regardless of the situation around him. We judge GMs all the time for their ability to evaluate players and there's no getting around that Paton completely failed in evaluating Russ.

Even before Russ played a game and seeing how badly it's gone, there was no benefit to Paton signing him to that contract extension. We've seen so many QBs completely fall off a cliff in their late-30s. Locking up a 34 year old QB to a long term deal, with term still left on his current contract, is just a bad move. I'm sure part of Russ agreeing to the trade was having an extension drawn up for him, I get that. But that gets back to Paton's evaluation that the draft assets and cap space was worth it for Russ. Again, he failed.
