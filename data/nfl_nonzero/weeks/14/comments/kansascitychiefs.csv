Yeah thats what I was talking about here. They usually have no idea whats going on. 

>I'd be curious what the definition of a rugby punt is. Do you have to run outside the tackles? Do you just have to deviate from a straight line? By how much?

One of the major, glaring faults of the NFL rulebook and how it relates to fans is that there is a lot of tribal knowledge needed to be known to really make sense of the rules. The NCAA rulebook is much better about this. To demonstrate in this example, the NCAA rulebook rugby style is not even mentioned and the protection is in the tackle box. 

The NFL rule book is basically making the distinction from a traditional punt (catch, 3 steps directly forward, kick) and ""rugby style"" punt (basically anything else besides 3 steps, kick). Rugby style in this sense is because rugby players popularized running a bit before punting as opposed to standing kicks. This punt in particular is indisputably rugby style since it was caught on the left hash and kicked on the right hash, but I can see the confusion as it's not really defined in the rulebook. 

All kicking coaches at this level know the difference between a traditional kick and a rugby kick, and that this is a rugby kick.

The purpose of the rule is when a punter takes off running, its impossible for defenses to tell whether he is going to run or punt the ball, so the punter forfeits protections so they can't fake a run an get a cheap roughing penalty. They still get protection under a traditional punt. 

Its the same concept as for passers if you ignore the whole ""passing posture"" thing that was added a few years ago, and since punting is something you can do pretty much at full speed, its tough to define a ""punting posture"".

8879,63744,63744,DoomTrain166,"I get everyone saying ftr because ftr, but for me personally, hating a team is about whether or not that team does things that are worthy of my hatred. No one in the division does anything hate worthy because they're not currently a challenge. They're like your little brother every time you kick their ass at smash bros. Non threatening and kinda fun. 

So then when I look around the league I look at some of our other rivals. In years past it was definitely the patriots. Man my hatred for the patriots ran deep. But now it's like when you grow up and make a shit ton of money after going to college and you come back and you see your high school bully working at subway at 40. It's just kinda sad. You don't necessarily feel bad but you feel like justice was served and the world is right again. 

So that leaves 4 possible teams for me. 1 is the bills but I feel like that mainly comes from their fanbase. But by and large, we own that team. So I'm kinda meh. 

Next is the Bengals and while they do own us right now, I don't feel like they've done much to warrant hate outside of just them showing up to play us. (Side note I used to really think Joe burrow was cool, but he's starting to rub me the wrong way specifically with how dismissive and condescending I felt he was being to mahomes after he congratulated him but I digress)

Next is the Bucs. For obvious reasons. And i think they are the winner here for me. 

But lastly the dark horse candidate for my hatred is the browns. Everything sucks about the browns. From their front office, to their spineless coach to their rapist qb to their fanbase. When we played them last year Holy shit was their fanbase more toxic than I ever saw bills fans and that had stuck with me.

During Gronk's tenure with NE, the 3 seasons where they had the most rushing yards Gronk played in 11, 7, and 13 games. Most rushing TDs? Gronk played in 11, (7, 16, & 8 tied) and 13 games.

That said, I think we've lost any 'fear factor' we mightve had, and should have with our record, after that.

We've got a relatively nice schedule coming up, but I think those teams will be looking at today's tape and feeling that we're beatable.

Spags/Bienamy aside, on both our offence and defence we need to learn how to control and shut out games. Time and time again this season we've thrown away leads with stupid plays or total lapses in concentration.

Mahomes is one of the best QBs in the league, and a generational talent, but he seems to spiral in games and get into his own head, resulting in silly mistakes and interceptions. We need to get better at controlling that, taking the downs while they're there and trusting the run game more.

Spags' D tends to be at its best in the playoffs against other high-octane offenses, where all you need him to do is just create 3-4 punts and the game is yours. It tends to look it's worst when the team is trying to protect a lead against cupcakes. Prevent defense is just not what this team is designed to do.

One other thing: The Chiefs are very, very disciplined about putting things on tape. There are certain plays that Andy will run once and then never again, so that future teams can't prepare for them through film study. I don't know for sure that Spags does the same, but I think he does.

55979,393453,393453,tk_fourtwentyone,"Washington and NYG's toughest games are week 18 against the Cowboys and Eagles, respectively. In all likelihood, those 2 teams will be benching most of their starters, assuming no crazy seeding scenarios develop between now and then. Philly is virtually a lock for the #1, which means Dallas is virtually a lock for the first WC spot.

Washington and NYG play each other, so whoever wins that game (please god, not another draw...) is almost certainly in the playoffs too. Giants have the Colts remaining, Washington has Cleveland remaining. Both games those teams should win.

All of that is not even to consider the Seahawks, who are 2 games ahead of GB (with 4 to play), and the Lions who are 1 ahead of GB. GB would have to go to like 4th-step tiebreaker scenarios to get into the playoffs over Detroit.

All of *that* is not even to consider there are 2 other 5-8 teams alongside GB

So assuming Washington or NYG get in, that leaves 1 final WC spot up for grabs between the other of those 2, or Seattle, or Detroit.

I also don’t think Spags is the problem on defense. We just don’t have many impact guys on that side of the ball. Jones is great, but the only consistent pass rush threat. Sneed, McDuffie, and Williams are fine CBs but very young. Karlaftis has a hell of a motor, but he’s young and inconsistent at finishing his pressures.

The D is about what I expected it to be. Not great. At times will look really good, at times really bad. I expected this to be a multi year defensive rebuild.
