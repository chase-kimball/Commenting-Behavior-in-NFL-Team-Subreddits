1906,18563,18563,Bieber_hole_69,"In addition, it may be something the Falcons training/medical staff said he didn't need to have done but his own outside doctor said was necessary.

This was also a thing with Mariota in 2018 with the Titans. Mariota suffered a stinger in Week 11 that was then reaggravated in Week 16. He didn't finish the game in Week 16. The next week was a win-and-in game against the Colts, and heading into the weekend it seemed like he was trending to play after practicing on Thursday and Friday. The coaching staff seemed pretty optimistic he would play.

He ended up being cleared to play by the team's medical staff, but an independent spine specialist advised him and the team to not have him play as it would risk further damage that may impact his future career.

Nobody doubts Mariota's toughness playing through all his injuries in 2018, but there seemed to still be questions around the organization about what all went down to keep him from playing in that game with the season on the line. If it was a business decision, I don't blame him for doing it but I can see where people in the building would be more than a bit perturbed that their QB wasn't out there for that game after looking like he was going to play as late as Friday.

It just so happens that Arthur Smith was in the building when all of that went down. I can see a scenario where Smith is agitated that Mariota is seemingly doing it again. To Smith it may look like Mariota is throwing a fit after getting benched and finding a way to be away from the team while using the excuse that he needs a surgery that the internal medical staff in Atlanta does not think he needs, or at least needs urgently.

Mariota could provide some pointers to Ridder if he was in the building at practice every day, and he's opting out of that while still getting paid. It also may not be the best look for the locker room that a veteran QB brought to the team because of his familiarity with Smith just up and left the team after getting benched.

There was also a conflictingly sourced rumor around that time Mariota was benched for Tannehill in October 2019 that he would be going to IR for an injury sustained in the pre-season. This didn't end up happening, but there seemed to at least be chatter from the building that Mariota may end up on IR at that time, which would have been remarkably similar to what did end up happening in 2022. Mariota gets benched and leaves the team, citing an injury that wasn't a problem while he was the starter as being an urgent issue that needs addressed. If there was any real chatter in the Titans org at that time in 2019 of Mariota getting IR'd, I can see where Smith is frustrated that it appears Mariota just went ahead and fucked off from the team after getting benched like he tried to do three years ago.

This is all speculation and conjecture of course, and I don't blame Mariota at all for being with his newborn and getting chronic injuries taken care of. But I can also see where Smith and the Falcons org may be frustrated that their veteran QB, brought in ostensibly to be a leader in the locker room, just decided to leave the team out of nowhere right after he got benched.",7.0,nfl,t3_zlvmsd,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-12-14T15:25:15Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0339694663672153
1907,18569,18569,Bieber_hole_69,"it’s reductive to approach a situation like the AJB trade with just a, “cui bono,” analysis, but c’mon who benefited more in this situation than AJ himself?

He got the exact contract he wanted from a team in a much bigger market that’s built to contend and has his best friend at QB. He got everything he could have ever wanted and more with the trade.

This isn’t a view of the situation that’s incongruent with the same man that proclaimed his love of the Titans and his desire to play for this team his whole career before knee surgery in 2021. Who would ever turn down a trade that gave him so much? I can 100% see a situation where his agent had been in contact with Howie Roseman and a deal had been hammered out in advance that was identical to the best contract the Titans could possibly offer. 

In that situation, who would agree to a deal with the team that couldn’t offer perks like a major media market and his best friend throwing the ball? AJB’s earning potential for endorsements increased exponentially the moment he was traded to Philly. He got the world with the trade, why would he ever give the Titans a hometown discount or be willing to work with the franchise to stay?

I think JRob was way too hasty to deal AJ if he was at all willing to stay for the right price, but I can see why he felt the need to make a deal while there was plenty of value and a guy like Burks on the board still to fill an immediate need.

AJ was my favorite player in the league, I completely get why everyone is still upset by the trade. I was close to vomiting when the news came across in April that he was gone, I was 100% convinced he would be here for life, but shit happens. I’m just glad I was waiting to buy his jersey until an extension was finalized, because I was absolutely planning on that being my first new Titans jersey purchase since my 2014 Locker jersey.

JRob could have survived the AJB trade and more if he just hit on the 2020 and 2021 drafts. The AJB trade was just the nail in the coffin for him.",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_zhuask,False,0.0,11,2022-12-11T02:38:53Z,tennesseetitans,0.0027564883205271

1) for Bowen, it's important to remember Harold Landry got hurt after preseason but before week 1. Harold is possibly the most important member of the defense at least in regard to scheme. So it makes sense why we struggled initially while figuring out a backup plan, then succeeded with the backup plan, then the backup plan failed once our D got as injured as it is.

2) for downing being different from Bowen, it's important to remember he already had a shot before this. Bowen had never been a DC before. Downing was in Oakland as other people have pointed out and the trajectory of the offense in Oakland almost directly matches the one here: top of the league turned worst in the league in less time than a Lambo goes 0-60.

10148,67794,67794,JGspot,"A collection of notes:
- Dennis Daley should be off the team NOW

- props to the coaching staff for finally starting to completely cut Swaim out of the picture. His only play I remember yesterday was the chop block which may get him chopped from the team

- yesterday wasn't downing's fault per se because of the turnovers but he also didn't do anything to try and alleviate the stress of missing treylon. I mean Derrick had 90+ yards by the first quarter and you only get him the ball 8 times in the other 3 quarters combined. And one of those was the insane direct snap to him. We actually were doing a decent job at run blocking for once. I get some of that was because of the jags lead but maybe if we kept running the lead wouldn't have gotten so big. I've never seen an offensive coordinator completely move away from anything that works game by game the way TD does on a weekly basis. He still should be fired ASAP.

- Vrabel is annoying at press conferences, I've gotta stop listening. I put this on twitter in response to Vrabel's comments on Chig but it literally is so predictable and just a bunch of nothing:
""Vrabel press conferences are groundhogs day.
- gotta coach better gotta play better
- next man up
- X did some good things but also made mistakes (when player had great game)
- you know X deserves a lot of credit for *insert random one off play* (when player had horrendous game)""

That's it. Those are the 4 press conference lines.

In fact the only reports that have been any different were supposed leaks from “inside sources” aka the titans PR department in a knee jerk attempt to save face AFTER Aj’s interview with TD. AJ had no reason to lie he was gone, he got paid, he got what he wanted according to those who believe he never wanted to be here. However the Titans desperately needed to save face and the firing of jrob is a continuation of that. 

So you can always attempt to discredit whoever you want no one knows the full truth besides Jrob and maybe the figures are slightly different but the owner of this franchise fired a successful GM days after the team got skull fucked by Aj Brown and the eagles and it wasn’t because he had done a stellar job lately and to act like the biggest indication of that WASN’T trading away the best Wr in franchise history is as naive as it is ignorant.",2.0,tennesseetitans,t3_zhuask,False,1.0,:1::6:BentforBurks:Burks:,2022-12-10T11:56:48Z,tennesseetitans,-0.052842784

29260,161521,161521,TySoprano,"Actually yes Jrob was the one forcing them. He paid Swaim and gave Vrabel two TE’s who could block on a team with an OL so bad they have to constantly run heavy sets and both gotta play. The third TE he was given us a Wr basically who can not under any circumstances play Y down TE. 

Jrob traded a 5th round pick for Daley to be the back up LT. That’s what they have to work with that’s who has to play. Because the other guy he got was Radunz who he wasted a second round pick on that had played one FBS game in 2 years and hasn’t translated at all he’s a terrible run blocker prolly the worst of the group, on a run first team. 

So yes Jrob has in fact forced all of that based on personnel decisions HE made which is why he is no longer here. 

How do we know Vrabel can evaluate talent? Because so far every report we’re getting says Vrabel had distinctly lobbied against moves like signing beasly and Daley and jrob by all accounts ignored them and signed who he wanted and said “win with them”

29282,161543,161543,TySoprano,"Nah the move was fine at the time Lewan had just finished the season strong and healthy, Saffold and Ben were younger and healthy and Nate davis finished the year strong despite a bad start. The OL looked set for a few years and you couldn’t really justify paying a RT top money when the other 4 spots looked solid, the rest of the roster was solid so drafting a RT early to start was a fine move and left money for other positions like OLB. 

What you couldn’t see happening was Jrob missing on Wilson, Radunz, and everyone else he tried to fill that spot for the next 3 years. I think NPF can be the guy but he’s ideally not starting this year on a play-off team so even he doesn’t really count yet.

So a move that was fine at the time is a large part of Jrobs downfall. In hindsight he should have 1 paid Conk or more ideally 2. After the 2020 season and the Wilson debacle take that 2021 picks you planned to waste on Radunz or Farley and find a vet starter that could stop gap while you fixed other stuff. Jrob was just allergic to proven players unless they were completely washed IE Julio, Clowny, Beasley and Daley. 

Jrob truly dismantled an elite offense from 2019 until now and it cost him everything. Letting conk going and chasing it for years, not even making offers to Jonnu or Corey and then replacing one of them with an over the hill injury prone vet and the other with Firk a glorified slot Wr and then the icing was not breaking his back to make Aj happy to be a Titan for life. 

Y’all know I love to toot my own horn but I called this as it happen to many’s dismay.

Obviously, Kern hasn't played all year. He lost the camp battle to Stonehouse, but Stonehouse is proving to be a huge talent on a rookie deal. The fact that it was a tight contest given the realities of their ages and contracts demonstrates that he wasn't washed by any means as of the preseason.

A lot of us had issue with him never really showing any emotion whatsoever when he was here, whether in big losses or big wins. And that's fine, ""mahalo spirit"", remaining even keel is great and all. But I know all of his guys (o-line) and most of the team would have taken a shot for him, but did he reciprocate that? 

Things he's said since he left Tennessee really rubbed me the wrong way. We don't know what went on behind closed doors here, but when he said he was happy to go to Las Vegas because it gave him a chance to rediscover himself because he had to become someone he wasn't in Nashville... I was like... ""What?!"" If you can't be yourself in small market Nashville where there are hardly any wild expectations (play good football 👍) and little national attention, where else are you going to become ""yourself""?

I don't know. He gets a lot of credit for being this great guy, but I've never seen it as being anything more than being a ""boring guy"". Being boring is fine. I don't care if you're boring.
