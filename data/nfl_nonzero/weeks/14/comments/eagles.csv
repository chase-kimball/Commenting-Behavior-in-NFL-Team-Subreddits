Step 3: Cowboys almost lose to the worst team in the league and are only spared from the L by the stupidity of said worst team in the league. 

Step 4: Cowboys fans yell about how the better team won today. Close games don’t mean anything as long as you get the job done, right? But a few weeks ago wasn’t being tied with Houston worthy of criticism?

Step 8: (You are here) The Cowboy Karen should just shut the fuck up and leave well enough alone, but will likely write a half paragraph about how none of this makes any sense (a little dense, I know) and bitch and scream about how the Cowboys were created from Christ himself and will decimate the Eagles on Christmas Eve effectively ruining the Eagles Christmas.

Spread *and* total together absolutely show the strengths of each team’s offense and defense relative to one another—not perfectly, but the best you can possibly do expressing it in only two simple numbers. 

Does the Rams team total of 17.5 explicitly show whether it’s a very bad offense vs a bad defense (such as in this case), or a good offense vs an elite defense? Not really, but that isn’t important. What it does show is that, relatively speaking, the defense has a moderate-strong advantage over the offense. That’s factored into the model. 

>It’s much harder to make a 78 yard TD drive than a 34 yard TD drive.

Harder, yes. Much harder? The data doesn’t seem to indicate that it’s a *massive* drop-off here. I’d bet this isn’t as significant as you think, with how defenses in these situations tend to play conservative prevent coverage that allows the offense to move the ball well, at least early in the drive. 

In fact in this very game, when the Rams were at their own 28 following the Tillery penalty, it only took them 2 plays to get down to the Raiders 30! Moving the ball in your own territory late is actually pretty easy for most offenses in that situation. 

The timeout point is actually a good one, in that case a longer drive is relatively more difficult than a shorter one against the same defense. 

But the one thing we haven’t touched on at all is the equity the Raiders still have from a quick Rams TD. Carlson is one of the best kickers in the league. With two timeouts left, a quick Rams TD doesn’t end the game for good like one that drains all the clock. If the Rams scored a TD with say a minute left, the Raiders still had maybe a 10-15% to win the game on a FG. That’s equity you lose by punting it deep.",2.0,nfl,t3_zgnccb,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2022-12-09T16:45:03Z,eagles,-0.0204002546977242
14187,118164,118164,No_Arm_6781,"The bot takes into account the pre-game spread and total, which gives a general idea of the relative strength of each offense and defense. The Rams were only projected for about 17.5 points this game which tells us that Vegas doesn’t think highly of the Rams passing attack even accounting for the poor Raiders defense. 

Basically, the bot is saying that a 6 point underdog with a pre-game team total of 17.5, loses in that situation about 84% of the time based on historical data. If you think the bot is drastically overestimating both the Raiders offense AND their defense, then that would mean you think the pre-game spread of 6 was also drastically off, and that Vegas sportsbooks were the wrong ones here. 

Regardless, in my opinion the point you just laid out actually reinforces the decision to go-for-it rather than punt. If you think the bot is overvaluing the Raiders pass defense…. shouldn’t the Raiders be more willing to go for it, and put the game out of reach immediately? Rather than force the Rams into a vertical passing game, the main weakness of the Raiders defense? 

And you think the Raiders are 60% to lose the game giving the Rams the ball at the 34, then you must also think they’re much more likely to give up a TD with a punt than 91%. 

You mention 84.9% as that probability… did you just pull that number out of thin air? Because you reduced their WP(Failed Conversion) from 84% to 60%, which is a 28.5% decrease. If we apply that same 28.5% decrease to the WP(Punt) number, we get:

91% x (1 - .285) = 65% WP by punting, significantly lower than the 81.9% WP(Go-For-It) you mention.

Slay is of course #1 corner, and Maddox is great but he’s a clear slot corner. Imo we don’t have anyone on the roster currently that would be a dependable #2 corner if Bradberry leaves.

And then of course you have FA acquisitions in James Bradberry and CJGJ, which personally I think we’ll find a way to resign CJGJ but probably let Bradberry walk since it’d cost too much money. So if that happens, we’ll have holes along DL and especially CB. We are deeper at DL so we can fill Cox’s spot next year, but not the #2 corner spot without acquiring somebody.
