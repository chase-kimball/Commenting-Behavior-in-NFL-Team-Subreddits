5687,45956,45956,DUUUUUVAAAAAL,"True, but it could very possibly just be a result of their scheme. Their defense was absolute dog water for most of the season. Something was fundamentally wrong with how they played.

~~I believe these win rates are calculated off 1 on 1 performances. So getting doubled doesn't change his win percentage. (I'll try to confirm after posting.)~~

Also, I'm not saying he's bad, but he isn't dominating. To put this in perspective, he has only 1 more sack than Smoot with way more reps. While Smoot is a good player, I don't think anybody would consider him a dominant force.

Edit: I found this neato graph which implies that double teams aren't omitted when calculating win percentage. So I'll retract my statement I made above about it.

Last week was a nut punch and I don't have nuts.

This week was the Ravens game only way better and we look again like we can be a good team.

The lack of consistency, for the last 15 years, is what terrifies me 

I'm excited for next season but something has to be done about our week in week out consistentcy and not playing up to and down to our competition.

Even if we lose next week, as long as it isn't the Lions game again, I'm ok. And I am all in on next season.
