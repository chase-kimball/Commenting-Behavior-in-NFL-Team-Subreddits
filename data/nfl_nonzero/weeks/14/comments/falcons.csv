1178,14406,14406,Bacun,"In the NFL, a single change in possession is a massive change in the game. Tiring out the defense, managing the clock, scoring points, keeping your defense fresh by keeping them off the field (to better close the game towards the end), these things can only be done if you have possession of the ball. There are NFL stats out there that strongly tie possession/turnover with how often teams win. 

The average number of possessions a team gets in an NFL game is around 10-12. If you compared that to Rugby which has around 90 (from Google), you can see why NFL teams don't want to risk laterals unless truly necessary.

I will also say that laterals aren't used because no one really practices it. Maybe a change in the game that incorporates high risk high reward lateral plays will be used, but there are already things like screens (uses a sideways pass to set up the play) in the league. But yea, it is still very risky and players aren't used to the idea of it. Although there are some great lateral plays that have happened, but more often than not stupid laterals end up with the defense getting the ball.",3.0,nfl,t3_zgxme2,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-12-09T11:16:09Z,falcons,0.0839626064224497

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve talked about trying to get over the hump in some of these close games and where we‚Äôre trying to push the offense,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúWe feel like it‚Äôs the best decision where (Ridder) is at and where the team‚Äôs at. I wouldn‚Äôt have made this decision if I didn‚Äôt think it was in the best interest of this team, not only short term but probably long term as well.‚Äù  
  
Ridder, who was 34-for-56 passing for 431 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions in the preseason, has made enough progress in the last month that the Falcons believe the offense ‚Äúcan operate at full capacity‚Äù with him in the game, Smith said.  
  
‚ÄúWe would have had to adapt if he had had to play early in the season,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúI feel really good about where he‚Äôs at right now. If I thought we had to restrict him, that wouldn‚Äôt be the best move and that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to this team.‚Äù  
  
Falcons running back Caleb Huntley said he was surprised when he learned of the news via social media on Thursday. Huntley‚Äôs and Ridder‚Äôs lockers are side by side in the team‚Äôs practice facility, and Huntley said he thinks Ridder is ready for the challenge.  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a cool guy, funny, I feel like he can command the huddle,‚Äù Huntley said. ‚ÄúI knew his time was going to come sooner or later. I think he‚Äôs ready for it.‚Äù  
  
Ridder looked sharp during Atlanta‚Äôs walk-through on Monday, Huntley said.  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always looked pretty good at practice,‚Äù Huntley said. ‚ÄúHe makes the throws that he needs to, and he‚Äôs always confident, so I know he‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù  
  
Monday was the team‚Äôs first official workout since a Dec. 4 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Falcons had a bye last week. Smith made the decision to change quarterbacks last week, but the team didn‚Äôt announce the decision until Monday.  
  
Running back Tyler Allgeier, who goes to dinner with Ridder and fellow rookies Drake London and John FitzPatrick the night before every game, spent part of his off week catching passes from his friend to help build on-field chemistry, he said.  
  
The team‚Äôs more veteran players will take plenty of time with Ridder this week as the Falcons get ready to face the Saints (4-9) on Sunday in New Orleans, wide receiver Damiere Byrd said.  
  
‚ÄúJust go out and work with him, get our timing down, get his trust in us, get our trust in him, just kind of get in that routine with him,‚Äù Byrd said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for whatever our coaches feel is necessary to help us win these next few games so we can get in the playoffs.‚Äù  
  
Atlanta is one game behind division leader Tampa Bay. The Falcons‚Äô top priority is to maximize this season‚Äôs potential, Smith said, but the coach at least acknowledged the fact that evaluating Ridder now could have future benefits for the team.  
  
‚ÄúThere is risk anytime you make a move, but you have to be willing to take that if you want to break through,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúWe have been in a lot of close games, made a lot of progress, but our objective is to get over that hump.

7216,80625,80625,Mean_Log_,"Here's the rest of the article  
  
Ridder has yet to play in a regular-season game, and the only other player on the Falcons‚Äô roster who could reasonably play the position is Feleipe Franks, who was 0-for-1 passing with one interception last year before being moved to tight end in the offseason.  
  
Smith informed Mariota of the decision to make a change at quarterback on Thursday morning. The Falcons learned Friday that Mariota planned to step away from the team. This is the second time Mariota has been benched while playing for Smith. The first came in 2019 when Mariota was Tennessee‚Äôs starting quarterback and Smith was the Titans‚Äô offensive coordinator.  
  
‚ÄúThose (conversations) are never easy,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúYou try to be truthful, whether they agree or not, those are the conversations you have to have.‚Äù  
  
The Falcons signed Mariota to a two-year, $18.75 million deal in the offseason. If he is cut after the season, they would save $12 million worth of salary-cap hit and have to count only $2.5 million worth of dead money to the cap.  
  
The decision to elevate Ridder was ‚Äúperformance-based,‚Äù Smith said. Mariota was 184-for-300 passing for 2,219 yards, 15 touchdowns and nine interceptions this season.
