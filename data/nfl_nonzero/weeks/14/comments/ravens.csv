It's a first down no matter what because Moses, Ricard, and a great pulling Powers all land good blocks to give Lamar a big hole, but [all the second-level defenders](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/514914322502385679/1052273633793429514/image.png) who would've had a chance to limit him to a 6-8 yard gain [over-pursue on Duv](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/514914322502385679/1052273634099601538/image.png), leaving Lamar with [nothing but green grass and a foot race he will always win.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/514914322502385679/1052273636570058852/image.png) If even one of those guys stays home and doesn't move right with Davis and Duv, that's an unremarkable first down, but that threat makes it into a touchdown. I've been a critic of Greg but this is one that's genuinely really well done in terms of design, situation, everything, A+ job!

The problem I have with them is that it's basically all we use him for on offense. Maybe he'll develop it later, but at least as of this season, he does not have the capability to line up wide and play the role of an X receiver. We've seen that pretty clearly in his snaps trying to fill the void of Bateman. What he *does* have though is the same lightning-in-a-bottle athleticism that makes him such a deadly kick returner, and you can absolutely design plays to get him out into space to use that athleticism. Deebo and Patterson are the shining examples of that in the league right now, but they are hardly the only ones in recent memory. Even things as simple as a pick play to give him a wide-open opportunity in space, or just a simple screen pass that lets him read his blockers and use his speed. (Yes we've thrown screens to him, but we have thrown fewer to him than we have to Ricard. I love Pancake Pat but how have we had more designed screen passes for our 300+ lbs. fullback than our all-pro returner?!)

31471,177929,177929,ZombieFeedback,"If you're Lamar, you can look at it one of two ways. The first way is that Kyler looks to have torn his ACL without a defender touching him, just from planting awkwardly, you can get injured literally every snap even if nobody lays a hand on you, so take the bird in the hand instead of hoping there are two in that bush next year. The second way is you need to dig your heels in and insist on that guaranteed money, because Kyler just tore his knee without being touched, just from planting awkwardly, it can happen just through pure bad luck, and if you get unlucky like that, there's a good chance your six-year $250m contract just turned into a three-year $130m contract. I honestly don't know which of these thoughts is louder in his head, I'd bet on the latter given his decision with regards to the offer they gave in the offseason, but I don't know. Maybe his knee sprain's changed his thinking? Maybe it's reinforced it? I honestly don't know, but I can see the logic in both of those.

If you're the Ravens, nothing's changed. You want to get this deal locked down asap, you're willing to give Lamar record-setting money - if that offer they allegedly gave in the offseason was real, the Ravens were offering the most per-year money in league history and the second-most guaranteed money in league history behind Cleveland Bill Cosby - so it's just a question of whether you can get him to agree to a number that fits your plans for the roster, or whether you have to rewrite those plans because of how much cap he's eating.",45.0,ravens,t3_zkziom,False,0.0, :19:,2022-12-13T10:37:18Z,ravens,0.0533101994017151

The difference between the wild card 5 seed and the division 3 seed is marginal, you get an extra first round home game, but either way you’d be playing the chiefs / bills in the divisional unless you get an upset, and even as the 5 seed you can get a home divisional matchup (and even championship match up) if upsets happen.

The only situation where the 3 seed beats the 5 seed is if the chiefs lose… and if they don’t you’re playing them anyways.

The only way you avoid the chiefs is if they lose, in which case you’re likely playing the bengals or dolphins (who are still hard af).

TLDR: division outcome likely determines whether you play either the dolphins or the titans in the first round - tbh you might even prefer the titans?

But once it gets to the second round, assuming the chiefs don’t lose, you’re very likely playing the chiefs in the second round.
