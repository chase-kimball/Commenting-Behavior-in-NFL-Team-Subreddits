9347,48052,48052,DrewDonut,"I'm indifferent to the playcall, but I have a problem with Mike Williams not getting a shot at the end zone on an earlier play in that set of downs.

I think what killed this play was a couple of things:

1) The snap was a bit late. Meaning Carter is running out of room to run towards the sideline - so Herbert can't lead him as far horizontally as he would like.

2) The throw could have been better.\* Due to the less than ideal room they have horizontally (result of the late snap), Carter should have been led more upfield, so he can cut that way and keep his momentum and not run out of bounds). Or, put more zip on the balls so he gets the ball faster, keep him from stopping his feet.

3) Regardless of those two less than ideal things, Carter still needs to keep his feet and not get tackled by the turf monster.

\*I'm not saying this is easy. And I'm also aware there are great QBs who would make this same type of throw (i.e. not a perfect swing pass), and his WR will still catch it, keep his feet, and bolt into the endzone. So this criticism is somewhat unfair, because it is mostly a result of how slim the margins are for Herbert/this offense to be effective. But yeah, the throw still could have been better.",6.0,chargers,t3_zl22g8,False,0.0,Chargers,2022-12-13T14:44:51Z,chargers,0.0646185596768998

14736,85279,85279,LakeShowBoltUp,"Full quote(s)

""You talk about a frustrating film to watch,"" McDaniel said. ""It was just taking that to the face.""

That frustration came in the form of revisiting Miami's 23-17 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers Sunday night, a game that was not as close as the score indicates.

The Dolphins were dominated offensively with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa having the worst game of his career (and second consecutive underwhelming performance) and Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert picking apart Miami's defense. While Herbert passed for 367 yards, Tagovailoa was 10 of 28 for 145 yards.

""Part of where we're at has to do with certain guys possibly pressing, playing outside of the scheme to try to make plays,"" he said.

""I think it's been a very, very valuable experience going against, specifically the last last two weeks, some playoff caliber teams. Whether or not that benefits us moving forward is for the team to determine.""

McDaniel identified issues on both sides of the ball, finding players going away from what they were taught trying to be a hero.

""You don't do that in 11-on-11 football with any sort of consistency or success,"" he said.

McDaniel said he saw players adjusting a route, attacking a read that wasn't primary in the progression, guys trying to ""engulf"" a defender at the expense of blocking techniques and jumping the gaps.

""It wasn't one player,"" he said. ""It wasn't one position. It wasn't one side of the ball. So to me that's very telling of there's a lot of guys pressing.",14.0,chargers,t3_zlb6xm,False,0.0,Felipe Rios,2022-12-13T17:52:07Z,chargers,-7.853440486128211e-07

26870,147862,147862,TheTrueBlu,"I'm of the opinion that his natural position is guard. He has a lack of ideal size at the NFL level. Along with suboptimal lateral athleticism. He played really solid to initially as a LT when Pipkins was healthy. They dedicated chips with TEs and RBs helping him out. Ran bootlegs to the opposite side of the line. It put a lot of stress on Pipkins to hold up. He absolutely did hold up well having a harder role than Salyer. Then he injured his MCL. After that injury you really see the value Pipkins added. We can no longer throw all of our extra resources to making Salyer's job easier. We have to split it between two rookie tackles. Our protection these last few weeks have reflected that. The pressure rate has been insanely bad. Herbert has done his best to mitigate it. 

Having an OL consisting of Slater-Salyer-Linsley-Johnson-Pipkins long term is probably the likely scenario. Feiler is an aging veteran who has had an immense drop off in play.

Generally better to do it in space and when it’s only teammates near the intended recipient to potentially recover or block while the ball carrier recovers. 

Pitches are practicable because opponent position is predictable, as in they definitely aren’t able to get there that fast because it’s right after the snap. Down the field laterals have all sorts of unpredictable opponent positioning and that makes it near impossible to practice.

He largely ran an offense of short game stuff, with quick passes and RB dumpoffs, and thanks to a mishmash OL, he developed as a scrambler to make it all work. His deep ball, while not his strength, wasn’t missing from his game and he still had his share of deep bombs. His passing totals rival many long time QBs of the modern era. 

He owned every passing record in the league when he retired and guys like Marino and Elway, the earliest drafted players above him on career passing lists, just finished season 4 when Tarkenton entered the HOF. Only Fouts and Unitas played before or during his career and ended up within 10K career passing yards of Tarkenton. 

Within 100 TDs (about 30% of his total) and you add only Hadl, Jurgenson, and Tittle to the list. There are 0 earlier or overlapping QBs within 50 TDs of him. Fouts ran a way-ahead-of-its-time passing offense and finished 88 TDs behind him despite retiring 9 seasons after Tarkenton did.

We were not pushing the ball downfield enough. A lot of Herbert’s longer completions come from him improvising outside the pocket. We barely incorporated his athleticism as a runner into the game. Lombardi handles Herbert like he’s 45 years old. These complaints aren’t new or exclusive to this season. Lombardi’s style is dink and dunk. He used Stafford and MEGATRON the same way. It doesn’t matter who the personnel is.

Lombardi has no idea how to use Herbert, just like he had no idea how to use Stafford. Here’s some quotes from articles written during his time with the Lions: “Stafford, in particular, seemed to regress under Lombardi’s command, with the deep passing
game becoming less a part of the Lions' offense
and the team relying more on short crossing routes.” “Starting quarterback Matthew Stafford
was expected to take off in this scheme,
but instead has regressed both years. He
was benched for the first time in his career.” “Despite a cast of talent that includes Calvin
Johnson, Golden Tate and Eric Ebron, the Lions
rank 20th in total offense, lead the league in
turnovers, rank last in rushing and have the
second worst scoring margin in the NFL.” Also, here’s a [video you should watch.](https://youtu.be/7WpQ4PkYiRs)",6.0,nfl,t3_zhwnow,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-12-10T13:39:13Z,chargers,-0.0162812885802469
