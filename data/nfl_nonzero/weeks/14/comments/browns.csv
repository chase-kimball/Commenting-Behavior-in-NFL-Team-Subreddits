Throwing around Watsons contract for why he should be on the field for one very specific situation, is not a factor. For me I understand the strategy behind that play call, it didn't work, not a firable mistake. 

The strength of a RB committee is the interchangeability based on their strengths. Hunt should be in on 3rd downs for pass pro *and* a recieving threat from the backfield, which he's more respected at than Chubb. The entire point of having literally 2 starters at RB is to keep them both fresh and wear down the defense.

It's not good NFL business to go clean house in the middle of the season, firing both Priefer and Woods after the Jets game wouldn't have been smart, *even if they deserved it* 
I don't see any horrendous missusage of personnel, so you'll have to further explain that.

dude's not above criticism but I swear you're all so burned by the Browns hire-fire-fail-hire-fire-fail cycle since 1999 you dont know any other way that football can be. 

The reality is that most HC hires are duds. Most of the time when you fire a guy with an above .500 record (like Stefanski), who's been dealing with a bunch of adversity, and you do it before they've had a full go at it, the chances are the next guy you'll get is worse. So when you've got a guy who's average or above you keep them until you've got someone better lined up for an interview, that's how the good franchises do it.

We'd also be subjected to Watson demanding a big say in the next hiring. You know who he wanted in Houston? Eric Bienemy. YIKES.

When Stefanski was hired other coaches were turning down Cleveland's requests to interview them. That's how bad this organization and owner's rep is around the league. You're not getting the next Sean McVay or Kyle Shanahan if you dont give KS a fair run at the job, you're getting the next Hackett/Kitchens/McAdoo/Rhule instead - i.e. what we've mostly had since '99. The good coaches know what's up and know which franchises you take an interview with.

Just look at the other team in Ohio, the young coach they hired. Absolutely sucked ass for two years, terrible record, until he got the franchise QB in good health and managed to hire the right defensive coordinator.
