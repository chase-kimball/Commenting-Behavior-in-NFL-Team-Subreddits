Most of the dead cap is from trading mack for pennies on the dollar coming off his first injury. And we were right to trade mack because who needs a hall of fame edge rusher but now we have to take an edge rusher because the experts said so and an edge rusher changes the defense so much!

Poles traded Quinn for pennies mid season instead of when he traded mack when he had his on off pattern for years now.

He turned roquan into a public spat, offered him a deesclator contract that no one in the nfl does, and caused us to trade roquan for pennies on a dollar.

Took 9 swings at offensive line and only one of them worked with Braxton. Who still has been one of the worst pass blocking tackles in the league even with the recent improvements. 

Took 5 swings at wr and all terrible.

We could have kept mack and traded him mid season for a better return instead of saving the mccaskeys money that doesn't benefit the team at all since it changes dead cap none. We could have drafted Pickens instead of taking a corner who has struggled hard all season. We could have traded a next year 6th to bring in a veteran Robert woods.

There absolutely were other options. Poles wasn't turning the team into a super bowl team in one year, yes. But we didn't need to become a national embarrassment either.

That wear and tear starts turning those 60 yard touchdowns to 15 yard scrambles. Turns those 3rd down scramble conversions to 4th and short. Turns those sack escapes to sacks. The athletic gap between players is not large.

Remember, the team is switching from a 3-4 to a 4-3. They lost four leaders (Mack, Hicks, Quinn and Smith) on the defense and struck out on their big free agency signing, which is probably the most important position in this defense. That transition (scheme) and the loss of leaders could each on its own cause a massive setback. 

We also have a DC who is calling plays for the first time. Just like with Getsy, there’s going to be growing pains. We don’t know if he has it or not and you can’t even really tell since the defense is both gutted and in transition. 

Eberflus led a defense that was top 10 in scoring, turnovers, and run defense two years in a row. Top 10 in turnovers and run defense 3 years in a row, and top 10 in scoring 3 of his 4 seasons in Indy. He’s earned the benefit of doubt this year. 

In terms of what he’s improved, there’s two rookies who look like long-term contributors (Sanborn and Brisker) and one who has shown flashes (Gordon). Kindle Vildor looks like a different player this year. That’s 4 of the 11 defensive positions that the coaching staff seems to have helped discover or develop. 

I think there’s plenty of reason to be optimistic, given his history and the performance of pieces of the defense so far.

And either way, through the first 7 years of his career Matt Forte averaged 1100 yards so like, it’s an apt comparison. His production dropped off in his last 3 years, like most RBs. I see Zeke more likely to have a Laveon Bell or Melvin Gordon finish than a Frank Gore or Adrian Peterson. 8/10 recent rushing leaders were under 26, the other two were AP.
