We trade up to get Bush who has had 1 good campaign and won’t even be a Steeler next year. Jack has been very underwhelming from what I remember watching in Jacksonville. 

Canada still needs to go. Anybody who thought “the offense is improving, he can get another year” needs to give their head a shake. His red zone offense failed with Ben. Rudolph. Pickett and Mitch. At some point that’s not on the QB anymore. On top of that, the scheme is fine, but the playcalling is atrocious. 

Harvin is good for one great punt a season, (see, last week and the one last year that was literally perfect going out on the 1) then a bunch of garbage inconsistent bullshit. They need a real punter. 

A losing season this year. Can’t see us competing for the North or doing anything meaningful next year. It’s completely unacceptable.

- Harvin: nice little 17 yard punt to give the ravens points. Inconsistency has been the name of his game and it showed up again. 

- Run d/contain: guys not staying in their gaps and not containing the edge letting big runs from Dobbins and Huntley taking off. DL just couldn’t get it done today, including pass rush. Everybody in the world knew they were running the ball and we still couldn’t stop it. Did absolutely nothing to stop it. 

- Mitch: I mean… 3 picks. All 3 were absolutely terrible. 

- Red zone offense: yet again, we can’t do anything in the RZ. We can Turn the ball over I guess, but other than that, we freeze. Canada has his worts, but this has got to be figured out. 

Good-

- George: he makes the difficult look easy. I swear, even when he doesn’t get the ball he is still open. Was giving Marlen a headache today. 

- Minkah: quiet but thought he had a good game. Saved a dobbins TD and got some pressure on Huntley. Did the little things well in the secondary.

If Mitch struggled to move the ball as the starter and then started taking more shots downfield when he's not the starter, all that tells me is that Mitch is playing for himself.
