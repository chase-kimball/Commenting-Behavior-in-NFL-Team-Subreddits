Also re: the run game- I think we've definitely taken for granted that while our pass pro has been suspect for the last few years, run blocking has actually been OK-ish. Yesterday was a prime example of how bad the run game is when the line isn't solid. Hopefully something that will be fixed by Bradbury and Darrisaw's respective returns

28910,181425,181425,benigntugboat,"There are too many individual issues with this for me to agree.      
       
1.donatell has been insistent that yardage given up etc were all fine and by design before this loss.      
2. There are issues that are clearly unrelated to scheme like a lack of blitzes. Players dont decide when they blitz or cover, thats scheme and playcalling. We've been lowest in the league in blitzes against qbs who are bottom of the league when blitzed.       
3. We're not giving players who have performed well in the past opportunities to even try whats worked for them in the past. Harrison smith in the box. Danielle hunter with his hand in the dirt. Attempts arent failing, theres just been no attempts to adapt to our personnel.     
4. We have multiple instances of personnel winning us games where the defensive scheme has been failing. Patrick petersons interceptions have largely been him reading offenses and making plays. Za'darius has been doing the same kind of thing his whole career and our d line is succeeding through personnel wins. Cam dantzler stripping the ball out of ihmirs hands against the lions wasnt a scheme thing.    
      
There are more questions and issues i have and I honestly believe that there are a bunch of issues caused by personnel and our shallow cb room too. But for donatell to constantly dismiss criticism and not take accountability when its easy and were winning.. to suddenly throw everyone under the bus as soon as he's seriously criticized diminishes my faith in him significantly. KOC taking the blame on himself and trying new things when winning AND losing has been huge and it really seems like donatell is doing the polar opposite. Its very hard for me to be optimistic about anything he's done this season.
