‘Other team leaders — such as Terron Armstead and Elandon Roberts — have organized many players-only sessions.’

‘With co-captain Roberts leading the charge, the linebackers have added an extra players-only meeting on Thursdays this year, linebacker Duke Riley said.’

‘And safety Jevon Holland has led a similar players-only meeting among defensive backs.’

6274,46005,46005,Cidolfus,"I'd still argue that's primarily a function of pure arm talent and it's not a modern innovation of the position. Are we going to pretend that quarterbacks like Favre, Roethlisberger, and Rodgers haven't been doing the exact same thing over the past three decades? Manning and Brady certainly didn't have the athleticism to do that (though Manning certainly had the arm talent until the neck injury), but quarterbacks with cannons for arms dancing around and evading pressure and making big plays downfield isn't an innovation and it's not exactly what people are talking about when they're discussing an evolution at the position.

We're unlikely to see eye-to-eye on this since it's quibbling over the definition of what type of athleticism matters. The way I see it, there are plenty of quarterbacks with the mobility to escape the pocket the way Mahomes and Allen do, but it's the pure arm talent that allows for those special off-platform throws that ultimately sets up them apart. I see that kind of arm talent as a very traditional quarterback quality, and it's not what I think most people think of when they discuss an evolution of the quarterback position centered around mobility. That's what I meant by the ice cream sundae analogy in my previous post: Mahomes's and Allen's ability to evade pressure and escape from the pocket on its own isn't what makes them special--it's what their arm talent enables them to do after they've escaped.

The article we're responding to frames the whole situation by talking explicitly about quarterback prospects who averaged 30+ rushing yards in college while defining pure pocket passers as those with under 10 rushing yards per game (which, of course, conveniently cuts both Burrow and Herbert at just under 13 rushing yards per game from the conversation), and while it acknowledges ""creative innovators"" like Mahomes for his ability to scramble and pass downfield, it's ultimately lauding the dual-threat quarterback as the ""ideal"".",1.0,nfl,t3_zk5ca1,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-12-12T14:47:43Z,miamidolphins,0.1194711729049682
6275,46007,46007,Cidolfus,"I get that needling him on the quip is low-hanging fruit, but you dodged responding to the most important part of /u/soboredcantfocus's post.

> Take away Mahomes’ mobility and he’s still one of the best QBs in the league.

Mahomes is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL purely on his arm talent and passing ability, not because of his ability to punish teams with his legs. Don't get me wrong, he *can* scramble very effectively, but it's not what makes him so dangerous. Similarly, it's Allen's improvement in the passing game that has elevated him to the top of the league, not his legs. In both cases, they're the best quarterbacks in the league right now because they can make every throw from anywhere on the field completely irrespective of their ability to scramble. Their mobility is the cherry on top; it's not the ice cream in the sundae.

There have been a lot of dual-threat quarterbacks who have had short term success in the NFL, but until one of them can show *sustained* success, teams aren't going to stop valuing pure passing ability over overall athleticism. Regardless of how productive young quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts are with their legs, I don't think it's controversial to suggest that the longevity of their playstyle is in question. Cam Newton was a league MVP and his productive years in the league were over after his eighth season.

It's telling that your go-to examples of the modern group of top quarterbacks included Mahomes and Allen but not Jackson. Take away Josh Allen's rushing, and he's still throwing for 271 yards and 2.15 touchdowns per game over the past three seasons. In the same stretch, Jackson has averaged 202 passing yards and 1.51 touchdowns per game. Most people wouldn't bat an eye if you suggested that Mahomes, Allen, Herbert, and Burrow will still be dominating the top QB discussions ten years from now and it's because they can absolutely pick you apart through the air. That's not to say that Jackson and Hurts won't be in that group ten years from now, but if they are, I'd bet they don't average anywhere near the 9-11 attempts per game they're getting right now.",3.0,nfl,t3_zk5ca1,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-12-12T13:34:47Z,miamidolphins,-0.0179029755067605

Well this is correct. He also isn't very good at improvising. When all phases of the game are working (WRs getting separation quickly, OL blocking, timing is on) then he looks great. Remove one of them and it falls apart quickly. 

Same with his accuracy. Great when he just has to throw from a clean pocket with little to no pressure and doesn't have to hold on to the ball. Accuracy takes a huge nosedive when he's moved off his spot, attempts to throw off platform, pressure is in his face, or has to throw on the run.

“Is that all on the players or is it something you and your staff can do to make sure they don’t find that…?) –

“Absolutely not. It’s not all the players. It’s far from it. I think the ideal, what you really want in your football team, is you want the players to think it’s all the players, and you want the coaches to think it’s all the coaches. And it’s somewhere in between. But that’s the furthest from that. I try to lead by example and I’m always the first one to be super critical of every single decision, trying to find the whys of why we’re not performing.

40588,298679,298679,realneocanuck,"List of primetime games where Tua was mediocre to bad:

* 2022 vs Chargers (obviously)
* 2022 vs Steelers - Tua had a great pair of opening drives and then turned into rookie year Zach Wilson for the remainder of the game, with endless 3 & outs. Everyone forgets about this because our defense held on for the win.
* 2022 vs Bengals - Tua threw a pick and otherwise looked mediocre up until the hit.
* 2021 vs Saints - Tua threw a bad pick and otherwise looked mediocre. We still won because we were facing a shell shocked 4th string QB in his first career start.
* 2021 vs Ravens - Tua comes off the bench for injured Jacoby Brissett, who had done a fine job establishing a lead. Defense and ST carried the team. Tua gets a 1 yd rushing TD on a QB sneak but also fumbles the ball twice and does nothing else of note.

List of other highly important games where Tua was BAD:

* 2022 vs 49ers - Huge game to give us the potential #1 seed in the AFC and prove we're not a bunch of frauds. Tua repeatedly struggles to hit WIDE OPEN receivers and throws 2 bad picks. Even average QB play wins us this one.
* 2021 vs Titans - Win and we're in, easy as that! Tua looks shakey from the very first snap, with a laughable unforced fumble and another bad pick, and he struggles to do anything under any kind of pressure. We get blown out.
* 2020 vs Bills - Win and we're in! Tua again looks shakey from the first snap. He struggles to even get first downs until garbage time.
* 2020 vs Raiders - Huge playoff implications. Tua struggles mightily with endless 3 & outs until he gets benched for a 38 year old Ryan Fitzpatrick, who instantly gets things rolling and delivers us the W.",0.0,miamidolphins,t3_zkew17,False,1.0,Teddy Bridgewater Stan Account,2022-12-12T17:45:18Z,miamidolphins,-0.0181814954955319
