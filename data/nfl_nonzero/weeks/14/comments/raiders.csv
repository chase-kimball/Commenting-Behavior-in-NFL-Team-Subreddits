This is the most frustrating period of football that I've ever witnessed and most likely I will be moving on with my fandom to another team in the offseason. (I even have a strategy for making this happen, I'm that serious about it.)

The answer to your question though is, I have no idea. Other teams/organizations seem to be able to identify and fix problems and the Raiders are just flat out incapable. Weak pass defense over the middle? Draft a baller safety. Moehring was supposed to be great, gets drafted by the Raiders and becomes pedestrian at best.

There's no game strategy. Playing the Chiefs and they're in the red zone. Hey, let's put fifteen defenders on Travis Kelce—or maybe just three (seriously). But nope. Just let him score. There's no player development (see comment above on Moehring). Whatever the player is in college he will be the same with the Raiders. No improvement. ZERO. There's no draft strategy. If we get a pocket crusher like Vita Vea then Crosby gets 25 sacks. But nope. Can't do that. By the time we get a capable DT Crosby will be on the downside of his career or already gone. Coaching. Yikes. How about a defensive coordinator that can somehow one of these years get a defense out of the 20s? Nope. It's been at least 10 years.

I'm done with the silver and black. 

I'm 56 and I only have one life and I want football on Sundays to be fun and interesting more often than not. I stopped watching between '04 and (I think) '10 but these days just giving up football altogether is no longer an option. I enjoy the idea of it too much. It's the icing on the cake of what is my favorite time of the year. But if the team you watch is so horrible for so many reasons and seemingly can't ever address any of those issues for *decades* on end—where something that is supposed to be a fun thing in your life becomes an annoyance at best, where instead of that thin layer of icing it's a thin layer of shit, then you just have to make a conscious decision to stop. I'm a firm believer if you want to change something in your life then you need to change the input—in this case a habit of watching a specific team. Yes, in theory anyway, that team can change, but the Raiders will sadly never change, never get it right, never be a real contender. And so if they won't change—if the input won't change itself—then I'll change the input.

Just last year Burrow had an insane season, but the crappy offensive line and a burnt secondary finally wasn’t enough and helped the Rams come back.

In 2020, the 49ers defense was ELITE but it finally wasn’t enough to overcome Jimmy G and a meh offense. Hell the Eagles scored 41 in 2018 but STILL needed a game saving defensive turnover to win it all or else Brady would have another.
