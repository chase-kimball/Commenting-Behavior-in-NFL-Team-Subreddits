What's changed since 2020 that this team can't stay healthy?

What's our biggest need entering the offseason?

How do we match up against the Falcons 14 weeks later with wildly different teams than the last game?

27899,257851,257851,physedka,"I've only watched a few of the Dolphins games this season, but I feel like at least a chunk of the hype around Tua has been the result of lobbing 50/50 balls toward Tyreek that 1) Tyreek came down with and 2) Tyreek added a lot of YAC to.

For example, go back and check out that long pass to Tyreek in the middle of the 3rd. He was pretty well covered but their feet got tangled and the CB fell. It's safe to say that there was a lot of luck involved in that play. Tyreek may have come down with it, but there was no way he would house it if the CB didn't fall down. Take that pass out of the stats and the game looks even more abysmal for Tua. 

Then look at that wild fumble/rugby scrum that Tyreek somehow scored from. It's not a big stretch to say that, if not for a couple of dumb luck plays that broke the Dolphins' way, it could have easily been a 23-3 beatdown.",-1.0,nfl,t3_zjkmo8,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints :Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-12-12T07:48:17Z,saints,0.009573259538412
