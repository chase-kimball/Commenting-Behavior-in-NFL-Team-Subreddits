Here’s why this year is different: Last year, we lose that game. Last year, Dak throws two picks and DOESN’T lead a 98-yard game winning-touchdown drive. Maybe he throws another pick, maybe he gets blindsided sacked, maybe poor play calling forces a 4-and-out. 

Last year, our defense probably doesn’t get that stop at the goal line. Gallimore and Lawrence don’t get it done. Our defense continues to gel this year. Things are different.

On three separate occasions this year, Dak Prescott has thrown interceptions and bounced back to help win the game. In years past, he wilts. Panics and fades. Yesterday, he overcame bad o-line play and baffling play calling to lead the team to a victory. No help by pass interference, either—this was all Dak, legs and arm.

Your perception of this signing is so far from why they signed TY. TY is being signed for depth - not because “other guys aren’t working out.” Everyone had questions about Ceedee thru the first 6 - 7 games of the season and if he could be a true #1 guy. And he’s playing like it now. 

Saying Ceedee is used like a slot - which is true at times.. no doubt.. but that’s a strength of his. Why not play to it with him being the first read on those plays? They’d be stupid NOT to play to some of his strengths. Also… that’s Kellen Moore’s offense as much as we cowboys fans hate it sometimes. It is resulting in one of the best offenses on the league for the past 3 years. Including this year. We just wish Kellen were more consistent with how he balances run v pass. 

TY is an experience and depth signing. Our WR is young. You could argue that Gallup should be considered in his prime right now - but can’t take away the fact that he tore his ACL last year and the affect that has. 

But TY comes with many, many years of high performing experience, went thru a litany of QB changes / coaching nightmares toward the end of his colts career and would argue to say he’s probably still got some of his best in him and will pass a ton of knowledge down to the younger guys.

Hell, we did it with Jason Peters .. his old ass is a HUGE reason why Tyler Smith is playing as well as he is for a rookie right tackle.

Added a few more comparisons from some notable RBs, but the rates are all very close:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|E. Smith|4924|61|1.2%|46|0.9%|

|D. Henry|1796|15|0.8%|12|0.7%|

The Texans game is the only close game we’ve won with Dak. The Eagles barely beat the Colts by 1 on a last minute touchdown just a few weeks ago. They also barely beat the Cardinals 20-17 after the Cardinals missed a FG to send it into OT, beat the Jags by 1 score after being down 14-0, beat the Lions by 3, beat the Packers by 1 score, and were only up 21-17 in the 4th quarter vs the Texans. Meanwhile, we blew out the Colts, beat the Giants comfortably (not counting the garbage time TD with under 10 seconds left), blew out the Vikings, beat the Lions by multiple scores, destroyed the Bears, and beat the Commanders and Rams by multiple scores with Cooper Rush. 

The Texans game wasn’t pretty by any means, but for these clowns in the media to act like we’re the only team to struggle against an inferior opponent and ignore the fact we’ve comfortably won most of our games is crazy.

When I watch Eagles games, I see the same thing you do. Guys are running wide ass open and all Hurts has to do is make an easy throw. Contrast that to our offense, where Dak has to make throws to WRs with defenders all over them. It’s effective most of the time because Dak can make those throws, and CeeDee, Gallup, and Schultz are talented enough to make those plays, but it also leaves little room for error.
