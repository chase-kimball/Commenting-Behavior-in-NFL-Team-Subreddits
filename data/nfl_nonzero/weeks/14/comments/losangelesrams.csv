5954,74917,74917,JohnArtemus,"Exactly.  Reddit skews younger, so a lot of people here don't realize that the Rams-49ers used to be one of the best rivalries in the NFL, and of the most heated.  Like Dodgers-Giants level.

The problem is, three things happened.

1. The Rams started sucking.  
2. The Rams left SoCal.
3. Realignment brought the Seahawks in and the Seahawks became quite good.  They also owned the Niners once Russel Wilson got there.

Also, for a rivalry to maintain the test of time, both teams have to have a similar level of success.  Like the Lakers and the Celtics.  The Niners have been consistently good since the 80s with some down years here and there. 

The Rams were good like 50 years ago and in the 80s, but have mostly been down since then.  And as an Angeleno, I don't really care about the St. Louis years.  I know the Rams were great with Warner, Faulk, etc. - the Greatest Show on Turf - but that's for St. Louis.

That SB doesn't mean anything for LA.  But had the Rams never left, the rivalry with the Niners might have maintained.

And I don't care what Niners fans say, but I guarantee they'd trade all those regular season wins over the Rams for an NFC championship win.

And the Cardinals have one of the worst fields in all of football, and the fact it’s a grass field and that that’s still the case is ridiculous and frankly unacceptable. The NFL needs to set some sort of standard for these fields. What I mean by that is 1. If they refuse to get rid of turf, then they need to at least make sure every turf field uses the exact same turf (this goes back to something George Kittle said earlier in the year when he said that not all turf fields use the same turf, and how if they did, you’d at least be able to become somewhat familiar with them and how they play so that you can protect your extremities by essentially playing different, which is absolutely ridiculous in and of itself that NFL players are forced to play differently depending on what surface they’re playing on to protect themselves from injury). 

And 2. They need to set a standard for grass fields. Some grass fields are much better taken care of than others (i.e. the Cardinals field is awful and the Chiefs field for example seems to be extremely well taken care of). The NFL goes to these great lengths to protect their quarterbacks, but don’t seem to care about any of the other position players. And last night, a grass field that’s very poorly taken care of may very well have resulted in one of the more exciting quarterbacks in our league to tear his ACL, which will have him out until around this time next season.

It was absolutely insufferable to be a Rams fan the last 5 years. Do you know how bad it is to see the Niners and Cowboys fan bases start to grow where the Raiders' trash base already set down roots too? Meanwhile our crap ass owner was doing everything to devalue the product on the field to justify bolting to anywhere that would offer a stadium deal. It was pure hell. 

But as bad as people shit on us Rams fans, we recognized our shitty ownership and didn't kiss their asses - still don't even now. But Al Davis milked LA for everything it was worth. They were there about 15 years, then went right back home...and Raiders fans in LA still eat the peanuts out of the Davis families' shit. 

Now, don't get me wrong - I *actually respect and feel bad* for OAKLAND Raiders fans. They got shit on TWICE by Davis. It was their team in their community, and while a stadium deal is king, he proved that he had no loyalty to community at all in trying to preserve the Raiders in the place they belonged,

I have zero love for Kroenke, and yes he dicked over St. Louis fans. But LA **is** the Rams ***home***. I'll never actually like the guy, but he DID bring the Rams home where they belong. Never mind the fact he only did it for financial reasons of course, but he righted a wrong that never should've happened in the first place.

If it weren't for Georgia Frontierre, there would've never been an LA Raiders, no St. Louis Rams. The Rams wouldn't have to be treated as a road team in their own home building against the Niners and Raiders first and foremost- but against Dallas, Green Bay et al too.

I'm not trying to make more of something than it really is, but, I hope people outside of the SoCal football world realize that, the NFC Championship win, the Super Bowl win **and** last night's win were even bigger than what they normally would mean to other teams. These games were exercising of just a few of the many demons the Rams have to slay in order to systematically return LA back to being what it was for 50 years....the Rams' house.

I'm so happy today; it's crazy...it feels almost as good as winning the SB did. This one win won't convert every Raiders fan into a Rams fan in SoCal overnight; nope.
