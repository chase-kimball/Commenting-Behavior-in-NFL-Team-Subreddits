 The US has amazing turf engineers and has had for hundreds of years.  Look up NFL mud bowls. Grass gets trashed very quickly and in some places you would need a full season of re-sod ready to go.  To do it right that is nearly one million dollars per game on just grass.

The real problem is less the turf and more than fact the the NFLPA negotiated for less practice time in the off season, less full speed practices, and less full contact practice.  Guys have a hard time mantaining ""football shape"" throughout the year.  That needs to be fixed in tandem with some kind of turf quality rules.

As it stands now, Pete and John have hit an absolute Home Run in two important areas: The 2022 Draft and the compensation from the Russ trade.   Almost all of our picks have made immediate impacts (Cross&Lucas, K9, Tariq, Coby) and the ones that haven't (Boye Mafe, Tyreke Smith, Bo Melton) still have plenty of opportunity to build on that.

Now we have all of our picks for 2023, Denver's 1st and 2nd (which both look to be Top 5) and a team which has already looked competitive basically the entire year, even if the wins haven't materialized all the way through.

Right now, Pete is 71, that's OLD for a coach.   Right now Pete is being gifted an all-you-can-eat buffet for a rebuilding team.   If Pete can't turn this into gold, then I think it's fully time to part ways.   

A lot of us were calling for Pete and John's heads when the trade went through and we've basically got the best case scenario we could've realistically asked for.   There are still concerning flaws in the defense, that much is still true.   But we've been able to finally solve the O-line problem in 2022, maybe 2023 is the year we answer the post-LOB defense question.   

Basically, all I am saying is that I am willing to see this through and choosing to look through this situation with a more optimistic lens.   After all, there is plenty to be optimistic about.
