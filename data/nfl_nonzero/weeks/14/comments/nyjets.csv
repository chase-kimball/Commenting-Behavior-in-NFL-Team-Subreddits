14173,99767,99767,NannigarCire,"almost did a full writeup on Mike White's game this week but i don't feel like it- but here's a quick breakdown; it was bad. From the first drive in the game the Buffalo defense had White so confused on what to do that he was just missing reads left and right. And it's not like they're running something intensely difficult to comprehend, it's just not as obvious on the pre-snap as the Vikings and Bears were. Missed players over the middle when the MOF was completely empty, forced throws and checkdowns, it just wasn't pretty at all. His accuracy was better in this game than in games prior but his mental game was just as weak and it's clearly his achilles heel. His internal clock is too fast very often and when protection does hold up and allow for opportunities to build down the field, he doesn't take advantage of it- and that's before he took a hit in this game so it's not from a buildup of that. He almost plays to not lose more than he plays to win. 

He's going to continuously put up stats but a lot of them are going to be empty because how much of it falls short of the mark he's trying to reach. As the players on the field don't turn short gains into huge YAC, he's not putting together great games. His YPA has dipped twice below the 7 mark and it's dropping immensely. but he keeps putting the offense in a position to create something for itself, and that's really all that can be said. And in this game he threw even shorter on average than he did in Chicago, going from 5.8 air yards per attempt, to 5.3. The Bills just had his brain completely picked. They ran a mostly cover-3 zone, with some cover-1 man and cover-2 zone mixed in, but would rotate their safeties and not show who is in the flat and who is going intermediate and he just couldn't take advantage.

i think if the Jets want to keep using him, they have to find a way to put Moore in the position for quick throws underneath to add a dynamic player down there. Because having him throw to knight and carter and conklin and other checkdown options whose main open field ability is to hope the defense forgot about them is not adding anything to this offense.",6.0,nyjets,t3_zlo2h4,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-12-14T17:47:46Z,nyjets,0.0352017600081005
