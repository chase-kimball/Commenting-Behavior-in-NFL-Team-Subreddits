17072,122929,122929,Nickppapagiorgio,"40 to 50 games over several years. The point is 9-0 in one score games is probably an anomaly. One of the greatest predictors of a team progressing or regressing from their record the previous year is record in one score games. A team that does something like 9-0 in one score games typically winds up with a record a few games better than what their talent would dictate. They typically wind up with fewer wins the next season. Likewise, teams that lose one score games right and left typically aren't as bad as their record would indicate and are prime candidates for an improved season the following year.

Really though, without naming the team, or who they've played, if you show me a team in a vacuum that's 10-3, but 9-0 in one score games and has -1 point differential, my reaction would be they're very fortunate to be 10-3. 10-3 probably doesn't reflect what they are, and I'd steer clear of them when betting post-season games. Nothing against the Vikings, I'm generally fond of the Vikings, but those aren't pleasant stats. Only 3 teams out of 40 who went to the Super Bowl in the last 20 years were outside the top 10 in the league in point differential. Only 1 team out of 56(2011 Giants) who went on to win the Super Bowl had a negative point differential in the regular season.

His 2 cheapest years are already gone. His cap hits for the next 2 years are 9.3 million and 10.8 million respectively. Cheap by QB standards overall, but not that cheap by rookie contract standards. A decision about his 5th year option would have to be made by the end of next season. There's little tape to go off of in whether he's developed or not.

Strength of Schedule is the 6th tiebreaker, and they do have a 1 ¬Ω game lead there right now, because DET/NYJ/NYG have a slightly better record than CHI/MIA/WSH, but it no longer matters after the 49ers win today. Seattle can no longer win a tiebreaker if it goes past divisional record. The 49ers would either win it on record against common opponents, or NFC record. The only way the Seahawks can take the tiebreaker now is to beat the 49ers and Rams, and have the Cardinals beat the 49ers. So long as the 49ers win the Seahawks game they clinch the division. Or if not, they can clinch with a win over the Cardinals and a win over either the Commanders or Raiders.

Where the 49ers are at now, a win over the Seahawks on Thursday would clinch the division. Without that, a win over the Cardinals and either the Raiders or Commanders would clinch the division. Without the Cardinals win either, then they'd need the Seahawks to lose to the Rams.

I'd predict the division to be wrapped up Thursday, and the rest of the season becomes a two team race with the Vikings to see who winds up #2, and who winds up #3. The 49ers will have the tiebreaker with Minnesota if they finish tied, because they're already 1 game better in NFC Record, need to gain 1 game in the overall standings to finish tied, and both teams only have 1 game remaining against the AFC.

17081,122943,122943,Nickppapagiorgio,"We didn't waste a year of his development. We wasted a year of his cheap contract. It used to be normal to make your top QB sit for a while if not a full season. Sending them out to start week 1 of their rookie season was unusual. The 2011 CBA changed that paradigm. Prior to that, QB's drafted near the top of the draft got big contracts on par with established veterans, and there was no sense in rushing them on to the field. You could let them develop organically, learn to digest game film with the coaching staff, get a lot of reps as the practice qb against the first team defense, then at some point either in the middle of their rookie year, or the start of their 2nd year, you threw them out there to see what would happen. There was no rush. Now you have to make a decision on the 5th year club option by the end of the 3rd year, and the biggest cheat code in NFL salary cap dynamics is high performing QB on the initial contract. You got to maximize those cheap years because it's your best Super Bowl window.

In my opinion it was better for Trey Lance's development to have sat behind Garoppolo in 2019, but in the current NFL fiscal environment that just doesn't make sense for most teams so it doesn't happen often, even if it's in the best interest of the development of the player.",3.0,49ers,t3_zi4vbh,False,0.0,:mertonhanks: Merton Hanks,2022-12-10T20:20:24Z,49ers,0.0899146293693958

>‚Ä¢ He needed to settle into a better pre-pass stance, which involved dropping his hips and engaging his glute muscles.

40432,287148,287148,phoenixremix,"I noticed this as well. And to be honest, this concerns me re: the Seattle game (now before some of y'all get mad at me, hear me out).

We lost EMan, who was frankly really good at not letting the deep ball beat him. We never got Verrett. Now we have Lenoir, who is doing well but definitely not on the same level yet. 

In addition, Huf is biting on the underneath routes a lot and letting the deep routes exploit him. Ward playing where Gipson is would be better probably, but we need Ward at Nickel (Gipson is great but he was a last minute signing).

A good pass rush generally neutralizes this threat to a large degree. However, we lost another DT yesterday (total: 4 injured iirc). We have great DEs and Armstead, but the pass rush is not gonna be able to keep the deep ball away forever at this level of health. 

Seattle has DK, Lockett, and Goodwin. They're fast guys. They're all excellent deep threats, and DK is also pure muscle. It's gonna be physical and speedy, and Lockett has been great at making DBs pay over the top this season with Geno.
