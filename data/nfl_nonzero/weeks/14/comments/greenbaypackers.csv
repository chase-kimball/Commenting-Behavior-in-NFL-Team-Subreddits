134,1123,1123,-makehappy-,"Personally I think that Herbert or Burrow is LaFluer's dream QB for the style of O he wants to run. Someone who fires missiles into tight windows \*exactly\* on time with the read progression MLF draws up, and still mobile but doesn't need to be Hurts/Mahomes level mobile.

Yeah MLF is from the Shanahan system but so far MLF's playbook is way less gadgety even though we've got a hybrid player in Aaron Jones. MLF really doesn't use Jones the way Shanahan uses Deebo or CMC.

My read on MLF's offense when not co-run by Rodgers is he's hyper focused on giving away as little as possible with pre-snap formation, and then the timing between route runners and the QB, with WR's in position at the exact time the QB is supposed to check that progression.",2.0,nfl,t3_zlzlq1,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers :Packers: Packers,2022-12-14T16:45:46Z,greenbaypackers,0.0930647999999999

3. Hat and scarf.  Most of your heat is lost through your head/neck.  Get them covered well.
4. Styrofoam insulation.  Precut to about 10x15"".  Bring two of them.  The reason: You will be on aluminum bleachers/benches.  Your 'Seat' is no wider than 15 (it might even be smaller).  You will also be on concrete.  These both act as a giant heat sink and pull the heat from your body and feet.  Sit on one and put the other under your feet.

ETA: Yes, you will be on a bench with 20-24 of your new closest friends.  No, the seats are not wide enough.
