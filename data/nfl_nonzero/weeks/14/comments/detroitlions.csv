That 8-9-1 would be 12-4-2 if the defense kept all opponents to 24 points. Upgrading the D is how this team gets better.

Lol ""QB1"" is not just used on fantasy football. It has long referred to the qb on top of the depth chart.

It is funny you had to reference fantasy football (i.e. how much rostering goff has paid off for gambling) because you had no other way of showing he is not in the top 10.

Fantasy of course favors rushing QBs based on the scoring system, and also favors teams that run the ball (with running backs) less often than the Lions.

Our disagreement may not be as strong as we thought. But it still exists. I would definitely put Goff at the top of the tier I mentioned along with Tua. He is also in the top 10 of QB1s imo.

But of course he is not in the same tier as the guys I mentioned; they are in their own tier (perhaps including Jalen Hurts).",0.0,nfl,t3_zk1njh,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2022-12-12T16:35:18Z,detroitlions,-0.06054068786919

I am not claiming Goff is elite btw. He is definitely below the Burrow, Herbert, Mahomes, Allen ""elite"" tier.

You're saying he played badly against the Giants now? He was quite solid in that game. We scored 31 points, including three consecutive touchdown drives.

We were up three possessions by the beginning of the second half and the wind was extreme. So we did not end up throwing it much after getting up three possessions, and when we did throw it was conservative. He still made the throws he needed to make on third down to set up touchdowns. Plus no turnovers.

0 touchdowns in this game was practically a choice. I mean we ran for four tds.

As to early interceptions this year, did you know we had the statistical worst defense in league history after the first several weeks of this season? Goff was pressing and trying to do too much because he felt as if we needed to score every possession (and he was right).

And yeah he had two very poor consecutive games throwing to practice squad receivers on the road against the Patriots and Dallas. (The ""top 5 WR"" you mention - our stud slot receiver Saint Brown, who not better than Davante, Jefferson, Diggs, Kupp, or Tyreek -was out with a concussion after 1 play against Dallas, as were 3 of the other top 4 receivers.)

Otherwise, he has had an awesome season, as the statistics clearly show. 

Also, he has had a total of one turnover over the past seven games. Sounds pretty consistent to me. He is tied for second in the NFL in completions of 20 yards or more; does not sound average to me.

Why does he get hate in real life? Because he‚Äôs been, at best, an inconsistent quarterback through age 28. He‚Äôs had some really high highs but some horribly low lows. The Rams didn‚Äôt think he was the answer, traded 2 first round picks to upgrade from him, then immediately won the superbowl ‚Ä¶ incredibly telling and something that r/detroitlions loves to ignore.

That being said, Goff‚Äôs last 6ish weeks or so have been extremely impressive - so much so that this sub (who already loved him) is convinced that he‚Äôs the franchise QB.

I‚Äôm of the personal opinion that Goff has played well enough to where QB isn‚Äôt an absolute necessity. I also like him and have really enjoyed his recent success. You should, however, ABSOLUTELY look to draft his replacement if you think there‚Äôs a guy who can be better than him available to you. The 49ers went to an NFC championship with Jimmy and *still* looked to upgrade at 3rd overall. Competent organizations realize that good young QBs on rookie deals are the key to sustained success.

Goff is also now well-documented as someone who doesn‚Äôt elevate the players around him. If one or two key injuries pop up, his play falls off a cliff.  There aren‚Äôt many QBs who can maintain a high level of performance with a decimated skill position group obviously, but your goal as an org should be to find one who can.

TLDR: Goff is good but not consistently 30 million per year good. He‚Äôs not old but he isn‚Äôt young either.

They play at MetLife next week, in what may be their toughest game remaining; the Jets have a phenomenal defense and are right in the thick of the playoffs with Detroit. But Mike White has returned to Earth the past two weeks, Hall is out, their OLine is decimated by injuries, and they're 1-3 in their past 4. This is a tough game, but a winnable one.

After that is a trip to Carolina, who is an improving team that is fighting for a playoff spot, but not *that* good and very beatable. Darnold has been playing very well, but he's not the running QB the Lions struggle with and they just beat Cousins, who is better than Darnold in every way.

Next they take on Chicago at home. They beat Chicago in Soldier Field a few weeks ago, so we know they're capable of doing it. Fields' running style represents a problem, but again, they beat this team before.

Lastly is Green Bay in Green Bay. The difficulty of this one could go either way - if GB is out of the playoff hunt, they may decide to shut down Rodgers and give Love a chance. That, of course, throws an element of chaos into the mix because I remember what happened with Matt Flynn in 2011. But with a team not playing for anything, I don't imagine that the team that beat Green Bay earlier in the season and at the end of last season (when it similarly didn't have much to play for) will present some Olympian level of difficulty.

Fivethirtyeight projections - which go by an ELO rating that probably does not accurately reflect how well the Lions are playing right now - gives them 44%, 47%, 44%, 71%, and 47% chances to win. The odds, then, of them taking all four would be a miniscule-but-not-impossible 6.9%. But again, that' s assuming the Lions are only a middling team and not the squad with a top-5 offense on the season also packing a defense that has been statistically top-10 over the past 6 games, during which they have a +55 PD against teams with a combined 39-31 record in games against the rest of the NFL.

So 7% feels low (I think 20% is probably a more reasonable estimate), but even at 7%, it's not *that* crazy of a dream; that would be 13:1 odds, instead of maybe the 4:1 odds I'd currently suggest they have.",2.0,nfl,t3_zk5oew,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2022-12-13T07:34:22Z,detroitlions,0.0269690528615783

So if your birthday falls on a date just after the cut off day to register to play that sport, that kid gains a massive advantage because he will be older than the other kids when he is first able to sign up the following year.

Coaches will favor the more physically gifted players so they end up receiving more focused attention during training.

I had a feeling Hurts was going to absolutely light it up this year after watching him a bit last year. Out of all the ""mobile"" QBs, he strikes me as having the most incredible speed, strength and accuracy with the ball. The one thing he had to clean up was throwing from the pocket and he did that for sure, so he's reached the level of Mahomes to me. I'd still rate Mahomes as higher, but I'd put them at the same level of eliteness, with slightly different specialties. Mahomes is a traditional gunslinger who can scramble and has unprecedented ability to make throws on the run. He's also an effective leader and is mature; basically Aaron Rodgers perfected. Hurts on the other hand is a freak athlete who's only recently discovered that he has a cannon for an arm and is capable of being a gunslinger if he needs to be. He's easily the fastest quarterback in the league right now and I'd start him over Allen, Jackson, well, pretty much anyone but Mahomes.

Not sure if I'd put Goff next to Herbert and Allen though, to be honest. He's been playing his balls off and definitely is proving that he can hang with those dudes, though, in terms of a pure pocket passer.

36442,218171,218171,Wiggymaster,"We're not just winning but we're dominating physically. We're winning in the trenches, which is something this team never did. O-line play like this is unheard of in Detroit, really since the 90s, and even then I'd put today's O-line against those days. We have receivers that I'd rank on par with some of the best we've had on the roster. The days of Golden Tate and Marvin Jones were fun, but I'd rather have Jamo deep for Jones and St. Brown in the slot for Tate. Chark and Reynolds having really high production all over the place is a bonus feature - really, I can't recall us ever having this many productive receivers on the roster. 

Tight end play has been freaking phenomenal, which goes hand-in-hand with the line playing the way it has. We have some really strong blocking tight ends at this point, and they've proven effective at catching the ball when need be as well. Getting rid of Hock and going with sleepers in the passing game who are all around better blockers was a master stroke. 

On defense, we've found a pass rush again, and it's been the most effective one we've seen since Suh was in the back field. We're not quite to that realm yet, but Hutch is at the very least a match for Ziggy right now and when you factor in what Houston, Cominsky, McNeil and Buggs are doing, it's pretty freaking incredible. Add to this that Romeo Okwara is going to see more snaps and things are going to get rough for opposing QBs in a hurry. They've been absolutely lights-out stopping the run over the past few weeks, too. How many TFLs did we get on Cook this week? It was sheer dominance against the Vikings O-line, which I'll admit isn't the greatest in the world, but our D-line made them look stupid. 

The secondary and linebacker group remains the weakest units, but I'll use that term sparingly; the improvement there has been pretty awesome, too. Okudah has been balling all year. We've had some other guys like Lucas and Barnes step up before they got hurt; hopefully they'll be back soon because we need those contributions. Rodrigo has been the hero we deserve, and not enough can be said about the value Kerby Joseph has brought to safety, which has been the biggest hole since we lost Quandre Diggs. 

Special teams remain a strength. The one thing I can say for the Lions is that this is usually the case here; our punters and kickers have been legends and our return guys are usually pretty good. CJ Moore executed one of the best fakes I've ever seen against Minnesota, and wound up not only getting the first down but ran that thing deep into their territory. Raymond has had himself some pretty good returns. Badgley hasn't been perfect, but he's close, and he made it when it counted last week. \*knocks on wood\*

I will say with all honestly and certainty that this is the most *complete* team I've seen fielded as a fan of the Detroit Lions. The fact that we're in year two of a complete rebuild makes that a remarkable feat. Our rookies are not just showing up but they're showing out. These guys are playing with and winning against some of the best teams in football, and coming close against the ones they don't beat. You add a couple more difference makers to this roster, and a little more experience to the ones already here, and yes, Virginia, That Would Be a Super Bowl Team‚Ñ¢. If we manage to squeak into the playoffs this year, it would light my pants ablaze, because we'd be talking about a team that would be on the greatest winning streak of all time from a Lions perspective, and we'd almost certainly carry that momentum with us wherever we went to play. The only team I see truly measuring up against a healthy Lions team ending the season on a six game winning streak would be the Eagles. 

[I said that this roster could win 11 games](https://old.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/updlt3/the_road_to_11_wins/i8ld5gz/) if it stayed healthy all year and I meant it. If we win out, which is a real possibility right now, that'd be 10. One off my prediction, where I set a floor of 9 games.

Remember when Ebron made the pro-bowl after going to the Colts? That's T.J. He features in an offense that is slowly sputtering in the final stretch of the season, centered around one of the most prolific wideouts in the league. He has 302 yards off of 36 catches with 48 total targets, picking up 8.4 yards on average since he arrived in Minnesota. Know what his average yards with the Lions were last year? 15.2. Minnesota is using him exclusively for short yardage situations, and yet he still has more drops this year than any of his previous seasons except 2020. 

I fail to see how you can rank a dude whose catch rate, drop rate, [target on route percentage](https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/analysis/targets-per-route-run-report-week-4/) and average yards per route [all rank among the lowest among TEs in the league](https://www.rotowire.com/football/player/tj-hockenson-13610) as a top 5 TE.

That's not the kind of player you break the bank for, or try to hold on to when you have comparable or superior alternatives, which the Lions have. 

The Vikings are 4-2 since they picked up Hockenson, and he's scored all of 1 TD for them. Shane Zylstra has scored the same amount.

44784,273832,273832,jimmyslamjam,"Picture this:
‚Äã


The year is 2039. Dan Campbell just finishes his shift as a milkman.
He loads his empty milk crates back into his truck and takes it back to the depot, before picking up his own two bottles and heading home.
‚Äã

Campbell pushes the door open - it's 04:48. His wife, Jennifer, is still asleep.
‚Äã

Campbell sits down on his sofa. He peels the foil off the top of the milk and gently brings it to his lips, pausing briefly. Is someone watching him? No. Of course not.
‚Äã

With a sigh, Campbell pushes himself out. He's older now than he cares to recognise, not what he once was.
‚Äã

Moving over to the bookshelf, he moves a dusty metal mouthpiece from the top of a slightly cleaner book. A photo album. Memories. Campbell sighs again.
‚Äã

Peeling the pages apart, like how sweat would later stick himself to the bedsheets, he grins. Resting between the pages were the still faces of those who had once tried to stop him.
‚Äã

New clippings - headlines - internet posts. All of the fighting. All of the drama.
‚Äã

And what for?
‚Äã

Campbell slumped down into the privace of his chair - his body clicked and a grimace followed each shaky movement.
‚Äã

The chair itself rattled as he pressed his weight into it - the Honolulu blue and silver metal shooting light across the room, into Brad Holmes' line of sight - though partially blinded, he could see the chair clearly enough to tell it was made of metal kneecaps.
‚Äã

Campbell coughed - a hollow, haunting noise. His bald head hit the back of his makeshift throne. Movement came from upstairs - Jennifer was up.
‚Äã

In pain now, and through a raspy breath that sounded so familiar, he called:
‚Äã

""Jennifer?""
‚Äã

She came into the room - her long pink night gown trailing behind her.
‚Äã

Jennifer had a chiseled face. Stubble spread across her chin and decorated her neck, trailing off until the hairs disappeared under the soft, pink fabric.
‚Äã

Her short blonde hair stood with the weight of an expensive gel.
‚Äã

Brad Holmes watched the scene in Awe. Jennifer - Jared Goff - walked over to Campbell and held his head up gently, caressing his neck with adoration. He was old now.
‚Äã

Brad Holmes turned around. Campbell was dying. It was no place of his to intrude. And so he left.

Stafford gave his heart and soul to this organization but ultimately we couldn‚Äôt put all the pieces together. Stafford asked for a trade, so we did right by him and let him go where he went along to win a championship.

The last two years we have been very fortunate with our first overall picks, but let‚Äôs be honest those were no brainers. Sewell was the obvious choice for the team, and the fact that Jacksonville took Walker over Hutchinson either speaks to the ineptitude or pettiness of Baalke. Basically I think this sub unanimously agrees that those two picks were the best options we could‚Äôve taken. 

Now, that‚Äôs where things start to unravel and this sub has no goddamned clue what we‚Äôre talking about. Trading up to 12 takes nuts made out of iron and brawn. Finding talent in LATE day 3 takes a sharp brain and a trust in your coaches to bring those players up to speed. 

Holmes knew damn well there was a chance the Rams could go back to back, but he took the trade knowing that he trusted his judgement and his scouts and coaches.

You saying that pick could‚Äôve been in the twenties is absolutely true, that pick could‚Äôve been ANYWHERE between 1-32, and he knew that, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because I believe that he has vision and could make a team out of day three picks if he had to. 

I absolutely want that Rams pick to be as high as possible. I want Carter or Anderson Jr with that pick.
