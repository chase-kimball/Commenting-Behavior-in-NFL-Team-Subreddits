1753,12061,12061,AlternateGator,"I totally get it, they’re definitely not for everyone. You probably don’t give a shit but here are some of my random thoughts on why I like them so much:

1. They will NEVER make a movie again like Peter Jackson made LoTR. The only things CGI in those movies are the things that literally had to be. The Battle of Helm’s Deep is shot with like 90% miniatures. The Shire was a completely man made physical-set. Almost every orc you see on screen is a real dude in makeup. The sparing and thoughtful use of CGI is what has helped the effects age so well. This is partly a product of the time period they were filmed in and partly because the movie studio trusted Peter Jackson’s vision. They just won’t ever do that again because nowadays it is just cheaper to do everything with computers. The Hobbit trilogy legitimately looks more dated and cheesy than LoTR which came out more than a decade before it.

2. I absolutely love the way magic is used in the series. When the credits roll at the end of the third movie, you still don’t really know what Gandalf and the Elves and Sauron can and can’t do. It’s treated so mysteriously and vaguely and because there are no concrete established rules on what is and isn’t possible it increases the sense of realism. 

3. Mostly I just appreciate that for once I don’t feel pandered to when I’m watching them. When you’re watching the films you are just swept up in this sense that *this* is the way the world really is and if you don’t like it fuck off. You’re not getting fart jokes and one-liners and sword fights blasted in front of your eyes every 10 seconds to keep your stupid monkey brain happy.

Vea, Godwin, and CD3 all signed signed huge extensions with >20 million in dead cap and no savings if we move them. Evans is like 2 million in savings with a 20 million dollar dead cap. The only person who we could trade is Smith since his dead cap is 7 million but his cap his otherwise is 17 million. But no one would want him because he sucks colossal ass. 

We’re 45 million over the cap, so we can’t trade pretty much anybody good because of the massive dead caps associated with moving them. All the guys we’re really able to trade are guys that no one wants. All we can do is kick more of that cap down the road by further extending some of these guys and pray to God that Licht pulls off another 2020 draft and not a 2021.

*the one exception to this is maybe Devin White, but frankly no one is giving us anything of value for him unless he goes on an absolute year at the end of the year.

5154,31238,31238,CoopNine,"It is (a loser mentality) and bad form.   Bad, or questionable calls are part of the game, we as fans have the opportunity to see things at reduced speed over and over again, a ref has to make a call at that moment with what they were able to see and while there is somewhat of a luxury of replay, the first call is the most important, and they have to be careful to make sure a play is actually overturnable.   One effect I've seen in both college and the NFL are that refs have been erring on the side of caution and using replay as a crutch, which is not ideal.   In the Bucs / Saints game there was specifically a pass caught by Evans which was ruled not a catch ( did get properly overturned, but was just brutally obvious that it was a catch, had it been ruled a catch there is zero chance the other team would have used a challenge ) We see a few of these in all games, and it  slows things down and I wish they wouldn't do that.   

But in the case of this fine, it doesn't really have anything to do with the refs being bad.    They have a directive to make sure injured players get the attention they need.   Abusing this is bad, and the fines are deserved by any team that does it.   I think after the fact that is severe is the best path, because what we don't want is a player who legitimately was hurt/stung/whatever, but can come back in has that opportunity denied.   IF teams abuse this, what I forsee is a rule that says if you go out for injury within x minutes of the end of the game/half, the player is sidelined until the next half starts.   This is bad, and increases  the chance of injury, because players will be encouraged not to show signs of injury and play when they shouldn't.

It's a hard problem to solve, but probably the best way is to hit offenders after the fact with the biggest hammer you can.   Certainly some teams will get more sneaky about it, but this particular instance was uh... pretty blatant, not the most blatant ever, but comes right after direction.

11418,75252,75252,Kreynard54,">He just led a comeback down double digits with 5 minutes left last week .

Against a poorly coached and weak talent Saints team that also had injuries, you can reference the Rams and again, against a weak team. We are an average team at best and thats mostly because our defense can dominate middle of the pack and worse offenses. Kansas City and our Game against the 9ers are the glaring examples of of us not competing with good teams and that REALLLY over exposes the coaching more than anything else. If we were even performing average we wouldnt need that. 

I think his mastery of two minute offense is obviously there, its the only time we move the ball and theres a simple answer why. Frankly two minute drill is VERY simple, especially for him. Because all he has to do is watch the safeties, and make a decision. 

Cover 0?: Throw to your best guy, hes going to get open. He usually targets Godwin. 

Cover 1?  Attack the outside deep because chances are receivers going to be in 1 on 1. This is where he usually hits Julio or Miller deep if he had the arm strength for it. 

Cover 2? Attack the middle of the field and bank on a weak Lineback. 

Cover 3?  Attack the outside mid range or short.

Tom Brady is REALLY good at playing simple football, hes been regressing at everything else. 

**I have been to every home game, I rewatch every game.** Hes regressed in his reads (theirs times players are uncovered and he doesn't see it presnap or during the play), add in a mix of drops from receiver injuries at the beginning of the season to bad throws at the worst times and its clear that hes more of an effective game manager than a playmaker at this point.

Its definitely MAINLY coaching, but also Brady needs guys that get separation, he needs speed guys. Thats why he loved AB, it opened up the scheme for everyone else. 

I would argue he wouldnt be able to help Detroit, their talent level is weaker, maybe the oline would help. But while St Brown is a good route runner, hes not as good as Godwin or Evans. Hell Goff being a risk taker is what makes those plays happen, Brady doesn't throw 50-50 balls, he throws to who gets separation. He doesnt feel comfortable throwing that 50-50 to Evans unless its the corner of the endzone.

And we still won.

This is a weird thing to say when every single team also has injury issues. We just got lit up by  a 3rd string, rookie, 7th rounder QB - coaching has been an issue preventing us from being an elite team this whole time (also preventing us from being bottom feeders).

Weird flex but ok:

1.	Vikings - the Vikings missed 3 field goals, making the 26-14 game much closer than it was
2.	Atlanta - a 31-27 win against a team that was 4-10 and we had to come from being down 24-7 in the third. 
3.	Lions - a 47-7 win where we played a bad team who is missing it’s whole coaching staff and had their offensive assistant calling plays 
4.	Atlanta - the game where it was close against a 4-12 team until the end of the fourth quarter where the falcons fumbled then turned over the ball on downs and the Bucs managed to capitalize w 2 TDs

This totally sounds like an elite team which then played Heineke down to the wire, created a few turnovers against the Saints, threw 3 straight INTs against the packers and relied on their coaching kicking a dumb FG on 4th down, and then played KC missing both its OTs.

They lost to all the teams that BA and Bowles have sucked against, with the exception of the 2020 playoffs! Chiefs, Saints, and Rams…. Oh and the Redskins. And they played the Bills down to the wire.

26311,159520,159520,fluffy_boy_cheddar,"What bothers me the most is the fact that every time the camera shows Bowles, he is just standing there with his arms crossed not saying a word with his mic flipped up.  Then the other teams coach is shown walking, talking, and you know...actively coaching! Then he goes on to post game interviews and makes excuses.  Like, why is it too late in the season to make changes?  Why can't we do different things?  Why do we run it up the gut every 1st down?  Why does Brady have to target the same player who missed a catch on the prior snap? (Example, Brate and Otton yesterday)  Why does the second half become a Brady pass-fest and we no longer run the ball?

It's like the coaches are playing Madden and trying to cheese the same plays over and over.  If Bowles is saying it's to late in the season to make changes to our play calling, then he has already given up, if he ever cared at all.
