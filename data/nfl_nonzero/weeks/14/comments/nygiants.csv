You can always make an argument against comparing any two players. Why did they have so few wins despite his stats? What percentage of those stats came against prevent defenses? He had zero come from behind wins in 2020. 

And wins don't matter to a degree. But when you only get 4 wins, well wins is a factor. They did not beat a team with a winning record, they  Two of those wins were against the 1-15 Jags.

30147,261104,261104,nrepasy,"What's his yardage on those receptions?  305 

He almost has more yardage than all of our receivers who we've played all year. Basically 50 less yards than Richie James has right now, same amount of tds. We only have one other receiver, Slayton, with more yards for the year. And he's at 63% catch rate right now, one less touchdown, basically double the yards. And that's our wr1. Charks arguably the wr3/4 on that team.

Amon-ra is ~100 yds shy of a 1000 yd season, with 6 tds. And he basically missed two full games. I'd say he's a wr1? 

And I replied because I don't think they're scrubs?? Exactly what I said in my comment? You brought up them not being responsible for Goff's success afterwards, and I said I never claimed that. Sorry I missed the unspoken ""context"".

And I'm not meaning to disrespect Goff, but he's also not a QB who elevates receivers, they and him have played well and all credit is due.

Edit: Really I'm trying to figure out how you judge wrs, because we have a ""serviceable"" core apparently, while one of the top scoring offenses has scrubs who are putting up similar or better stat lines than our wrs in less games.
