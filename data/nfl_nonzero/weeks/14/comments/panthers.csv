To be honest?  I knew even less about football than I do now (I'm hardly an expert, most of the names don't mean that much to me yet) but when gf & me watched some older Superbowl games (courtesy of NFL gamepass) we eventually lost ourselves in the Panthers. THAT was going to be ""our"" team (this was in week 1).

We all know the rest: one loss after the other, though we always saw drive & potential. We weren't going to back down, and backing a possible underdog? Only made it more exciting!

And let's not kid ourselves: Panthers *always* had potential: their win from the Buccanneers and then the other team going up against 'm next week looses? (but then also gets a win over us, *darn!*).

Point being: we never stopped believing, Panthers was ""our"" team and nothing would change our mind.

And then we get THIS game...  omg...  they revived themselves!

Next stop.. the Steelers. It's going to be a tough cookie but at least we'll have home advantage (says the guy living on the other side of the world, lol!). But I'm serious... this game was HUGE, in Seattle.. and they STILL pulled it off!

gf & me are expecting Panther merch to arrive soon, all the way in frickin' Europe (!!) . At first it was gonna be ""supportive wear"", now I'm darn proud to be a (very / non-existent) small part of all this!!

GO Panthers!

20334,130577,130577,ShelLuser42,"**Shell's half-time report (no spoilers!)**

Disclaimer: I'm a passionate overseas Panthers / football fan, **not** an expert!

The pressure was on the Panthers, big time. You could see as much with several false starts. But they managed to push forward until the Seahawks managed to stop them, but they were well in bounds for a decent field goal.

Then the Seahawks got their turn but got blocked and even *pushed back* several times by the Panthers. Not to mention that our favorite team managed to strike like a Panther by intercepting the ball multiple times. Just when you don't see it coming a Panther can strike ya know, and that happens with the first touchdown!

But... please don't cut the Seahawks short?  I really respect them as a team, seen many of their matches, and sometimes they need some time to get going and 'into' the match, which seems to be the case here.

Because while we started out with a full denial to the Seahawks a few quick passes and runs allowed them to score their first touchdown as well. And that seems to have motivated their defense as well, because the Panthers next run ended in nothing.

But then we had yet *another* interception by the Panthers!

And from what I can tell the pressure was on the Seahawks now because they too got a few flags and ditto penalties. One for a false start and one for a personal foul...  a Seahawk thought he was a Panther and tried to grab one of ours... can't do that ;)

But please don't cut the Seahawks short... they pushed back with a mighty fine 30 yard pass and eventually followed it up with another touchdown.

We're not there yet but if you ask me this is the Panthers best game of the season so far, they're really into it!

Even if we loose (you never know, do NOT underestimate the Seahawks!!) ... but even then we'll still have gained something because this new formula is obviously working. THIS is what the Panthers need right now.
