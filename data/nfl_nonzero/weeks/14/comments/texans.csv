That said, I think it kills his ceiling. He absolutely will not be able to throw effectively over the middle in the NFL. This has always been Wilson’s greatest flaw and is really showing this year. Kyler’s worst performances come when he is bottled up in the pocket because his height limits him so much.

There's also the pasta's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its composition - its personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. 

As a consequence people who dislike Kelvin Benjamin copypastas truly ARE idiots- I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the pasta's genius unfolds itself on their monitor screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂

If he does you’re looking at the top 3 probably being off the board by the time the Browns pick comes up and I don’t believe he’s in a position to take a major project QB like Richardson right now (especially in the 1st round)

So now that leaves building up the team up this year to take a swing for the FQB next year. Either A) he does a good enough job that we play ourselves out of one of the top guys next year and find ourselves back in QB purgatory or B) we’re one of the worst teams in the league once again and now Caserio is going to have to do a hell of a tap dance to justify why he should keep his job.

The Broncos writer has had two all-time great QBs, neither of whom were accused of being a serial sexual assaulter. The Broncos writer has greatness to relive.

The Texans have mediocrity. We have had maybe 2 total seasons of being real good, not even great. Every one of our playoff wins was a fluke, aided by playoff Dalton, third string rookies taking their first and only snaps, and refs pulling random bullshit out their ass to save us from a dumb decision. We still haven't been to the AFCCG, even though the goddamn Jags have been minutes away from a SB appearance. We've been one of the greatest postseason collapses in NFL history, followed up by one of the most embarrassing regular season collapses that we're still struggling through. We're the worst team in the NFL, by a wide margin. We fucking lost to the very same Broncos that their writer is struggling over.
