You're correct, there are plenty of teams that would be 'triggered' and knee jerk a change.  Plenty of teams to insert a 3rd OC into a 2nd year QB's mind, because they think they know better than a 8 time Super Bowl champion.  

lol

>A good plan, violently executed today, is better than a perfect plan next week."" - Patton

When the GOAT was here all we heard about was 'where are his weapons' - now all we here is 'the OC sucks because he couldn't turn a franchise around that is literal shit in a toilet bowl in a port-o-potty'

If Mac Jones was throwing to Gronk and Edelman, - and had Scar coaching an offensive line - you'd have pencil in your ear and a burly beard.

'01 - Steelers D is probably too conservative to do what needed to be done to slow down the GSOT.  Probably Rams

'03 - Peyton was having an absurd 8 TD postseason until he got clowned against the Pats D, so probably the Colts. 

'04 - Peyton probably struggles against whomever in the divisional round still, so Steelers looks like a safe bet, but a flawed team with Rook. Ben vs that Eagles team... that's a tough one, probably the most balanced hypothetical SB matchup

'07 - Philip Rivers on no ACL vs that pass rush?  Still giants

'11 - That Ravens team had a comically better Defense then the Pats, they probably make short work of that Giants squad.

'14 - Yeah that Colts team was not beating the Legion of Boom.

'16 - Steelers again probably play too normal of a defense to hold up against that Falcons squad.  

'17 - Be a funny cinderalla scenario of Bortles vs Foles in the superbowl, but I doubt the result's changing any.

'18 - God the offensive explosion that would've been the Chiefs - Rams in a Superbowl.  Presumably Mahomes takes it, but those two defenses would've been completely outmatched.  Possibly the most fun hypothetical SB matchup.

there's a lot to this...I'll start in the Brady era just as most of it starts here.

Let me preface this by saying before the re-alignment Colts and Patriots were in the same division. Colts still have more AFC East titles than the NY Jets (6 for the colts, 4 for the jets - not sorry AT ALL Jets fans)

1) Irsay went to the league and cried because we bullied his receivers in the playoffs [https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6pnuua/what_is_the_ty_law_rule/] a little thread about it: the Ty Law Rule.

NFL made it a softer league for WR because of this, which helped (all) offenses a lot, this is part of the offensive explosion in the league around this time.

2) They were our bitches, during the Manning vs Brady era....PS: they had a few big wins vs us...for example the [infamous 4&2 ](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/ten-years-ago-today-fourth-and-2-bill-belichick-made-one-his-most-controversial-decisions) 

Indy vs Patriots: Records head to head (stop comparing QBs vs QBs - but this was the narrative by the media) Regular season Brady 9, Manning 3. Post season Brady 2, Manning 1.

3) Deflategate. I don't want to get into this too much but [Wiki got yah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate)

4) Andrew Luck, their second in a row (would be Hof QB, i miss him - only Colt player i ever liked) never won vs us.



Other side notes.

One of the [greatest special teams play in their history was vs us on national tv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i7VKQwDS2s)

and ofc  this year [colts fired Reich after losing to us](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/colts-fire-head-coach-frank-reich-after-third-straight-loss)

Irsay hates losing to us.

I'm sure i'm missing some things but yah this is the majority of it /u/sumcal

To all the colt fans: I voted for you all as my most hated team so it's mutual there - I understand the downvotes in advance, not mad at it.

To other AFC-E fans: I really don't hate any of y'all..i don't like y'all but i don't ""hate you all"" but fuck the jets fr fr.

Mahomes doesn't seem to have any options besides holding out. With stuff so far in advance, unless he has a handshake agreement with the ownership, there isn't enough solid since GMs can change. Who is to say that the next GM will just auto restructure and try to keep Mahomes for cheap? Mahomes is under contract until he is 36 so it is a bit past his prime years of when he can still use his legs to help his passing game (using Rodgers as a benchmark).

Mahomes current cap hit of 36 M is also not that big when you take into account that it also includes an auto restructure. Real numbers would be \~32 M which is a lot lower.

The whole money is low as well. For reference, Watson has a higher average value despite Mahomes being under contract for a longer period of time. Same thing with Kyler Murray.

Watson is slated to earn more than Mahomes will (cap hit wise, despite KC having punted 17 M put into that period of time).",1.0,nfl,t3_zl72bc,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-12-14T00:16:06Z,patriots,0.0399205809986901

Screenplay heavy gameplans try and force those linebackers and ends to respect the edge to give Mac more time through scheme in the pocket when they do go for a pass

Not saying it's right but that could be the concept behind it.

Bit the same with the play actions everyone is clamouring for. Earlier in the season we saw them try to do more of it and Mac getting blown up for big losses in the backfield. Even when we do a run there is a lot of pressure in the backfield for the RBS to navigate. Which is why I presume we don't do much play action even against teams that have bad stats against it. Because the line can't stand up to a focused attack from other defenses 

So the argument basically is it's better to be heavy throwing the screen where we have a 55 percent chance of making yards off let's say than trying play action or pocket passing heavy gameplans where we have a 55 percent chance of losing yards on (made up numbers for example purposes obviously)",6.0,patriots,t3_zkugvi,False,0.0,:Kendrick_Bourne: ForeverNE:edelman:,2022-12-13T07:11:17Z,patriots,0.0538605505723441
