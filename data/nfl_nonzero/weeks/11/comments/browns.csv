Take a cup of whatever bourbon you have lying around the house and measure carefully. Then chug it.

Then take half a cup of the stuff and throw it into a sauce pan with 2 cups of sugar, the juice of 4 freshly squoze Oranges, the zest of 1 orange, a couple cinnamon sticks and a couple quarter size slices of ginger and bring that shit to a boil.

**Protip**: Dont stand directly over the pan because i got gassed by the alcohol.

Reduce heat and reduce sauce for like 8 minutes. Take another nip or 3 of the bourbon to speed up time.

Throw in a pound of cranberries fresh or frozen and a scraped vanilla bean (or 2 tsp of extract) and keep that bitch simmering til the cranberries get soft. Like 15 minutes or so. Then you can mash those little shits with a potato masher and keep simmering until thick.

Now is a good time to make an old fashioned or just drink straight from the bottle.

Then pick out all those stupid things you put in at the beginning.

**Protip:** dont try to use your fingers to pick those little bastards out. Use like a fork or something. Shit is really hot.

Let the stuff cool down then transfer to a bowl and stick it into the fridge overnight. Then look at your dog's face as he judges you and pass out on the floor.

Garrett, Peppers (not a bad player just traded him for a better one), Njoku. Ward, Wills (hasn’t met expectations but he is still a viable NFL starter), and Newsome isn’t a bad run either.

Our history with first round picks hasn’t been that bad since 2017 tbh. Baker was arguably our worst first round pick in that time period and he still managed to win a playoff game.

Worst case? Well if Stefanski doesnt work out after next year at least the franchise can say to future coaches ""we gave the last coaching group everything they wanted and needed to succeed, including a QB and a bunch of star players, and plenty of time/tenure to do their work"". 

This is all a step in the right direction (to not being the league's worse trashfire).

23862,176394,176394,deviden,"> how we went from a great D at the end of last year to being such trash

There's a real confluence of factors, the most obvious of which is the mistakes made by Berry/Woods with the DTs, but that alone doesn't explain it. 

Ultimately, at least as far as we can see with results, Woods and his staff aren't the best teachers and they don't seem equipped to get this defense out of its current tailspin. The match quarters 4-2-5 base scheme is not easy to learn and we have maybe the youngest (and one of the cheapest) defensive rosters in the league.

The defense's start to last season was horrific, and I think what happened was that as they learned the scheme better they radically improved... and then Woods & co. started this season with an assumption that what the players had learned last time round about the scheme's zone coverage rules would stick and they had the players on a 301 level teaching of the scheme when they should have maybe have gone back to 201 or 101 level and build as the season goes on. 

This year the DT problems has combined with the fact that everyone in the league has wised up to the importance of running the ball against the kinds of soft/2-high/quarters looks our defense likes to use. So we're defending with light boxes, with a deficient DL group, and we're facing opponents who are using a greater variety of different creative run play designs to exploit/attack our scheme, and the failings of the defensive coaches in teaching their scheme means that guys seem to don't know how to fit the run (which gap they attack/plug on a run play). 

You don't get a historically bad run defense without a series of factors all coming together... and sadly for us that's what's happening. 

That historically bad run D means we're rarely seeing 3rd and long, which is what we DO have the personnel to be genuinely good at, so our defense is frequently tired/beat up and rarely in the situations it wants to be in, and we're now entering the ""players losing faith in coaches"" phase so it's unlikely any of this can be fixed until the offseason.",1.0,browns,t3_z0yc00,False,0.0,:crazy-joe:,2022-11-21T10:48:10Z,browns,0.0029837158977985

23864,176396,176396,deviden,"AB made his roster strategy very clear, in the few interviews where he spoke candidly instead of giving the Ivy League stock answers.

He essentially said: ""the draft is for long term development, trades and free agency are for short term fixes"", and the guardrails are clear. Draft very young guys with star-potential measurables (then trust that NFL coaches can fix them up).

The problem with not trusting AB (or if Haslam decides not to trust AB and fires him early) is that a lot of his picks don't pay off in the first year. It's a long term approach and it's more like what the Ravens do - get a high volume of mid round picks and use them to get big, strong, fast young dudes in the building on super cheap deals, then if they develop into starters you get comp picks when they walk and sign elsewhere, or if you want to keep them you get them signed to a cheaper extension early (like the Eagles do).

The roster isn't in the state it was in like the old days, the Hue/Sashi days, where we expected every 4th and 5th rounder to hit the field as an immediate impact starter because *we had never had any dudes*. 

Sadly, things have gone so badly this year with the defensive staff (and ST) that we're all at risk of Haslem coming in and blowing it all up before we get a chance to see how a real long term roster strategy (something we've not had in CLE since Bellichick...) might actually turn here in Cleveland given time.",3.0,browns,t3_z0yc00,False,0.0,:crazy-joe:,2022-11-21T08:28:17Z,browns,-0.1013346467640426

If you think this roster doesnt contain enough building block players for a competitive roster I'd recommend you manage your expectations between now and the 2025 offseason, which is where we're committed up to with so many of the current pieces and the Watson trade + contract.

> This is my least favorite team in maybe ever

How quickly we forget the Freddie Kitchens experience. 

I dont think there's been any disappointment greater than getting blown out by the Titans in that week one game, then over the course of the season the realization started sinking in that Dorsey had blown all our rebuild assets on two plus starters, a me-first ""star"" WR and the 3rd best QB in his draft class. All the misery endured through 1-31 to get us a new team and it was all for nothing - we've got more Sashi era players still in the building than we do Dorsey players. 

> Joe Woods is a lost cause. Is it Scheme? Is it player talent? Kevin's seat is slowly becoming warmer but no way he gets let go after this season.

I think it's a cascade failure. 

Woods/Berry had misevaluated the quality of the DT position within the team, thinking that what we had would be good enough, and Woods ""thought the team was further along"" (his own words) re: scheme and understanding of coverages on the field. Then the team gets run on constantly and the coverage busts happen... and everything from there has been a failure of teaching and leadership among the defensive staff.

Every week they're coaching to fix the previous week's issues, tidy up the blown plays, trying to get the rotating cast of replacement DTs and LBs accommodated to the system's run fits, and all the limited coaching time they have every week is being spent on patching holes and not game-specific adjustments. 

As Woods and his defensive coaches are now in over their heads, spiralling, the defensive players are losing belief and cynicism, public complaints and business decisions start to creep in. 

So yeah - failures cascading into other failures and it's now beyond the competency of our defensive staff to fix this during the season. They go basic to make sure players understand the scheme and they get torched by clever OCs, they call complex plays and players dont understand and the coverages/run fits are busted open. The defense needs a new coaching staff... mainly because of the reset of scheme and mentality that comes with that.

> Cade York. What a fall from grace. 

Nothing wrong with York that a proper special teams coach can't fix. The blocked kicks are looking more like a failure of ST blocking details than a lack of talent in the kid.

The remaining test for Stefanski and Berry at this point is whether they can rebuild the defensive and special teams coaching groups. So long as Watson is the real deal (yikes), this roster isn't unfixable - it just needs good coaching and experienced coaches on D/ST.",11.0,browns,t3_z0yc00,False,0.0,:crazy-joe:,2022-11-21T08:10:43Z,browns,0.0198969562686269

23868,176400,176400,deviden,"Stop this nonsense. There's no star coach coming here. Why do you think the Browns have to get unproven/developmental head coaches like Stefanski (the best we've had since 1999? Romeo Crennell?) while the Giants get Daboll and the 49ers get Shanahan and the Rams got Sean McVay. 

The Browns owner is Jimmy Haslam and his reputation is mud. Those other teams have owners with good reputations among the league's *very small world*. Coaches and scouts talk.

Go listen to the McVay/Shanahan podcast episode of Flying Coach. The best young coaches coaches who are sought after by many teams know what's up, they can afford to turn down guys like Haslam and wait for the right opportunity - then when one of those guys gets that opportunity they call up the best young potential coordinators from around the league and get them in the building too. 

They're not coming to a franchise that stumbles from coach to coach and GM to GM every couple of years, keeps blowing up the roster, is the very model of instability, has never had a franchise QB and is now in the middle of a whole bunch of long term roster/team building commitments that would lock in any new GM or HC - the Watson contract, two years with no 1st round picks, Myles contract, Chubb contract, etc, etc. 

If you want a coach like Kyle Shanahan to come here it's not happening - not until Haslam proves to the league that he's capable of letting a mediocre or better HC get a full run at the job with a real QB and allows a GM go through a full roster build-commit-rebuild cycle without getting all his work blown up halfway through. 

Newsflash: when Stefanski was hired in the wake of the Freddie/Dorsey shitshow loads of other coaches were turning down the opportunity to interview. It was the least desirable job in the NFL - my hope is that by the time Stefanski is done here it's not that any more.

Mark my words. If Haslam gives you what you want - Stefanski gone, all the coaches gone, etc - their replacements will more than likely be worse; it's back to finding guys at the bottom of the barrel who will even be willing take an interview here. I hope you enjoy the football shit sandwich they'll inevitably serve up every week, until you break and it's back to ""fire the damn coach"" again, and again, and again because that's all Browns fans know at this point and we're all conditioned to think that repeating the same 2-3 year cycle is the only way a team can be run. 

The best thing we can hope for is that Stefanski and Berry are able to bring in a former-HC defensive coordinator who's been around the league a long ass time and can put together a unit that's fundamentally sound with high morale for next year, and that having a real QB will allow Kev to take the offense to new levels.
