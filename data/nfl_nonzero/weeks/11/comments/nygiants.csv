Just to reiterate what we all know about our WR woes but he has a point.

15840,138998,138998,Potential-Car,"My know very little about football take from yesterday. 

1) DJ had 341 yard game. The first int was a good defensive play, but the second one was on Jones. People can say most of those yards were at garbage time but we were down 18 against the ravens and won so idk if we were ever *really* in garbage time 

2) daboll’s first bonehead move this season was putting Adoree back to return kicks. If you’re putting him back there, tel him to just fair catch the damn ball and not get killed gaining 4 yards. 

3) saquon looked like Saquon of last 2 years. Not sure if he is still nursing that shoulder thing from a few weeks back, bad scheming this week, an off week for him, or if the lions just game planned to shut him down. Either way hope we see saquon of the  last few weeks in Dallas

4) Thibs my guy - I know you’re a rookie but need you to step up. Tbh look in the mirror. Usually DE can start making an impact day 1 (heck look at Hutchison). We need you to step up and do your job and humble yourself a bit. Hutch has more ints yesterday than you have sacks on the whole season. Thomas’ turnaround gives me hope that maybe Thibs just needs a bit more time to adjust but if he keeps playing like he has been, I’d be disappointed. Blah blah he is being held on every play - no he isn’t. If he legit was, calls would have been made. The refs might be bad but they wouldn’t no-call holding on him down after down. Yes some of them are, but then Thibs needs an acting class this offseason to fricken sell it

5) Wandale. Rip. Heal up my guy! 

6) yeah I’ll say it - no chance we beat Dallas at home on a short week. Especially after holding Vikings to 3 and scoring 40 points. 

7) Obj - If he is truly between us and Dallas I see it as this. If he wants more money and a more realistic shot of the playoffs this year (albeit to lose in the first round) he goes to Dallas. If he wants to become a teams WR1 and play more and be a bigger impact (prob would be WR 3 on Dallas), have more of the pomp and circumstance of returning “home”, wants more opportunities for endorsements in a NY market, and wants to be part of the culture Schoen and Co are building and be with Saquon again, but make less money, he would go with us. Also him going to Dallas would be the biggest FU in giants history and he would be my least fav ex giant ever lol.

I have no idea if any of next years class of QBs is any better. I just know that a rookie QB in our situation is probably going to look a lot worse. All we can do is trust Daboll/Shoen to make the right choice.

All that being said, I believe we need to improve other areas. Personally, I'd try to get Jones and Barkley back on reasonable deals, extend Thomas and Dex, and resign guys like Love.
