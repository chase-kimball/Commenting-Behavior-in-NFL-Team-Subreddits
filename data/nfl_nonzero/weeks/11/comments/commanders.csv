30175,232565,232565,frodo54,">Mills has film out there that teams studied and could pinpoint weak areas.

In relation to this, actually, I was watching some film breakdown from Washington last week and Rivera made an offhand comment about Mills liking to slide to the side he's going to throw to.

It piqued my curiosity, so I went and pulled up all-22 from the Giants game, Eagles game, and week 1 vs the Colts.

Mills is halfing the field, completely on his own. If he's not running a timing play, like an out, or a screen, or hook, or something like that, he either only looks at the half of the field the ball is snapped on, or slides to the other side of the field while looking for an open target. Defenses can just run zone against him and completely shut down his passing.

It's how they got the pick-6 at the start of the game. Mills didn't slide right, so Forrest knew the out was the pass, so he broke early and got in the way.

I don't know if Pep isn't spending enough time with Mills to get him comfortable with throwing across the field, but this is a large part of the reason our offense is bad this year, and they need to fix it",2.0,texans,t3_z1lk35,False,0.0,:toro:,2022-11-23T13:04:11Z,commanders,-0.0865638638639475

There's a reason we almost never won any games against the top half of the league. They had coaches and we didn't.

Flexible Scheduling Procedures
Published: May 12, 2022 at 07:41 PM
Allows teams to play their way onto the Sunday night schedule
In 2006, the NFL implemented a ""flexible scheduling"" procedure for Sunday Night Football. Flexible scheduling ensured quality matchups on Sunday night in those weeks and gave surprise teams a chance to play their way onto primetime. ""Flexible scheduling"" for Sunday night may be used twice between Weeks 5-10, and during Weeks 11-17.
In weeks of the season eligible for ""flexible scheduling,"" the games listed for the Sunday night window are tentative and subject to change. Only Sunday afternoon games are eligible to be moved to Sunday night, in which case the tentatively scheduled Sunday night game would be moved to a Sunday afternoon.
Sunday afternoon games may also be moved between 1:00 PM and 4:05 PM or 4:25 PM ET. Flexible scheduling will not be applied to games airing on Thursday, Saturday or Monday nights.

Just as the six major college football conferences have done for many years, the NFL has the flexibility to move the start times of games on Sundays, using a 12-day notice format.
For example, a game scheduled for a Sunday could move from a 1:00 p.m. ET kickoff to an 8:15 p.m. start, but the change would be made and announced no later than the prior Tuesday, 12 days prior. Sunday afternoon games, as in the past, can still be moved between 1:00 and 4:05 or 4:25 p.m. ET.
In Week 17, in order to ensure a Sunday night game with playoff implications, the decision to move the start time may be made on six days notice.
2022 Flexible Scheduling Procedures
""Flexible scheduling"" will be used in Weeks 11-18. Additionally, in Weeks 5-10, flexible scheduling may be used in no more than two weeks. In Weeks 5-17, the schedule lists the games tentatively set for Sunday Night Football on NBC. Only Sunday afternoon games are eligible to be moved to Sunday night, in which case the tentatively scheduled Sunday night game would be moved to an afternoon start time.
For Week 18, two Saturday games and the Sunday night game will be announced no later than six days prior to January 9. The schedule does not list Saturday games or a Sunday night game in Week 18, but games with playoff implications will be moved to those time slots. Flexible scheduling ensures quality matchups in all Sunday time slots in those weeks and gives ""surprise"" teams a chance to play their way into primetime.
Flexible scheduling will not be applied to games airing on Thursday or Monday nights.
NFL FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING 101
Begins Sunday of Week 5
In effect during Weeks 5-18
Up to 2 games may be flexed into Sunday Night between Weeks 5-10
Only Sunday afternoon games are subject to being moved into the Sunday night window.
The game that has been tentatively scheduled for Sunday night during flex weeks will be listed at 8:15 p.m. ET.
The majority of games on Sundays will be listed at 1:00 p.m. ET during flex weeks except for games played in Pacific or Mountain Time zones which will be listed at 4:05 or 4:15 p.m. ET.
No impact on Thursday, or Monday night games.
The NFL will decide (after consultation with CBS, FOX, NBC) and announce as early as possible the game being played at 8:15 p.m. ET. The announcement will come no later than 12 days prior to the game. The NFL may also announce games moving to 4:05 p.m. ET and 4:25 p.m. ET.
Week 18 start time changes could be decided on 6 days notice to ensure a game with playoff implications.
The NBC Sunday night time slot in ""flex"" weeks will list the game that has been tentatively scheduled for Sunday night.
Fans and ticket holders must be aware that NFL games in flex weeks are subject to change 12 days in advance (6 days in Week 18) and should plan accordingly.

I was calling for JDR to be canned earlier this year. Hell, the entire coaching staff, honestly. But I‚Äôve come around on a few things:

1. Del Rio finally has this defense playing how we all hoped it would.

2. Considering Heinicke‚Äôs limitations, I think Turner‚Äôs play calling has been pretty creative of late.

3. The offense‚Äôs recent involvement of Terry also suggests that his previous lack of use was actually a Wentz problem (who historically under targets wide receivers) and not a scheme problem. 

All that said, I don‚Äôt think that the coaching staff‚Äôs jobs should necessarily be guaranteed heading into the next year. There‚Äôs lots of football left to play.
