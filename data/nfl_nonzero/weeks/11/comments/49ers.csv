18317,131942,131942,Paladuck,"So after reading the opinions of several former NFL players it seems the consensus is that even if it is tipping, it doesn't matter. Additionally, the tipping isn't just some kind of poker tell, its a necessary stance adjustment that helps players win their rep. If you eliminate the tipping but it causes you to get beat then it doesn't mean shit.

[Former Rams/Bengals All-Pro Tackle Andrew Whitworth had this to say](https://twitter.com/AndrewWhitworth/status/1592699443337273344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1592699443337273344%7Ctwgr%5Eae82b8a9021dc369e03fbaa464466f990927c7da%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2F49ers%2Farticle%2Fniners-trent-williams-tipping-plays-17590343.php): ""Well first ask yourself how many defenders get to look at his feet from this angle [referring to the All-22 film]?  Zero. All the motions and formations this offense has. Nobody has time to worry about Trent feet. He doesn’t just do it run or pass.  Sometimes it’s just different blocks.""

[Former linebacker Emmanuel Acho said that because of all that players have to account for pre-snap and how they communicate with each other, even if Williams had a tell it basically wouldn't matter.](https://twitter.com/EmmanuelAcho/status/1592711909048221696)

Former tackle George Foster[ gave a very technical explanation](https://twitter.com/GeorgeFoster72/status/1592898494112886784?s=20&t=dsVwq8YaXzK1OlNdv8amgw) of how the different stances are things lineman have done for ages and a necessary advantage to pass protecting and blocking. [He also got an ""lol"" from former All-Pro Defensive end Robert Mathis](https://twitter.com/RobertMathis98/status/1592917960863408131?s=20&t=49R9SJmUCCFKB0Bbq86Czg) after people continued to argue with him about why he was wrong.

Foster also replied to someone who argued that it may not matter for Trent Williams but it definitely does for someone like Mike McGlinchey: [""Eh. Doesn’t matter like you think it does really really trust me on this one.""](https://twitter.com/GeorgeFoster72/status/1592914973843652608?s=20&t=cJtx2V7dQU26RNxEg5ZNXA)
