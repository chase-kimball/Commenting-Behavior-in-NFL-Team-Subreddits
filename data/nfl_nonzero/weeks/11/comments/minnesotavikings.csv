AT has started all 9 games as the #2 WR. A lot of teams don’t have a consistent WR starting at #2 (the Titians doesn’t even have a legit #1 or 2). 



- So take the Jets, who did you use as their #2 and how many games did you divide his total by?

Kwesi was in that Browns FO at the time, so my guess is he subscribes to that theory and is looking at extending hock for 3-5 years this offseason.

36069,234325,234325,mrmpls,"Isiah Pacheco caught it.

Think of it this way: Unrelated to a kickoff, if you run with the ball out of bounds, you are out of bounds. By rule, a ball cannot be advanced out of bounds, so e.g. if you run out at the 8 yard line, the ball is placed at the 8. Likewise, if you catch the ball out of bounds, it is an incomplete pass, because you cannot catch the ball out of bounds.

For a kickoff, suppose the receiving team does not touch it, but the kick-off is out of bounds. This is the penalty that puts the ball at the 40 yard line.

Now, what if a player stands out of bounds and picks up the ball (from in bounds)? The ball is out of bounds, and the ball is placed at the 40.

You can see Randall Cobb doing this ""correctly"":

[https://www.si.com/nfl/2012/12/23/randall-cobb-takes-advantage-of-bizarre-nfl-rule](https://www.si.com/nfl/2012/12/23/randall-cobb-takes-advantage-of-bizarre-nfl-rule)

Edit: The rule itself is Rule 6, Section 2, Article 3. ""For a kickoff out of bounds: The receiving team may elect to take possession of the ball 25 yards from the spot of the kick at the inbounds line on the side of the field where the ball went out of bounds, or at the out-of-bounds spot.""

Edit 2: The ball is out of bounds because of Rule 3, Section 21, Article 3, Item 1. ""**A ball that is in player possession is out of bounds when the runner is out of bounds**, or when the ball touches a boundary line or anything that is on or outside such line, except another player or an official.""

It's not placed at the spot where you see Randall Cobb in that SI article because he didn't ever possess it inbounds. If he had, then it would be placed there: ""If the receiving team is the last to touch the ball before it goes out of bounds, the receiving team puts the ball in play at the inbounds spot.""",24.0,nfl,t3_z1548y,False,0.0,:Vikings: Vikings,2022-11-21T11:51:56Z,minnesotavikings,0.0226666666547321

36074,234336,234336,mrmpls,"To clear the field including sidelines, they would have to remove an area 425' long by 265' wide, 112,625 square feet, at 66"" deep, that's roughly 625,000 cubic feet of snow. A cubic foot of snow might weigh 7-30 pounds (Google), so at 10 pounds this is likely 6,250,000 pounds of snow, or 3,125 tons. If 15 pounds per cubic foot, it's around 4,500 tons.

If you had to clear the bleachers, Google Maps says it looks like that might be 600'x700' or so, including the field, so that's 420,000 square feet, 2,310,000 cubic feet, 23,100,000 pounds of snow, or 11,550 tons.

Google says a snow shovel holds 1-1.5 cubic feet of snow, as a Minnesotan I'm pretty sure that's on the low side, so let's say 2 cubic feet. (If it's heavy, that's 30 pounds, so you don't want much more than that.) It would take 1,155,000 shovels to clear the stadium bleachers and field.

In 2020, Lambeau Field needed 350 volunteers to shovel snow for $12 an hour, but that was a pretty light snow event. If the Bills needed volunteers, they'd better quadruple it to 1,400. But even if they did, each shoveler would be responsible for 825 shovelfulls, or 16,000-24,000 pounds of snow per person.
