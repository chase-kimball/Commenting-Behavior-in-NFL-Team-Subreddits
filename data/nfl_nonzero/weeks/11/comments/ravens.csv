He started 8 games for the team and played in 12 total games that year.

Here are some of his stats

* 147 completions out of 276 attempts for 53.3%

* 1,677 total passing yards 

* 139.8 passing yards per game

* 3 touchdowns to 13 interceptions 

* 13 fumbles 

* Sacked 46 times 

* Quarterback Rating of 55.8 that was boosted by garbage times production 

This is just a brief list that I was able to remember. 

If he actually played all 16 games, the numbers would have been even more horrifying. 

If he had a full career, he would have set records for fumbles and turnovers at the rate he was turning the ball over.

Justin Herbert. He's always passing late in the game and padding those passing yards because his defense is shit. Maybe if he was a better QB, the team would be confident in spending more offensive resources on defense.

There's a reason Lamar Jackson wins 75% of his games. The front office trusts that he can succeed with bottom 5 WRs so they use those saved resources to build a great defense.

31193,176329,176329,Yallmadugly,"Same, not only because he's on the Ravens but that the guy is clearly the most hated QB in the league and for no good reason. He's just a chill guy who takes gas station pics as his hobby lol. 

Now I know there's a lot of people who try to gaslight and say no one hates Lamar. Name one other QB in the NFL that after every incompletion, the reaction is a huge indictment on his future in the league? For every other QB, misreads and incompletions are just a natural part of the game. 

This really hit me in the Ravens vs Bengals game when Burrow was sailing passes left and right and I thought I was crazy that no one was saying anything about it except, ""poor throw there"" ""some mistakes from Burrow."" With Lamar it's, ""He has huge deficiencies as a passer to work on."" ""They kept him in the pocket there and he can't throw."" How exactly is that fair at all?

Another example is the Ravens most recent game. You would Lamar was missing wide open WRs the way people were talking. Lamar was 24/33 with 4 drops. If your QB has only 5 real incompletions in a game that's honestly a pretty good performance. (2 of which were throwaways, 1 was a pick, and another was a very difficult throw but slightly overthrown to Likely in the endzone) What's crazy is I can remember every one of those 5 plays clearly but I shouldn't. There's literally no reason for why in year 5 every Lamar pass has to picked apart under a microscope while every other top 10 QB gets the benefit of the doubt.",44.0,nfl,t3_z17rz3,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens :Cardinals: Cardinals,2022-11-21T13:54:38Z,ravens,0.0031364120749621
