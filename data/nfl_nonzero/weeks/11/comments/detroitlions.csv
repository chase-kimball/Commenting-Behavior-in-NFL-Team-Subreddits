We need to sit tight and see how the rest of the year plays out. I‚Äôm of the opinion that Swift isn‚Äôt fully healthy and is still limited on a week to week basis - we probably won‚Äôt see early season Swift until, well, early next season.

Swift is a walking highlight reel and adds an element to our offense that, frankly, no one else but Jameson can hope to match. The plan should be to sit tight, continue working with him, and hope that his body holds up moving forward. 

There‚Äôs no point in trading him 1) because his trade value is probably very little, and 2) whatever we‚Äôd potentially get back in a trade is not worth letting a talent like him walk out the door.

36549,218310,218310,Wiggymaster,"Oh, how silly, and absolutely arguable. 

This old man is about to send you to school. Sit down, shut up and open your eyes and your ears, cause you just might learn something.

Stafford's value was as a dynamic QB who could bail out McVay's poor on-field playcalling and lack of adjustment. At this point in his career he was comfortable ""making things happen"" when plays broke down, and Goff simply could not reliably do that at this point. When they asked him to, he froze like a deer in the headlights.

Goff did not cost the Rams that Super Bowl. It is absolutely laughable to suggest that. If you even watch the game, let alone study the film, you can see how pretty much every receiving option would be taken away. They'd have pass rushers drop into coverage on one play and had coverage guys rush the passer the next. With no run game after Gurley was hurt, the greatest defensive coach to ever do it had absolutely no problem handling a young QB and a young ""offensive genius"". He was armed and ready from the moment that game started.

The Rams' defense was absolutely heroic as well. Really, that game still could've gone either way. The Rams were one big offensive play away from turning that game around, but McVay simply could not adjust. Do you know how often they ran 11 personnel and CONTINUED to run 11 personnel even into last year? [Ninety fucking percent of the time](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/10/18177030/rams-sean-mcvay-jared-goff-todd-gurley-11-personnel). The Rams offensive approach has not involved some crazy complex wildly dynamic playbook with explosive adjustments to exploit the weaknesses of opponents - it's been the exact opposite. A simple, one-size-fits-all approach that worked against 70+% of the league *because of the athleticism of Rams backs and receivers*. 

The single most important factor to the Rams 2018 offensive success was not Sean McVay. It was not Jared Goff. It was not Kupp, Woods, Cooks, Reynolds or Hodge. It was Todd Jerome Gurley II. Without Gurley and his home run threat on every down he played, the Rams were a one dimensional wet noodle against teams that could play man coverage well as well as rush the passer, and nobody knew this better than Belichick. Gurley's knees were shot to hell well before that Super Bowl. Belichick also knew this. The result was completely expected for anyone paying attention.

Stafford was a quarterback who was used to playing in simplified schemes and trying to make stuff work, because as of 2020 he had just finished 7 seasons in Detroit without a competent running game. Remember the whole no-100-yard-back-since-Reggie-Bush-in-2013 thing? After 2018, the Rams simply no longer had the talent to run the football effectively, let alone as effectively as they had with Gurley at his peak. This was not Goff's fault, but McVay's response rather than to find ways to improve the run game was to divorce himself from his young quarterback in favor of a veteran who excelled at making otherwise one-dimensional offenses dynamic. 

Of course, we know it worked. But only just barely. The Rams also obtained Von Miller, putting their defense over the top. Nonetheless, they were a *dropped NFCCG interception away* from not even *making* the Super Bowl. They had what it took last year, but now we're seeing that with both Stafford's health on the decline and their receiving corps eviscerated, the Rams are as much a mess offensively as the Lions have ever been. I guarantee you that even were Stafford healthy they'd not be winning right now. They might be a few games better, but McVay has just been doing the same thing on offense for too long for NFL teams not to know how to deal with him. It certainly doesn't help that he's gone from having some of the most athletic players in the league to having just regular dudes.

Goff was not the problem. *McVay* was the problem, and Goff was the scapegoat. Stafford was able to bail him out for a year and keep the ship upright long enough to reach the harbor, but that ship had to set sail again and now everyone can see for themselves how badly its listing.",2.0,detroitlions,t3_z23x6d,False,0.0,90s logo,2022-11-23T11:20:36Z,detroitlions,-0.0152483709293643

I figured he had 2-3 good years left in him, period, and this year is definitely showing that this is far more likely than not at this point. The way things are going, I actually wouldn't be surprised if he retired at the end of this year. Being able to spin him into two first rounders, one of which is now looking to be a high draft pick, plus another quarterback, was an absolute dream come true. Out of Stafford, we wound up with Jameson Williams and Goff, who has been easily our second best quarterback in the entire time I've watched the Lions and is starting to show that he might be making a Stafford-esque 2nd-quarter-of-career step up. He's looking a bit more comfortable when plays break down and is actually making some throws on the run. Last year, I'd have called that unheard of, but just this past week we watched him scramble out of the pocket and make a big play. Being able to develop that is big, and if he can keep it up and continue to get better at it, he can be as efficient a passer as Brady. He's looking more cool and collected than he used to even in those situations, and that's a sign that he's maturing and continuing to develop. He could yet take a step backwards, but if he stays on this track, then there's no reason not to continue to keep him under center.

No. It doesn't even have anything to do with your ""point"", let alone prove it. My point all along was that the Rams 2018 offense was a product of Gurley's impact on opposing defenses *just by being out there*. If you take away a team's rushing threat, their pass game is going to suffer. Doesn't matter if your quarterback is Goff, Stafford, Brady, Rodgers or [Mahomes](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2930359-tom-brady-bucs-dominate-patrick-mahomes-chiefs-31-9-to-win-super-bowl-55) - when there's no rushing threat, pass rushers can just tee off on the quarterback while corners play man coverage and take away the options. We've seen numerous high-powered offenses beat this way due to injured running backs or significant injuries to the o-line that prevent running backs from having effective holes. 

I'm fairly certain Goff got plenty of heat for his turnovers. Hell, I remember Dan Campbell specifically saying that those who can't protect the ball *can't be a part of this team*, and it was specifically in reference to Goff. Yes, he's thrown interceptions. But let's compare him to his immediate predecessor - he's thrown one fewer than Stafford has this year, and Stafford's played fewer games. He's also thrown 7 more TDs than Stafford has so far this year. What exactly is the point that you were trying to make? 

That is absolute nonsense about Derek Carr. How are you going to suggest that a guy who's throw 2 fewer TDs and nearly a hundred fewer yards with ten more pass attempts and DAVANTE ADAMS on the team is having a better performance than Goff? And you're suggesting the Raiders' defense is worse than the Lions'!? Dude, we're *last in the league* in points allowed. Vegas is FOUR SPOTS ahead of us. 

This is the same mentality as the ""Stafford is the problem"" lunacy that plagued this place for so long. I can't understand why you'd be so willing to ship a guy out for an idea of what you want to see at quarterback when you don't even know what's available, or even if that idea had a chance to manifest. It's greedy and stupid, and it's what leads to long term quarterback purgatory. I've watched this team long enough to know that.

Goff is your quarterback for 2022. Accept it and move on and hope for his success. That's what *fans* do. If you're going to root for him to fail, then you're a fool, and you're not a fan of this team. The Lions may well be in a position to draft a great QB prospect next year. Or, they may have to roll with Goff on an extension because nothing else worthwhile is available. *That's how it goes*.

It's a completely stupid stance to take, because Detroit is far more likely to win a Super Bowl the way other Detroit teams have won championships - through building a blue-collar beater who just defies all the odds. Sure, there'll be a few stars, but our city has never been home to a Michael Jordan or a Lebron James or a Derek Jeter - we had guys like Brenden Shanahan and Ben Wallace and Kirk Gibson. Sure, we've had guys like Barry and Calvin and the like fall into our lap, but without that gritty, solid team of blue-collar grinders around them, they weren't able to take us over the hump.

Goff is exactly the type of guy who could be a part of a Detroit success story - that ragtag dude everyone writes off who grinds it out and winds up being a part of something special, not on his own, but as a *member* of it. The key is going to be getting some more pieces, balancing out the defense, and letting our rookies make their strides. Goff may not be the long term answer, either; if a better prospect becomes available, we should take him. But we shouldn't actively seek to unload the dude as though he's a problem or incapable of winning, because neither of these things are true.",1.0,detroitlions,t3_yy4w72,False,0.0,90s logo,2022-11-18T09:29:01Z,detroitlions,0.00403066495482
36611,218380,218380,Wiggymaster,"They didn't have an all-star cast in 2018 - they had a single all star and his name was **Todd Gurley**. The 2018 Rams team was less talented and not as balanced as the 2021 squad. Recall if you will that Cooper Kupp played only 8 games that year due to tearing his ACL. The Rams offensive struggles in the Super Bowl were actually fairly easily telegraphed in previous games against teams that had very good pass rushes combined with good man coverage secondaries (the loss to Chicago comes to mind). The threat of Todd Gurley is what made the team dynamic. They were anything but one dimensional. 2018 Goff could carve up most defenses, especially when they played soft zone coverage, but teams couldn't commit to man coverage because the threat of Gurley meant they had to keep the secondary ready to pounce on him should he get loose. It was a true one-two punch. 

If you look at what our offense was doing when it was healthy at the beginning of the season, it looks like the 2018 Rams. We were averaging over 30 points for the first three games of the season. We had deep threats, and Swift was a legitimate home run threat much like Gurley was (though to a lesser degree). Even still, it made Goff's play very efficient and he was able to carve up opposing defenses to the tune of 2-3 TDs per game.

I really don't understand the logic behind attacking Goff at this point. Guy has been lights out to be honest. If our defense was able to keep us in games - hell, if they were even able to get one more stop in a few of these games - we'd have 3 more wins and be flipped on the season. This team is still very young and rookies/young players are going to make key mistakes that screw things up. Trying to act as though Goff is holding this team back is doing a disservice because it is an outright lie at this point. Goff is who he is; he's a younger, more conservative version of Stafford with reasonably less arm strength. 

Truly, the offense has truly stunk it up only once this year, and that's when they got Belichick'd. Say what you will for the Patriots, but that man knows how to coach a secondary and gets the most out of his defenses.

What lmao

I wanted Goff to be the answer and he even looked like he might be early in the season. It is my opinion that he likely is not going to be the answer. Not because he's bad, but because he's not special when it comes to arm talent and is below average in athleticism. And of course, he's making 30 mil the next two years. So there's also an opportunity cost to keeping him if we can't sign as many FAs on the defensive side of the ball.

If Hutchinson doesn't have the awareness during that play, that ball is recovered by the offense. If he doesn't have the drive and motor that he plays with, he's not in that position and doesn't get the FR. I respectfully disagree- INTs are very similar because most of the time, you just have to be in the right place at the right time, for example that ball that both Okudah and Joseph went up for that Kerby ultimately got- If you're not a high motor, heads up player, it most likely won't happen for you.

Forcing the fumble is a huge part of it, don't get me wrong- but a turnover is a turnover, and its never a given that just because a ball is forced out, it is recoverable.

I highly recommend going back through all the old threads pre and post draft talking about Jameson as a prospect as well as our fleecing of the Vikings. 

Reminder, Vikings fans uncovered a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence that lead them to a trade chart on top of Mount Everest that says they win the trade by a couple points. 

They won a gold medal in mental gymnastics by arguing that Cine, Booth, and Ingram were a better value than Jameson, Hamilton, or Davis - the latter of which would have been day one contributors for them. Cine couldn‚Äôt even crack the backup safety spot and was buried on the depth chart before his brutal and unfortunate injury. Booth has also unfortunately been battling with injuries but looks lost (to be fair to him though rookie CBs struggle a lot so still time for him). And Ingram is the worst graded pass blocker in the league. Kwesi‚Äôs process backfired so hard. The supposed value they gained was more shots at similarly graded prospects, however it just seems far more likely that Kwesi got scared, didn‚Äôt know who to pick and sprinted away from some top tier talent or came into the draft knowing he wanted to trade back because Malcom Gladwell said it‚Äôs the best move. He forced it to happen. He traded back twice in the second round then was forced to trade up to get booth.

Now it‚Äôs looking like Jameson may just make his debut against them. That would be so poetic. I hope he blows past Booth and catches the longest of bombs ever for a TD.",37.0,detroitlions,t3_z26g6t,False,0.0,MC‚ö°DC,2022-11-22T16:09:53Z,detroitlions,0.0315760967963639
