A lot of the mistakes on defense came down to coverage mistakes, losing men etc. Lots of roster building issues that go well beyond the lack of high draft picks. Morris doesnt trust our secondary to make plays, thus plays a conservative defense..and guess what..they cant make the plays even when called upon. I feel like its a uneven cocktail of coaching and personel cause our safety group ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it‚Äù as they say. Throughout the sneed/mcvay tenure the team has called upon the secondary to play ‚Äúabove their means‚Äù .. what i mean by that is that we dont invest financially in the group.

9667,105070,105070,PrettyassDolphin," Hard pill to swallow but as I watch more and more, our secondary is just not good. Ramsey is good but gets caught checking out way too often to comfortably call him a shutdown corner (though he rarely gets the opportunity nowadays). Every other DB looks average at best on a good day. 

Rapp is slow as hell and can't cover anybody. Scott is decent but inconsistent as a tackler. Hill is very up and down. Kendrick and Long are both awful. Where tf did Jordan Fuller go? (is he injured? I legitimately don't know). Durant looked good week 2 but essentially hasn't played since. Rochell is buried on the depth chart...

As frustrating as it is to watch the slow-bleed of giving the team easy completions over and over, I think Morris knows that if we did play more man, every DB not named Jalen Ramsey would be getting torched left and right. 

That leaves our options (due to bad off.) as either let the other team be on offense all game and lose by 4-10 points or play press and lose by 30 lol.",35.0,losangelesrams,t3_z1filw,False,0.0,St. Louis Rams,2022-11-21T19:10:23Z,losangelesrams,-0.0237002385063266

There‚Äôs also the choice of releasing Van Jefferson which would save us $1.3m, but that depends on A. What we do at the receiver position and B. How he plays the rest of this season without Coop.
