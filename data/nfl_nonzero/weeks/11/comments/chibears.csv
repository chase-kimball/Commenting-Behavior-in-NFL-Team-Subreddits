-this exact thing happened in 2017 with the bears drafting Trubisky over Watson. Watson had knee injury concerns, Justin had epilepsy concerns (not as much concern as Watson’s knee)
-jets wanted the shiny object not the proven starter. Zach Wilson looks great in shorts against air. 
-Zach had some highlight reel plays in college and his arm talent looked like Mahomes he also had an amazing OLine that protected him against the poor talent they played against. 


In 2021, I had a feeling that Wilson would be a bust like Trubisky. I also saw some red flags in maturity. Seemed arrogant and he wasn’t a captain on the team. To me if you aren’t the captain on your college team as the QB they how are you supposed to lead grown men getting paid millions. I did think Justin had the intangibles like leadership and work ethic. He showed the leadership in bringing the Big 10 back during Covid. He came into OSU as a transfer and immediately won the locker room over. His toughness showed in the playoff game against Clemson. He just looked more like the proven prospect. I am not going to lie. I gave up on the bears after 2021 when they signed Dalton and kept Nagy/pace. When they drafted Fields, I haven’t been that hopeful for a bears player in a long time. I never felt like Trubisky was going to be the guy. In 2017, I wanted Watson. Mahomes and Trubisky were unproven.
