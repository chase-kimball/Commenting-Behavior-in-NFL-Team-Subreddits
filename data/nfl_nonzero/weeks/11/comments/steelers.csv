What? The way were measured is unbalanced? Every team is measured the same way. So we aren’t last?

>you can’t compare us to a team that throws medium

You absolutely can. Last year, Ben had one of the quickest snap to throw times across the entire NFL, yet our run blocking was dead last and pass blocking was in the high 20s (29?). We still gave up sacks, hits and pressures. The line improved from last year to this year in both areas. Also, your blocking scheme may just work this way. Look at how the dolphins played us. Quick throws short, screens, etc… get the ball out quick and keep Tua upright.

KP has 30 rush attempts for 163 yards and 3 TDs.

- He stands in and takes hits to make throws

- commands the offense well, can run the huddle, seems like a leader 

- Can throw pretty rainbow balls when allowed to do so, like the Pickens drop, the Diontae pass last week, etc… he wasn’t doing it early and now it seems like a weekly thing which is how it should be

- Can make plays with his legs, both maneuvering around the pocket/behind the LOS and running downfield

- Hasn’t turned the ball over since the bye week, which I’m sure was a big emphasis in self evaluation considering his numbers

- Has started stepping up and keeping his eyes downfield to extend plays and make throws, as opposed to tucking and running, or running around in the backfield like you’d see him do on tape week 4/5 (although still does it to some degree, which may be an OL thing)

I’m not saying he’s Tom Brady, but it’s not a head scratcher pick. This entire team stinks right now. He’s shown good, and will continue to do so. Allen looked inaccurate and shit in his rookie season. Didn’t even look all that great in his second year. Then he turned it around and became an MVP candidate QB. It takes time and work.

- 3rd and long what feels like all game. Tough spot to put the rookie and this offense in. The trend here is the 2nd and 10 runs, putting us well behind the sticks to concert third; makes things tough.

- Missed tackles. Not only limited to mick up there but the team seemed to struggle, especially in the first half. Can’t allow YAC, gotta get these offenses off the field as soon as we can 

- Secondary. Higgins was the star of the game. Just absolutely did not have an answer. Almost feels like we needed to move Sutton inside and Pierre outside but we hate Pierre for some reason.

- George. Bengals really had no answer for 14. Looks like Kenny missed him a few times but he was pretty open from the tv view. Was burning everybody

- Najee. Again, not the sexiest stat line but he’s running north and less dancing which was hurting him. And his damn air Najee jump for that well deserved 6

31601,219574,219574,Zane_Flynt_boyo,"my review of Scarlet/Violet after beating most content:

Very, very, very good game blighted by technical issues and bugs. Struggles to get 30 FPS, weird lighting glitches, bad textures, what have you. The game is rushed.

However, it is seriously one of the best pokemon games from a gameplay perspective. The move to fully open worlds with the map opening up ease of access with progression is just incredible. Everywhere you look is a point of interest rewarding your curiosity, a TM here, a unlockable that can be used to get more pokemon, areas where new pokemon spawn, tera raids for completely random pokemon to spawn with good stats. Your willingness to explore is rewarded and your mind becomes more curious and this game always seems to reward your curiosity - even if it allows you to get side tracked. Whereas PLA was an open zone, SV is an open world and is better as a result. 

There also seems to be a deemphasis on battling, which youd think would be an issue, but it clearly isnt. You gain EXP naturally through wild battles and you can find trainers to battle as well, the amount was fixed in past games and that led slogs of battles in the late game, you wouldnt be faulted for skipping as much as you could. In this game, the only mandatory battles are things like rivals or leaders and such. You can battle wild mons and receive enough of a boost to be comfortable. Want more new ways to gain levels? Try a tera raid and get flat EXP candies. Heck, you can even just explore and find candies naturally including rare candies. 

Minor issues I have with the game: the level zones are bot clearly defined, that is the issue with pokemon in an open world, and you can easily wander into a place that is not scaled to you. To me, I like that I have no no zones or places I should be careful in, Sword and Shield showed if there was no danger in these no no zones, exploring higher level areas is lame. you can catch those wildly overleveled mons, but you cant use them until you have a badge that makes them listen. Mons over-leveled past your badge level will still listen to you, badge level only cares about what level they were caught at.

Another point about this, Gym leader and Major Points of Interest order is not clearly laid out. A guide is helpful to this end, but spoils the pleasant experience of a surprise challenge. Additionally, the perceived correct order is all over the place, without spoiling, two badges next to each other are, in fact, not supposed to be fought consecutively. I fought the final gym 5th by accident. The only POI where the order is clearly mandated is the Star Camp Raids, I wish the gyms and titans were as well. 

I rushed towards completing the Titans first, and that meant I quickly expanded my ability to traverse the map and meant I was able to explore as much as I could. This probably informs my opinions laid out before, but it was probably the best for my enjoyment. 

But if the game doesnt receive a performance patch in the next three months, go ham in criticizing the game for its technical issues, just keep in mind it is a wonderful game.",9.0,nfl,t3_z1vq4l,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers :Panthers: Panthers,2022-11-22T09:36:40Z,steelers,0.0168818803484085

41890,295721,295721,mitchmatch26,"Teams don’t just make adjustments at half. It happens all throughout the game. And JC Hassenauer was in at C for the 2nd half and suddenly the bengals D gets a bunch of pressure. That’s not a “we didn’t adjust” issue. Injuries happen, some can hurt you more than others. 

I just don’t think it’s fair to say “well LBs get burned in coverage” as the only reason we lose, as if we’re the only team sticking guys in coverage. Or that we don’t make “halftime adjustments” when it happens throughout the game *by both teams* and we’ve seen parts of the offense that sucked before improve, like the run game this year and the OL steadily improving from how abysmal week one was. 

We have a tendency to overstate the bad and understate the good. It’s not just an anecdote, negative memory is more vivid than positive. It’s just human nature. 

I won’t deny the offense has been super stale and lame under Canada and Randy. Even Todd Haley held back the killer bs with his playcalling at times. But you say that we were so talented at times that it doesn’t matter about coaching, good or bad. Which is patently false. Good, talented teams can *absolutely* be tanked by bad coaching and I’d say that happens more than them *hiding* bad coaches. 

Sure every so often mediocre coaches like Pedersen, Jeff Fischer, Ron Rivera, Rex Ryan put together a 13-3 season with a conference championship appearance. But those are way less frequent than a good coach uplifting a team. We haven’t been so talented since 2017 ish that talent would cover for bad coaching, yet we keep winning close games. Coaching has covered for an offense that declined in proportion to its QBs abilities, seeing as even when Ben threw for 5k in ‘18 we were a middle of the road offense by efficiency. 

Putting your hope into a defense that has had a couple years in the top 10 and expecting that to lead us to a SB is crazy when you look at the successes in the modern NFL. A top 10 defense doesn’t get you there every year. An elite QB or an *all time* defense gets you there. We don’t have elite QB play and arguably haven’t since 2017. This defense is just a good one, not an all time one. 

And again, I can’t emphasize this enough. Nobody is happy, nobody is satisfied, nor hanging their hats on positive records. I don’t care what our regular season record is if we win the Super Bowl. The point is just that, while we have been disappointed of late, we still get to enjoy watching a good team each week more often than most fanbases have. 

I’d rather win 2 super bowls in 20 years AND be .700 in that span versus 2 SB wins and .350 in that same span. 100/100 times.

41893,295724,295724,mitchmatch26,"I think any fan would agree with you. Nobody is happy with the playoff success. We all want this team to win. But you speak very broadly in your post about “The same mistakes.” “The same types of losses.” Which is shit to me and takes the nuance out of the equation. 

They defense being Swiss cheese in the killer Bs years is not the same as having the highs and lows of a rookie QB now. Tomlins teams are also never really bad in the penalties department, never ranking lower than 20th in penalties/game. Nothing to write home about but we’re not really in the “bad penalties frequently cost us games” department. 

If you think this team doesn’t make adjustments game to game, I don’t know what to tell you. Because we’re watching different games. Also teams can make an adjustment that simply *doesnt work*. Because the opponent also makes a good tweak. 

Nobody is *happy* with the postseason success when we push back on the frequented “3 wins since ‘11” argument. It’s just that we’re constantly in a good position wins wise which is the first and most important step to having postseason success. 

We’re not some tortured fan base. We see a team win year in and year out. Would you rather be a Bucs fan who’s seen as many SB wins since 2000 as us? Or wake up enjoying your Sundays more often than not? That’s where the spoiled part comes from. Because we see a frequently successful regular season team, some fans are no longer satisfied with winning championships at a great frequency. 

If you were born in 1990 you’ve seen the Steelers play in 4 Super Bowls. That’s tied for 2nd most only behind the patriots…which lets just call them an outlier at 10 appearances. We’ve seen great success and that is 4 Super Bowl VISITS in 32 years.

45655,332176,332176,terrybradshawsballs,"From ESPN:  Jackson got off to a hot start, and he had a very efficient performance in a win over the Buccaneers in Week 8, but he has otherwise been struggling for about two months. Since Week 4, Jackson's 49.3 QBR ranks 19th in the league. Leaving rushes out of the equation, his 36.8 QBR over that time frame is 26th out of 30 qualifying passers. Only Mills, Zach Wilson, Justin Fields and Russell Wilson have been worse in that regard.

For an offense that can be so explosive on the ground, the Ravens have not been able to create those same big plays through the passing game. Jackson is averaging 6.1 yards per attempt over that time frame, ahead of only Kenny Pickett and Mac Jones. Jackson's off-target rate (17.1%) is much higher than league average, and his 10.5 QBR on deep passes (20-plus air yards) ranks 29th in the NFL, with just Kyler Murray behind him.

49256,347795,347795,volvanator,I'm so sick of this take. The hit on Najee wasn't a foul. He had just broken a 50 yard run and got hit high at the end of it. Running backs never get calls for helmet-to-helmet because they're not defenseless. Olave was in mid-air and completely defenseless when he got hit.
