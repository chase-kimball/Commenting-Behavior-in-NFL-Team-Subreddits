22772,177077,177077,bingmyname,"1. The point is to make a projection about how much a guy can realized come in and reasonably raise the floor of your offense. That's specifically why it should be a first round talent because guys like JSN and Addison are far more likely to translate quicker and give your QB more weapons to work with. No they won't be perfect and may not light things up but they'll more than likely raise the floor. Just having that talent will be a big plus for your offense and thereby your QB.  
 
2. No one said you don't get any pieces on defense. You're going to have to opt to pass on the highest round picks but that doesn't mean you can't still get guys who will start. Siaks Ika is a perfect example. Lots of mocks have him going in the 2nd and the Texans pick at the top. He's a run stuffing DT so it's not to say you'll abandon defense altogether but it's more like I'd rather take my time building up defense than to take my time building up the last necessary pieces on offense to at least build a competent offense.  
 
Ultimately the floor is likely going to be a lot higher if you have Young throwing to Addison/JSN, Metchie and Collins rather than just a later round pick and Metchie and Collins. There's only really 2-3 game changing receivers in this draft right now and they'll be gone in the first.

22773,177078,177078,bingmyname,"1.  There isn't a single offense right now that's having success without a reliable target #1. Metchie just isn't likely that guy. If you take a QB your job immediately becomes to make his job easy as possible.  
 
2. You can still get pieces for the front 7 and build up over the years. We aren't expecting to be a SB contender just from taking a QB so losing games because of bad run defense isn't the end of the world. Not getting your QB enough to support development is a much bigger problem. Taking shortcuts by gambling current receivers who haven't shown enough will somehow be enough is how we got ourselves in this position in the first place.  
 
3. Having a high powered offense means opposing teams can't always just run the ball down your throat. Eventually they'll have to play catch-up.

Mills- people think he's regressed but these are the people also saying he's not going through his progressions (not true). I would say at the start of the year it looked like he regressed but then he picked it back up around the jags game. However the real problem with Mills is that he can't yet play through the situation around him. Too many pressures, not enough weapons and inconsistent play calling all a factor he has to overcome and he just hasn't yet. There's opportunities for him to make difficult throws and he's not doing it enough. However he looks really good in the few snaps where he doesn't have interior pressure but he still needs to work on being a better thrower. Missing a lot of consistency in his throwing and his ball placement is not ideal some games. He's a great decision maker which is why I think it's foolish to give up on him just yet but he needs to stop forcing late game heroics. Leadership also coming into question with his OL seemingly not liking him even though it's partly their fault he's struggling. People also don't seem to understand he's not a scrambler. He's athletic enough to make a guy miss and get the ball out when he has to but he's not really meant to extend plays like a Mahomes. His processing potential makes up for this though and we see that when the IOL actually holds together. Sorry for the long explanation but it's complicated unlike how some will admit. The rest are kind of backup guys that will make decent depth.",2.0,texans,t3_yzimtj,False,0.0,:H-Town-Cal:,2022-11-19T17:41:53Z,texans,0.0010341900540863

his 17 game pace for the last 5 games he played last year

Mills stats for a 17 game pace:

* 68.4% Completion
* 4277 Yards
* 31 TDs
* 7 INTs
* 31 sacks

At this point its obvious we shouldnt have let go of tim kelly who was clearly calling a gameplan that fit mills strengths and allowed him to develop. Our offensive gameplan is dogshit this year. Mills has shown he can make all the throws and would have EASILY been a 1st round pick this year had he stayed in college another year.

At this point it's an inexperienced QB going through growing pains, giving him a 3rd year to see what he can do hopefully with Metchie coming back and the addition of another weapon will be huge.

People just wanna see mills fail so bad because he wasn't a first round pick. I'm not saying to commit to the guy long term but it is definitely too early to just give up on him and the only reason people are even considering it is the 3rd round draft capital used to get him.


Coaching staff has more to do with QB development/performance than any other factor. Look at Geno with the seahawks, look at daniel jones with daboll, look at Josh Allen, look at Lamar Jackson. Look at Tua's first two years which are arguably worse than what Mills has shown his first two years.

Mills has been better than Trey Lance and Zach Wilson who were taken 2nd and 3rd overall. I get this year is a step back from what we wanted to see but holy shit so many people had already given up on him before the season.

Again I'm not saying we commit to him long term but for his lack of experience I think it's unwise to not give him at least the beginning of next season to figure out what he can do.
