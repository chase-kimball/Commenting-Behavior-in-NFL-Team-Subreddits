Colts are another good example - they've given almost every playoff team fits - but they're 4-6-1. Beat us, almost beat the Eagles, close against the Titans/Commanders.

Look, I can't speak for bad realtors. 

But a good realtor will pull comparative sales and tell you exactly what your home is worth at that moment. But yes, real estate is an investible asset that may gain or lose value. 

Realtors do not magically sell their own homes for more than they sell yours. That doesn't make sense and is counter to how they make money. 

Any realtor promising a refinance will be possible later is not a good realtor. 

But the higher interest rates of today has softened demand. It is easier to get a contract accepted today than this time last year, and for cheaper. Which helps counter balance the higher rate. And with rates being somewhat artificially by the fed specifically to combat inflation, it's perfectly reasonable to believe it is likely that rates will drop. In fact, the last inflation report showed inflation slowing, and rates dropped from the mid 7% range to the mid 6% range immediately. 

And that 4% is worth of every penny of ensuring proper list price, ensuring all contracts are written properly to protect you, that inspection negotiations are handled properly, professional marketing of your property, etc.

If you try to argue pass catching, it’s clear to me that no TE has ever been as consistently great for as long as Travis has. And stats are easily found to back that statement up.
