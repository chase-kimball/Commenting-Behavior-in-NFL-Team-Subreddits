Campbell was released from the Cardinals because they got a replacement for him in the draft. He started every game for them and was a tackle machine, but they had more LB depth than they knew what to do with, so Campbell got cut. Plus I believe they needed to make space after signing Watt.

Hollins started 6 games this season and has sucked in all of them. The Rams sub was relieved to see him let go. I'm not too optimistic he'll have a Campbell-esque resurgence.
