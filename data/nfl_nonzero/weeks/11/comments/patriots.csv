People will point to Brady as an obvious factor in Bill's successful career, but Brady only plays one out of three phases in the game. The Patriots have consistently had top 10 defenses for 20+ years and always have elite special teams (Vinatieri, Gostkowski, now Folk, Slater, etc). Hell, the Rams superbowl was entirely a Belichick coaching masterclass. And those early 2000's teams were built on a seriously elite defensive unit and amazing kicking.

Brady went off and won a Super Bowl with a loaded team that was a QB away. Evans, Godwin, AB, Gronk, Fournette - 3 HOF players and 2 perennial pro-bowl level guys. But just two years removed the Bucs are showing a lot of cracks in the foundation, the coaching /playcalling is poor, and they're a middle of the road team.
