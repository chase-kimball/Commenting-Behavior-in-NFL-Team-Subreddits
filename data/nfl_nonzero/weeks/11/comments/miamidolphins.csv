Because MIA-SF is on Fox, it might be part of a cross-flex transaction with CBS, because AFC road games are normally on CBS. If CBS airs an NFC road game, then I think Fox gets an AFC road game to even it out.

Stuff like this happens, like when CBS aired LAR-TB, DET-DAL, and SF-CAR earlier this season, even though all those teams were in the NFC. And Fox aired KC-SF, NYJ-GB, and TEN-IND this season as well.

If IND-DAL got flexed out of Sunday night, it would go to CBS, which I think might cause a problem because now Fox isn't getting their AFC road game they are owed.

I think we're seeing a similar mid-season philosophy change with the Chubb trade. With all of our DB injuries the old ""play man with elite CBs and blitz everyone else"" isn't cutting it because we're down to an undrafted rookie and special teamers in coverage. 

So they switched to more zone coverage with four man rushes...but our rushes weren't getting home. Thus: trade for Chubb.
