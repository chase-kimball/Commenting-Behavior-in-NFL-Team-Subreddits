- The team that took the field in the second half looked like a completely different team.

- Offense was grooving that second half. Scores on the first 3 possessions. Utilized all of our weapons.

- Can't spell ""I love you Chris Olave"" without OROY.

- OL was about as good as you could expect with the entire left side being backups. 

- Cesar Ruiz for All-Pro. Aaron Donald is scared of him.

- Ever since the Rams collapsed in week 18 last year they can't hold onto their half time leads oh no

- Rams still trying to score at the end of the game with a bunch of backups in what a bunch of tryhards

- This offense will live and die with how the Taysom package is used and evolved the rest of the season.

- Defense sorely missed Cam. And also Davenport. But mostly Cam.

- No turnovers. Minimal penalties. Disciplined football is good football.

- Special teams is the best it's looked all year. Lutz nailing kicks. Gillikin back to punting like a pro. Return team getting big plays. They need to run midplay gimmicks to outdo our coverage unit.

- I just want Cam, Lattimore, Peat, McCoy, Werner (and CGM) back asap :'(

- Much better from the coaching staff this week. Team looked prepared and came out at halftime firing on all fronts. **We need to be putting this together in back to back weeks though.**

- God those uniforms are sexy as fuck.

- We're going 10-7 and winning the division.

-  A lot more offense in this one than I expected if I'm being honest.

- This offense is operating about as best as you can hope for having a below average QB and 3 backups on the OL.

- I think play calling is improved this week. The Taysom package continuing to evolve is important for the sustainability of Taysom in the offense. Dalton and Winston couldn't be more complete opposites on how they use check downs.

- Ruiz has gotten the better of Donald so far. I am once again asking that he be recognized this awards szn.

- The defense was playing pretty good overall. Then that last drive the pass rush just kept getting stonewalled and made it way too easy.

- The little things like setting the edge or fasting pass rush wins are what we are missing without Cam and Davenport.

- We are the least healthy team in the league according to that FOX stat. So naturally we've lost another DE.

- I'm a big fan of limiting penalties and not turning the ball over. I'm not a big fan of another half of 0 takeways.
