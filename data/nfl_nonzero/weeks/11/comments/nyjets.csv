It's so tough because the coaches are doing everything they can to protect him from himself, but with Zach, it's SUCH a fine line between ""don't fuck up"" and ""throw the fucking ball to the open receiver."" It's so damn frustrating to watch him play. 

If he was throwing 30-40 yard bombs that were falling incomplete or heck - even getting picked off, we'd be like ""ah damn, nice try down field"" but the dude cannot hit receivers behind the line of scrimmage 8 yards away from him and throwing balls directly into the defense's chest. It's truly mind boggling how terrible he is.

And I absolutely think you're right. He's so mentally in his own head that he can't make the gimme throws to start the momentum and get the offense and himself going.

And on top of ALL of this piss poor QB play, he refuses to accept responsibility and take accountability. The few fans and supporters he had going into this week have dissipated after his post game conference. He no longer has the full support of his teammates, coaches, or fans. It's going to take A LOT for him to turn this shit around. 

And going 18/30 with 1 TD and 14 rush yards against Chicago isn't gonna do it. He needs to beat this subpar Chicago defense down to a pulp to prove he can potentially be the guy and can turn things around.

11193,84056,84056,Kwall267,"Not seeing the daily thread for today so I‚Äôll post this here. Here are the top unrestricted Free Agent QBs in 2023 who currently do not have a contract (this is in no particular order): 

Tom Brady (lol), Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold (lol), Jimmy Garopollo, Teddy Bridgewater, Daniel Jones, Case Keenum, Jacoby Brisset, Geno Smith (lol), Andy Dalton, Joe Flacco, Mike White, Taylor Heinicke, Lamar Jackson, Drew Lock, Cooper Rush, Gardner Minshew. 

I think we resign Mike White if he‚Äôs half competent this week as our back up. I don‚Äôt think Lamar or Danny sniff free agency. Tom would rather retire then play for us. Geno and Sam would never come back and Bridgewater probably wouldn‚Äôt either. Baker, Keenum, Brisset, Rush, Minshew are high quality back ups that aren‚Äôt any better than White. Dalton and Flacco are washed and have ‚ÄúIndianapolis Colts‚Äù written all over the their tired faces. That just leaves Jimmy G.

This roster is solid and we shouldn‚Äôt have too much roster turn over next year. If anything we will be in a better position since our high quality rookies will have a full NFL season under their belts. 

Best Case: Zach gets his shit together, apologizes to the defense privately and makes an adult statement to the media. Goes out and plays consistent football at or around how he was in the 4th quarter in Pittsburgh. We sneak into the playoffs and we all feel good about the season. Then we bring in a quality back up this off season. Case Keenum, Andy Dalton, Teddy Bridgewater, Jacoby Brissett, Taylor Heineke, Cooper Rush, and Gardner Minshew are all unrestricted free agent QBs next year who have real game experience and can be some competition for Zach this off season 

Worst Case: Zach sucks and we know that definitely and we miss the playoffs. But, we can improve our draft position. We then make some moves to bring in a better QB this off-season. Jimmy Garappolo, Daniel Jones, and Lamar Jackson are also unrestricted free agents next year who don‚Äôt have a deal as of this moment. In this scenario we have everything to be true contenders. 

The only thing that can truly make this situation worse is if the locker room implodes. Right now I really think the only thing keeping us together is Saleh. If he can keep the players sharp and the captains continue to speak his good word to the locker room we can weather this storm.

I haven't argued he shouldn't throw to Moore, once he makes the wrong read on the progression he has to throw to Moore because he can't make up the throw to Carter- that throw was timing dependent. And while you're right, they are multiple assumptions, i'm saying it because i've watched other QBs and very similar plays. This is Brady's bread and butter on game winning drives. It works because defenses are more scared of giving up a big play than a short one in these situations. It only doesn't work here because Zach leads them to this play. It's not even a special play, it's very normal around the NFL. This is like a Garappolo or Alex Smith play. Very low threshold to clear. Not clearing it is very bad. He should've thrown to Moore once he has made the wrong play, but throwing to Moore only fixes the problem he had in the 4th Quarter with 0:32 seconds left against the Patriots in a tie game, and he has far bigger errors that reverberate a lot more through his games when he misses the pre-snap read.

*He could've still hit Moore even if he made the other progression, if he noticed the corners not taking the bait and staying disciplined. But he never read their position because he was always going to go to Carter (as he is supposed to) since he started from a left->right progression.

It's not fair/correct to assume things would happen the same way if Zach starts from Mims->Garrett (i think thats Garrett?) -> Carter to read the vertical stretch instead of Left-Right.

And i think you might be misremembering it- now i didn't watch the game but from the screenshots i had a good feeling of what was probably happening in this play and to me the play itself confirms it. Here it is in full:

https://imgur.com/V83e3UL

So yes, he throws to Carter and it didn't make it. But look at his process of getting to Carter. He starts on the opposite side of the field, slowly crosses his way over to the middle, and then to the side of Carter. By doing that, he's leading the zone defenders to Carter. This is not by design, Zach is given this play and he can choose his progression here based off what he's reading on the defense. And the likely optimal progression as is obvious from the pre-snap when the linebacker drops out, would be to watch Mims as he goes up the seam from the slot because now he's 1v1 with a linebacker in zone coverage who will be pedaling to catch him (potential big play if the throw looks good) and thereby keeping the safety along with the nickel back who is staring at Wilsons eyes the entire time driving backwards as well. Instead, because Wilson takes his time crossing the field, the nickel back sits in his pre-determined zone, watches Zach, and begins moving towards Carter even before he makes the throw there. He can just tell that Zach is heading there. Zach's eyes had to hold that nickel and the outside corner behind him and force him to follow the seam or even dip backwards towards the slant from the outside WR. That would create the space for Carter to catch, get a first down, and then get out of bounds.

He makes a bad call on his progression, decides to read left-to-right in a situation where the play is very obvious, but ends up at the decision he knows he has to get to but does so late. And by reading it left to right, both of those corners are able to sit in their zone instead of following his eyes deeper down the field. He knew he had to throw to Carter, which is why he gets back there when he overlooked Moore. But he did the entire process badly. It's a long hesitation to throw to Carter, and it's also the wrong progression to use here.

*and to add why i'm so focused on this- if he made the play to Moore that would save this otherwise bad play.

On the pre-snap (the first image) you can see pretty clearly that Carter is the best option, because the safety is so far away from him and they have a numbers advantage of 3 blockers on 3 defenders with only that deep safety on carter. Knowing that, if you really wanted to win this- you put your eyes on Mims as he goes up the seam to keep the safety back and then fire to Carter. There just isn't a reason to decide on Moore unless you are desperate, which Zach shouldn't have been because the play is obvious before the snap goes off.",1.0,nyjets,t3_z1020c,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-11-21T11:05:37Z,nyjets,0.0386255999999999

Moore is your desperation throw if pressure hits your face. Zach's supposed to make 1 read on the deep end to potentially flip the field if they overplay their hand, and then switch to carter right away. That's what Brady does on all of his game winning drives. Even taking Moore, this would be a bad play, because the right play was always obvious even on the pre-snap when Carter moved into the area behind the WRs. He basically has three throws on this play- one deep if someone misplays the vertical defense. One to carter if the deep is covered.

With no timeouts, they'd have to do that entirely at the sideline. This isn't a defense of Zach, but this is not an uncommon way to play it. Brady takes the RB every single time in this situation.

14235,99834,99834,NannigarCire,"I personally don't take these types of catastrophic games in any heavier weight than necessary, it's all just one game as part of a bigger picture. Geno famously had 3 INTs in 8 passes and then put up a perfect passer game, and now in this year- none of that matters. So i've just learned there's good reason to avoid over-weighing individual moments.

Anyway, about Zach- watching him from the start of his Jets tenure the one issue i've constantly found annoying about his play is that he never seems to be in time with his receivers. A lot of people seem to think he can't read defenses, or can't go through progressions- i don't know if this is true when i've watched him. He has two problems of a sort of wacky accuracy, and then being off time with his receivers. And personally i would guess, his accuracy problem comes from being out of time with other receivers. As he starts rushing himself to get in time, he then rushes his throws. I'd say it's less likely he can't read defenses..and maybe more likely he doesn't know his own playbook/receivers really well. I don't think it has to be both, but he might just have no chemistry with his surrounding players. I think it's obvious he has very significant issues as a QB because of this, and the Jets need to explore some other options after this year. I wouldn't pull the plug on him, but i would feel strongly inclined to change something.

I'm very critical of MLF on top of this- i think Zach has been given a bit of a bad offense to work with that doesn't fit him at all. Zach is not a timing passer. He wasn't known for that in college either. He's kind of a ""big time passer""- and this isn't really an offense designed for him at all. And i'm gonna say again, he seems like he can read defenses- if he couldn't his INT numbers would be much much higher. I don't see him throwing into double and triple coverage constantly, he isn't making boneheaded throwing decisions. His INT's or even interceptable plays, seem more like bad inaccurate passes than just total misreads. You don't see a linebacker undercut his throw very often as far as i can tell, or a roaming safety snatch one out of nowhere. And i personally just don't get why they drafted him if this is what they were going to do with him. Who watched Zach Wilson in college and thought, he would make sense in an offense with a lot of timing, horizontal, short, screen passing?

Anyway (2), i don't know if this is fixable or not, that's not really up to me. Nothing is unfixable, the popular opinion in this sub on prior jets QBs thought Mark got screwed and Geno was an unfixable moron- and got both of those completely incorrect. I think if Zach wanted to fix this, it's fixable- but that's just outside of our control. This is a disaster season for Zach and one that might sink his career as even with the potential that MLF is misusing him- to be surrounded by this much talent and not be able to provide a consistent floor of QB play is pretty awful.",9.0,nyjets,t3_z0yfrm,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-11-21T09:51:57Z,nyjets,0.0029374960798967

14238,99837,99837,NannigarCire,"I‚Äôm trying to imagine why Zach didn‚Äôt take Moore here and my best guess is because the time on the clock was low, he didn‚Äôt want to waste the time out on a short over the middle gain and be left with none while having to keep moving at least 20-30 more yards. In most other situations, this is a pretty automatic read- and that‚Äôs also why the linebackers give up this throw. Moore‚Äôs supposed to be your last chance- but what I don‚Äôt get is why he doesn‚Äôt throw to the running back on the side. Honestly that‚Äôs the throw that probably nets 7-10 yards and stops the clock.

*didn‚Äôt watch the game so I didn‚Äôt know he did throw it to the RB, in which case the problem is that he didn‚Äôt make that decision before the snap.

* If Wilson is closer to being benched that people think, if he can't beat a not great Chicago defense, missing Justin Fields, they have all the due cause in the world to bench him in favor of someone else the following week. Especially to try and salvage the season.

There is a very high chance Wilson is starting and anyone thinking that an NFL coaching staff is going to risk their jobs without doing their professional dilligence is fooling themselves.

I just don't understand why Slants, Jet sweeps and 50/50 balls on man coverage are so out of the realm of our offense.

Too many fans got ""NY Media'd"" and they don't want to admit it.

Did Wilson suck ass on Sunday? Was it bad enough to finally legitimately start a ""maybe this is not our QB of the future"" conversation?  Absolutely. However, people took a bad answer to absolutely go all in on bashing the guy on a personal level and it wasn't called for. 

Anyone who watched the full press conference could see Wilson was upset and annoyed at the loss and the series of questions leading up to the ""gotcha"" one were pretty bad. When they weren't trying to get him to get him throw the team or teammates under the bus, they were trying to make it sound like this loss was the end of the world and the season. Towards the end of it, it didn't even look like Wilson wanted to answer any more of them because he wanted to look ahead to the next game.

The media is always fishing for a ""dysfunctional Jets"" story and everyone is biting down hard on it like they wanted. At the end of the day it doesn't matter what any of the players say, it's wins and performance that matter.

If Wilson continues to suck, the team will move on from him. It's that simple. The rest of the ""accidental tweets"" and magical ""Fields led a group prayer and singing of kumbya in the lockerroom"" stories that are miraculously coming out now are all part of a crafted narrative. People's shouldn't fall for the bullshit.

In fairness to Wilson, that despite the soundbyte and quote that is getting play, here are some of the other questions and answers that were asked during his press conference (paraphrasing reporter question when not entirely clear):

> **When the defense is playing as well as it is, how frustrating was it to not get anything going?**
>       
> Wilson: ""Yea, it's super frustrating, it was a frustrating day of course, I felt like I had some balls that got away from me, but you know we gotta find ways on offense...we gotta do some digging, watch some film, and see what we can do better""
>        
> **Aside from the first time you played NE, aside from the turnovers, you were able to move the ball up and down the field offensively, why today...Did they dramatically change what they did in the first to the second game?****
> 
> Wilson: ""No it's the same. I think you have to put into account that it was windy as hell out there guys...theres times where you just can't take shots down the field, you can see it moving out there.,...We were trying to establish the run game, same as the Patriots were trying to do as well, they weren't out there trying to chuck 30-40 yard passes either, we got to find a way, I have got to find a way to make the easy ones on the side line and try and get my guys on the outside so they can run. What it really comes down to is execution.
>         
> **How tough will be to shake this one off Zach, losing like that?**
>        
> Wilson: Yea obviously it sucks to lose that way, but we are gonna move on from it, and learn from it.
>         
> **You guys talked alot about this game, what does that do to your momentum and confidence?**
>       
> Wilson: yea nothing, we won some big games, we lost some games we want back, we are gonna move on and learn from this one. We got Chicago next week.
>        
> **CBS cameras caught Wilson and Mims a little upset after a couple of the missed passes, Did they say anything to you or the you talk on the sidelines?**
>         
> Wilson: ""No we are all close, we are all talking and communicating, there's some stuff I want them to do different, and I get frustrated as well. I miss a throw high there and they are frustrated as well, it goes both ways, this isn't anyone pointing fingers here, this is everyone taking accountability and trying to get better.
>         
> **As an offense though, when you are only able to score 3 points, and the defense only lets up 3 points do you feel like you let the defense down at all?**
> 
> Wilson: No.
> 
The press conference is ended on that question.


Its not like Wilson was completely washing his hands of his major role in the loss. I think the NY media wore him down and were trying very hard to get him to throw someone under the bus or obviously offer himself up as a scapegoat (which would have been the right and smart move) but it was clear he was getting annoyed at the repeated questions and just wanted to pull a ""we are on to Cincinnati"" but finally nailed him with the final question and that's all that gets play. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt here, because sound bites are sound bites and at the end of the day, they are worthless. It's performance that matters.

Wilson can answer all questions ""right"" but it's all for nothing if he is continue to play poorly. Sam Darnold answered every question right, but he wasn't good enough. Maybe Wilson isn't good enough either, but he sucked on Sunday, moving on is the right attitude and not throwing your teammates under the bus is also the right move. Words are cheap and performance is what truly matters. Don't get bogged down in one poor, admittingly bad, sound bite. If he answered the last question ""of course"" does it really change the fact he is missing open receivers or that he is still getting flustered in the pocket? It either gets fixed by Wilson and the coaching or they have to move on. It's that simple.

NY Media is gonna NY Media. Don't take the bait. They love lockeroom drama and the Jets have bigger problems than press conferences and tweets. Wilson needs to improve or get benched. That's the entire problem, don't get distracted by the ""noise"" aspect of it. Letting them divide the lockeroom will create much bigger problems in the long term than Wilson just playing like ass.  So stop helping the dogpile and start looking at QB alternatives if you like. That is infinitely more constructive than trying to get the team to pikle on to Wilson. It does nothing for the team.",0.0,nyjets,t3_z0yfrm,False,0.0,":PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya",2022-11-21T14:14:57Z,nyjets,6.959466800328656e-06
