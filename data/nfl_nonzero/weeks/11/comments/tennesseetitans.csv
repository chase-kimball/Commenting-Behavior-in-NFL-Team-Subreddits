He served his suspension in 2019 when all the legal proceedings played out after the Rams signed him to a futures contract in the 2019 off-season.

It's not standard operating procedure in the NFL to fire a guy immediately after he is charged with a DUI, in fact it's pretty rare that ever happens. The Jets had an o-line coach get a DUI in the off-season and he still has a job. Steve Keim got a DUI and still has a job. Even those low on the totem pole like Neary were kept when they could have easily been cut after a stupid and easily preventable mistake like a DUI.

Simmons isn't one of the 10 highest rated d-linemen? David Long Jr. is the 85th(!!!) highest rated linebacker in the game, when I would be hesitant to name 5 linebackers playing better than him right now. Fucking Zach Cunningham, Joe Schobert, and Rashaan Evans are rated higher than David Long Jr.

If either Simmons or Long Jr. played for the Cowboys they would be 95 overalls easily because the ratings adjusters would actually care to watch their games. I don't think anyone working on the game could even tell you what team Long Jr. plays for. He probably doesn't even crack the starting lineup when you play as the Titans in the game.

Kristian Fulton is the 67th highest rated CB in the game too. He's below Trent fucking McDuffie and Derek Stingley, two rookies. William Jackson III is the 40th rated CB in the game and he just got traded in a salary dump before the trade deadline.

Insanely stupid to not call a cab or sleep it off in his office, he probably just didn’t think anything of it.

1969,18651,18651,Bieber_hole_69,"I made the trip up to the game, and what a game to be there for. I was genuinely shocked and impressed by the amount of Titans fans that showed out for this game too, I was at the week four game in Indy and there were maybe half as many Titans fans there than there were at this game. Did not end up getting back to be until 3 this morning so I am exhausted but wanted to jot down some thoughts:

One thing that I couldn’t help but notice watching that Packers team, just how awful the body language on their players is and how piss poor their effort could be sometimes. Receivers jogging on routes, nobody hurrying to the line, it almost looks like some of those guys don’t want to be on the field. Obviously it’s a top-down thing there, when the guy getting paid the most money in league history is doing that shit I can’t blame the rest of the team for thinking this shit doesn’t matter too. They were coming off a huge win, at home on a short week against one of the most injured teams in the league, their season was pretty much on the line and some guys looked like they couldn’t be bothered. Even the fans look like they hate their team too, they seem just as tired with it. Down 2 scores with under 5 minutes remaining and no timeouts left, and there was absolutely no sense of urgency in their offense. That team in Green Bay is a team in dire need of a spark or a shake up, just something to give them some life because the win against Dallas just four days ago seems like it was just a mirage.

It really made me appreciate even more what we have going with Vrabel and how much this team and franchise as a whole has transformed since Robinson took over in 2016. This team always comes out ready to play, there’s just never any quit in them. Outside of the Buffalo game in week 2, (which seems like a real aberration now,) when was the last time this team quit? Maybe the end of that Wild Card game against Baltimore in 2020? And even then that 2020 team also feels like a really weird outlier year based on how the team was built and how different it was compared to every other team we’ve had under Vrabel, and I would like to expand upon that further when I have more time. No matter what scrub they’ve rolled out to play off the street or off someone else’s practice squad, Vrabel and Co. have them ready to play and giving 110%. No matter how many injuries and how much they get counted out, they’re always playing with passion and drive, and it comes from the top-down with the players taking after a coach they love to play for. 

And boy oh boy was Downing in his bag all night lol. Maybe having to essentially eliminate the passing game from the playbook for two weeks when Willis was starting finally made Todd long for throwing the ball so much that he finally felt the need to be aggressive? And it fucking worked, Tannehill looked great again last night. Burks of course looked phenomenal, but the whole WR group turned it on with Woods no longer MIA and NWI playing his role as possession WR3 perfectly with some clutch contested catches. My only complaint is I would have wanted Chig to get another touch or two, but honestly the offense was churning so well that it’s whatever. We finally, finally got the explosive plays that have been completely absent from the offense all year, and it opened so much more up. I am legitimately giddy about the Burks performance though, really feels like he needed a showing like this to turn a corner and get it cooking, he was getting such great separation all night.

Offensively, this just felt like a perfect get-right game. Everyone other than Jones and Philips is back and healthy. The play calling found a rhythm. The explosives are there now. They found their swagger and got in a real groove last night, and if they can take keep it going we may really have something with this team. 

That game really felt like two teams going in opposite directions. One team had high expectations internally and from the media, but has failed to meet them spectacularly. The other came into this year after an offseason of self-reflection and started a semi-reboot with postseason expectations internally and 8-9 expectations externally, but has outperformed even the more optimistic projections despite awful injury luck. The Titans are playing hard, having fun, and proving naysayers wrong with glee. The Packers are on the verge of just rolling over and pretty much everyone in that locker room seems miserable being there. Both teams ended last year the same way, as #1 seeds that went one-and-done in excruciating fashion. The Packers still seem haunted by it while the Titans seem like they’ve been able to move on from it and start fresh.

The playoffs loss fucking sucked, but I don't feel any animosity toward your team. I think the Titans players likely have some leftover feelings after such a tough loss.

I'd say it's certainly the case for the majority of Titans fans who have been fans since the move to TN. I could imagine that for newer fans, the playoff loss sticks a bit more and make them more anti-Bengals.

I fuckin hate the fuckin Ravens. Honestly, hate the Ravens even more than the Colts.
