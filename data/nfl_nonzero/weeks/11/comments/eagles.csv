29763,269050,269050,howd_he_get_here,"I don't think there's a crystal clear answer tbh. It's a larger topic. The modern NFL is governed by these types of player protection rules that favor the injured but are also pretty easy to abuse on both sides of the ball - whether that's halting offensive momentum with a phantom ankle injury or trying to bait a 15 yard unnecessary roughness penalty.

As a human I obviously want the game to be as safe as possible and for players to be able to raise any and all injuries without fearing that it'll hurt their team. 

As fans it's obviously frustrating how much those rules have slowed down and sterilized the flow of the game. Especially when that tradeoff goes toward defenses faking injuries to slow down a fast drive, QBs pretending to give  themselves up and drawing a RtP flag for defenders not reading their mind in the fraction of a second, and other comparable nonsense.",1.0,nfl,t3_yy9bgk,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2022-11-18T14:25:29Z,eagles,-0.0904082518861454
