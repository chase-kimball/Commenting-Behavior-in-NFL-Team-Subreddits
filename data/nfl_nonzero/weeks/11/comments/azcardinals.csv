>Fowler:¬†Let's start with the former head coaches, Dan. Sean Payton seems to be lurking in a big way, and speaking of worst-kept secrets, Payton circling around the Chargers is probably one. Some around the league believe he would wait that one out (if the Saints would trade his rights, of course).

>Graziano:¬†I'd like to stop here for a second and talk about Payton, because I think just about every team with an opening will want to talk to him. Carolina, for example, would probably love a chance to throw a pile of money at Payton. But my sense is that he'll be picky and will look for a spot where the QB situation is solid, first and foremost. That's why I think a lot of people are connecting him with a potential Chargers opening. People would line up to coach Justin Herbert if that job came open. If not there, I've been told to watch Arizona as a potential Payton destination (again, assuming there's an opening there). And your point is well taken about the fact that an interested team would actually have to give the Saints some compensation in return for Payton, since he's still under contract with New Orleans. Makes me think it's even less likely that NFC South rival Carolina would have a chance.

Doesn't seem like there is much there to me.
