10550,64083,64083,FutureDH1089,"I just realized that the Bills have only had like 1 legit practice all last week, so the sloppiness displayed yesterday is sort of explained. That gives me a little better feelings heading into a “normal” week for this Thursday.

However, there’s definitely some things to fix moving forward such as (again) our RZ offense still continues to struggle. I mean 6 FGs could have been 6 TDs if the play calling/execution was better. Also our DBs got picked on all game, so hopefully Tre is back and Elam gets healthier so they can help. Dane what is happening?!

Lastly, I am encouraged that we got the run game going. Both Cook and Singletary looked amazing and Josh only had 1 carry, so a majority of the ground game was actually our RBs doing the heavy lifting. Hopefully we see more of that. Anyways, here’s to another game this Thanksgiving where Josh always shines, so I expect a better day for the entire offense as a whole and I know we’ll get the defense sured up (which wasn’t really bad to begin with; 2 garbage time TDs late). I’m excited about the rest of the season and thinking yesterday’s game will spring us into winning again!

Josh Allen’s overall grade is 9th at 80.9. His pass grade is 16th at 69.2 which is slightly above average, but his rushing grade is first at 92.8. On the season he has the best rushing grade in football. Not just QBs, out of anyone.

Zach Wilson’s is 74.0 which is, oh hold on, that’s his rush grade. That’s alright, it’s 12th. His overall grade is dead last at 40.0. Like Allen, his rushing grade helped. His passing grade is also dead last at 35.6, and it’s not close. 2nd worst is John Wolford and his passing grade is nearly 10 points higher.

Big difference is Allen is throwing it down the field 2 yards further on average and has nearly three times the percentage of PFF’s highest grade of pass than Wilson. His yards per attempt is 14th while Wilson’s is 32nd.
