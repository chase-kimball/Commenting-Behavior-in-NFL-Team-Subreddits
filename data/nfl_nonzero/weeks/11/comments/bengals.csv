I slept all day Saturday. I had been up pretty much all night the night before, and I was exhausted. I woke up at 1:30 Sunday morning. I was hungry as fuck, and let me tell you I go absolutely feral when I’m hungry.

I didn’t have any food in my fridge and nothing but ramen and protein powder in my pantry. I meant to do the groceries yesterday, but I slept instead. So I go down the street to McDonald’s. I sit in line for 10 minutes and the line doesn’t budge. I decide to bail and go somewhere else. I go down the street to Del Taco, the line is out the fucking parking lot which is weird because Del Taco is ass. I sit in that line for 15 minutes and I don’t move an inch before an employee comes out to tell me they’re short staffed and that it would be an hour wait. Hell no. I bail and go further down the street to another McDonald’s, I sit in that line for 10 minutes before noticing a big beautiful Jack In The Box across the street, with no line. I jumped out of line, and went over. The guy on the speaker said that they were closed, despite being a 24 hour business. I was starving and 40 minutes later I still had no food.

I ended up finding a Wendy’s that had a pretty long wait, but it was still moving at a decent pace. I would’ve went there first but I didn’t even know they were open at 3 AM.

26441,197419,197419,TheReaver88,"I think it's a combination of things.

1. Our overall talent level is *not* that high, IMHO. It's a little above average. However, we don't have any true ""weak spots."" One could argue that an NFL defense is only as strong as it's weakest link; T.J. Watt played another great game against us, and we put up 37 points without any gimmicks because their back seven are beatable. In contrast, there's nowhere obvious to attack our D.

2.  Zac Taylor is a very good Monday-Thursday coach. Lou probably is as well, but I'm not sure what that split is. The staff does a really good job of getting the most out of individual players so that our team is greater than the sum of its parts. That's why our defense can be dominant without true superstars, and its how we cobbled together a postseason run with a trashcan offensive line.

3. Last but not least (and certainly not a groundbreaking statement), Lou Anarumo is phenomenal at making in-game adjustments. We've been doing it since last year's bye, it seems.

Predictability is one that I would be interested in learning more about. For example, it became public knowledge that Mixon was upright during pass plays and bent at the knees on run plays. Is this a contributing factor? Does Burrow tip his throws in some way indicating to the defender he's about to throw the ball? 

If a QB has a predictable release time does it allow the defender to more accurately time their jump? What about a lack of or implementation of pump fakes?

If you take the grades from the lineups on PFF and use the average grade these teams are ranked higher than the Bengals.

Falcons----71.6  
Panthers---67.9  
Broncos----65.9  
Steelers---65.6  
Commanders-62.4
