Fields can become a great passer because most of the issues I see with him can be coached up.

14373,148766,148766,d1dOnly,"A few reasons for the improvement after moving on from Matt:

1) The OL is playing better. We replaced 2 OL (Center & LG) and while the new guys aren't world beaters, they have played better. For example, last year's starting Center, Hennessy, had to start at LG against Carolina and the entire OL played worse. Also, our starting RT, McGary, is actually playing well for the first time in his career.

2) When things do break down for the OL, Mariota can use his legs. I love Matt, but he can be a bit of a statue in the pocket, which is harder on the OL. Mariota has 347 rushing yards in 10 games, Ryan has 370 rushing yards in his last 56 games.

3) Despite giving up more YPG this season, the defense is actually allowing fewer points. They are giving up roughly the same amount of first downs per game (22.5 in 2021, 22.3 in 2022), but allowing 2 fewer points per game.

4) Were actually one of the least penalized teams in the league, so we're not giving up free yards.

I've said on r/falcons before, but I think we're 4-6 or 5-5 with Ryan this year.
