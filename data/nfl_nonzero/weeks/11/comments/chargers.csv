34913,199375,199375,costopule,"This was not how he was seen. He was drafted 2001 and rode the bench behind Flutie, then started all 16 games in 2002. 

In 2002, Brees’ stat ranks were all right around the 12-18 range, but his Y/A and TD% were in the basement and he was tied for 5th in INTs. He was also like not remotely close to the upper tier of QBs that year, who had 1400 more yards and 10 more TDs. Sure a year that showed he could play some football, but nothing that made you confident he was that guy. They went 8-8 and missed the playoffs. 

In 2003, he only started 11 games, but he was actually worse than last year across the board. INT% went up, TD% went down,  CMP% went down, Y/A went down, and he finished bottom 5 in passer rating. He threw 11 TDs to 15 INTs. He was 2-9 as a starter. 41 year old Flutie went 2-3 as a starter with 9 TDs to 4 INTs and better stats in nearly every category. 

In 2004, he had a good year. In 15 games, he threw for 27 TDs and 7 INTs, good for 3rd in both TD% and INT%. His Y/A and and CMP% were 6th, which had him 15th in yards while only being 21st in attempts. He finished 11-4 as a starter, with Flutie pulling in a week 17 victory to bring the team to 12-4, good for the 4 seed. Brees had a good game against the Jets in the wildcard, but thanks to a Kaeding missed FG in overtime, the Chargers lost by 3. Brees’ best season was a bit overshadowed by Manning’s absurd 2004, and there was other guys like Culpepper who were also playing well beyond normal expectations. He received a franchise tag entering 2005. 

In 2005, he was good not great. The league’s ceiling came down a ton from the year before, with the TD leader having 17 fewer TDs than in 2004 and yardage leader being 600 yards lower. Brees finished not crazy far from the top in much of his volume stats, but was average in a few pace stats. Brees got his injury in the late 2nd quarter and Rivers came in, got their only TD of the game on his first drive, and played the whole second half (not very impressive)  and they lost the game, finishing 9-7, 2 games back from even a wildcard. 

Brees’ shoulder was fucked, he dislocated it and tore his labrum, requiring off-season surgery. This guy showed he could have a great year, but he was not close to world beating. After an injury like that, nothing was guaranteed. There was a good chance that Brees would never get up to the level he was at before, and a more limited version of the Brees we had seen would just be a bad quarterback. 

The Chargers did offer him a small deal, which would’ve put him in the top 10 for pay, keeping in mind that Rivers was also on a top 15 contract at the time and had a higher cap hit than Brees on his franchise tag that year. Some teams were interested, including the Dolphins, who dropped out of the Breesstakes citing his questionable injury status and not being confident that he was fully healed. Brees, in the end, found a better offer from the Saints that brought him up to 6th in AAV, and 1st in cash earnings that season. This was a widely criticized move for a QB who seemed to be a boom or bust player at that stage in his career. Obviously we know how that turned out.",31.0,nfl,t3_yzhva1,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-11-19T13:58:41Z,chargers,-0.0003617184269211

Wilson has a bunch of young unproven receivers, nothing notable at TE or RB with Breece Hall out now, and an offensive scheme that is maybe fine? We don't really even know on that front. And an OLine that is ok on a good day but bad on most days from my understanding. So his surroundings aren't super favorable, at least comparably.
