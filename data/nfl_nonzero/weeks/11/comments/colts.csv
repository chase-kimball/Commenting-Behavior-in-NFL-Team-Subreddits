Zach Wilson is judged differently because he was a high draft pick. Wilson is 5-2 as a starter this year and his play hasn’t been great. He has 4 TD passes and 5 ints and QBR of 45.1. But what if I told you a QB with similar results is receiving adoration?

The other QB is 4-1 as a starter with similar results. 5 TDs-4 ints, a QBR of 46.4 and just got named the Starting QB despite no TDs in his last 2 games for one reason and one reason only. WINNING. That QB is Taylor Heinicke of the Commanders. So whats the difference? (2/9)

The difference is Wilson was the 2nd overall pick and Heinicke was undrafted out of Old Dominion. Heinicke has a great story and lower expectations after bouncing around the NFL and another pro league while sleeping on his sister’s couch. Wilson’s “No” comment didn’t help. (3/9)

While Saleh is benching Wilson for poor play, Ron Rivera said Heinicke doesn’t have to play good to keep the job because the whole team plays better when he starts even if he isn’t. YOU NEVER HEAR THAT IN THE NFL. Only Winning matters for Heinicke but not Wilson. (4-9)

Wilson gets no credit from Saleh for the play of the Jet’s defense but Heinicke gets credit from Rivera for the play of the entire Washington team. Rivera says, “There is just something special about Taylor Heinicke” and everyone else says, “What’s wrong with Zach Wilson?”. (5-9)

Heinicke is beloved, his teammates rave about his underdog mentality and he is credited with raising the level of everyone around him despite his own play. Wilson’s play is always analyzed in the sense that the Jets and specifically the defense performs in spite of him. (6-9)

The expectations of each QB determine the reaction. Wilson gets no credit for the game winning drive against the Bills because he only threw the ball once or for the game winning drive against the Steelers because he had 1 TD-2ints in the game. More is always expected. (7-9)

Yet, Heinicke is given credit for beating the Eagles despite completing 58.6% of his passes with an int and a 66.9 QB rating.  You can dislike Wilson’s play and his post game comments and still understand the discrepancy in the reaction to a QB with similar results. (8-9)

High Draft picks get more scrutiny, that’s just the reality. Whether you think this discrepancy is justified or not is up to you. I would argue Wilson should be given more time to figure it out because he was a high draft pick and is 5-2 as the starter.

This team is built to win as hard as it may be to believe. But this team has also not been performing to expectations. Defensively even with all the injuries has been playing well. And I know they can play even better. Offensively there are numerous problems.  The line has been a consistent problem, lately it seems to be the rookies with an occasional vet making mistakes.  Or Ryan not able to make the big plays. I do trust in Saturday to figure it out and get the line in gear or to tell Ballard the moves to be made. 

This year sucks. I love this team but I unfortunately don’t have high expectations. I go in every week believing we can beat just about any team (because we can) but settle with the defeats hoping that we’re going to make the necessary changes to truly compete.

I am an avid Colts fan and have spent the greater part of my life playing and/or being involved with football. There is zero indication that Ballard is going anywhere and many things that would in fact point to the opposite. Ballard was heavily involved in the hiring of Reggie Wayne and is a guy he targeted. Yes, he for once finally appeared annoyed and agitated. But wouldn’t you if everyone was complaining about what moves needed to be made, you make those moves, and then people decide to move on and then just bitch about something else? He has every right to be pissed off. He has drafted well and made some great moves and some no so great ones. But the team he has built should be and HAS performed leagues better than what they currently have been. Wouldn’t you be upset to see all that talent not doing their jobs? It became clear this is a coaching issue and the organization made the move to reset and take back control. I like Frank, but I don’t like what became of this team. I hope he goes on and does great things, but it was time for HIM to move on. There is no reason that we shouldn’t be in control of our division and have a clear lead in the playoff hunt. None of the AFC south teams are better than us, but we sure made them look that way. Ballard knows what this team is and has full support of the organization and of Irsay. Saturday was brought in to light a fire under people’s asses and hold them accountable. Something that wasn’t happening. He is not going to be complacent or a yes man. What he will do is find every flaw he can and report it and try and work with our FO to fix it. Whether that means he stays on as HC or not, his job now is to turn this ship around, keep it from sinking, and build it better to prepare for a better future.
