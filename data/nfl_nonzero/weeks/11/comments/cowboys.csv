26014,224142,224142,barley_wine,"This isn't quite true, these numbers are only true for average incomes.  In Colorado you'd be hit considerably higher if you make $14,000,000 per year.

For Denver for a 1.5 million dollar home he'd get taxed at around $6,000 per year.  Denver's sales tax is 4.8% so say he spends 250,000 per year then he gets taxed $12,000.  Finally at $14,000,000 per year he gets taxed at 4.5% or $630,000 per year.

So total taxes per year at Denver are $6,000 + 12,000 + 630,000 = $648,000

In Dallas a 1 million dollar home (prices are a little lower here), he'd get taxed at around $19,200 per year.   There's no state income tax here.  Sales tax in Dallas is 8.25% or $20,625.

So the total taxes per year are $39,825 per year for Gregory.   So he's paying $600,000 more in taxes in Denver vs TX.  (This is assuming that there's not complex laws about if you play a game in another state such as New York you pay taxes there)

&#x200B;

Property taxes and sales taxes are regressive so they hit the lower income brackets way more than the higher income.  It seems counter intuitive but you're normally better off paying income taxes with lower property taxes (until you reach a certain income that is).  These comparisons aren't for high incomes.

For quick comparison sake lets look at someone making $100,000 per year with a $500K house in Denver vs a $400K house in Dallas:

Denver Vs Dallas:

Income Tax:  $4,500 vs $0.  
Property Tax: $2,000 vs $7,464  
Sales Tax (assuming 20% of income towards purchases): $960 vs $1,650
