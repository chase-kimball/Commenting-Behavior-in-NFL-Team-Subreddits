Fun fact: the 2019 Seahawks had 12 one-possession games, with a record of 10-2 in those games.

[This was Pete's response](https://www.seahawks.com/news/they-make-you-stronger-why-the-seahawks-are-ok-with-playing-so-many-close-games):

>I love close games, I think they help you. They make you stronger. They keep you in the game longer. They make you have to focus farther, and it prepares you for more kinds of things that can happen that you need background and experience in. It would really be OK if we could win by a lot sometimes. That'd be fun. (But) this is this season. These seasons write a story and that's kind of the story of what's been going on all year long. We're certainly not trying to let them back into it. That's not the idea. I think it's only going to help us. I think all of the young guys that have been through those games, they're not tensing up. They're not worried about what's going to happen next. Just keep thinking we're going to find a way. That's powerful. It really supports what the experienced guys have been around and how they think. It's just the way it is. I'm sorry for the fans. Like I've said before, you've got to suck it up and enjoy the wins. Sometimes, they just come out later than you want.",10.0,nfl,t3_z1dl11,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-11-21T17:47:53Z,seahawks,0.0053865563306651
