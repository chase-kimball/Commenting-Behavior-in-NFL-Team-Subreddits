Step-by-Step Solution
0.042 = 21/500
 as a fraction
To convert the decimal 0.042 to a fraction, just follow these steps:
Step 1: Write down the number as a fraction of one:
0.042 = 0.042
1
Step 2: Multiply both top and bottom by 10 for every number after the decimal point:
As we have 3 numbers after the decimal point, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 1000. So,
0.042
1
 = (0.042 × 1000)
(1 × 1000)
 = 42/
1000
.
Step 3: Simplify (or reduce) the above fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) between them. In this case, GCD(42,1000) = 2. So,
(42÷2)
(1000÷2)
 = 21/500
 when reduced to the simplest form
