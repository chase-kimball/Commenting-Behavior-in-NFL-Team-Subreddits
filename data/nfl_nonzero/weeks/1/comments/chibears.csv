37369,222575,222575,billyinforsey,"It’s a recent change to the rules. In 2020, the NFL started a new collective bargaining agreement before the pandemic was in full swing. That CBA allowed for up to two players in a given game week to be promoted to the active roster without giving the players a normal player contract. Normally, a player must be removed from the 53-man roster to make room for a practice squad promotion. Then, if the promoted player is sent back down to the practice squad, he has to clear waivers. That is not the case with the new rule. The new rule allows teams to promote two players from the practice squad per week without the need to create a roster spot—in essence, creating a temporary 55-man roster. Those players are eligible to play in that week’s game, and they revert back to the practice squad at the end of the week without having to pass through waivers. There is one catch. You can only use this temporary promotion three times on an individual player per season. After that, you’ll have to sign him to the 53-man roster to play them.

50139,314508,314508,patrick_e,"There’s a ton of great history. Most wins in pro football history (although that’s likely to change this year unfortunately), most Hall of Famers in the NFL. 

George Halas bought the Decauter Staleys and moved them to Chicago, took University of Illinois’ colors (his alma mater), took inspiration for the mascot from the Cubs, and was really one of the essential people in the creation of the NFL. That’s why the Bears wear his initials on their sleeve. 

We’ve historically been a blue collar, defense-dominated team. There’s mixed history, especially lately, and this season is likely to be a “bite the bullet” year where we offloaded a TON of dead cap money ($60 mil I believe?) and, with a new coach and GM and below average depth and talent, what we most want to see this year is development of the QB in year two of his career, a competent offensive system installed, and a disciplined and fundamentally sound team, something we struggled with under the last head coach. 

We always want to win but the W/L numbers are less important this year than long-term development. 

The defense was good against the run last year but rough (31st) against the pass, so they added two 2nd round picks at S and CB. Really hoping to see Brisker and Gordon show flashes as the future of the defensive backfield. 

The offensive line seems to have potential but is pretty young and very new playing together. It’s likely to start rough, but again, growth, development, and potential are what we’re looking for. 

Expect a run-heavy offense this year (I think) with occasional deep throws to keep the defense a bit on its heels. 

Looking forward, the OL and WR group are probably the biggest units to watch next year and on. The Bears have a lot of good depth WRs but probably only 1 real starter at the position right now. There’s mixed opinions in the new front office, but I think it’s pretty clear they have a plan in place and are executing it as best they can with limited resources left over from the previous regime. There’s reason to be optimistic, even if we’ve become a favorite punching bag of the national media.

9ers didn’t lose because of Lance, they lost because they were undisciplined and taking stupid penalties and didn’t adjust after the Bears did. There were a couple of weak calls too. 

I don’t think that game was any indictment of Lance’s potential or ability to be a good quarterback in this league. I wouldn’t write him off even after a full season of looking mediocre. He is a project, everyone knows he’s a project and that’s why he was drafted…because of his raw talent. 

That being said, Arlington Heights’ only son Jimmy G will start because the fans and media and some teammates cannot possibly accept that they played poorly and undisciplined in the second half given the circumstances to hold into a lead.
