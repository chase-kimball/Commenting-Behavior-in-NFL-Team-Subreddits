Your best bet would to be on the lookout [on TSE’s website](https://tsebuffalo.com/). They are an official partner with the team and have tons of pre-signed items you can buy. They also do a lot of mail in/in person autograph sessions. I’ve gotten multiple items from them. They also do pop up booths on game days if you know someone local. 

There’s also [Dave & Adams](https://www.dacardworld.com/sports-memorabilia/autographed-football-memorabilia) which is a local store to Buffalo. But their website is kinda trash. Not everything they have in store is listed online. 

Another option but will be pricey is the [NFL auction site](https://nflauction.nfl.com/iSynApp/showPage.action?sid=1100783&pageName=partners&pgmode1=bills&pgmode2=team&pgmode3=&rc=10&rs=0).

46771,324270,324270,samb716,"1) buffalo in October is very unpredictable. Could be 40 degrees, could be 65 with a breeze. Could be pouring rain and windy as all hell. Id say prepare for the worst but also pack for the best, can never be too prepared.

2) public transportation in the city isn’t bad. Buses, the metro line and depending on where you stay some walking wouldn’t be out of the question. If all else fails ridesharing is always an option. 

1.	The bills stadium is located in orchard park which is just about 22 minutes from the airport. Game day traffic can be a nightmare. It’s recommended to go early enough that it won’t be an issue. In all honesty most things are at least a half hour away at all times if you’re in the city. Niagara Falls is beautiful, definitely make the trip but I’d recommend staying within the touristy areas. 


2.	There is probably more food than you’d know what to do with in such a short period of time. That said the staples would be **wings**: *Duffs*, *Bar-Bill*, *Gabriel’s Gate*, *Nine-Eleven Tavern* and for the birthplace of the wing *Anchor Bar*. **Beef on weck**: it’s roasted beef, usually with au jus and if you’re feeling special, some horseradish. The bun is what’s called a Kimmelweck roll. On the top bun is salt and kimmelweck seeds. Hence the name Beef on Weck. I’ve had delicious wecks all over but my favorites are *Charlie the butcher* and *Bar-Bill*. There’s another place I’d recommend but last time I was there they didn’t have the stuff to make their weck. (*Wingnutz* for the curious ones). **Pizza**: in my opinion if you want just a general feel for most buffalo pizza I’d say go *La Nova pizza*, some will say imperial or others but La Nova I feel hits the mark for a good all around view of buffalo pizza. **Hot Dogs**: *teds hot dogs* for a sahlens hot dog is a must in my opinion. Enough said there. If beer is on your menu, there are a lot of breweries around the city and I’d recommend all of them.

49296,351333,351333,tomk1,"Thank you for posting OP. For those interested, go just before the 14 min mark. His agent then Ramsey himself start talking about Bills Mafia presence at the game. Put a smile on my face, I’ll be honest. They end up talking about Josh and the Bills for about 6 min. I thought it was very good. The only thing that irks me slightly in this clip is what he said in interviews earlier as well … that we had only scored through “explosive” plays, and that, without those, it would still be a 10-10 game. Lol.  Truth be told I’ve seen a LOT of this logic on other games by our own fans in our own sub. As well, as poorly as the excuse/reasoning comes off, I think i understand the logic. “Explosive” plays, I believe he means, are plays that are very risky and require a bit of luck. A great example is Gabe’s first TD. The LA D absolutely bit at the run which left Davis open. HUGE credit to Dorsey’s design and call and to the O for perfect execution, but a percent of that play, however small, requires the D to make a bit of a mistake, in this case a misread of the O Line and the initial part of the play. Ramsey’s argument is that these explosive plays are likely more defendable than others and that if their own D didn’t make the “needed” misread mistake, those plays don’t succeed. Those plays, all scores, don’t succeed, it’s still tied.


Personally that’s a little bit more of a jump in logic than I’m willing to swallow, but it’s still better than reading the take as “if the Bills just didn’t score, then we would have won”.


That being said, if you’re a Ramsey hater and watch the vid, I doubt you’re going to forgive him, but for me, I thought it was fairly entertaining commentary from a top Corner who’s seen a lot, and came off very respectful of his opponent who, by his own words, beat his ass.",1.0,buffalobills,t3_xaz6rp,False,0.0,:still-bill:,2022-09-11T02:17:11Z,buffalobills,0.0332282715067253
