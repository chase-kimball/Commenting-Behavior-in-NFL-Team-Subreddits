Secondly, you need to listen to Michael Thomas’ post-game interview. It’ll give you some faith. Our offense didn’t even click until midway through the third quarter. This was their preseason game - they hadn’t played a single snap together prior to this. 

Third, our oline struggled with communication during the first half. They shaped up by the 4th.

Historically, the Saints take approximately two games to get warmed up each season and knock the rust off. I encourage you to listen to Ross Jackson’s podcast episode that he drops tomorrow, because I guarantee you that he’s going to explain why this particular win was different.
