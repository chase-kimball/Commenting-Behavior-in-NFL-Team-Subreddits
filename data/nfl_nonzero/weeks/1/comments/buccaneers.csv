Overall, yes…. I am a bit concerned about the sequencing which is where I think the offense places too much burden on Brady on 3rd down. That being said, my comment is just vibes so far (and validation from Ledyard and NFLosophy) and I’m hoping to get into the numbers later this week

>	There are some situations where it’s fine to run more than pass on first down, and I think last night was one of them.

Ya I agree - which is why I said that I hope the rushing late in the game is because of a high win probability and not because Bowles told Lefty to rush a fuck ton.
