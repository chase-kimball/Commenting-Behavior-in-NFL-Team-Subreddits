Whenever Dak has a bad day, it is ok full display for millions of fans that not have the opportunity to ridicule him online or on TV or wherever. Now think about if your bad day was made worse because people publicly are shaming you for what you did wrong at work. That‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs happening to Dak right now. He had a bad day at the office, we all do. Peyton Manning had a game with 0 passer rating if I recall. Aaron Rodgers didn‚Äôt play very well this week either. It happens.
