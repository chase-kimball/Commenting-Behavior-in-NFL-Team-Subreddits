Yes, the cap is jumping in the next year or so. But how high a percentage of cap can you afford to give to your QB and still field a competitive team? It's also going to mean that average and above-average QB's (like Cousins) start setting the market as opposed to the elite tier QB's.

And that's why teams are not happy. Lamar now has massive market leverage. If Lamar does, that also means the next tier down (Baker, Cousins) and even mediocrity (Daniel Jones?) could shape the next set of contracts which is not what teams want to see.

It's honestly likely going to predicate a bunch of teams going back to rolling the dice on rookies if they feel they're priced out.

24071,176667,176667,deviden,"> Look at our schedule, the top QBs we face are Brady, Allen, Burrow, Herbert, and Jackson. They will undoubtedly pick apart our secondary under JW.

AFC is a QB nightmare, throwing that many good QBs at us, but I don't think there's many defenses in the league where you can honestly say that group of QBs wouldn't shred the secondary/coverage schemes. 

Leaving aside the occasional blown coverage, which is the one thing that most worries me with JW, the reason those QBs will pick our defense apart (assuming they do) is not going to be the coverages that JW runs. It's gonna be the fact that aside from Myles and Clowney the DL that AB has given JW this year has very limited/unproven talent and no quality depth for rotation. 

If we can't consistently generate pressure all along the DL within 2.5 seconds, or heaven forbid Myles or Clowney miss some time, we will be reliant on sending blitzes and the best QBs all shred the blitz.

49ers have been running the same scheme as us for years and have been consistently one of the best defenses in the league, and a big reason for that is they've got 6-8 studs in the DL room and they're blowing up their gap in the OL on every snap without needing to send a blitz. Bills defensive scheme is very similar and now that they've got a loaded D-line they're gonna be wrecking even the best QBs. 

We've got a great back 7 for pass defense but due to deficiencies in our DL we're gonna eat shit some weeks. That's just how it's gonna be. Some teams will run it down our throats, other teams will be able to protect their QB for too long for any secondary to hold up.

Other than that, it's only the blown coverages I complain about. We're not a top 5 defense but if JW can coach those out then we're maybe top 10.

24076,176672,176672,deviden,"**TLDR:** I dont think Joe's scheme is a problem, we're at one of the leading edges of the meta, there's one glaring personnel issue with this defensive roster, and unless the coverage busts keep happening every game I will continue supporting JW.

**Essay time!**

So there's a few issues holding our defense back from being truly top tier but I honestly don't think there's a schematic problem. I think the theory behind the scheme and how it meshes with our personnel is sound, with an exception or two... 

For me, the single worst thing about our defense is what we saw on Sunday - the big coverage busts from miscommunication. Now in JW's defense, this kind of thing happens to loads of teams every week and a lot of our guys are real young, so this will happen - especially in week one; if you take out those two huge broken plays most of Carolina's pass offense is erased and we're back in ""elite performance"" territory, and with stronger QB play we'd have all left the game thinking the defense did well enough. The argument againse JW here is  it's now the 2nd year in this defense for most of these guys (3rd for a few others) and we're still getting a few miscommunication broken coverages.

**Why do I like JW's scheme/defense?**

- Soft zone with split safeties in a two high shell is the new meta. All the light box, two-high shell Fangio/Staley stuff that people gush over and many teams are trying to adopt? Ditto the 49ers w/ Demeco and Salah? We're already there. The aim of the game is disguising coverages pre-snap and limiting explosive plays on early downs, and allowing safeties to play fast and come downhill to make tackles instead of run backwards. 

- The scheme is *the non-Staley way to get there*, with a 4-2-5 nickel as the base, running quarters and match quarters as the core coverage concepts. Fangio/Staley means going to a 3 or 5 man front and with our personnel that's not our best path. Base nickel is great for us - in that lineup we've got one of the best back 7s in the league. 

- Note: The soft zone thing is really only on early downs. 3rd down and 4th down most teams are running man most of the time, incl. us, and frequently blitz.

- Why do all this? Take away easy pre-snap reads for QBs, put a two high shell over the top to limit explosive plays (because explosive plays are now better than being efficient - you rarely score on a drive without at least one 20+ yard play), and match-zone concepts kinda play out like man (based on offense's post-snap route distribution) but usually with more plays on the ball by the DBs. 

- Rushing 4 and dropping 7 into coverage is the dream. Just look at the Bills. If you can get away with reduced blitzing against today's better QBs (who kill you on the blitz) then why bother? 

**The problems:** 

- Complexity. Zone, match and deceptive zone coverages are harder to teach than man (man = ""you got that guy""). That's why we get the occasional egregious wide open coverage busts. 

- Limited blitz and DL creativity on early downs. It's inherent to the 4 down front, sadly. All the creativity up front has to come from D-line stunts/games and the occasional nickel or LB sent on the blitz. 3 or 5 man fronts can get real weird with it, a lot easier to run simulated pressures (send 4 but who knows who's coming)

- Defensive tackles. ALERT ALERT. This could kill us against the good teams. 49ers and Jets are the other teams running this scheme and unlike us they invest most of their D capital into the DL, both have loads of depth and a great rotation group and can afford to go 1-gap rush full speed every snap. We're more invested in the defensive backs and only two proven good edge guys. Having the best back 7 wont mean shit if we can never get to 3rd and long against the better teams, or teams with a genuinely good/smart run game. 

**So what?**

Don't expect us to be a top 5 defense this year, purely based on our lack of DL depth and proven DT talent. 

Don't write off Joe Woods yet. If the communication/complexity issues get ironed out over the course of the season there will be long stretches where our back 7 just erases other teams' passing offense and buys all the time Myles and Clowney need to get home. 

Our defense will win us games but due to the limits of our QB that wont be enough in other games.
