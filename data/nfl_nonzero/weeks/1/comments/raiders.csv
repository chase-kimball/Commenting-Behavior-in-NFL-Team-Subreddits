Technically if I start blocking Aaron Donald at the snap and I push him backwards 20 yards downfield that's legal.

The penalty would only come if I moved forward in between the time Donald fell and the ball got thrown.

1. Very few flags compared to our standard, there's more discipline and less stupid shit costing us games.

2. While it took a while for them to wake up, overall the defense balled out second half. Getting decent stops and keeping it competitive kept us in the game, and kept me from turning the TV off till the end.

3. Though some will disagree, I think the Carr-Adams connection is real. I do agree however, that it was overused and there were too many plays Carr tried to force. But Adams can still make clutch catches and Carr can still throw them. He just has to make sure that there isn't a safety in the way first.

4. We are still competitive in this division. Chargers are favored by many to win it and we shut down their elite offense multiple times especially during the second half. The offense threw the game, but the defense kept it a game.

The O line did not play a terrible game, at least not as bad as many of us feared coming in, particularly against a very good LA front 7. Davante Adams is the player we thought he would be, Hobbs is becoming a star before our eyes, and we shutdown the LA offense in the second half. The defensive adjustments were very, very impressive.

Overall we were in the game at the end, on the road, against a very, very talented team, that’s a division rival.
