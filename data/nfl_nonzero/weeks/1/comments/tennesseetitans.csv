Our team last year as a whole was not mediocre. Our offense absolutely was.

Losing in the first round of playoffs as the number one seed (first round we got to play in that is) the year after losing in the first round at home against the ravens with the offense barely able to put up any sort of offensive momentum in both games, is mediocrity. 

In short: the team isn't mediocre, but the offense is. that falls almost exclusively at this point on downing. If you would like to look past this because ""oh it's week 1 it doesn't matter"" that's on you.

Nate Davis had a PFF grade in the high 40’s his first year, followed by two years grading out at 69. That isn’t great. PFF isn’t the end all be all, but it does give a ballpark estimate of OL and DL play better than anything else I’ve seen. And a 69 average there tracks with the eye test, which is about average.

He inherited Lewan and Jones, who have been the two biggest pillars of the O-Line here. 

You could say that he hit on Conklin, but they also let him walk in FA, which has lead to several draft picks (Wilson, Radunz, and now NPF) used on the position.

16737,111619,111619,PuffMagicDragon,"Couple of things, mostly positive. 

Weaver looked really nice for his first real performance as a starter (not sure if he technically was the “starter” but still). But he isn’t filling the Landry gap (not that we should expect him to). Gave up something like 240 rush yards yesterday. Bowen and Vrabel need to gameplan a better way to fill his gap. 

Amani hooker looked great too, already earning that contract extension. Shades of KB in the Dallas game a few years back. 

Rookie receivers looking good already. Philips led the team in receiving and Burks had some major yards on just a few catches. Excited to see what they can do with more time to glue with Ryan.

In the same vein as above, I don’t think Bobby Trees got a catch the whole game. I was at the game so it was hard to keep track but that cannot happen next week. Have to spread the ball out more and get it to the guy you’re paying to be WR1. Same goes for TE1 Hoopdog.

How did the DB’s look? I think that may have been Fulton that blew that long TD pass in the second half but it was hard to keep track of it all.

Also, tackling. Wow we missed a lot of tackles. I get that Barkley is good but again, we let up a sickening amount of rush yards. Several times when Jones or Barkley should’ve been down for a loss and ended up getting 5-10 yards.

Don’t need to say anything about playcalling that hasn’t already been said. Fire Downing.

14 teams with 6 bench spots is a lot of players, which means very few playable guys on waivers. It's not inherently bad. Just, y'know, compared with 12-team 5-bench, it's a big difference. It's 42 players that are on teams instead of being on waivers, likely the 42 best (though obviously that math isn't perfect considering positional value and stuff).

Nothing wrong with it. I've done 14-team leagues, done 10-team leagues. I think 12 is kinda the sweet-spot for a reason. But the others aren't inherently worse. Just different.
