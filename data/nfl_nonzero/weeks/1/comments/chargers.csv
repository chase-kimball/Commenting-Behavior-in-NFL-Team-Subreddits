We are only allowed two pinned posts at a time. The buy/sell thread is pinned as much as we can, so we don't get flooded with posts selling tickets, jerseys etc. This post was created at user requests last season, and by all accounts has been a success.

That leaves us with one pinned post to use. We have several posts scheduled throughout the week to use that spot for:

Sunday: Game and Post-Game Threads, with UpBolt Parties temporarily replacing buy/sell after wins.

Monday: Day After Thread, to limit extraneous and often low-effort text posts regarding the previous game.

Tuesday-Thursday+Saturday: Weekly Chat Thread, [in the vain mentioned in this request last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/x7eo8u/weekly_threads_this_season/), where standard discussion about the next week's game will take place. **This does not mean we will remove all posts regarding the next game, just those deemed as low-effort.** Again, this thread has been made new for this season **at numerous requests of users**.

Friday: Free Talk, for any and all general discussion that may, or may not, have anything to do with the Chargers.

While I understand it is not perfect, this is the best schedule we can do, and I believe that, if it were not for this Thursday game happening so early in the season when we're first introducing the Weekly thread, it would not be nearly as much of an issue, since we would have a set schedule.

We can only pin two threads at a time. The buy/sell thread stays pinned as much as we can because without it, we get a lot of people posting ticket threads. So we have to rotate the final thread, and we have the next day thread the day after the game for further discussion so there aren't 100 text posts. And a standard unpinned weekly thread will get lost in the posts because they are generally not upvoted much, so would get lost in the page.

At that point in the game the Chargers had a two score lead and playcalling got extremely conservative. Well over half the plays after that point were runs to wind down the clock, which allowed the Raiders to get back into the game. 

But yeah, Herbert was super efficient this game and if they kept their foot on the gas, he could’ve easily thrown for over 350 yards and 4-5TDs. Mahomes played great, but to say Hebert wasn’t on his level is a bit of an overstatement considering his OC didn’t give him as many opportunities or make it easy for him to drive the ball.
