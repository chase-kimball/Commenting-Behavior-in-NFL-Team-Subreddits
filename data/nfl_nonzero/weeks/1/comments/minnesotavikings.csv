29106,181843,181843,benigntugboat,"The problem with the analogy is that the force int he analogy isnt hitting the mud because its spread throughout the water. Where does the force that hits the helmet go? Diffusing impact with padding reduces pain but it doesnt reduce the force at all unless its diffusing it to another place. If it were to absorb it instead of diffusing it than force reduction would leave the padding damaged like a cars crumple zone.     
      
When I try rlto find information about the how I just find a lot of things stating that it works because it works. Thw company compares it to an airbag but airbags work as a single deployment for a reason and dont really stop concussions as much as other worse issues. They say it can reduce force by 10 or even 20% without saying how that number was reached. With slower weaker impacts from highscoolers etc they say it can reduce up to 33%. No explanation how or why a slower impact would be easier to reduce. It should have less force inherently but why do cushions work better on that?     
      
The reason this concerns me is because spreading the force out DOES reduce pain. And that allowes harder hits. Part of the reason that the nfl has so many concussions is because helmets allow players to use their head and play through head contact that they would have to find a way to avoid without them. In boxing theres been some data supporting an increase in damage when headgear is used for this reason (and possibly peripheral vision being affected). Its also commonly stated (hard to prove) as a reason why rugby doesnt have these problems.     
      
That said if theres a 50 % reduction in concussions among those using it than those numbers are really exciting. Id really like to know if that numbers near equally distributed among teams or positions using them and how the control and experiment group vary.

It might be in different ways but some part of the area is stillt aking the force and being impacted by it. Unless these helmets are being damaged and reolaced than I dont see how spreading the force out to the same skull is going to significantly reduce concussions.
