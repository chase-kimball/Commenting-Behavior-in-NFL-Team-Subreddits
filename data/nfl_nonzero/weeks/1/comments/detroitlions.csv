6579,38374,38374,ChefCurrySauce,"I think calling negativity “fair weather” is part of the problem.

I’m not as old as some users here, only 25, but I’ve been following this team religiously since I was like 13. While I do get optimistic and hopeful, I’m so jaded it’s crazy. My mentality is “prove it” and I’m surprised that most fans don’t follow suit.

I’m not sure what it is about this sub (and certain fan podcasts), but most seem to start with the presupposition that everything the lions do is objectively correct and frame their narratives/arguments around that base. The glass is always half full to these people - criticism, no matter how warranted, is often harshly dismissed. You literally have a mod here that uses the words “slander” and “libel” every time someone criticizes a player or a coach on the team. Fuck, I saw a comment 
 yesterday where someone said “we needed to win week 1” and someone got upvoted replying “we didn’t *need* to win” lol. Even a loss, to these people, is all a part of the plan.

Point being, I’d like *tangible* and *sustained* positive results before I’m ready to anoint anyone. Dan Campbell, who I LOVE by the way, has not had one shred of success in this league yet. Brad Holmes, for his hits in the draft so far, has made several mistakes that I think have bitten us already (Onwuzurike, the receivers last year, etc). Why can’t we objectively analyze their moves and results on a case by case basis? Why is it all or nothing?

It's week one, so I'm not going to pound my chest and predict glory just yet, but that's impressive. 

It's going to take a healthy O-line, healthy Swift, and healthy receivers to keep it up. That's the big X factor; our depth at key positions remains thin.

Cousins had all day in the pocket to throw. Gotta look at things like pressures, how tight the coverage is, etc. The Eagles really impressed me. There were so many moments where I went, ""damn, well, wtf was the defense supposed to do there?"" especially with Hurts making plays on his own. Granted there were plenty of, ""wtf are you doing?"" and ""c'mon man!"" moments for the Lions on offense, too, but like I said that can be ironed out. 

Our defense was just tasked with a very difficult duty to a team that's kind of tailor made to exploit its biggest weakness (line backers). It's going to take a team with elite line backer play to stop the Eagles from scoring more than 24 points per game this season. From what I see of them they have the most prolific offense in the conference if they stay healthy.

Philly was mixing it up in ways that make me feel like they're going to be the #1 or #2 seed in the NFC if they can keep it up and stay healthy.

The big thing is I feel like the Lions have easily the best pass rush in the north from what I've seen so far, and that's going to be huge. Cousins had some really clean pockets against GB and it's not like they have a world-beating O-line in Minnesota. Lions were getting great pressure today despite Philly's really good O-line; it's just that Hurts was out there looking like Lamar. He's going to be a scary mother fucker.

If the Packers defense can get it together, who knows, but today was ugly. They let Jefferson get wide open a stupid number of times, and couldn't get consistent pressure at all.

That's what happens when a good defense keeps a QB under constant pressure and there aren't a lot of offensive options to spread it around. McVay should've been mixing things up and trying to push back up front to try to force the Bills to stop using the deep safeties, but instead he ran 11 personnel all game and kept going up the middle for nothing when he did run the ball.

Yes, he has developed a great system of offense but he has been average to crap at actually calling plays in big situations against better-coached teams who game plan against him well. Once the NFL caught onto him he needed an on-field veteran leader who was better at calling audibles and understanding on-field defensive disguises in order to bail him out. What annoys me is that the response was to blame Goff for not being able to do that rather than criticize McVay for being too rigid and green when it comes to changing things up.

38892,235006,235006,blue_shadow_,"You:re trolling. PRs have *always* been a subjective look at what each writer or group of writers views as a *general* look at who is better or worse than any other given team, not necessarily a pure look at who actually won H2H. This us how the entire sports world has *always* viewed PRs.

However, even though I *know* you're trolling, I'll give you the answer I gave in advance last week to the Lions' subreddit.

I started off my own rankings with how each team finished the regular season last year, by win%, including league-wide tiebreakers. From there, I read offseason reviews and tried to take in as much about the league as I could in the few days between the day I found out about getting onto the PR team and the day the Week 0 rankings were due. In that time, I made judgment calls on how far each team slid up or down the order.

For the rest of this season, I'm bringing an ELO-style approach to the rankings, where teams have to *earn* their moves up and down the order. I've developed my own tool for ranking which will partially kick in after Wk 3 and fully kick in after Wk 4. It will be, on purpose, a bit harder to move up or down the order, because it will emphasize trends that are much longer than simply one week's worth of overreaction.

In the meantime, since posting my inputs for Week 0, I've learned more about the rest of the league, and I focused in on some key teams where I varied wildly from the rest of the crew. My goal was to balance all that and  *not* overreact by assuming a bad game means a bad season.

I also said in my initial post to the sub that my own Week 0 ranks were *not* how I thought the end of the season would look. That's going to play out over time.

So, there's a lot that goes into the rankings, for me at least, but to treat them as purely reactive based on a first week of play that is *historically* known for being an unreliable predictor of success - yeah, fuck that.

But again. You think we're wrong (and, by the way, you think that the *entire sports world's view of rankings ia wrong.*) Prove it. Put up your own rankings, in a separate post, and defend them like we are.

Jackson came up from Practice Squad to the 53 man for Sunday's game, replacing Levi Onwuzurike who went on IR (4 weeks.) However, the reason for the delay in signing him to the 53-man has to do with vesting rules for veterans. This was planned 4 days ago, nothing to do with Swift not being at practice today.

From Pride of Detroit:

>It’s likely because of the NFL’s Week 1 vested veteran rule. One of the benefits that comes with being a vested veteran is that if you are on an NFL active roster for Week 1, your salary becomes fully guaranteed. But there is also a downside to this rule for veterans too.  
>  
>For a player like Jackson, whose status as RB4 leaves him a bit vulnerable to roster movement, the Lions likely didn’t want to keep him on the initial 53-man roster for Week 1, thus guaranteeing his salary. So instead, the Lions and Jackson jumped through some hoops, taking a different path to get him back on the roster.  
>  
>Now that Jackson is on the roster, his primary responsibilities will include his special teams play. In Week 1, the Lions only deployed two running backs—D’Andre Swift and Jamaal Williams—meaning Jackson was two players away from seeing the field, as Craig Reynolds remains RB3. But, Jackson was the teams starting kick returner, where he saw seven of his 20 special teams snaps.

39804,238886,238886,boerumhill,"Point of information:

There are two types of restructuring:

A simple restructure converts payments into prorated signing bonuses within the confines of the remainder of the contract. Teams typically have the ability to unilaterally execute simple restructures without any action necessary from the player.

A maximum restructure increases the amount of cap space via conversion into prorated signing bonuses by either extending the contract or by adding void years to a contract, years that do not extend the contract but are only used as placeholders for the proration. Maximum restructures are typically considered a renegotiation of the contract that requires the player's consent to execute.

Jared’s Rams deal is done after 2024.

Cut him, tag him, or renew him - those are the options. There really isn’t anything left to restructure.

He’s likely headed to phase two, the backup years, if he does not ball out this year. They’ll draft his replacement if he doesn’t play like 2017-2018 Goff.

Yeah, no they're not. You're not the first person this week to say this and all it took was a quick scroll through their posts and comments to find very little of what you're claiming. 

Sure, they've got their idiots like every fanbase, but I've checked their sub multiple times this week (I do it for every Lions opponent, I like to know what other teams and fans are saying) and have seen very little bashing on the Lions. Obviously they are confident that they can win, they were a playoff team that made massive improvements and we won 3 games, of course they think they should win. But playing victim here and saying they're being toxic and chalking it up as ""no chance we lose"" is just not true.
