I read up on their player grade metric's intended usage and its methodology from their website, which reminds me of a film-room version of what FO is trying to do with DVOA/DYAR. So if we're grading one of the plays from Mahomes where he throws a ~5yd TD to a wide open receiver in busted coverage, for example. The player grade aims to hypothetically put all other QBs in Mahomes' shoes for that play only and look at their reasonably expected outcomes. If 2/32 go incomplete and 30/32 make the same pass for a TD, then what Mahomes did is technically not anything special relative to other QBs. So despite being a positive result overall (obviously TDs are good), that one play would not get a positive grade due to it being an average-QB outcome and average outcomes == 0 on their scale of -2 to +2.


Despite not knowing all the granular quantitative details of the calculation itself, that methodology seems perfectly sound with their stated goal of the metric. 


In your opinion, in what ways do their grades not reflect their intended use (aka ""reality"")?",3.0,nfl,t3_xcjcx9,False,0.0,:Jaguars: Jaguars,2022-09-12T22:36:23Z,jaguars,0.0096138770759105
30174,208403,208403,ddscience,"I understand your point as you just stated it now, but the way your wrote it is just nonsensical. 

Which by the way, your argument doesn’t have any support behind it. While small amounts of data can make analyses meaningless, putting more data- let alone ALL data- isn’t always better for multiple reasons. 

In this context, you would be comparing average performance of QBs 15 years ago and weighting them the same as those in more recent years, which would skew results significantly due to changing trends in playcalling and QB utilization. So there’s a qualitative reason.

But more importantly, they’re making a mathematical model to predict future outcomes. Rule 1 of supervised/any modeling is to have split datasets- one for training and another for testing- so that you don’t overfit your estimates. Even if the game from a QBs perspective were exactly the same 15 years ago, just throwing the entirety of your data into a model literally wouldn’t work. 

I haven’t even touched on the fact that 5 years of PBP data is EXTREMELY sufficient. Conservatively we’re talking between **17000 and 19000 rows** of pure pass attempt PBP data each year, which is at least **85k records** for a 5-year period. I’m looking at it right now. Mathematically, at **85k records**, it doesn’t matter if your full population consists of 100,000,000 rows or 100,000. If you have some revolutionary whitepaper about how 85k records is an insufficient amount of records for a model of any kind then let me know because you deserve the upcoming fields medal.

On one of his TDs, he threw ~5yds to a wide open RB for a TD. He doesn't get a lot of ""points"" for that play, because when looking at data in that same scenario (red zone pass plays to a wide open receiver), on average, pretty much every QB with every level of talent (bad or good) makes that same throw with that same outcome.
