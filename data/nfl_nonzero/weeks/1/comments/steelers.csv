- [ ] Defense looked phenomenal. 5 turnovers and points on the board. Turnover city with a strong front and reliable secondary. 


- [ ] Lots of rotations on defense mitigating burnout and displaying depth. 


- [ ] Mitch has thrown well or at least better than expected. He’s making lemonade out of what lemons he’s given. 


- [ ] Offensive scheme seems more dynamic than last year. Excited to see what more is to come. 


Cons:


- [ ] Could not capitalize on turnovers. Offense was lackluster on all fronts. 


- [ ] Run game is non existent as Claypool was the biggest rusher on offense. Couldn’t get the run game going. Regardless of the reason, we had no answer to the problem except throw the ball. 


- [ ] Even with Higgens out, we have left Chase open all game. We’ll need adjustment when facing other top tier receivers. 


- [ ] Terrible time management at the end of the game. A whole Minute could have been shaved off the clock but we decided to throw the ball. 


- [ ] Offensive line. Only positive is very little penalties. Otherwise terrible.

16611,101000,101000,ItsYourBoyD,"Surprisingly, our pass blocking against Cinci wasn’t completely horrible and they have some studs that rush the passer as well. 

Not too confident in our running game, Naj is banged up, you guys have Godcheaux and Barmore inside, big meaty boys to clog the middle and we struggle to run in general, let alone outside of the tackles. 

I think for the most part our offensive line SHOULD match up fairly well. Mitch won’t have all day to throw or anything, but I’m definitely not expecting to give up 5+ sacks.

My concern is our WRs getting separation on your DBs, so we can extend drives and push the ball down the field. Seemed to do a pretty good job of defending deep against Miami, most plays I saw were receivers scoring/gaining yardage after the catch, like Tyreek underneath and the one Waddle TD.

The trenches will be the Xfactor Sunday for sure. Can you guys run effectively and protect Jones, especially without Watt in? And will we be able to give the titty kisser time in the pocket against Barmore, Judon and co.

I don’t think we have a Super Bowl team, because the offense isn’t complete. At best, we have a team similar to the Niners last year that COULD make a run solely based off our defense, winning ugly low scoring games.

If we do have playoff aspirations, 3-1 to start out is the worst we can afford. The stretch of: Buffalo, Tampa, Miami & Philly we’ll also need to steal at least a game. 

Our schedule down the stretch isn’t as bad, but 4 of the last 9 games are divisional games and they’re always tough.

Now seeing if it would’ve been overturned is questionable. The blind ref was literally staring down the line and called him out at the one. Unless there was a pylon cam or a clear shot, they maybe lose the challenge as there’s no “definitive evidence” and lose a timeout which is probably why they didn’t do it. 

If they do challenge and lose, and then we were still able to get a stop, we would have been able to run the clock down to essentially ~15 seconds with them having no timeouts and having to drive 70+ yards.

20670,140930,140930,Ooziez,"Good:

- Cam- Still one of the most underrated and he’s still here. Big players make big plays and 97 showed that today with the fumble recovery and sack. Great performance   

- Highsmith- whew he really came on today. His bend was spectacular, Pass rush lord strong and he perfected that Spin move. Him as a threat lined up with TJ elevates this pass rush to the next level. 

- Minkah / TJ- your stars make plays and that’s what they did and always do. 

- Pass rush- touched on it with highsmith but this pass rush is going to break their own record. Could be an absolutely lethal group that is only going to get better. 

- Boswell you sick motherfucker I love you!  

Man this whole defense… something special is brewing Pittsburgh, I tell ya. 

Bad:

- Short yard run game - You got your first round RB and can’t pick up 2 yards. This offense struggled mightily and this is a huge component to it. You HAVE to pick up those short yards, no way around it. 

- Third down conversions - again, offense fell short. Juju shined on this O because of these money downs. Who’s going to replace that? Today was a struggle and not extending those drives to help that spectacular defense is just a waste. 

- Offense - I am big on complimentary football. This offense just simply did not do the defense any favors. Defense put them in prime situations and we simply fell short. Canadas game was showing today: motions, trick plays, PA, it was all there we just have to execute. Those shovel passes simply did not work but we kept reverting back to them. Lots to clean up here but my main takeaway is that this defense is so good, offense just has to let them shine and help them out (sounds like the last few years, right?…). Top to bottom, this offense needs to fix an awful lot. Running out of excuses 

Pray to everything holy that TJ and Najee are okay. This offense needs A LOT of work- just flat, no Rhythm, identity, nothing. Even just the slightest, most average offense and this shit was done forever ago.

You are up (can't really remember when we started this idiotcy) but up. You are 3 and more than 10 with an oline that gives 3 seconds maybe. The bengals know that what the Steelers WANT to do is throw it deep, and really who gives a shit about short shit, so they push the defense back, put them on the first down marker and say ""I bet by the time your recievers get even close here, we're close to sacking you anyway"".  


Steelers are going  ""Alright, we're up, the last thing we want to do is give them the ball here, do not turn this ball over, do anything but that"", punt and live to see another down, get field position and use the defense that is literally kicking the shit out of the bengals right now"".
