Being called losers obviously hurts as first, but now everyone does it, everyday. So we make some changes. Our parents get us a new car for our birthday, but its a used Camry with a bad accident history. It isn't flashy, but our parents told us this should be a reliable option. Doesnt seem to really seem to help, though. The ridicule continues. So we decide to buy a couple new outfits. Only, no one told us that Beyblade isnt cool anymore, and that honestly, it never was, so that new t-shirt with Gingka on it isnt winning us any new fans. Despite telling ourselves that our new improvements in our life might help turn the tide in our favor, we're still that loser. We dont even make good enough grades to graduate and go off to be an engineer or some shit to return at some far off reunion where we can rub it in everyone's faces that we made it. Still that nobody. Still that kid who gets caught staring at the pretty girl we'll never actually talk to while we walk to our lonely corner of the cafeteria, until we run into one of the basketball players and drop our tray of food in front of everyone. They all point, they all laugh, they all call us a loser. But it no longer upsets us. We just accept that this is our lot in life. This is the card we were drawn. We always will be what we are.

*sigh*

Soon we'll think we're free of this hell. But then we get to start it over again after we graduate, because all that awaits us in our future is a job as a janitor at the very school that has consumed all of our happiness. Its all we're good for. Being the butt of the joke, and cleaning up shit. 20 years from now we'll sip our morning coffee at our small kitchen table in our 1-room bottom floor apartment and wonder what it was all for, and the answer will become abundantly clear.
