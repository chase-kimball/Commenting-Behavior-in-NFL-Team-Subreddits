If Sanders was good/trustworthy, he would be playing. But he’s not. No shade on him tho, he’s a third-round rookie, it’s totally fair not to expect him to play right away.

I got bad news on Simmons. He’s not out of position, he’s just not good. He looks out of position because he can’t play any position well. He was lost at ILB. He got spun by Juju trying to cover him 1-on-1 in the slot. Gave up a TD to Kelce. The chickens of his “positionlessness” are coming home to roost.

As for Zaven, he’s similarly just bad. Took a chance on a small-school guy after we missed out on all the top prospects and he’s getting exposed against the first good players he’s played. Can’t get off blocks. Doesn’t plug his gap. Gets caught in the pile frequently allowing cutbacks or getting himself walled off.

I get the frustration with the coaching, but ultimately you need enough talent and this is one of the least talented defenses we’ve ever seen in Arizona.

* Some of this is just performance.  We (Cardinals) were hyped going into the game however after that first half we saw the writing on the wall
* Someone said it right: ""Its worse with good teams since the bandwagon is real, especially ones that have been good for awhile.""  This is true also with our fanbase as well....the bandwagon is real when it comes to Valley sports.
* No established football culture.  Cardinals is a fairly new team with not a lot of history in the Valley.  Mix that with not a big winning culture and you have what you have.
* We are more alive during teams we know...or should beat lol.  Texans was fun.  Seahawks games are always fun as well.  Rams games are okay but those fans are getting too obnoxious now.
* I also said it before...the Cardinals doesn't have a cool chant or anything to hype anyone up.  Chiefs has the tomahawk thing and even the National Anthem thing.  We have a CGI bird to protect the nest.
* To sum it up Cardinals fans are great often times a little passive yes...but even more so when we just don't show up.  Not a lot of confidence going into the Chiefs game may have sucked the energy out...then seeing that performance...yeah that's hard.  As I said many times though there is NO reason why opposing fans can sit in the home side and feel confident enough to be obnoxious though.

As for what’s best. They say there’s no bad seat in the house however there’s disadvantages. I think direct endzone seats suck. You can’t see any plays past the 50 yard line and the angle stinks. So slight angle is better. The upper bowl only the bottom 5 rows are good. These seats are great to see things develop however doesn’t matter if you are on the home side there’s a ton of opposing fans. 

October means roof might be open (usually November though) and I think the Cardinals purposefully planned this but that sun is HOT and hits section 437 and the sections below it from the 10-50 yard line on the visitors side.
