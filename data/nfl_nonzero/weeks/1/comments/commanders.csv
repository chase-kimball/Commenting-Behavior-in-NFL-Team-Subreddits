* Rivera is both a better coach than Gruden, and has assembled a better/less problematic FO than Bruce. Putting them in the same tier is silly.
* It's annoying to see former staff go and be great elsewhere, but it's revisionist history to act like we've just ushered droves of HC-ready geniuses out the door. Fact of the matter is, these guys became who they are over time, almost always with extremely important experience and seasoning between leaving Washington and getting their HC opportunity.
   * In the Mike Shanahan era, Lafleur was a QB coach and McVay was a TE coach. As the OC, Kyle Shanahan was the closest to being ready, but were coming off of a disastrous stretch with that regime: 4 seasons, only 1 of which was at or over .500, an easily-avoidable career-ruining injury for our ostensible franchise QB, and a subsequent 3-13 record. None of those guys had demonstrated the capacity that they have now.
   * In the Gruden era, McVay saw success as OC, but when McVay got poached, Gruden had just given us two straight seasons over .500 for the first time since '96+'97 and capped it off with a playoff appearance. There was no possible justification for canning him for his own OC.
   * I dunno if you count KOC and McDaniel as ""best coaches in the league,"" but you shouldn't - they're WAY too fresh to make any sort of judgment on them yet. Even still, McDaniel was the WR coach under Shanahan and KOC was the QB coach under Gruden, then interim OC for less than a full season. He looked decent, but again, no reason to believe he was HC-ready when he left.

Sure, it's frustrating that we just barely missed the bus on these guys, but we can only see that in hindsight. Honestly, the more frustrating thing is the circlejerk surrounding it, because of how often people obfuscate the facts to better feed into the ""DAE Washington dumb and bad!"" memes.

...That said, I'm worried about what happens with Turner going forward. he's showing a lot of promise right now, and he's the first of these guys that actually kind of matches up with our timeline. Ideal scenario is that Ron gets elevated to the FO at some point and Turner slides in as HC a la Arians/Bowles.
