>It's legal to look at your receiver during a spike.

""a passer, after delaying his passing action for strategic purposes, is prohibited from throwing the ball to the ground in front of him""

My interpretation of the rule is that a spike has to be immediate with zero other action. By looking at Cooper, you could argue he was thinking of throwing to him if the defence wasn't ready. The slight pause could thus be argued a strategic advantage, as he only decides to spike it after realizing Cooper wasn't running a route. Burns reaction also goes perfectly with this, as he only rushes once he notices Brissett look over at Cooper, which disqualifies the ability to spike it.

It's would've been a ticky tack penalty, and I'm not going to lose sleep over a week 1 call, I just thought the interpretation of the rule was incorrect.

>**RE: Did you consider going for the end zone on offensive drive that scored field goal at end of the game?**
> 
> We did not want to give the ball back to them. The first snap, obviously, putting the ball on the ground, might have changed us a little bit. We wanted to put the ball in McCaffrey's hands and take the game out of Garrett's hands. **The third one was the same RPO that we hit DJ [Moore] so our hope was that if they brought pressure we could hit DJ one on one and win the game with a touchdown.** We went with the play that got us there. The thing about RPOs is sometimes it looks like you are just running the ball but sometimes you are explosive down the field. **We knew that they had no timeouts so we felt like they would not be able to go the length of the field, go however many yards, 44, 45 yards in that amount of time without a timeout. The only thing that would allow them to do that would be a penalty, an unsportsmanlike conduct, those 15-yards and the clock stopping is what allowed them to kick the field goal.**

Sure looked like the same play to me. On the 2nd one, DJ was covered and Baker made the correct decision to hand it off.
