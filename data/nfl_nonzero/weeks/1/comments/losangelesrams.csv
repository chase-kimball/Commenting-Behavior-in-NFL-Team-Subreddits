Didn't even play QB and I can see how open Allen is from the start of that first play. Yes, he was running either a go or post route, and normally the ball will be thrown later but the CB is 7 plus yards back, and the first step is backward. Allen should have been the first read for the play, and the second the CB steps backward the ball is released to Allen for only a 3-yard catch, but it is also another yard or two after the CB finally reacts and comes down. So a very easy 4-5 yards on the play if not more if the CB misses. Not sure about the down and distance but Josh did the same thing all night taking to quick short pass for 2-3 yards and letting the player get another 1-2 yards after the catch.  

Some of the ""opens"" as you said though, Allen really isn't open and covered by the zone. In some cases, he turns into the zone coverage and covers himself.
