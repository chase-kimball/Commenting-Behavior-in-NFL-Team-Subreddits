Lance played in a more prof style offense. He was asked to do more. For example he called his own protections. He's also a bigger body more suited to running. Fields is faster but Lance is supposed to be a better runner and can do things like QB power. The biggest thing though is Lance was far a finished product as both fields and Jones. That may seem like a negative but they viewed it as a positive. Fields has been going to the best QB training camps since high school he was a freshman in college. He's had a lot more help training to get to where he is as far as throwing mechanis, playing qb etc and he still wasn't to far ahead of Lance. Lance wasn't taught to throw by a good QB coach until he started college.  In one year he grew a tremendous amount. Learned how to throw and be a top QB prospects and it still was only North Dakota state. So Kyle's thinking is this guy isn't nowhere near what he can be, he hasn't developed any bad habits yet and the speed that he's learning is tremendous.

Faithful  


This post is just gibberish from either a pessimistic ""fan"" or a racist one. Trey has not shown anything that he is a bust or a backup. He has shown he can run a little so that makes him instantly like Kaep? Come on now...Trey has a much better arm talent and more touch and he keeps his eyes up instead of looking to run. He does not compare anyway to Kaep.

But do you know who else James isn’t, he isn’t Joe Montana, he isn’t Steve Young…hell he’s not even John Brodie. 

But we know what he is. And yes we’re in a Super Bowl “window”…but I’d much rather see what we have in Trey, who if he’s as good as we hope, will keep our window open all by himself, than hope Jimmy figures out how to not get hurt/throw outside the numbers or deep. 

This was a bad game in shitty weather, with a lot of sloppy/ticky tack penalties. It’s far, far too soon to pronounce Trey a bust and go back to just good enough to get you beat Jimmy.",0.0,49ers,t3_xbsbku,False,0.0,:pixelmontana: Joe Montana,2022-09-11T16:25:44Z,49ers,0.0556134923696845
