Piniero was money on reasonable FGs, but didn't have the leg for the long ones.

All we need to do is look at Amendola back when we had him. 70 yard fg instagram hype videos? COOL. In game, shanking them so bad that if they added two more FG poles on either side, he still would have missed many of them.

Bring back Piniero, if you are banking on 50+ yarders all the time, your offense needs to do much better. I'd rather have the consistency on ""gimmie"" FGs than have to rely some deep ass attempts. Either punt or go for it, and the offense needs to do a better job in getting favorable yardage anyway.
