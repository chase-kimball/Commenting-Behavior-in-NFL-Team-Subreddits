173,1787,1787,03Jinx03,That why I’m saying they should more or less be closer than that far apart. Mac also had some other plays that almost got picked. Brandon Jones got both hands on one on an out route and Javon might’ve had another if Riley wouldn’t have taken it off his butt. Mac also missed a few easy completions by a pretty wide margin.

175,1790,1790,03Jinx03,If Tua stinks it up as I said in the above comment then they’d play Skylar Thompson. Again there is no benefit of playing Teddy if Tua stinks unless we are within grasp of playoffs which would presumably not be the case if Tua is sucking. The only way Teddy plays is if we are in the playoff hunt and Tua gets injured. It is way more beneficial to give the promising rookie a look if the verdict is Tua is not the franchise guy. So it is only reasonable to see Teddy if Tua does get injured but we won’t see Teddy based off poor production.,4.0,nfl,t3_xe6gq9,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-09-14T13:55:28Z,miamidolphins,-0.115410976

Our skill players are unreal, even the depth just makes something out of nothing. TEs are the only question mark.

Line had a tough task against NE but pass pro was very shaky at times. Scary part was everyone was a little responsible. Heal fast AJ

Defensive front seems exactly like they were last year which is good. Ingram is a great pickup, still a playmaker. We lost the edge a little too much in the run game, NE still has a good OL. Backers seemed fine, a few missed tackles here and there. Great pursuit. Wish Phillips put a little more pressure on Wynn today.

Shout out the the whole secondary even Needham. Dude runs like a 4.7 or some shit and wasn’t a huge liability considering they tried to target him a bunch. Kohou, Bethel, Crossen and mother fucking BRANDON JONES showing they are those dudes. Fuck Flores lol

Special teams was great, everyone in all phases.

Loved the playcalling by McDaniel, should he have run the ball in the 2nd half a bit more? Maybe but that NE front is stingey and we were not exactly creating a lot of push inside.

Ravens looked great today but it’s the Jetes so we’ll see who’s really improved since our last matchup.
