If you are trying to have better stamina for a boxing match, the best way to achieve that adaptation would be to put that demand on your body. Distance running is an entirely different demand.

Running and boxing are two different sports, one will not condition you for the other. I have trained martial arts for most of life, and I can at least say anecdotally that I know several great fighters who probably can’t run more than a mile or two, and I’ve seen several distance runners come into the gym and be completely gassed out by the end of it. The two are just not closely related.
