The play call is a read option though. The premise of the play is you leave a player unblocked, usually the DE which was the case here as well, and read what they do. If they crash down the line, the read is to give to the RB and let them go outside one on one with the backer the is pursuing. If the DE stays home, it’s a keep and the middle will be more open. Hines misread the play and kept even though the unblocked DE crashed down the line.
