An easy way to think about it is 325 yds, 3 tds, and 0 ints would be a slightly above average game for a QB, but if you do that 17 times you get 5,525 yds, 51 tds, and 0 ints which would be the best QB season of all time.",12.0,nfl,t3_xe5qv2,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2022-09-14T14:29:18Z,eagles,0.2822

Matthew Stafford arm punts the ball to Jaquiski Tart in the NFC championship game last year who drops it, but Stafford still committed an error that should have resulted in a turnover which should deservedly impact his grade. On the flipside, Allen in the opener this week hits his receiver in the hands who drops it and basically shovels the ball to a Rams defender, a far less egregious error but on the statsheet Allen gets a pick and Stafford doesn't. This is actually why last when Mahomes was going through his stretch in the early middle of the season where he had all those picks his PFF grade wasn't affected much, because he was actually committing less turnover worthy plays than he had been previously and was just getting unlucky.

Run defense.. ugly. Expected better. Goff didn’t look good though.

Offense: please never run a WR screen ever again. It never works. It got blown up bad today, even worse when (IIRC Brown) went lateral inside to come back to the ball
