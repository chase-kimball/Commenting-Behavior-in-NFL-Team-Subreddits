Plus, with the gambling and Amazon dollars coming in, the salary cap will increase $15 - 20 million per year, so the $50 million per year number for QB's in 2022 will equate to $60 million in just 2 years.

For example, option runs are a way of addressing it, but options are pretty predictable when your choices are a QB as fast and dangerous as Lamar or a 30 year old RB who's averaged 440 yards and 3.9 YPC in the last four years. Just assume Lamar, and your edge defenders are fast enough to cover Devonta Freeman on the pitch. By the time we started trying things to beat it that actually worked, it was too late; [""If the Ravens made some of these adjustments earlier, and did it maybe the second quarter instead of the final five minutes of the fourth quarter, then we might've had a very different ballgame on our hands here.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxKL678g5WE&t=1015s)

Now you can argue this one of two ways: Some will say that Greg gets a pass here because what are you supposed to do with an offensive line on its second-string LT, third-string LG, and third-string RT, with two decrepit RBs, a banged-up Sammy Watkins playing as badly as he's hurt, and a 5'3"" WR who flinches at the first sign of contact? Others will say that you knew you were going into that game with that roster, so it's literally his job to know those answers going into the game, especially since cover 0 isn't some new concept and there were clearly things that the Ravens could do that *did* work by the end of the game.
