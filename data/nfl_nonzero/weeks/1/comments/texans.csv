Patriots were #1 and #2 and now they have neither, so it'll be interesting to see if they keep young fans now that they've hit leaner times. Packers are #1 and #2 as well, though they haven't won as much as the Patriots and Rodgers isn't on the same level of stardom as Brady.

Yankees hold onto fans because they're globally known, so they're always at least going to fit #3. Already mentioned the Dodgers. Red Sox are one of the winningest teams in the MLB and have a storied history, so they get a little #1 and #3.

Bulls are still hanging on to Jordan magic to fit into #3 as well. 

Kids (and adults who never outgrew the bandwagon phase) pretty much all stick to that, unless there are external forces pushing them to another team, like a parent's fandom or history with a particular team. E.g., I grew up going to Oilers games, so I grew up an Oilers fan. When they left, my fandom didn't really follow them to Tennessee (not many Oilers fans did) and I kind of just watched football neutrally and bitterly until the Texans came to town. Been miserable ever since lol

If a kid roots for a team long enough to actually get attached to them, they usually end up a fan of that team. If they're only passively interested in the sport, you might get a fair-weather fan. If they keep bouncing around teams and never really get attached to one, you end up with a bandwagoner.
