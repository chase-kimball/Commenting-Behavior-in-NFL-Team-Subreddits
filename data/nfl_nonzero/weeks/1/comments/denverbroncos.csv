- Hackett—who maybe needed a punch in the face type game

- What if Geno had taken that sack?  
- What if the RBs had entered the endzone at least once?
- What if Saubert catches that ball?
- What if Tomlinson's shoe was one size smaller?
- What if the ball didn't slip out of Wilson's hand?
- What if McManus hits the FG?
- What if we went for the 4th & 5?
- What if we didn't have 12 penalties?

That said, there were a lot of positives in that game:  

- Wilson is the guy, as expected  
- Jeudy and Sutton will have a good year
- The TEs came to play
- The offense was finally moving the chains with ease
- Defense was bad at start, but they showed they can make adjustments
