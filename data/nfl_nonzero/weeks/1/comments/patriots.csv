On Patricia:

Answer: Bill Belichick 

Logic: 
-Matt Patricia play calling.
-Rookie Quarterback with Joe Judge and Matt Patricia which neither has had historical success w/o Belichik and neither are QB coaches (Joe judge is a special teams coordiantor and not technically a QB coach per their commentary). 
- Despite Belichick saying all goes through him, he needs reliability and that didn't show yesterday against a 1st year coach (Miami coach).
-Miami offense looked great and do did the defense. 
-Bad that Matt Patricia is both Offensive coordinator and offensive line coach 
- One commentator challenges the others to name one team that ever had someone share roles of offensive coordinator and OL coach and neither could, and that they're separate roles and Patriots are ""saving a dollar.""
- One commentator trying to be positive stated at least Patricia was an assistant coach for OL line in the past, they never win against Miami in Miami early season, and historically the team always improves with time. 

My personal commentary: 
- Miami offense was ok. 7 points was a 6 pick, not many teams have a Tyreek Hill (Yes you, Steelers), and Waddle pass was a fluke secondary missed tackle opportunity (not to mention the missed PI call on first series of the game). 

- Pats defense only allowing 13 points was not bad, with two red zone field goals each attempt due to stopping the TD.

By all accounts Steelers should have lost that game. 5 turnovers and offensively only scoring 13 points in regular time (I guess only 4 would count due to pick six).

They're a solid team, but with Harris out and TJ Watt most likely injured, their offense is significantly weak. 

I look at the Dolphins game where the Pat's defense allowed 13 points. Sorry, but the Steelers do not have Tyreek Hill-caliber player. And Miami's Waddle TD was the weirdest defensive blunder I've seen in a long time.

Next week will be a defensive week. Our run defense wasn't bad at all. I think the game will be much closer than people think, and I won't be surprised if Pat's pull it off so long as Mac doesn't sit.
