Easy; ALS is near the top if not the top of that list. Is it causing 50% of hip spasms? Not even remotely. But it may cause 10%, and then every other possible cause is less than that because there are so many different diagnoses. 

2.	Of our most common causes, which do we have the most information about? Which will generate more clicks? Which is most likely to keep people on the site?

You may ask why “which cause is most probable in this specific person” is not one of the questions. They don’t have ANY information that could help them diagnose an individual like that. Medical history, bloodwork, environmental factors… even if they operated with the best of intentions they have no shot to diagnose you unless you have something EXTREMELY common or incredibly unique in symptoms.

Many unpolished QB prospects have problems with accuracy, rushing throws, or taking too many sacks, but those issues weren't what were considered flaws in Mahomes's game.  There were technical issues with bad footwork and not working to step up in the pocket, and aggressive decision making leading to turnovers.

He’s a good QB that thinks he’s Patrick Mahomes. That’s why he takes so many bad sacks, plays so much hero ball, and has such inconsistent play throughout the season. He thinks he’s on the Mahomes/Rodgers level and tries to play like them but he’s just not at that level.

They were a team that was expected to be good but not Super Bowl good last year. Had a miraculous somewhat flukey run to the Super Bowl ending in heartbreak. Now expectations are heavy on them to be in the same class as KC and Bills.

Now they play a 1st place schedule. I don’t think they win their division because of that. Ravens were wiped out by injuries last year, a Tomlin coached team will never be awful, and the browns are capable of putting together good games. The North is no cake walk.
