4772,48799,48799,DoABarrowRoll,"Hard question, honestly. Most of my answer is just randomly word vomiting.

I think we look fine right now, but the next 2-3 years will be really telling. Sounds like a cop out, but I do truly believe that. Things will change a lot when even more of the Gettleman era players are phased out. You have guys like Shepard and Martinez who took massive paycuts to stick around, guys like Kenny Golladay, Adoree' Jackson, and Leonard Williams who are good players, but at numbers you may not be happy with (personally I'm fine with Adoree's number but that's just me). 

Rosters turn over fast, and it's been the Giants' MO to just go out and purchase talent to fill those holes. Imagine what this roster looks like without all of those guys. That's kind of how I see the team moving forward and comparing to other rebuilding franchises. It's kind of unfair to compare the Giants' roster to teams like the Lions and Falcons where when you think of those teams, you're thinking of almost exclusively players that they've chosen to retain through their rebuild that they drafted or developed (with a few exceptions; the QBs for both teams, Michael Brockers and Big V for Detroit, but those guys don't match up in quality to those Giants players).

I think I am fine with how the Giants have chosen to really start their rebuild, though. They've chosen to invest primarily on the offensive side of the ball, which I think is right. The defense might be a problem but they will need to continue to invest there over time; you only have so much capital to fix a team with one of the worst records in the league over the last few years.

I would say true All-Pro players, you're looking at Andrew Thomas, Xavier McKinney, Evan Neal, and Kayvon Thibodeaux, really. I'm hard pressed to find other players I feel that confident about being that upper echelon of player. And I feel bad putting Neal and Thibodeaux in that group too, honestly. But I'll settle for guys who are just impact players, even if they're not necessarily all pros. If a guy is going to perform the way that say Adoree' Jackson performed for us in 2021, that's a win, aside from the players I listed above, I think.

So I'd add in Kadarius Toney (assuming he can stay healthy) and Azeez Ojulari (it appears I'm higher on him than many others; I don't think he's going to be a superstar necessarily but if he could be say Yannick Ngakoue, I think we're very happy about that). Also Leonard Williams, Dexter Lawrence, and Adoree' Jackson in that ""these guys are good starters"" category, but how long they'll be around is a question mark.

I don't think we're fucked or anything, but it's also far from a guarantee. I probably will feel more comfortable answering a question like this once we see how this season plays out, how these players perform in their new schemes, etc.",3.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-09T11:31:03Z,nygiants,0.0374063115637207

4779,48806,48806,DoABarrowRoll,"That is my expectation, yeah. Jones' option was declined, so he's a free agent after this year. They'll only keep him if he really plays well this year, which most of us do not really expect.

Barkley, it's a little bit greyer just because there's still the possibility he plays really well this year and the Giants have a lot of cap space for 2023, but based on Schoen's comments and how Buffalo did things and stuff like that, I'm expecting Saquon to walk too. Plus I'm not sure he's going to be able to stay healthy or play at a top of the league level if he does stay healthy.

No, we don't know if that will work out, but we never know if it will work out. We didn't know when Buffalo drafted Allen or Baltimore drafted Lamar or the Chiefs drafted Mahomes. But it's an important step for any team trying to get back to winning games and trying to make playoff runs; finding a QB that will be able to take you there and win you the games. It's the most important position on the field for a reason, and (almost) every great team has it figured out there. We think we have the GM and HC figured out, they need a QB to be aligned with as well, and that's the main foundation for any team.

Really, the Giants have been falling off since after the last Super Bowl win. They picked 32nd after that obviously, then 19th, then 14th, then have picked in the top 11 for 7 of the last 8 years (the only exception being McAdoo's playoff year, where the defense was absolutely incredible and his offense was ""just throw it to Odell""). 

The Giants absolutely could not land a hit in the draft after the 2nd round, and it really depleted the depth on the team, which trickled into the starters because we had more holes than we could fill. Then they turned to free agency to help and that only really made things worse.

But that's why we needed a guy like Schoen to replace Gettleman. He's not just a scout, he understands the whole process of roster building and evaluating the process and all that. Gettleman was just like ""I know football, I will pick good football players"" but he never adapted to the way the league works now compared to when he got his start in the 80s and 90s. He thought the Giants' failures were just not being right, and not the rubric they used to figure out if they were right or not.

4780,48807,48807,DoABarrowRoll,"There's a few pieces to it for me:

1. They'd be wasting the year with any of the alternatives. Who could they have signed that would have made the year a waste? Wasting the year is a feature, not a bug.
2. It was kind of circumstances with him; to some degree, he *is* the vet transition QB for this year. As bad as we think he is, he's at least started a bunch of games in the NFL and been not a complete dumpster fire for some period of time. And his contract for the year was already guaranteed, because he was an early draft pick.
3. They also did sign a vet transition QB, that's what Tyrod Taylor is; his contract makes a lot of us feel like he's going to be the bridge QB next year while whatever rookie they target gets ready to play.
4. Schoen knew taking this job it was going to be rough and it was going to take some time. Taking a move like letting Jones finish his contract (and not picking up the 5th year option) and spinning it into anything more than ""holding down the fort until we can really fix this thing"" is a mistake, in my opinion. Everything about the QB position for the Giants is about waiting to see what they'll do next.",4.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-04T07:21:49Z,nygiants,0.0001330278256527
4781,48808,48808,DoABarrowRoll,"I think Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll are well aware this is much much closer to a ""blow it up"" situation than a win-now situation. Yeah, they're sticking with Jones for this year, but it's less about their true confidence in him and more about the lack of alternative options; the draft class was viewed very negatively around the league, as evidenced by how late most of them were picked, and they were never in on the win now QB options like Wilson and Watson. They signed Taylor to a deal that has a much higher cap hit in year 2, and is mostly guaranteed; he's going to be back with the Giants in 2023. He's their security blanket/bridge QB for 2023. They're prepared for this to be the rebuilding year. Cap is much clearer for 2023, they can move off of most if not all of their big contracts after this year if they so chose.

They know what they signed up for, and Schoen in particular has been really clear that he knows what he was brought in to do, and that's reset the organization and bring them into the modern era.

The goal is always to win games, but they know they have to make tough decisions with the salary cap (like cutting James Bradberry) and that it's not going to be easy or a quick fix, they want to do this right. The 2022 season isn't going to be the ""excuse to rebuild"", it's the first season of the rebuild. 5 picks in the top 100 in the 2022 draft, a bunch of cap clearing measures and dead money eating. They're already in the thick of their rebuild, they're just going to *finish* the rebuild with the QB question instead of *starting* the rebuild with the QB question like many other teams have.

If you think this team is an 8-9 team this year, that's way more positive than a lot of us feel about it, even. More positive than me, at the very least. I tend to believe that Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll are here to make this team great in the end, I don't think they'd hesitate to be aggressive in acquiring a new QB if they're not really wowed by Jones.

Remember, when Sean McDermott first was hired by the Bills, Tyrod Taylor took them to the playoffs with a 9-7 record. After that season, Doug Whaley was fired and Brandon Beane was hired, bringing Joe Schoen with him, and they replaced Rick Dennison with Brian Daboll. They then went on to trade away Cordy Glenn, who at the time was their LT (who missed most of the 2017 season) and 2 2nd round picks (with some auxiliary pieces mixed in as well) in two trades to move up from 22 or so to 7 and pick Josh Allen.

They're going to get *their* guy at QB at some point. Whether that's Jones miraculously putting it together this year (which I doubt, to be clear), or a draft pick, they're going to get their bite at that apple.",3.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-03T18:51:25Z,nygiants,0.0013498629922756
4782,48809,48809,DoABarrowRoll,"I mean, if you want to play that game, we got away with one against the Saints, between the one play TD drives that were incredibly rare for the Giants last year, to the holding penalty that took a TD off the board for them, to being down 21-10 with 12 minutes left, to winning the OT coin toss. It took a Quincy Roche strip sack to seal the Raiders game, and Nick Sirianni remembering that running the ball can be good could have cost us the game against the Eagles, putting us at 1-10 instead of 4-7. If things were different, they'd be different.

I think this team is horrible because every year we gas ourselves up only to have one of the worst records if not the absolute worst record in the NFL over the last 5 years, and you are what your record says you are. The Giants trailed in 16 of their 17 games last year. Bad teams find ways to lose games. That's us. We have to take our lumps and earn our respect back.

4785,48812,48812,DoABarrowRoll,"Honestly, I don't think it's complicated. I've watched and rewatched every snap Jones has taken since his last year at Duke and every time I've come to the same conclusions.

First off: I agree he's hard-working and everything like that. But that makes me ask another question: how hard can you work, how good of a teammate can you be, how perfect can you be off the field, but still not produce on it? Why is the guy who everyone says does everything he can, everything possible, to be good, still not good?

I get it, he's had bad teammates and bad coaches and everything like that, but other guys in bad situations show us more. Justin Herbert's OL in his rookie year was horrific too, he still won games for his team and gave us much more consistent highs. Joe Burrow pre-injury in his rookie year, without Chase, showed us more. And both of those guys had way fewer lows than Jones had his rookie year when his highs were on tape. When people talk about Jones' great stuff, it's almost always just him lobbing the ball deep and his receiver coming down with it. It isn't him creating space to pass with his legs, it isn't him throwing a laser through a tight window.

It all comes down to the very simple and kind of cliche answer for me, off of all of his film over the past 4 years: he just doesn't see the game that well. He doesn't have that natural instinct that the great QBs have. He doesn't see the field well, he doesn't process the game well. He's a ""see it, throw it"" guy.

It's like in school when you have the super naturally smart kid who never really has to try that hard but still gets great grades who, if they chose to actually apply themselves, could do amazing things, compared to the kid who has to work super hard, study for hours every day, and go to office hours so he doesn't fail the class.

In the first category, you have guys like Mahomes and Allen and Brady and all the really good QBs in this league. They understand how the game flows, they understand how to see space on the field, throw to open grass, manipulate coverages. They know how to feel pressure and either escape the pocket (which Jones is capable of but very rarely chooses to do) or hit their checkdown/hot reads in record time. They just *get it*.

In the second category, you have guys like Jones. At some point, it doesn't matter how much you study if you just don't quite have that natural acumen. I've seen too many late throws, too many double or triple hitches, too many throws pre-determined at the snap that he doesn't adjust out of once the defense shifts.

Being a good guy and a hard worker can only take you so far if that natural instinct for the sport and for the position isn't there. And I just don't see it with Jones. He doesn't have that adaptability or magic factor that the greats have.",3.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-03T10:51:44Z,nygiants,3.5157897567461154e-05
4786,48813,48813,DoABarrowRoll,"it's hard for me to say because as much as I do really like this coaching staff and I'm very excited for them, the roster does have very clear holes and a lot of big question marks.

Coaching staff helps raise the floor for this team a lot I think, as just an improved scheme should bring us from ""incapable of scoring points"" to ""can score at a respectable enough level"". Like a 20th best scoring offense? Something like that? And just from that you go from that 4-13 team to the 7-10 team level of a team like Denver or something. 

And then the difference between being Denver or Washington and being Miami and Pittsburgh is the defense, which I think is a bit shaky; I think around that like 16-24 range for our defense like where we were last year is a fair baseline to start from; I don't think they'll be the worst, but there's enough question marks for me I'm not ready to say they'll be a GOOD defense.

Ceiling, I agree, Jones is the catalyst. You look at the teams that led the league in scoring, most of them got very good QB play. In the top 20 in scoring you pretty much have like the Patriots, Colts, Eagles, 49ers, and Saints, maybe Browns not having a pretty strong QB. The teams with bad QBs all were down near the bottom. And those teams I listed above were some of the best rushing teams in the league. That's a mark we could reach if everything goes well, but it's hard to expect for me.

I'm just not that big of a fan of Jones, I feel like expecting him to get us there is just wishful thinking. I'm expecting him to settle into that like 20th best QB type range, I expect that he won't be the worst in the league, but he won't make me feel good about his future.

And because that's just the most important position on the field, it kind of acts like a tiebreaker in some of these situations. In a vacuum (cap hit and age and stuff like that notwithstanding in this situation), I'd rather have the guy on the other sideline in a lot of our games. Probably the only ones I guarantee I would rather have Jones are Seattle and Carolina right now? Hurts I think is pretty even honestly, Goff I think is pretty even.

I didn't really talk about Taylor because I don't think it really changes the calculus for me. I don't think Taylor is just as good as Jones is, but I feel like I have to approach this as though Jones is going to play the full year. And I don't think Taylor wins any games Jones wouldn't (or vice versa really). Frankly I'm not really convinced having Taylor instead of Fromm or Glennon makes the Giants any noticeable amount better than they were last year, either.

All of this coming together to say: I'd rather undershoot than overshoot on this team this year. I expect some of those 6 or 7 wins to be strong, I expect Jones will have a couple of games like the end of the New Orleans game or like the first Washington game in 2021. But I don't expect this team to be consistent in any respect. I can't sit here and tell you Jones is going to prove Gettleman right.

4787,48814,48814,DoABarrowRoll,"Far from it, really. I mistyped in the chart with Wink (fixed now), he was the Baltimore Ravens DC last year. The only coaches pulled from Buffalo ended up being Daboll, Tierney, and Bobby Johnson. Egorugwu spent a few years in Buffalo before spending 2021 with Vanderbilt. Everyone else has been from other places, and most of them, Daboll has never necessarily worked with before.

I'm pretty sure he's never worked with: Kafka (his OC), Martindale (his DC), TMac (his STC; who is a holdover from the last couple of NYG staffs), DeAndre Smith (RB coach), Mike Groh (WR coach), Andy Bischoff (TE coach), Andre Patterson (DL coach), or Drew Wilkins (OLB coach).

It's really a diverse coaching staff, in my opinion. Obviously a lot offensively will come from Daboll's identity, but he's also blending it with Mike Kafka's experience from Kansas City.

4788,48815,48815,DoABarrowRoll,"Agreed on all counts. I would be stunned if the Giants had a winning record this year, it's impossible for me to expect that. I'm a pretty out and proud Jones detractor, I don't think he is like complete dogwater trash tier, but I don't see a guy who is going to win you games, just a guy who you can win with if everything else goes right.

This year isn't about the record, and I think most Giants fans agree; I do expect them to win more games than in 2021, but mostly because even if the offense goes from bottom 3 to 20th just on scheme alone, we should win more games. But (and this is where the Dave Gettleman regime failed) if we feel like the foundation of future star players is there, with guys like Thomas, Toney, Neal, Thibodeaux, etc, then it's okay to not win that many games while those guys grow into star players and we fix up the rest of the roster.

In my opinion, the team will have a QB they are going to dedicate multiple years to in 2023, whether Jones miraculously pulls it off (which I doubt) or they really go for it in the draft, trading up if they need to.

4790,48817,48817,DoABarrowRoll,"Agreed 100%. This year is where they're trying to put a floor on it and not be completely embarrassing, and then go into the next year or two with a reloaded roster led by players and people this regime brought in.

Whether we win 5 games or 8 games, it's irrelevant as long as we feel like we're set up for success. And for me, that's also regardless of Jones/Saquon, both of whom personally I'm ready to move on from right now; even if for no other reason than to remove the stink of the Dave Gettleman era.

Like I wrote, even if the offense caps out at 20th or something, if it's because of Jones, I'm okay with that. This regime deserves the privilege of getting their own swing at a QB.

My personal timeline looks like:

2022: learn whatever we can about all the players on the roster. Some things are foregone conclusions in my mind (Jones is going to cap out as a mediocre starter, somewhere in the like 16-24 range of QBs where you should be looking for a replacement; Saquon isn't going to be worth a big extension; etc), but there's a lot of other stuff to learn, between young players recently drafted like Aaron Robinson, Azeez Ojulari, Kadarius Toney, and vets like Kenny Golladay and Adoree' Jackson. Who's going to be here for the long haul?

2023: little bit of a bumpy road as a Tyrod starts until Schoen and Daboll's guy in the draft is ready; I'm fully expecting Jones to be gone next year. They'll try to compete but probably be in the like 6-9 win range depending on how good Taylor will be/how quickly the rookie comes along. I'd like to hit 8 wins, because coaches who lose double digit games both of their first 2 seasons are historically very unsuccessful, but with a QB change in there, it can kind of reset the timeline a bit. We'll also have more picks and more time to develop players to fill in some more of the holes in the roster. They'll need to replace a bunch of WRs, they still need to fill in a couple of longer term gaps on the OL, CBs, which of those young defensive players can step up and be starters.

2024: By this point we should be a good team. Not necessarily a dynasty level team like the Chiefs or something, but a team that should win 10+ games and make the playoffs. By this point, the Giants should have their QB (even if he's not 100% broken out yet; most QBs in today's game show what they are in year 2, the year 3 breakout for QBs is kind of a defunct measuring stick in my opinion), the roster should be retooled and reloaded, the schemes should be fully in place, etc.",8.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-03T09:13:15Z,nygiants,0.0247210965719041

4793,48820,48820,DoABarrowRoll,"# Training Camp Battles

* LG

> This one seems pretty set right now, with Shane Lemieux taking the vast majority of the snaps as the starter at LG. I think the Giants are trying to ease Ezeudu into things. He’s also been playing LT with the first team while Andrew Thomas has been rehabbing from offseason ankle surgery. This may be less of a training camp battle and more of a battle to watch as the season goes on. How well does Lemieux play coming off of his knee injury and how much better is he than his rookie year? How quickly can Ezeudu develop?

* EDGE3

> This might be a weird one to highlight but I’m very interested in it. We all know Kayvon Thibodeaux and Azeez Ojulari are going to be the lead dogs off the EDGE for the Giants. But there’s a healthy stable of options behind them as well. Jihad Ward is the vet and apparent leader for the group, but he’s maybe the least talented of the group. Quincy Roche played limited time last year but made some great plays (like his game winning strip sack vs the Raiders). And Elerson Smith was the highest draft pick and probably has the highest upside. I don’t know how they’ll divvy up the playing time among these guys but having a 3rd quality pass rusher would help elevate this defense.

* Defensive Rookies vs Incumbents

> I’m going to lump these all together because they’re basically the same: Cor’Dale Flott vs Darnay Holmes for the Nickel CB job, DJ Davidson vs Justin Ellis for the NT job, Tae Crowder vs Micah McFadden and Darrian Beavers for the LB2 job, Dane Belton vs Julian Love for the safety spot alongside Xavier McKinney

4794,48821,48821,DoABarrowRoll,"# Scheme Description

* **Offensive Scheme**

> Daboll runs a version of the Erhardt-Perkins system that has kind of become synonymous with the Patriots offense in recent years as more west coast, air raid, and spread passing attacks pop up across the league (on top of the prevalence of the sort of offshoot that Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay have helped popularize around the league).
> 
> The key for Daboll this season is going to be creating explosive plays, and that includes both phases.
> 
> In Buffalo, he leaned on zone runs more when the OL wasn’t meshing, shifting more to man/gap runs when the OL really started to figure it out. I don’t actually expect that to continue with the Giants, as I think they’re going to try pretty hard to get Saquon out in space. The additions of Glowinski and Neal will help a lot with that.
> 
> I also expect Daboll’s offense will live a lot on deep crossing routes and RPOs, which were very common in Buffalo. Garrett’s offense was more archaic, more classic Air Coryell, so I expect Daboll to splash in more modern concepts that will help make Jones’ life easier. Jones operated a very shotgun-heavy, RPO-heavy offense that made his decisions quicker and easier at Duke, and if I was Daboll, I would be trying to do the same thing; get the ball out of his hands and reduce the load on his mental processor (one of his biggest weaknesses).

* **Defensive Scheme**

> Wink Martindale is a blitz machine. His teams in Baltimore have been towards the top of the league in blitz rates almost every year he’s been the DC. It’s most common on those “gotta have it” downs, though. When it’s 3rd and 5, 3rd and 7, you better expect Martindale to come with a complex front that makes it hard for the offense to know who’s blitzing and who’s popping out into coverage. Martindale believes he can manufacture pressure and get free rushers, and that will mean a lot when the offense absolutely HAS to get a first down.
> 
> The concern is that by blitzing you often have to play man behind it, otherwise there’s not enough players to cover all that grass. The Giants CB room is a bit of a mess, so playing man behind it might be a bit tough. We really need the big men up front to get home.
> 
> Against the run, Martindale’s defenses have also done really well. Dexter Lawrence said he expects to play a bit more nose tackle this year, which is something I’m excited for. Having that big guy in the middle and letting his LBs run behind them is a staple for Martindale’s run stopping unit.",19.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-03T07:44:56Z,nygiants,-0.0063656506121327

I just think Flores is too similar to Judge, and what I want is for this team to learn how to score points again and find a franchise QB.

What I am most worried about right now is figuring out how we're going to score points and how we're going to maximize the QB position (read: how we're going to set up for and then acquire a franchise QB because Daniel Jones may be the starter in 2022 but I don't see him being a long term solution).

Like Duke says in the article, if you play with good body angles and weight distribution, you have good hand timing, placement, and gap control (I co-opted this term from hockey where we're talking about managing the space between you and the defender) you can overcome more minor length issues.

Having more length just reduces your margin for error; you can throw your hands a little bit earlier, you can be a little further away from where you need to be when you throw your hands because your length compensates for it.

Size doesn't matter (it does, but not the way people think sometimes), how you use it matters way way more.

The league isn't going to do anything now, probably, so now we just have to hope that one of these GM candidates can convince Mara of what everyone outside the building already knows: we need change and we need someone to bring us into the 2020s, we don't need someone to restore what the Giants were in 2007 and 2011 (Which were, to be frank, very lucky years where we got super hot at just the right time and Eli played out of his gourd).

But it's hard for the candidates that know these things and want to build something new and fix problems at the root to compete with the candidates who know how to talk to Mara and whisper sweet nothings in his ear about how the QB is fine and the coach is fine and the last GM just sucked but it had nothing to do with anyone else.

If Scott Pioli comes in, gets the Judge and Belichick nod of approval, and says ""We can win with Jones, I believe in Joe Judge, the scouting department can stay just the way it is"" and tells John Mara everything he wants to hear, it becomes easy for Mara to sit in that feedback loop.

We were hoping at least to some degree that Judge could be that; even though it felt like it might just be ""we're doing the Patriot Way now"" we thought maybe he convinced Mara of enough to change the way we do things, but it certainly hasn't seemed to be the case.

5081,49226,49226,DoABarrowRoll,"This sounds...very familiar. I'm talking about Joe Judge, both last year and this year. It's generally just kind of a struggle because nothing is going right. Like how do you build a culture and exude passion and motivation when basically everything that can go wrong is going wrong on the field?

I can't really expect the Jets defense to be good when their entire CB room is day 3 picks and UDFAs from the last few years so when their pass rush isn't clicking, partly because the edge group is pretty weak with Lawson hurt, they can't stop anybody. Especially when that's what Saleh's system has always been based on; when his teams can get after the QB, they have success defensively, but giving QBs all day, they just can't cover like that. Then offensively, Becton has been hurt, Wilson hasn't really been what you hoped and has missed 3 games, and generally offensively things haven't been going well. Schematically, personnel, everything.

The Jets just don't have anything to hang their hat on right now. The Giants in 2020 started 0-5, 1-7 halfway through, but then they really found their identity relying on the defense, the defense became like the core of the team and something for everyone to rally around. Bad start for the Jets obviously, but you have to see how they really respond to it. Sucks that your bye was so early, since the Giants probably pay the league to give them a late bye we get these midseason resets. 

But get Wilson back, find something that works to lean on, and win a few games here, you've got 8 games left, just 3 against teams with winning records (NO at 5-4, TB at 6-3, and a week 18 matchup with 6-3 Buffalo), with 5 games against teams that currently sit in the top 11 picks, Miami x2, JAX, HOU, and PHI. If you can find even just like 3 wins in there and find something that it feels like you can take to next year, it'll completely change the vibes I think.

5190,49362,49362,DoABarrowRoll,"The OL has been fine, not exceptional but fine this year, that's not the biggest issue. The problem is the whole offense is on rails. It doesn't actually spread the defense out. There's very little that crosses the field horizontally so no defender is ever really put in conflict. Just draw a line from the receiver to the end zone and more often than not they won't deviate from that line.

That's also a big reason the RZ offense sucks. When your whole offense is built off of the 9 ball and you get into the RZ where you can't really run a 9 route, you get completely stuck. That's why there's so many fades and stuff like that. They don't use the middle of the field at all in their normal offense outside of curls and it really stalls things in the redzone. Plus the run game isn't exceptional with a mix of just okay blocking upfront and Saquon not really impressing. Plus some miscues mostly from the OL, a holding penalty here, a botched assignment on 2nd and goal to knock you to the 20 there.

Otherwise, you're pretty much spot on. Jones leaves some yards on the field at times, keeping the ball short sometimes when he can push the ball downfield a little more, but for the most part, we're just not challenging defenses downfield properly with route concepts, the routes don't work together pretty much at all.

And Garrett is a bitch of a playcaller because there are some good plays in his playbook but then he watched us have the most success we've ever had on offense since he's been here against WFT and just removed 90% of what was so good about that gameplan against ATL and it didn't make sense.",4.0,nfl,t3_py0b83,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2021-09-29T14:35:01Z,nygiants,0.0593608163374365

The methodology behind the trade was sound and (in my opinion) correct. Free up cap space for 2019 that can be allocated towards important things we needed or really wanted, and get an extra top 75 pick in the process.

The problem is that those picks and that cap space were allocated poorly because the people in charge of the team are/were (depending how much blame you place on Gettleman vs Shurmur/Bettcher, I would personally go with ""are"" in this case) really bad at their jobs and used those resources poorly. 

I'm not saying ""yes I would rather have Billy Price than JPP right now"" I'm saying ""I am glad they made that trade, but I'm not glad they used the cap space on Alec Ogletree/Golden Tate/more dead money from trading OBJ and the pick on BJ Hill.""

Yes, we ate a 15m dead money hit that year, but it bit the bullet so we had more space the year after; it basically paid for OBJ's extension. If I could go back in time to 2018 before that trade was made, I'd still make it.

5254,49438,49438,DoABarrowRoll,"it's mostly overcorrections from a lot of what he had trouble with early in 2020. During the times he really struggled, he was oversetting and giving up inside moves. Last night, he was setting really short and letting guys get to the corner and trying to recover and ride them around the back of the pocket; which worked okay a few times when the interior guys held up and Jones stepped up in the pocket (like on the touchdown he threw), but if Jones sits back or the interior breaks down, then it gives the defender an easier route.

I'm personally of the opinion that it's a lot of coaching/scheme with him right now, and they were telling him to set short because there were almost no deep concepts run last night, it was all quick throws, as evidenced by Jones completing 77% of his passes and having a like 6.2 YPA. For reference, 4 QBs in 2020 had YPAs of under 6.2, 2 were below 60% completion (Darnold and Wentz), Haskins at 61.4%, and Foles at 64.7%.

If the ball is supposed to get out right away, setting short is fine because the EDGE has to go allllll the way around. But if your QB is still taking a 5 step drop from the gun and sitting 10 yards back from the line of scrimmage and not moving, or double clutching because he decided not to make a riskier throw, your receivers are all running to the first down marker and turning around, and shit like that, then yeah the short set isn't going to work.

That's basically where we're at with the Giants and Jones, where the protection is not good, the scheme is terrible, the QB isn't really doing anything to elevate that, and I'm basically waiting for the new GM+OC+QB to come in.

A new scheme that forces Jones to use his legs, get him on the move to help alleviate that stuff, that leverages his skills more and uses more misdirection and play action/RPO stuff could really work for him, but it's just going to be too late where the guy has just left such a sour taste in everyone's mouth and has so little team control left that it would be better to just move on and get a fresh start.",7.0,nfl,t3_pei7g6,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2021-08-30T11:46:30Z,nygiants,0.144948832

If all you're getting is a day 3 pick, then it's probably better to me to just see if we can ride him out in that option year, get one more year of production, let him walk in FA, even though that risks him just getting hurt again and us getting nothing out of it.

Look at the rate that draftees even stay in the NFL, let alone be starting caliber. If you can draft 4 starters out of your 7 picks, you won the entire draft. Now limit it down to 3 (Tackle, Guard, and center) positions. It makes it infinitely more difficult to find someone that will be a starter. 

Hence why teams that have a good track record of drafting, may make confusing picks as far as need goes. These teams understand how difficult it is just to land NFL talent in the draft. We drafted two (maybe more?) defensive backs in this draft. It’s not a need, however the staff evaluated those players as the best chance to land NFL quality level players, and that is the approach you should go by.

The media over hyped how deadly it was as well. They portrayed accurate death rate numbers (which weren’t that high to begin with, the issue is how easily it spreads) however the reason why they were even THAT high is because they treated the ventilated patience incorrectly. With the vital signs they were showing, typically you treat it one way, however with covid it made it worse, so more people died than had to. The survival rate is much higher than the typical flue at this point. 

Also the Fauci E-Mails where he said masks do nothing came out, but reddit, and main stream media ignored it, and so did everyone else.

You bring up the PFF grade but without context it's meaningless. He has only been actively superior to one of the other three guys. One guy is injured. The other guy is the best RT in football.

14738,126786,126786,Niccio36,"One that I found that was kind of interesting was Steve Young and Terrell Owens. At least that one wasn't full-on injuries or one player being washed, because Young was still pretty damn good in the late 90s. But his peak was inarguably the 1992-1994 range. He started dipping after that. Here's some simple counting stats.  


They overlapped from 1996-1999, with Young managing only three games in 1999, so basically just 1996-1998.  
Owens' career averages in three-year splits over 48 regular-season games:   
**1996-1998: 54 receptions, 851 receiving yards, 9 TDs**  
1999-2001: 91 receptions, 1315 receiving yards, 12 TDs  
2002-2004: 96 receptions, 1340 receiving yards, 13 TDs  
2005-2007: 90 receptions, 1389 receiving yards, 14 TDs  
2008-2010: 68 receptions, 996 receiving yards, 8 TDs  
Young's career averages as a starter with the 49ers in three-year splits over 48 regular season games (excluding 1999 and his time as a backup since it would throw off the averages pretty bad):  
1991-1992: 3545 passing yards, 25 TDs, 9 INTs, 104.9 QBR, 65.8 Cmp%  
1993-1995: 4164 passing yards, 31 TDs, 14 INTs, 102.2 QBR, 68.4 Cmp%  
**1996-1998: 3661 passing yards, 26 TDs, 9 INTs, 101 QBR, 65.3 Cmp%**

By framing it that way we can all agree there’s no doubt that a QB has an outsized impact on the game in a way no other player has.   


Personally when I look at GOATs and all that I look at the impact a player has on their position and the game as a whole, then by their statistical dominance in context. 

This is why, for me, LT is #1 and Rice is #2. LT fundamentally changed not only his position and defensive schemes, but also he changed the way offenses operate (or at least the way front offices judge linemen). Rice’s statistical dominance, where no one is in the same stratosphere as him in overall numbers, is why I put him #2.

14747,126831,126831,Niccio36,"Well you said “Rice's production is going to be limited by QB play.”

I was simply responding to that. 

His average over a 16 game season would only be 70 yards short of his PEAK year from a receiving yards standpoint, and that was with Montana, an all-time great. Those five QBs were definitely average or worst, and he still was putting up fantastic numbers. 

Personally I have LT #1 and Rice #2. 

LT for how much he changed the game and how dominant he was as a DEFENSIVE player. Joe Gibbs created a position simply to block him lol. And he’s pretty much the reason left tackles are paid what they are paid nowadays. 

2 is Rice because of his statistical dominance. He holds every record by such a wide margin and no matter who the QB was or how old he was he was still putting up incredible numbers. I mean I didn’t even mention his early 2000s years with the Raiders, where he still put up over 1200 yards.

Sure, you can say that players have been hit by other player's helmets previously, but that is not a fair comparison as they were being worn to protect both players on the field during normal NFL interactions, not being used by one NFL player to assault another by the use of their helmet, which also opened them up to major injuries as they were now defenseless, unlike the players in your example that did not sustain major injuries while being hit with a helmet.

He is also top 3 in rushing yards and top 70 in terms of games played, including K, P, and QB. For a RB, that's insane. 

I don't want it to seem like I am saying longevity equals a HOF bid, since that isn't what I am saying. What I am saying, is that he mixed longevity with great play. Only four RBs rushed for at least 5,000 yards in their 30s: Payton, Smith, John Riggins and Frank Gore. In fact, he is the only RB to have at least 6,000 yards after turning 30. Add that to the fact that only 6 other RBs (all HoFs) have even played after turning 35, his longevity is something not seen in the NFL before. 

At age 37, he still had over 650 yards and was top 30 in the NFL that year. He may not have had as high of a peak as other RBs, but he has done somethings that no RB before him has been able to do. Also, to those saying that the only reason he is 3rd all time is because of how long he played and not his skill, please, let me know all the other RBs who were able to keep playing long enough and well enough to surpass him.

19429,170986,170986,Tomtom6789,"In 2019, the Giant's had a hard decision to make. Try to take one last shot for a title with Eli Manning or cut the Giant's legend to stop postponing the rebuild and limit the consistent mediocrity they showed on the field. Well, of course, the Giant's decide to roll with Eli and decided to make multiple signings of aging players such as Antoine Bethea and, Golden Tate, and Nate Solder (who both Solder and Tate still have a $4M a piece dead cap charge in 2022). 

This did not work out how they hoped. The Giant's went 4-12, and instead of starting the rebuild, the Giant's decided to hold off and try loading up yet again with expensive, older players. The 2020 NY Giant's, a team with a QB on a rookie contract and a team that previously went 4-12, starts the season with less than $5M in cap space. We made good decisions during the draft, which are paying dividens now, but other than that, there wasn't much to enjoy about this time.

All the spending they did in previous years and reaching for a QB in a bad QB draft ended up increasing the Giant's win total by 50% over the previous year. The Giant's almost made the playoffs at an intimidating 6-10. 

Now, one would think, after multiple years under a .500 record, it would finally be time to start the rebuild instead of spending multiple millions of dollars on aging veterans that will only prolong the inevitable instead of building a firm foundation for the years ahead. I'll let you guess which one they ended up doing. 

$72M for an oft injured Kenny Golladay, and others leave the Giant's with just under $3M in a make or break year for the franchise. They, again, made great moves in the first and second round of the draft, selecting players in areas of need but seemed to forget everything they knew about drafting and did not draft players in areas of need but spent picks on players like a 4th string RB instead of taking a shot on a developmental players at more pressing needs like OL, Edge, and LB. 

Well, third times a charm, right? The Giant's finished 4-13 this past year, causing Mara to finally clean house and look beyond his best friends to hire someone to lead the Giant's. Even with a competent staff making cuts where allowed and trying to trade off players for further draft capitol or extra cap space, the Giant's sit at just over $1M in cap space with a roster that includes a QB on a rookie deal and a lot of overpaid veterans on deals that have been reconstructed too many times, eliminating any wiggle room there may have been.

The Giant's could have started back in 2019, but instead, we are here in 2022 with no cap space, no franchise QB, a dilapidated OL, often injured, aging WRs, pedestrian TEs, multiple highly paid run-stuffing DTs, one promising edge player, a 1980's style LB core, and an actually promising secondary, but a secondary that will most likely be gutted to create space to improve all the other positional groups. Fun.

Guards seem to be easier to find, with an average of 13 starters being found in rounds 1 through 4 each and then 13 starters found in rounds 5 through 7 and UDFAs. The center position seemed to be the easiest to find later with a pretty even spread from rounds 1 through 6. This isn't to say that all of these players that are starters are actually *good* starters, as we have 5 players out there that we call starters, but it shows that if the Giant's are serious about drafting a better O-Line, they will need to invest not only *more* picks into the position, but also *earlier* picks if they want a starting caliber OT to play alongside Thomas. 

On top of this, they need some stability in terms of coaching. You can't expect to have so many shuffles at the coaching position and then expect players to be well developed.

The idea that you can bring in anyone that will play like Cooper for closer to $8M - $10M is just wishful thinking since guys like Golladay are getting $18M a year, Robby Anderson is getting $15M, and even Robert Woods will be making $18M - $20M in a year or two. Also, just to rub salt in the wound, those contracts will cost teams at minimum $5M and, at a maximum, over $20M in dead cap, which means they are locked into that contract without having to spend more than Cooper's current contract.

This shouldn't come as a surprise though since he was able to lift up the Lions to an absurd amount of wins when he was with them.

TT had a hamstring injury. He went on IR in week 3 and came back in week 11 rushing for 2 tds in that game. He was benched 2 weeks later. The article simply mentions the injury in the context of the season. It wasn’t used as an excuse for his benching. That’s a conclusion you tried to draw on your own.

You can’t just throw out MT’s rookie season. That’s not how it works. That’s called moving the goal posts. He had 1 good year then regressed each year after. I’m not making this up. The numbers are the numbers.

The entire extremist attitude taken towards DJ on this sub is what gets wearing. It’s absolutely from both sides. The sad part is the “DJ realists”  are typically the ones who lack the self awareness to realize how ridiculous their takes are. 

The fanboys know their nuts. You saw that fan fiction post with the made up quotes. Their unbridled love for DJ is annoying and creepy, but it’s no less annoying and creepy than the unbridled hate for DJ either. 

That fan fiction post is the equivalent of the fan fiction posts that were written when TT was signed and people were saying he’s going to be the starter. People were actually saying the Giants were probably actively shopping DJ. That’s nuts. 

There is a middle ground. There is an objective evaluation that can be made. While the endless excuse making is ridiculous so are things like “he’s a slow processor”, “he can’t read through his progressions”, all parroted comments by people who probably never studied game film in their lives. While there’s film that shows that, there’s also film that disputes that. I didn’t study any film. I’m not a coach or a scout obviously. I just read alot and listen to alot of podcasts of people who do. It’s a pretty split opinion on DJ as whole.

I have 2 specific reasons I don’t think DJ is the guy. Ball security and availability. It doesn’t matter how much talent you have, if you turn the ball over and miss games, you’re not the guy. However, I also understand that he’s been in one of the worse situations since he’s come into the league. Roster wise and coaching wise. It doesn’t excuse his mistakes, but it absolutely needs to be considered.

With that being said, and with all the circumstances surrounding the team, I’d rather give DJ his 4th year, like MT got, to either play himself into a franchise tag or play himself off the team. It makes for a much more interesting year than watching journeyman backup Tyrod Taylor play.

TT was benched. 

https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32837466/houston-texans-turn-tyrod-taylor-davis-mills-quarterback?platform=amp

MT wasn’t 25-13, the Chicago Bears were. MT was carried to the playoffs by the #1 ranked defense and 11th ranked rushing attack in 2018 and in 2020 they squeaked in at 8-8 with the 22nd ranked offense. After his decent sophomore season, MT regressed each season after that. Stats don’t lie so here’s some for you. DJ, on a per game basis, averages more touchdowns and more yards than MT. DJ also averages more turnovers, my biggest problem with him, but MT is no slouch himself in the turnover department.

While I agree there’s no reason to believe DJ will be more successful than TT or MT have been, I’d rather see him get the opportunity to do it this year than watch either of those 2 play. 

If the QB class was significantly better this year I’d have been on board with doing whatever was necessary with those 2 top 10 picks to secure a QB. If the cap situation wasn’t a complete disaster I would have been on board with pursuing a vet like Russell Wilson. However, I’m not on board with making change just for the sake of change.

“Those personnel deficiencies showed up all over the field. Jones finished last in the league in targets thrown to open receivers, which is hardly surprising if you’ve watched film of the 2021 Giants offense. The offensive line wasn’t good enough to hold up in protection on long-developing pass plays—New York had the highest rate of blown blocks on five- and seven-step dropbacks, per Sports Info Solutions—so opposing secondaries didn’t have to worry about the deeper areas of the field. Offensive coordinator Jason Garrett was unable to coach around those limitations, so he just called a bunch of hitches and out-breaking routes instead. Those are risky throws, and they’re even harder to make when the defenses can sit on them without having to worry about throws over the top. As the season wore on, defenses squeezed the Giants passing game more and more, forcing Jones to grow more and more conservative.”

Congratulations on going back to the post where I had to explain what a bidding war was to you. You just obliterated your own argument. There was no incremental raise from the Browns. They came in with an offer significantly higher than any other team was willing to pay. Not a bidding war.

Fact: Deshaun Watson is going to pay, whether through settlements or rulings in the civil suits.

Fact: Cleveland is well aware of Deshaun’s legal issues as they “thoroughly” investigated them.

Fact: Cleveland way overpaid for a QB who isn’t even the best in his division.

Fact: That money will be used to pay some or all of the 22 plaintiffs.

Even if you just focus on the 1s, Herbert walked into a situation with Keenan Allen, Murray had Fitz in year 1 and was gifted Hopkins in year 2, and Burrow had multiple 1000 yard receiver Tyler Boyd.

Trubisky has   65 for an average of 1.14 per game. So although Trubisky was much better with ball security, it didn’t translate to better production.

The other issue is that you’re lumping me in with the DJ fanboys simply because I’m pointing out that Trubisky isn’t some massive upgrade over DJ. They’re basically the same. The point of giving DJ another year is because Trubisky is not going to come in on some cheap 1 year prove it deal and the Giants are trying to fix their terrible cap situation.

You're ignoring a lot of my arguments. No we can't give up on 2023 or 2024, you are assuming nothing will get better. If we dont have to worry about burning 22 million then why worry about 29 million for the tag? Again, you are ignoring a lot of my arguments. You also seem to ignore that we have tyrod signed already for 2023.

And in regards to your first point, I've seen WAY more people here overhype his first 4 games than people shitting on it. If anything he played worst than what people here think. He was better than 2020, but thats not saying much, he had an awful 2020 season. I talked about this yesterday, im gonna paste my comment here:

Improvement from his second year isn't saying much. His second year was abysmal. His improvement is not as big as you say, and while i think he is better than darnold, they're not far off from each other. The biggest difference is that the jets actually moved on, even if they had as many, or more reasons to assume they actually screwed him over.

That ranking of him as a top 5 QB is ridiculous. He was 7 in yards, he was like 15th in completion percentage (and i took out the saints quarterbacks because i dont know who was starting), he only had 6 TD (including rushing). those are not great numbers, i don't get this narrative that he was killing it. He didn't even scrore a TD against the falcons, who had a horrible defense. In those 4 games, and correct me if im wrong, he had most of his weapons available. In those games (and the rest of the games he played), he had a pocket time of 2.5 seconds, which ranked 6th most during those 4 games and 8th most during all the games he played.

He hasn't been consistent, he hasn't shown that. Almost every QB shows flashes. And even if you ignore all the negatives, he still can't stay healthy and that is the most important thing",3.0,nygiants,t3_tyfjot,False,0.0,:Giants-Logo-Oldschool:,2022-04-07T13:00:57Z,nygiants,-0.0179521923431753

No. 22 million cap hit would be bad man, we have taylor and if dj is bad we are gonna need another QB, and then we're stuck like the panthers and the browns. If 22 million is meaningless, then why is 7 million more (or whatever the difference is) for the franchise tag not a better option? It takes away all the risks of giving him the 5th and you're tagging him knowing he improved.

It's also good to note that many reports say that at the senior bowl he was extremely coachable and learned things quickly. He is nothing like jordan love as a prospect. Trey lance got drafted at 3 purely for his upside, which imo (and it's ok if you disagree) is not as high as willis.

On regards to your post about allen and mahomes. Mahomes draft class was looked as a weak class, the only guy that had a  high grade was trubisky. If it was a strong class then you would've seen more than 1 guy going top 5 and definitely you wouldn't have seen the always QB needy Cleveland browns trade away their pick to houston, or the bills (who needed a qb) trading their pick to KC. Mahomes was looked as a reach.

With josh allen, all you have to do is go to the thread in /nfl where they drafted him and see for yourself. Outside from the reddit world, it was also considered a reach and people said they got ""the wrong josh"" in the draft.

Here is what i see with willis, and its ok if you disagree. I see elite tools, his skillset reminds me of a smaller josh allen. His accuracy problems come from his footwork, when he is set right he can put the ball anywhere. He also needs to get better at reading defenses.

I won’t even go into the non-existent pressure against the O-line, but this is not how you win games. I don’t know what Patrick graham is doing but he needs to figure it out fast. 

2. Darius Slayton. I don’t know how you can expect to be a viable receiving option if you drop passes like that. A perfect ball by DJ and the chance to take the lead and then it’s gone. You just hate to see it, but he’s gonna have to mentally bounce back. 

3. Nick Gates. Just the most brutal injury combined with the worst timing. On replay it look extremely gruesome. Wishing him a speedy recovery 

4. Penalties - just sloppy sloppy and sloppy all around. Dexter Lawrence’s offsides ripped my heart out. No excuse, it’s week 2, the jitters need to be gone. 

5. DJ had a great game imo. Looked comfortable in the pocket but also didn’t linger and used his feet extremely well. Ball security was there and no Ints? Shows the improvements he knows he needs to make in year 3.

Meanwhile Eli ""2 x Best QB in the Playoffs"" Manning had his main targets Plaxico Burress, Hakeem Nicks, and Victor Cruz rendered relatively useless by the greatest defensive mind in NFL history in his SB victories. The 50 yard pass down field to third option Mario Manningham was placed so well...not even Evan Engram could have dropped it...the fact that started his second game winning Super Bowl drive is legendary. 

I can't even imagine how much greater his victories would have been had he been fortunate enough to have a running back go for a 75 yard td run, have one of the most historically one sided officiated games, or benefited from an extremely flukey 99 yard defensive touchdown. He wouldn't have needed to show the stones that he did coming back like he did. 

Instead his only SB turnover was a result of a dropped pass in the red zone by rookie Steve Smith in SB 42....if he hadn't have done that the Tyree play probably isn't even necessary.

Two years ago Golladay turned down an $18.5M AAV deal exactly because ""he knew"" the market would pay him significantly more...if not for COVID and the reduced cap he would have been 100% correct, easily commanding at least $19M if not $20M. 

In two years (if not next year) when the salary cap gets back on track there will be WRs who don't sniff KGs skillset signing for $18M left and right, while the rare WRs who do have  his skillset will be cashing in for $20M and more.

- I was very pleased with our defense in the first half, especially stopping the bengals with short field position after our special teams mishaps

- also, I thought offensive playcalling was really nice. I know preseason is supposed to be vanilla playcalling but even just our route combos last night are leaps and bounds over a Jason Garrett offense

Lars posts a lot of content to the sub - some relevant and some not so relevant, and we're actively moderating the not-so-relevant posts as needed (like a Penik tweet yesterday that offered little to no value or discussion opportunity). These posts keep the feed fresh, up to date, and generate discussion. 

We have been working with Lars over the past several months to clean up his formatting of posts and type of content that gets posted and he has been nothing but compliant with the subreddit rules since then (thank you). 

Some of y'all were complaining a year ago when /u/zimmie41 was posting articles often, and now some of y'all are complaining that Lars is posting content too often. **There's actual news and updates to post right now! Football is here and that's exciting!** 

If you don't want to see Lars' username pop up in the sub so much, then feel free to pitch in and post relevant content to the subreddit feed too. If you feel his post breaks a subreddit rule then report it and we will assess from there. To those of you who are just reporting every single Lars post because Lars posted it and you have something against him, you're wasting your time and our time so please stop. 

Lastly, we're doing more moderating of hateful comments directed towards Lars than moderating Lars' content and comments. **The name-calling and threatening comments towards him (or anyone else) are uncalled for and not welcome here.** He may have some wild takes (sorry dude, Slayton has no trade value...) but that doesn't open the door to attack the guy.",1.0,nygiants,t3_wkv629,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-08-10T06:58:05Z,nygiants,-0.0679058017382683

2022 Hot Takes - NFC
NFC East

New York Giants

- Daniel Jones will finish the season as QB10-12. 4200 pass yards, 450 rush yards, 34 TDs on 8 INTs
- Saquon Barkley will finish as RB2 on the season. 1900 total yards, 17TDs
- Wan’Dale Robinson more will be fantasy-irrelevant. Under 400 total yards on the season
- Kadarius Toney will finish as WR8 on the season
- the Giants top 4 playmakers will collectively outscore the Bills top 4 playmakers this season in fantasy points

Washington Commanders

- Carson Wentz will not be the starting quarterback of the Commanders by week 9
- Brian Robinson will lead the Commanders in rushing yards
- Terry McLaurin will end the season as WR35, scores less than 200 fantasy points 
- Jahan Dotson finished the season with 800 yards, 4 TDs, leads the Commanders in receptions

Philadelphia Eagles

- Jalen Hurts finishes the season with 3 or less games of 25+ fantasy points 
- AJB finishes the season with less than 750 receiving yards and less than 4 TDs
- Miles Sanders will finish with the 3rd most rushing yards on the team
- Devonta Smith puts up 1100 yards on the season 

Dallas Cowboys

- Dak Prescott throws for under 4,000 yards and throws more INTs than any of his prior seasons
- Zeke finishes the season as RB15-17, rushes for under 900 yards for the first time in his career
- CeeDee Lamb finishes the season with less than 800 yards receiving as WR30-33. Team owners finally stop paying top WR price for Lamb in trades by the end of the season when they realize his price outweighs his points
- Dalton Schultz sees 120+ targets

28659,240619,240619,jshanley16,"Dude you’re on quite the rampage in here. Let’s take a step back, alright?

In regards to Alex Wilson… no, there wasn’t a vote. There won’t be and doesn’t need to be. The dude doesn’t have media credentials so he’s no different than you and me, just happens to have more twitter followers. 

We have rule #5 of the sub: “**Personal Blogs/Websites/YouTube Pages, etc. ** you can be a redditor with a website, but not a website with a reddit account. We reserve the right to remove any blog posts, twitter chains, podcasts, etc that do not contribute to the subreddit.”

Alex Wilson’s tweets, or my tweets, or your tweets don’t belong here, that’s what the daily discussion thread is for. 

Now as it pertains to Pat Leonard, the topic comes up when his articles and tweets aren’t accredited. For example, his latest article really only references to a Colin Cowherd hot take as his source of information he’s basing his article off of. 

In another example, his infamous “Toney is on the trade block” story, he lacked credible sources other than some sources that suggested Toney *may* be on the trade block, and those sources were unsubstantiated as confirmed by Schoen himself. 

So now we have a guy like Alex Wilson who doesn’t have media credentials and posts opinions on twitter and a personal blog site who’s not allowed to be posted unless it’s unique, statistical content worth sharing. And then we have Pat Leonard who has media credentials who’s work is either A) opinions, click baits or stories with sources who lack credibility and B) content that duggan, art, raanan, rock are all reporting about that is actually news, like roster updates. 

The difference? Pat has media credentials and someone pays him (which, there’s plenty of fan-based sites that pay their writers, albeit hardly anything for their work). 

So, your friendly mod team asked the sub their opinion as the content falls within a grey area being discussed by the mod team. 

This is not a “we are banning this content” or “this is our subreddit, we don’t care what you think”. This is us asking for input on what people want to see as it’s our responsibility to *moderate* the content that is on the sub, and we are well aware there is a grey area in that duty.",5.0,nygiants,t3_w8ktcx,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-07-26T11:19:16Z,nygiants,0.0228248302574871

- WE DIDN’T HIRE BRIAN FLORES FUCK YEAH!

- Daboll has never been a head coach before. I would still like a young mind at OC but that means we should probably hire a DC who has some HC experience to assist Daboll, much like how McVay structured his first season with Wade Phillips (not saying Daboll will be McVay)

- word is he likes DJ, which is good considering the likely scenario is that DJ is our QB this season and we can build around him

- I dig the synchronicity we’re gonna get out of Daboll and Shoen

- I’m not really “excited” other than the fact that Flores isn’t our HC, but I’m happy we got our guy, and one that was seemingly desired as a strong candidate for other teams.

- given shoen’s cap mess and seeing as Daboll just operated an offense where the only first round talent on the field was Josh Allen, Daboll has shown he can run an offense without star power and get the most out of his guys. In theory this opens up the door for Shoen to make drastic changes to the roster as he sees fit to dig us out of our cap situation. This may result in some unfavorable roster moves (no peppers, Saquon trade, etc), but I’ll buy into the thought that they gotta do what they gotta do to get us out of this mess",34.0,nygiants,t3_sfhjvx,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-01-29T07:12:34Z,nygiants,-0.0890150162894375

28790,240918,240918,jshanley16,"Jshan’s Next Day Thoughts - Post-Judgement Day Edition:

- I’m frustrated because, while Judge wasn’t exactly great in his tenure, he was given a shit scenario that seemingly kept getting shittier (aka mass injury across the team)

- I also feel judge didn’t get a true fair shot due to the belief that Jason Garrett was put in his OC a position because of Mara and Getty. Garrett never made sense. And when Garrett was out, DJ went out with injury so of course our offense is gonna get worse with Glennon and Fromm behind center. What can you expect?

- Biggest loss is going to be Patrick Graham. If we can somehow retain him I would be in heaven.

- Reviewing the past few years of drafts for the Bills, I would be more than okay with Joe Schoen as our next GM, and excited to hear beat reporters share any info they get from sources on today’s interview (this morning).

- I’ve decided that my preference is to have a HC who runs the offense, unlike Judge who has his OC run the offense. OC/QB coach to assist. Would love a guy like Pep Hamilton as OC

- with that said, we need some younger, creative mind installing or heavily influencing offensive scheme.

- Given the state of our franchise, upcoming contracts and cap situation, I’m of the belief that Saquon played his last snap as a New York Giant. Same with Peppers and Engram.

- I’m still undecided on whether or not DJ is our QB next season. It would make sense to keep him because we’re paying him anyway, but I wouldn’t be surprised if our new coaching staff/GM want their own guy.

- With the above, I could see a new GM drafting QB if they really like one of the top prospects. I personally want to smash OL/OL or OL/edge, but a scenario with a QB being drafted has opened up with Judge gone.

- At least I get a little offseason excitement rather than sulking in misery until the draft",8.0,nygiants,t3_s250er,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-01-12T06:21:11Z,nygiants,-0.029542313111893

- Mike Glennon shouldn’t even be on the roster. Like obviously you hope you never have to rely on a backup QB but good lord

- Watching the Saints game where their OL can control the LOS to the point where they can scheme run blocks moving the DL left or right for Kamara to find a cutback lane… our OL is literally incapable of that and it’s depressing. Our offense is so hindered by this OL, no QB or RB should be able to do anything effectively.

- Saquon’s one handed catch was pretty sweet. Dude still isn’t out of the doghouse but between getting hit behind the LOS every rush and Glennon’s atrocious checkdown passes (8 targets, at least 3 were uncatchable and 1 shouldn’t have been thrown, defender was already draped on Saquon), it’s hard to really put full blame on the dude for his lack of productivity. He does shoulder some blame though. He’s supposed to be “generational”…

- From the small sample size we saw, Fromm has the kind of command at the LOS you see from seasoned vets. DJ doesn’t have that command. It was nice to see. However other than that it’s not fair to evaluate his play, good or bad, as sample size is tiny and Cowboys were just playing prevent D at the end of the game.

- RIP Shep. I love that guy and sadly, he’s likely played his last snaps as a New York Giant.

- We suck. Our offense is nonexistent, our D gave up far too many big plays. We’re just an overall bad football team

- I have no expectations for Fromm but we should have put him in in the 4th quarter being down as much as we were just to see what we get from him. We know what we get out of Glennon already. Season is lost, throw the kid in.

- I was happy with some of our offensive playcalling yesterday. Freddie seemed to scheme up plays to get Saquon open and able to make plays, which was nice. I still expect more from Saquon, though. His route on the TD was pretty nice. Corner bit HARD.

- Slayton has officially lost his hands. Dude continues to not catch footballs. He’s the new Engram.

- Our D just was not in sync yesterday. Couldn’t get to Herbert enough, pass rush is as big an issue as our lack of OL as far as I’m concerned. I will note the blatant missed holding call on Zo Carter during Herbert’s long TD pass to Guyton, though. We should have had a sack there.

- Our OL might be the worst in the league. They failed to pick up very basic stunts and blitzes. I saw plays where our OL double teamed a single DL while another defender flew through the line untouched. There are absolutely no holes in the run game. None.

- Mike Glennon was not good, but I don’t think anyone has high hopes for him on the field. Continuously throwing bad balls behind WRs or too far out in front of them (1-2 to Saquon that an accurate ball could have put Saquon 1v1 on a defender on the perimeter). He grossly under threw a pass to John Ross that would have been a huge gain, nobody was in front of him.

- Kenny G can’t go a single game without being hurt in some way.

- Don’t let Saquon’s stats fool you, 1/3 of his yards came from a couple of garbage time touches when the Dolphins were playing soft D. He had no holes, but he also didn’t run aggressive on most runs to make his own push.

- I don’t know what I think of Freddie Kitchens’ playcalling yet. Lots of injuries, shit OL, but I didn’t see many plays yesterday that got me excited.

- Surprisingly, ENGRAM of all players was the only reliable receiving target yesterday.

- D played fine. Can’t win games scoring 9 points.

- I’ll refrain from critiquing the offensive playcalling until next week, as a new OC on a short week isn’t a fair timeframe for assessment

- Our OL can’t run block for shit. That said, I’m growing frustrated with Saquon. Regardless of the lack of holes, I see other RBs across the league not have holes and still produce more than 40 yards on 13 carries. Saquon’s supposed to be able to do that. Let’s see it.

- Hard to say that KenNYG should get more targets if every pass to him shows a DB draped over him. He needs to get open more, not every pass to Kenny should be a contested ball.

- Our secondary came to play. 3 INTs against Hurts isn’t all that impressive because it’s Hurts, but Bradberry made Dsmith a non-factor which made Reagor a target far more often than he should have been. It was nice to see.

- Playcalling was atrocious. Kenny Golladay had 1 target. Toney pass plays only work if you use him like that more than once a game every week. Saquon had 9 rushes. Just absolutely terrible. I enjoyed the first drive’s mixed up formations and tempo, but all of our first drives are solid every week because they’re semi-scripted. It’s like Garrett only game plans for the first drive and wings it the rest of the way.

- Our redzone offense it terrible.  Our lone TD came from a reception by Andrew Thomas

- DJ played the entire game in distress thanks to all OL other than Andrew Thomas, who I thought played fantastic.

- DJ’s 2 ints were knucklehead throws. Blame DJ, blame defenders in his face all game, but he shouldn’t have thrown either ball.

- Saquon was serviceable, but hard to give an opinion since he hardly got the ball.

- defensively we played way too soft. Couldn’t get pressure because Brady dinked and dunked his way down the field, we were giving up anything 8 yards from the LOS

- Judge’s post game comments makes it sound like we’re finally going to see a change in coaching, hopefully playcalling. I wouldn’t mind seeing what Freddie Kitchens does for us calling plays.

- Toney may be the hardest player in the league to tackle in open space. Get this man the ball more often, but less from passes behind the LOS.

- DJ was asked to be a game manager and nothing more. He did that, but it’s disappointing to see

- That was the most boring, shitty playcalling I’ve seen this year. WRs had a total of 4 targets thrown their way. 4. Playcalling was predictable and as vanilla as a C Team coach puts together

- Nate Solder is gonna set this franchise back another 5 years if he stays on the field. DJ is going to get hurt.

- Defense played really well and finally came in clutch when we needed them to instead of blowing the game in the final minutes like always

- our young defensive guys are showing up! McKinney with 2 picks and a score, Ojulari kept applying pressure all game

28889,241135,241135,jshanley16,"Jshan’s Next Day Thoughts: Week 7

- Daniel Jones played efficient and smart yesterday, knew when to take the sack instead of play hero ball, yet also scrambled outside of the pocket at the right time. No turnovers, even though Engram was targeted 8 times.

- Daniel Jones’ 1 handed catch was beautiful. Best play of the game. But his route running was terrible and he stopped running, which is unacceptable. Keep those legs moving!

- Daniel Jones has a 69.696969% completion percentage

- Teams are finally committing to stopping DJ’s rushing ability. Devonte Booker’s TD came largely in part to a few of the Panthers defenders biting on DJ’s fake run to the opposite direction.

- Our defense finally came together. Secondary played well, did not allow over-the-top blown coverages.

- Azeez Ojulari had 2.5 sacks, 3 tackles for loss and 4 pressures yesterday. Puts him at 5.5 sacks on the season. First rookie with 5.5 sacks, 5+ TFL through their first seven games since Nick Boss’s rookie season

- Criticism from yesterday: the offense had most of their drives start in Panthers territory, yet we only put up 25 points. We NEED to get something out of our redzone offense. Anything.

- bonus take: Sam Darnold was benched yesterday because the Panthers are the mystery 3rd team in the Watson trade about to go down.

The people I was arguing with were using rudimentary and outdated stats that don’t really reflect what was actually happening. Both my “eye test” and DVOA + EPA show that McAdoo wasn’t doing much more than average at best.

Kubiak and McAdoo run completely different offenses. Kubiak comes from his fathers coaching tree which is rooted in a Shanahan style offense, whereas McAdoo originated under Mike McCarthy. McCarthy’s offense was so basic and bland and outmoded that it’s not even part of what the Cowboys do anymore, it’s all Kellen Moore. There’s no real defense for McAdoo.

29271,243507,243507,kcadia9751,"1) Ben McAdoo never had a top 10 offense -- not for 2 straight years, not for any 2 years. The Giants ranked 15th, 19th, 21st, 23rd in DVOA and 15th, 9th, 29th, 27th in EPA/play during his two years as OC and then two years as HC. If you're talking inferior metrics of yards and points, that's easily explained away bc those numbers were buoyed by unsustainable splash plays.

2) As someone who watched those teams very closely, I can say with unequivocal certainty that Ben McAdoo did not 'maximize' anyone on the Giants offense. Odell was a superstar with superstar gravity -- he was going to be great regardless of what was around him, and so he was. Nothing that McAdoo did maximized Odell -- Odell consistently made something out of nothing. The fact that Odell was turning these slants into big plays is a problem because slants are not supposed to be big plays, and the fact that Odell was making them is a miracle that is extremely unlikely to be replicated.",3.0,panthers,t3_s9htgi,False,1.0,Giants,2022-01-21T14:19:44Z,nygiants,0.0911032677103684

There’s a way to twist it so that it looks like McAdoo was adding value, or as you say, putting guys like OBJ in a position to succeed. And I’m just telling you from my experience closely watching the team, that is not what happened. Odell was an all world talent, and he would have blossomed regardless of what was going on around him. Telling Odell to run a slant or hitch 20 times a game is far from maximizing his talent as a field wide threat.

""I  was confused too so I looked into it..

The best and also funniest explanation I could find for it's popularity was an [interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/9irqb0/eli_manning_on_a_water_tower/e6lvw4l/) in the comments between /u/SaltyGeese and /u/BrettBrooks21:

Tyrod looked good, and it's a weird feeling knowing that if Danny gets injured, it's not a guaranteed clown show.... Basically I think we have a good chance of not having a negative yardage game this year. 

Defense had some good plays, and granted it's preseason,but it's a hell of a lot more fun watching and hoping we make a play, rather than just trying to limit their yardage in coverage, and I loved Graham. 

Although it's preseason, I realllly did not like that terrible effort by Golladay on that one red zone route, or even the go route a couple plays before. I get he doesn't get separation, but being able to see that lazy a route is embarrassing, borderline +1 on the clown show rating.

* Mayfield was, at the time, my #1 QB as he looked to be the most pro-ready and, keep in mind I don't follow other teams much, he helped the Browns become respectable. I don't think he's the best QB from that class as of right now, but it sounds like he may be in a good position to have a good year.
* Darnold was my #2 QB as I thought he had more potential than Rosen. I know a ton of people who were begging for the Giants to pick him and now seeing that he's now a backup QB kind-of makes drafting Saquon look better. (Not saying he was the best choice there. Just comparing him to Darnold.)
* Rosen being cut again is just amazing. Every report made it sound like he may be the best pure passer that year. The only reason I had him this low was because he had injury issues. I honestly thought he would have done better, so it's just so wild that he's been cut so many times. At worst one could have expected him to be a backup somewhere.
* Allen was a boom or bust case. Everything I read made it look like he was never going to be the star he is now. The biggest issue was accuracy: most QBs don't become more accurate when they move up to the NFL. He became significantly more accurate. I think he lucked into a good situation that allowed him to developed and now he's the clear #1 QB out of this draft.
* Jackson is another one who ended up in a good situation where he could develop into a good QB. His draft profile made him look like a boom/bust prospect.

This makes it sound like no other GM in the history of the NFL ever refused to pick up a phone to listen to an offer for a high draft pick. That sounds absolutely ridiculous. Just looking at a number of #1 overall draft picks, I can see a significant number of times where a GM would ignore the phone because the pick was ""their guy."" Think Elway, Aikman, Testaverde, P Manning, Bledsoe, etc. Looking at second overall, you can see names like LT, Dickerson, McNabb, Calvin Johnson. Are you telling me that if you're in need of a top-tier QB or you have an extremely talented guy as your top pick at 1 or 2, you're going to take the call because ""good GMs do that?""

My main point is this: without proof, this is merely a talking point to make DG look bad because he's an easy punching bag. Am I saying he was a good GM?

Second, regarding the first round picks, I think if I had to rank how likely each one would be resigned:

1. Thomas
2. Sexy Dexy - I think this comes down to money more than anything else. No injury history and has been performing. No, he's no Donald/Watt, but he is good.
3. Jones - This is very dependent on how he does, but QB is the most important position and if he shows enough, I think he gets the second contract regardless of his injury history.
4. Barkley - Again, depends on performance, but also health and money. We all know what he's capable of when healthy. If he can stay healthy and we get him on a pretty friendly deal, I think we keep him, but I find that scenario a bit unlikely.
5. Toney - Way too soon to really know, but it's the same scenario as Barkley except he's already been injured a lot in his first year. Yes, receivers are more valuable than RBs, but he needs to do more to prove he's worth a second contract.

The other way: because of the trade we get what should end up being an extra new starter this year and we got extra depth both last year and this year. That could set us up better in the long run as the 7th pick could be, preferably, a OT or EDGE.

So, if you want to know if it's worth it, think about this: because of that trade, w get 3 extra players with one that should be a day 1 starter. That's three extra chances to get quality players.

I won't name names, but you have to look at the guys who can make adjustments at the line, or even after the snap, really well and has the balls to go against what Garrett wanted to do. Some of our games only needed just a bit more and having a more experienced QB may give us just of a boost to get us those wins.

As for Jones himself, yeah, he's been in a situation that hasn't been the best. Do I think he's a good QB? Yes. Could he be better? Yes. Can he carry the team? Unfortunately, no. I think he's tried his best at times and sometimes it works. I suspect some of his issues are due to him having to play hero ball. I'm a firm believer that the offensive system has held him back and the OL is doing him no favors. I'm not sure how many people would look good with the plays Garrett was calling since there was no real attempt to get YAC most of the time. At the same time, contrary to some people, I don't believe he needs to be in a perfect situation to win.

If you were to ask me right now what I'd do with him, I'd give him one more year to finish out his rookie contract, but make a concerted effort to pair him with a better OC that would be better for him and improve the OLine. If he is still under performing, then I would have no issues with moving on.

Now, think about how many of those QBs were supposedly better than Eli. I swear every year it seemed like people where talking about some QB being the next great thing and he's outlasted damn near all of them. AND he has 2 rings. More than everybody not named Ben or Brady.

So yes, we should appreciate him as there was no QB quite like him. Humble. Didn't blame anyone but himself. Selfless player. Arguably the toughest SOB on the field.

I will say this much, I think I root more for the guys DG has drafted vs. Reese, but it's hard not to root for a guy named Coughlin.",2.0,nygiants,t3_qkfieo,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2021-11-01T15:14:01Z,nygiants,-0.0111752869844436
34197,299088,299088,sybrandy,">They had plenty of options at the time but decided not to wait and just go with Gettleman. A really big part of my takes is that the process that led us to where we are was flawed and needs to be changed, and Gettleman's hiring is a good example of that.

I don't remember the process, but the more I read about what people thinks are the real issues, the more I think this is less DGs fault and more ownership.

>He doesn't give any credence to more modern methods of decision making, things like analytics, positional value, etc.

I'm not sure that's an accurate statement. I understand the positional value part (Saquads), but I'm not 100% convinced he's not looking at things using modern methods. Specifically, look what he did with our defense where he got a done of CBs vs. getting high-end EDGE players and analytics said that was the better way to build a defense. Granted, it's not working 100% due to lack of good EDGE pressure, but to me, that's more of the analysis being a bit flawed. I'm now wondering if part of why LW has been having better seasons under Judge/Graham is because our secondary has been able to hold up better than the Jets. (No time to do that research)

>And while Shurmur and Bettcher did us no favors either, Gettleman also hired them.

Are you sure about that? I only ask because others have said that Mara is the one who hires the HC and not the GM.

>Sure maybe we can't say he's a ""bad GM"" but we can very clearly say that he has not been successful as the GM of the Giants. When you look around the league and see the Cardinals, Rams, Bills, Bengals, Browns, Chargers, 9ers, all turn their teams around and rebuild in the timeframe that Gettleman has been the Giants GM (the Rams obviously started theirs before Gettleman got there but their glowup is still unquestionable, the Bills and Chargers also have never had a pick higher than any of the ones the Giants had with Gettleman, the Cardinals, Bengals, Browns all had #1 picks, the 9ers had a #2), it seems pretty clear that what the Giants have done with Gettleman at the helm hasn't exactly worked.

Yeah, I can't argue against this too much.  My biggest argument is the Browns have sucked so hard for so long, they got a lot of good players before they got a competent HC. As for the other teams, I see what you mean, but outside of the Bills, I feel they're all a bit suspect. I don't see a SB run for any of them.

>So either he didn't get a good QB or he failed to build the roster around him. Both pretty big indictments on him.

I think he hit big on Jones, but I understand your second point. However, I think he may have actually done well in that respect IF we didn't have most of our offense injured. Personally, I've been down on Garrett for a while, but it seems like if he gets a fire lit under him, we can get shit done. If we get everyone back, I hope someone keeps the fire in his seat nice and hot.

>I unfortunately don't have the time to really count up all of his bad moves and compare them to other GMs, but just starting by listing his bad moves and think about how many of them were major, it should be blatantly obvious enough that he's not a good GM. It should be clear as day (not that it's not to you) that he needs to go. It shouldn't be about not being bad, it should be about being good. And I think we can all agree at this point that Gettleman's not good.

Yeah, this is getting harder and harder to argue against. I mean, I still think Shurmur and Bettcher screwed him over the first two years. Garrett hasn't helped either.

34198,299089,299089,sybrandy,"First, I think this is the best conversation I've had on Reddit.

Second, I get exactly what you're saying.  A clean break could be good.  It's just a crap shoot regardless of who you get. Looking back, DG was the safest choice as he at least had success before.

Third, just to keep this short, I'm a sort-of DG defender. I don't believe he's perfect, but I'm not sure if he's really as bad as some people thing.  I think he just gets compared to other situations where teams are turned around quickly and gets blamed when he doesn't do the same without knowing everything behind the scenes on both sides. I've also wondered about how much of his first two years was influenced by Shurmer and company as the last two drafts and offseasons feel differently to me. Personally, I'd rather have some concrete comparisons before I declare him a bad GM. He has done some good things and bad things, in hindsight, but other GMs make mistakes as well. How does he compare to others?

Just to be clear, I'm not saying he should stay. I'm just saying I'd like to have more concrete evidence that he's bad vs. listening to a bunch of anonymous people and talking heads saying he's bad. It's kind of like comparing QBs: yeah, with some it's obvious, but it can get difficult to say that one is better than the other when they're in two very different situations.

I wouldn't mind Abrams if he has the opportunity to do things ""his way"" and not the way things have been done.  He's sat behind two GMs and has seen the good and the bad. If he has learned from their mistakes, I'd be fine with him since he would already have a working relationship with a lot of people within in the org. Also, if Judge is not fired at the same time, it's more likely we maintain a good working relationship between the HC and GM.

As for Riddick, yeah, I don't want him anywhere near the team. His reaction to the OBJ trade was shit and if he hasn't gotten a job yet, I have to wonder why.

As for your specific wants:

1) Agreed. I was really hoping that the Giants, and maybe they did with Abrams, would have had someone under DG to learn from him and eventually take over. For all the hate he gets, he is an experienced GM with some success in Carolina, so he's not a bad person to learn from. Refer to my paragraph on Abrams above. But yes, we should get someone who can be with us for decades and not years. (That was my biggest issue with getting DG)

2) Good point.  I like it.

3) Agreed.

4) Agreed.

5) I get what you're saying, but I don't want to ignore a good candidate just because of who they worked under. For example, Abrams may have his own way he wants to do things that's very different from DG. Why shouldn't he get an opportunity to interview just because he currently works for the Giants? (Again, I don't know him.  Just using him as an example)

6) Initially, I was thinking ""Who cares"", but after rereading it, yeah, I get what you're saying. I mean, when it comes to drafting and scouting, we are stupid compared to DG, but we don't need to be made to feel stupid.

34259,299171,299171,sybrandy,"I'll try to be as objective as possible here.  tl;dr: No to bust, not sure if worth #2 pick yet, probably would have been better off overall with Nelson.

First, I don't believe he's a bust.  We've obviously seen his talent in action and know what he can do when healthy and under Schurmer.  Last year he got hurt before the OL started playing better and the run game took off.  Yeah, it may be that outside zone is not our forte, so that's a potential issue that's probably one of the reasons he hasn't done much this year.  Not 100% sure why he's not getting more touches this year.  It may be they're being careful with him, but it may also be that Garrett needs to figure it out.  That's just speculation.  Regardless, if his knee is healthy and holes can be opened up for him, he would be a true weapon.

Second, we'd have to wait until he retires to really know if he was worth the #2 pick, but was he the right pick is questionable.  There's the QB argument, but I think that would have been a bad idea.  Mayfield was the only safe pick and he was gone.  Darnold looks like he could be a bust.  Rosen is a bust.  Allen and Jackson were both risky picks at the time and were not good enough to be picked at #2 that year.  If I had to redo that draft, I probably would have gone with Nelson at 2.  (yeah, hindsight)  Getting the OL fixed would have been more beneficial than picking Saquon.  I love him as a player, but we saw what Gallman could do when the OLine did well and with Nelson opening up holes, our running game could have been pretty decent.  When Saquon was healthy, I think he played well despite the OL.  Huge difference.

Then during halftime instead of diving into specific plays, I would review the new game plan to get everyone on the same page.

I'm partly basing this on the last Saints SB where, IIRC, it was mentioned that the Saints had 3 game plans for the entire game: a 1st half plan, a 3rd quarter plan, and a 4th quarter plan to keep the opposing D on their heels.  Not sure if that was true, but it's an interesting concept.

Bradberry is a really good CB but his talent is being wasted on a bad team.  Inversely, this bad team is limiting it's potential for getting better because of cap restrictions and the percentage of that cap used on Bradberry. 

That being said, I think that the old adage ""defense wins championships"" only applies if your offense is already running on all cylinders.  

I wish I could find the clip of Bill Walsh where he stated that the only time to make a huge splash in free agency is when your team is already really good.  Adding that to add a big free agent to your team doesn't do anything for the team. What we did with Bradberry is the latter.  


I wish we would take that approach.  Focus on building an offense that can either compete against TODAY's players and systems or build a system that no one can figure out with players that can thrive within it (yes, ala Patriots... lol).
