You expect to suck for a couple years probably get the first pick in the draft your first year in. 2 to 3 years after drafting and playing around in FA with a huge salary cap available to you ought to make for a good team.

You have to pick up a veteran QB early and stopgap them into your franchise QB. This is where I wanna go draft and get a QB on that rookie contract. Don't want to overpay here just for a big name to come in and eat up your cap space as that is gonna be all this new team would have to influence players to join. 
I don't think your RB is gonna matter they burnout quickly you can easily draft a good one without expending much capital that still has his health.

I want a veteran TE that I'm spending a bit on it so my QB has a chuck down option in case of emergency.

Literally everyone does this shit and hates it. Really not an indication of ""drama behind the scenes""

Just you and the guy who is upset he was banned for personal attacks. Both of which are conversations that are going in circles, but I still see it as necessary to be open about this stuff.

Was trying to give you a better method to have an open conversation. It takes me a bit to see the responses on here, discord would be faster and easier to send pics of specific parts of automod.

You are aware that none of us were mods when you were right? Like it's a 100% different team from when you were a mod. 

> You all collectively take it way too seriously. Like all of this is unnecessary.

Dude I failed this subreddit for like 2 years, sorry that I'm trying to fix the mess I created. Added a whole new team, and I'm letting them call the shots behind the scenes.

> I would hate to see how you handle actual personal attacks because calling someone trash and telling them to fuck themselves is pretty tame.

We'll have to agree to disagree, because the majority of the people we've asked about this stuff agree that stuff like that needs to be removed.

Now if you want to have an actual open conversation about automod and stuff that should be relaxed, I'm all ears. But almost all of your comments seem to be ""you guys are too strict and that's why I quit as a mod"" which is odd because this is a completely different mod team from when you were a mod.

12320,121548,121548,Thecrimsoncreampuff,"Ok so here’s my take, Ridley has never been one to look for contact, he doesn’t break many tackles and he doesn’t make many contested catches which is fine because his route running and release makes up for all of that becuase of how good he is at it. He’s always given himself up and ran out of bounds or even ran sideways to avoid hits. On the first drive of the year vs the Eagles he took a shot from a linebacker and looked really shaken up and I got really worried looking at him on the sidelines(I was at the game) he looked very distressed tbh. I think right now he doesn’t want to get injured or hit as he’s a smaller guy. Arthur smiths playcalling needs receivers that take contact as he uses a lot of routes over the middle. Ridleys style of play is to get open on the outside or when he’s the only one on the deep middle not when there’s 1-2 other guys near that area. He’s not comfortable with taking hits and maybe on a different quick-strike scheme that fits his playstyle better he will be better",2.0,falcons,t3_rrnqip,False,0.0,Avery Williams,2022-01-01T09:59:34Z,falcons,0.0747947281441284

Gage is invisible. He’s a playmaker but he can’t play on the outside and AS doesn’t seem to want to adjust. Just like koetter last year, he’s also misutilized Hurst. Hurst has great speed and change of direction ability but sub par hands, he’s a vertical threat and doesn’t fit as a TE2 in smith’s scheme. All season he’s used hurst as a safety blanket which like I said he’s just not that. 12 personnel heavy offenses do work but our team is not suited for that. The teams that used 12 personnel the most last year were the Titans, Eagles, and Browns. All of these teams had great run blocking and had strong running game and play action.

**if we’re going by stats we have a clear winner in** *Calvin Ridley*!

Julio Jones has only ever scored more than 8 touchdowns in one season his whole career, Calvin Ridley in three full seasons has done it twice, I’m not sure I see the points you’re trying to make. 

Last season without Julio Jones, Ridley put up Julio Jones numbers, 90 1,374 15.3 9

Ridley finished the year tied with Green Bay’s Devante Adams for the fifth-most receiving yards in the league. He also had eight 100-yard games, which led the NFL. Ridley averaged 91.6 receiving yards a game in 2020, ranking third among wide receivers.

I’ll go back even farther if I have to julio Jones, alabama stats 179 2653 15. Calvin Ridley Alabama stats 224 2781 19. 

Before you go and say well of course Ridley did good his first three years he was playing with Julio, Julios first three years he was playing with Roddy White, Calvin Ridley is elite, our coaching and management is not. Calvin Ridley is one of 14 players in NFL history to have 3,000 receiving yards thru his first 3 seasons of their career and top 25 all time for most touchdowns in the first 3 seasons of a players career. Before Julio’s injury, despite not being able to score for whatever reason, he WAS(past tense) one of the top receivers in the league, which I won’t say Ridley is that high in my regards because there’s a clear difference in raw physical ability, but I’ll repeat Julio couldn’t score.. so really in the game of football it’s all about production.

Roddy White was great, Julio Jones was great, and believe it or not Calvin Ridley is great. I don’t think his payday will come anywhere near Julios, and Julio wasn’t replaced by Ridley, he was replaced by Pitts which was a genius move by the organization, if you watched the game you’ll have noticed Pitts lined up at WR considerably often, and he’s a generational talent, he’s 6’6” 240 pounds. He ran a 4.44 40 yard dash compared to Julio’s 4.39. Unnoticeably slower. He has an 83 3/8 wingspan. Pitts' wingspan is the longest of any tight end or wide receiver of the past 20 years. He’s literally uncover-able, truly. If Ridley’s has outperformed Julio up to this point, at every level of his career, college and the pros, and year 4 is when julio and Roddy white actually showed up and reached their true potential, what makes you think Calvin Ridley is going to regress?? If anything he clearly has room for improvement, and guess what buddy he definitely isn’t getting traded this year, and I highly doubt he gets traded next year, his cap hit this year is only 3,468,000 and 11 million next years is a steal, I could see us getting a really good deal on him with a contract extension too. It’s clear to me that you have something **personal** against Calvin Ridley, you are the definition of a toxic fan, let me guess you also want to get rid of *Matt Ryan*???

Watson seriously benefited from horrible defensive play in Houston, which forced the offense to rely on passing to “keep up” with other teams and padded his passing stats (similar to Matt Ryan and Matt stafford’s situation for years). 

Lastly, the Browns offense relies on Chubb and hunt and I don’t expect stefanski to completely ditch his offensive scheme.

Stay with Kyle Pitts (Best Player in the Draft other than Lawrence, Can’t miss HOF Talent) Although the Idea of getting QB sounds great, I feel Matt will have some of his best years in Arthur Smith’s scheme and I love the 2023 NFL Draft class which will have QB’s DJ Uiagalelei and Bryce Young, who will be future NFL superstars, and the idea of making a run for one of those players via trade. They also fit the timeline for which Matt will be here for the end of his career which will probably end around the time the two prospects declare for the draft.) 

40. Trevon Moerhig (Grant is a great safety, but his age suggests his upside won’t be as high as Moerhig will be in the next 5+ years. Moerhig might be the best safety in the class and his potential is sky high for the future. Also very versatile and can play Slot and Deep. )

68. Ronnie Perkins (Great Edge Rusher and Run Stopper, provides immediate value to the DL, and is a plug and play starter Day One)

108 and 114: Keep Darren Hall and Drew Dalman (I like the potential which Hall can bring to our secondary, and is a high IQ player who also is a ball hawk on the boundary. Dalman was probably the best remaining interior lineman left, and has a good chance of starting on the OL in the next 2-3 years) 

148: Jamar Johnson would’ve been a steal at this point of the draft and even though Ta’Quon Graham should be a good rotational piece on the DL, Jamar Johnson is a safety you can trust can give you quality snaps from day one. He and Moerhig would be a great duo, and solidify your safety group for the next decade.)

182: Deonte Brown would be a high upside pick here at interior OL, and coming away with him and Dalman would be one hell of an outcome for the draft)

14531,149090,149090,d1dOnly,"IMO, Fontenot has a lot of work to do to not go down as a very bad GM. Whenever I point to the Julio Jones trade, I always get the same response: ""He's not even on a team right now."" Rewind the clock 1 year. It's 2 weeks before the 2021 NFL Draft. If I told you that all of the following happened, you'd say the Falcons got robbed.

* Julio Jones traded for a 2nd round pick.
* Matt Ryan traded for a 3rd round pick.
* Drafted a TE at #4 overall with both Justin Fields, Mac Jones, Penei Sewell, & Micah Parsons still on the board.
* Attempted to court a QB with sexual abuse allegations, thus burning the relationship with the current franchise QB, and then failing to close out that trade.
* Saw projected starting LG Josh Andrews go down with an injury, and instead of trying to acquire a vet to fill the hole, was convinced to let 3rd round rookie Jalen Mayfield start in the spot, where he was rated as the worst OG in the NFL.
* After losing starting WR1 to gambling suspension (can't blame him there), he let the next best WR on the team leave in free agency, and instead signed a 29 year old journeyman WR and a WR that looked promising in 2019, but in the last 2 seasons has played 16 games and caught just 17 balls.
* After trading away Matt Ryan, he went out and signed a QB that worked with the current HC for 1 season and was benched that year. Mariota got to watch the team go 7-3 while he rode the pine (they were 2-4 with him).

Right now, I have a very low opinion of Terry Fontenot as a GM. He still has time to prove me wrong, and I'll be happy if he does, but since he's been hired it feels like he has continuously bungled everything.",20.0,nfl,t3_u3qc4g,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-04-14T15:48:20Z,falcons,0.0351570037283584
14532,149092,149092,d1dOnly,"Looking at Corral and the other QBs in this draft, I still hold steady that I would not take any of them prior to the end of the first round.

* Willis - Makes some questionable decisions, has a tendency to miss open receivers, and the competition level frighten me off. Needs to go to team where he can sit and learn for a year or two, otherwise you're just throwing him to the wolves and he'll never progress.
* Pickett - Feels a bit like a 1 year wonder to me. Something about his throwing style just feels off to me. I think he's the most pro ready in this class, but the team that takes him needs to have a good OL already in place or he's going to be hearing footsteps by the end of year 2.
* Ridder - Honestly, my favorite QB in this class. However, that doesn't mean I would take him early on. I feel like the football IQ is there, but that throwing motion is concerning. I feel like there's a chance at the NFL level that DBs could start hawking on him with how long his windup is. Honestly, if I'm drafting Ridder, I'm going to consider sitting him for a year and working with a specialist to see if his throwing motion and time to release can be improved.
* Corral - He looks like a strong breeze would blow him over, and at the NFL level he'll need to show he can take getting hit. Add to that a problem with throwing easy picks and I'm skeptical of his future prospects.
* Howell - This time last season, Howell was viewed as an near lock for first QB off the board, and probably was going to go in the top 3. Now, there's a possibility he's the 5th or 6th QB off the board and most don't see him as more than a long time NFL backup. Short and stocky, a slow release, and a problem with overthrows, Howell will likely take 2 seasons to make it to starter level, unless a team has no other options. I think the 2020 Howell is still in there somewhere, but he'll need a coach that can really help draw it out.

For my team in particular, I want them to go DL-DL-WR with their first 3 picks, and then see what is available. However, knowing the NFL, I feel like we'll end up trading back into the tail end of the first round for one of the 5 QBs listed above.",8.0,nfl,t3_u3ial6,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-04-14T11:25:52Z,falcons,0.0193088617324011

She has made it pretty clear how much she loves Atlanta and doesn't want to move their family on her social media. Because of this, I actually think Ryan will be getting an extension this offseason that will do 2 things.

1. Free up cap space the next 2 seasons.
2. Serve as Ryan's final pro contract.

It's not a popular opinion, most people seem to think we have to move on from Matt, but I still think he can lead this team. This year was just a worst case scenario for him:

* OL has been garbage
* Run game near nonexistent
* His #1 target asked to be traded
* His #2 target left the team to deal with his mental health
* His #3 WR missed time early on in the season
* He's learned another new offensive system

Players: as far as young talent goes, Anderson is one I'm looking forward to.

FTS: for the most part it's just petty rivalry, especially since we've both been historically bad.

Another being that he was present at the Iron Bowl which raised questions from fans about why he's ok enough to support that team from the sidelines but not his own.

Through the first six or so weeks, everyone watching Falcons games could tell you he wasn't playing as well as he did last year. People questioning whether Julio leaving did a number on him etc. And then after around week 8 he's done for the season because of mental health issues he needs to address. To many fans that probably solved the questions they were asking, but according to others -Tinfoil hat alert- he had done this to accrue the minimum amount of active games of 7 before getting put on the NFI list in order to not have to repeat a season and get the year over with to move on.
