My advice? Put some happy brain chemicals into your system. A *huge* reason as to why I was depressed was because I was constantly smoking and drinking. When it all comes down to it, depression is the result of your brain lacking a balance of healthy chemicals. Serotonin, dopamine - the good stuff. Your body produces these chemicals naturally, but when you start to drink and/or smoke, it stops producing said chemicals because you’re receiving them artificially and in massive amounts - so why should your body continue to do the work when it’s getting it for free? The thing is, now your body is out of wack. The *hardest* part is when you finally decide to do yourself a favor and put it all down. It’ll get worse before it gets better, but it *will* get better.

Like I may be reading this incorrectly, but I think the only starting quarterback he ever recruited was Tebow. Josh Harris and Alex Smith were already at Bowling Green and Utah, respectively, when he took those jobs.

He even walked into Ohio State with Braxton Miller already established. 

From all accounts, he creates this locker room full of toxicity that eventually implodes, and he conveniently has a ""health issue"" or ""family issue"" that requires you step down right before it does. 

And I think he thought that drafting Trevor Lawrence would buy him time to win a championship before things blew up in the face again, and make him one of the few people to ever win championships in both college and pro football.

They're the same dumbasses that picked Tennessee and Kansas City (as well as Dallas and Green Bay) because they want big places and big names.

Another thing is that Burrow is not playing the endorsemant game like the NFL wants him to do. There is no cute 'Joe Price' for State Farm, or Joe at the Heisman House. Why? Because he's supporting local small businesses or his charity instead. And because he doesn't have the same exposure, the NFL refuses to back him and in turn Cincinnati.

Just keep winning. Just keep getting in the playoffs. The NFL wanted St Louis to move back to LA. Right after Katrina, the NFL held a gun to Saints ownership to move to San Antonio and it got shut down because the Saints became successful a few years later and kept winning and getting in the playoffs and then won a Super Bowl.

Don't let the narrative get to you. Bengos, keep going meow.

9538,96189,96189,Mchead22,"Wow. So many bad takes in one post.
1. There QB situation was good coming into the season, their starter went 5-2 with a 14-3 TD/INT ratio. That situation got worse because of injuries throughout the season that led to starting 4 different QBs. If those injuries happen to teams with MVP caliber QBs like Packers, Bucs, Chiefs are we talking about them having one of the worst QB situation in the league?
2. Michael Thomas had 440 yards in 2 years because he played a total of about 5 games. Again, its injuries. This has nothing to do with the cap, which is what this whole thread is about.
3. Those pockets of dead money are not that huge, and they’re pushed back to future years where the cap is gonna rise. It really puts no strain on the situation.
4. If a team has a good core that it wants to keep, they’re going to get older because they’re humans. But that doesnt mean that they arent still drafting and getting younger where they can. They still use their draft picks and continue to draft well. They got a number 2 corner in the third this year, and likely a starting LB in the second. In the first they drafted a DE that could take over for Cam Jordan soon. They’re doing what every good team does; keep good players and bring in more good players.
5. Everyone has these.

I really don’t understand why people think the roster is so horrible. They set a record for number of starters this year due to a huge amount of injuries, including 4 different starting QBs and they STILL almost made the playoffs. Sure they need to fix some things on offense, but every team has areas to address. This narrative that their cap strategy is hindering their ability to stay competitive is lazy and misinformed.

So Saints win that trade right off the bat.  Now in regards to #19 for the OT.  That's always trickier as you are betting future capital on the current year, typically to fill a hole.  For judging the trade at the moment, I typically will agree to follow one of two rules with people to save on too much arguing.  The first is the lowest pick of the current round or the pick at the same position in the following round.  There is a definite benefit to the team that gets to draft in the current draft over waiting draft a player in a future draft, it might not always show dividends in the first year, but they'll likely see a higher return sooner due to developing a player they know for sure that is there that they like over hoping for it in the future.

So #19 is 875 and giving the highest value for the trade IMO '23 1st is 590 and '24 2nd is 270 for 860, so the Saints come out ahead there too.  Obviously, something could happen next year and the Saints do poorly and the picks will have a valuation higher than what they gave up, but that's part of the game.  The Saints might end up paying a premium for their guy, but it was made knowing that they are getting their guy and not hoping for them to be there the next year, not to mention the challenges of going into the season with a position not addressed.

There's no cartoon bird prancing about on the box cover, there's no commercial with Barney and Fred getting in fist fights over a bowl of Grape Nuts, you get a box full of cereal and that's it. It's not even a big box filled with air and prizes, it's just a pound of wheat and barley with a picture on the front.

What I have here is living proof that Grape Nuts is truly life changing. A four pound box of Grape Nuts, in all it's glory. Any other box of cereal this size would weigh half as much, which makes them half as good. There's something to be said about a cereal with the same density as sand.

Just holding the box gives you a sense of power like holding a baseball bat or a meat cleaver. There is some serious loft to this cereal. I could kill a man if I had to with this and I'm not even joking.

Another thing I like about Grape Nuts is that it sinks right to the bottom of the bowl. There's nothing glamorous about it, no lame snaps or crackles, no different colors, no marshmallows, just a pile of food sitting at the bottom of a bowl of milk.
Eating the food is an adventure within itself. Bite too soft and you aren't gonna break a one. Bite too hard and you might chip a tooth. It really is a wild man's cereal.

I'm not even going to talk about the taste of Grape Nuts, because there isn't any. If there wasn't milk you would swear that you were eating gravel, the only different being that gravel might soften up a bit.

The very best part of Grape Nuts is after the whole eating experience. If you've ever accidentally swallowed a rock you know what it's like to eat a bowl of Grape Nuts.

1c-a. The pitcher is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, batter, that prohibits the batter from doing, you know, just trying to hit the ball. You can't do that.

1c-b. Once the pitcher is in the stretch, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, ""I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna tag you out! You better watch your butt!"" and then just be like he didn't even do that.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to pitch and then don't pitch, you have to still pitch. You cannot not pitch. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, throwing motion of the ball, and then, until you just throw it.

1c-b(2)-a. Okay, well, you can have the ball up here, like this, but then there's the balk you gotta think about.

I said in their prime, when he left Indy he was past his prime, he had 2/3 good years left and Denver carried him to his second SB win. 

Packers for the most part are also not a good team. Rodgers/Adams/Jones are about it on offense, they have a couple decent guys on defense, but without Rodgers that team is not a good team. And the games he has been out the past few years are proof of it. 

Like I said, these guys willed their teams into wins. When you get into the playoffs you need MUCH more than the better QB, you need to have the better team, otherwise you won’t make it to the SB. Deshaun hasn’t even proven consistently he can be in that first group to even just get a mediocre/bad team to the playoffs.

Even if it was, you need a good team to win anything, what we’re going to have to give up we are losing a lot of what makes us good, and with draft capital going too, less chances to fill those holes. 

Some guys can will their teams to wins. Saw Peyton, Brady do it for years. Even Brees willed the worst defenses of all times to 7 wins. Watson isn’t a proven anything in the NFL, not to mention I can’t remember the last guy to willingly sit out a year of football come back and play anywhere close to how they were before they sat out. 

QB is the biggest position, but Peyton, Brees, Marino, Kelly, Young, Rodgers are all time greats who won 1 or less super bowls because the teams they had around them were bad for their prime years.  We can maneuver the cap with the best of them, but we still are limited because of it, trading away 3 firsts, multiple seconds, and the good young players that are rumored to be in this deal to get a 27 (when the league year starts) year old QB who is as big of a shit as he is, when he’s only ever won one playoff game, been to the playoffs only twice, sat out an entire season (what real competitor can actually do that?), and will cost us $30m in cap space, on top of the fact that if history tells us anything in a year or two he’ll hold out again for even more money… stupid.

My unpopular opinion is that we were beyond spoiled for 16 years with Brees and Payton. The fan base latched onto Teddy as a successor because he didn’t lose us games, then latches onto Jameis for the same reason. Realistically, we may go through a few more QBs before we find the next guy.

Bieniemy - Chiefs fans seem to not want him gone. Andy Reid coaching tree has moderate success. High ceiling. The dudes past is a lot of red flags. 

Glenn - coached here was highly regarded. Campbell brought him over, no talent on defense and coached the worst defense in the league last year. Players love him, coaches love him and will play for him. 

Flores - 2 winning seasons but couldn’t get Miami over the hump. Active legal issues with the NFL, reports about him after leaving Miami are concerning. Belichick coaching tree historically fails. 

Leftwich - highly regarded and credited to the success of the Bucs offense. Play calling offensive coordinator. Worked with Jameis before. Little success before Brady got there and brought an all star team with him, Bucs fans seem to be okay with him going. High ceiling, low floor. 



Honestly, each guys has an argument, each one has draw backs. I personally would want an offensive minded coach to take over.

Trautman and Ertz are similar in size and they way they play, so he could learn a lot from him. 2 TE sets would be really good especially for Jameis who can sling it and will help play action with the defenses stacking the box against the run. Johnson looks promising, and I trust that we wouldn’t waste him, but right now we have 2 TEs that are promising, with little evidence they can produce 16 weeks. 

Getting a known commodity, and a lot of depth behind him is great for the offense, especially considering we have Kamara as our only proven threat week 1.

Trevor does have more passing yards and TDs, but sacks are the same and Taysom adds on a good chunk of rushing yards to even out the yardage argument imo.

I do wish this was broken down by quarters though, that'd be interesting to look at

They both have their benefits, though. Trevor was more willing to throw and had better accuracy, where as Taysom's running ability forces the defense to account for him and could open up receivers. 

Negatives are they both lack decision making skills and can't read defenses. I think Trevor's decision making is worse and Taysom has pretty bad accuracy at times. Both QBs are very middling tbh",2.0,saints,t3_s5kil3,False,0.0,Kamara,2022-01-16T15:58:44Z,saints,-0.0159842956961591

17034,160623,160623,TomorrowMayRain065,"Lately we have played 3 roles with out safeties. Marcus Williams as a deep FS, Malcolm Jenkins as a SS, and CJGJ as a slot corner (thought listed as a safety). The FS covers deep zones, the SS in the box and on players like TEs, and the slot self explanatory along with some SS type things. All of these guys move around and are versatile but those are the basic archetypes. PJ Williams can do all of these a little.

Unfortunately, at this point there's no one we can forseeably obtain who can replace the true center-fielding range of Marcus Williams. This means we will probably shift our roles a little bit and have two hybrid safeties moreso than a true FS and more of a SS, if I had to guess (we already did this a good bit because we play a good bit of quarters). That role requires less speed which is what is missing without Marcus, it more relies on a little man ability and lots of awareness, which fits our guys all well. Still, for FS, Marcus Maye is the best option we have, and PJ has had work at FS for us, too. That leaves the SS spot. Right now that's probably whichever of Maye/PJ isn't at free and Sorensen as the next in line. However, we could move CJGJ there, where he has been good in limited snaps, and play PJ/Roby/2nd round pick Taylor in the slot.

I think the current vision is PJ at free and Maye at strong because of Dennis Allen's comments, though I think it's a little puzzling because Maye is definitely the rangiest guy we have now, though he is a big hitter which is valuable at strong. Maye is also injury prone and probably facing a suspension for DUI.

Mathieu, like you point out, is a SS. For the Chiefs, he was almost exactly what Malcolm Jenkins was for us. He is no longer fit to play deep in coverage like when he was younger but brings a lot of juice. If we brought him in, we could pretty cleanly roll with Maye/PJ in place of Marcus Williams, Mathieu in place of Jenkins, and keep CJGJ in the slot.",17.0,saints,t3_uffwtn,False,0.0,Shield,2022-04-30T13:40:33Z,saints,0.0276763946022953

(Assuming Jameis re-signing or securing a similar non-splash, but stable, short-term QB option)

Daxton Hill -- Deep FS replacement for Marcus Williams; has the range there that the FA choices don't. Safety and slot position versatility. (Update: we literally just signed Marcus Maye instead, oops lol)

Christian Watson -- The WR2 investment everyone is clamoring for. Deep threat and another RAS monster lol.

JoJo Domann -- Having gotten an extra pick when I would've been okay with Hill at 18 straight up (though, I understand this is the sort of move you can game on a mock draft sim that would be less likely to happen irl), just swinging on a really fascinating prospect. Safety? who has played LB and slot. Could maybe fill in to Jenkins' or Kwon's roles later on.

Max Mitchell -- Whether or not Armstead is back, a solid prospect to develop at right tackle. I think Hurst can start for now if Armstead leaves, but we will need to start to replenish the ranks both for depth and long-term.

Kyle Phillips -- Another WR dart, more of a slot guy.

Jelani Woods -- Athlete at TE. Hopefully one of he and Trautman can eventually grow into the starting role and the other, Juwan Johnson, and Vannett round out a decent group.

Pierre Strong -- Speed at RB and reinforcements for Kamara's likely suspension. I like Tony Football but don't really like the looks of him and Ingram alone there, especially as more of a defense/running game team.

Chigoziem Okonkwo -- Interesting FB/H-back type. Could give additional help/another dart throw at TE while at the very least upgrading... Adam Prentice? and letting Taysom stay very flexible.

Thomas Booker -- Needed DI depth. If you haven't noticed, a lot of these later round picks are informed by Brett Kollman's latest video.

17151,160923,160923,TomorrowMayRain065,"Well, I don't think it would be like 2013 just because it's likely to be a little more gradual and we have actual young, or just other, talent on defense now.

I'm not unsatisfied with Cam right now, but I think his decline has officially begun. He's more of a high end number 2 than an All-pro elite edge rusher this season and last. He's a super sound player in all phases so I expect his decline to continue to be very gradual and he's locked up here for awhile anyway. Knocking on wood that health doesn't hinder his development or completely destroy his availability going forward, but we're already seeing Davenport take over as a more impactful rusher. Payton Turner is a carbon copy of Cam archetype-wise, so hopefully he can at least offer what a declined Cam can as a pocket pusher and run defender. Not too concerned.

Jenkins is interesting, he's clearly a late-career version of himself but, as he shows right now, can make up for a lot of physical decline with his intelligence and savvy. So I have no idea if he might retire after this season or in like 5 years. Box safety is generally an easier position to replace, plus the Saints have been great drafters of safeties, so I'm not concerned as far as on the field--it's not like Jenkins is an irreplaceable All-pro impact currently, either, anyway. What I'm more curious about is how, exactly, we go about replacing him, because CJGJ could slide into full-time safety, but that would open up a hole at slot corner, which is another usually replaceable position. Just going off if Jenkins were to retire tomorrow, we could field either:

Lattimore (OCB) - Adebo/Roby (OCB) - Roby/PJ Williams (NCB) - Marcus Williams (FS) - CJGJ (SS) 

or

Lattimore (OCB) - Adebo/Roby (OCB) - CJGJ (NCB) - Marcus Williams (FS) - PJ Williams (SS).

Basically, I'm curious whether our staff sees a role at safety as advantageous for utilizing CJGJ's abilities, which is something I'm interested in seeing, or if we will convert/draft/sign a new SS and leave CJGJ in the nickel. The thing is, both Jenkins and CJGJ are more versatile than being ""just"" box safeties, so if the choice is a street FA at NCB or SS with CJGJ in the other spot, I want CJGJ at safety. Also, though, who knows who we retain (Marcus Williams could be gone) and possibly add, so this is kind of a pointless rambling. Not too concerned.

Demario is the hardest to replace. He is the only one of these guys who is still undoubtedly in their prime. While Cam and Jenkins are important leaders, Demario is the only one who brings something genuinely irreplaceable in that department, as well. Linebacker is not as premium of a position as something like edge rusher or corner--the Kwons and Werners and Bauns of the world are not the hardest thing ever to find--but having a transcendently good one is very rare and really ties together a defense. We could survive without Demario, relying on the the guys aforementioned or other players of similar good-not-great caliber, but actually replacing him is very unlikely unless we get very very lucky with a draft pick (or with another free agent from the Jets). Luckily, I'd think his career probably still has a decent lifespan; at worst, he could decline and remain a serviceable starter for another 3 years or so. Semi-concerned, but only because we'll probably be ""only"" fine, not have an All-pro, once he's too old/gone.

Future leaders? CJGJ jumps out as someone that is young, vocal, energetic, and probably staying here. Lattimore, Davenport, and Marcus Williams project to continue to be core pieces if we retain them all, but I don't know if their personalities are as large. I get the impression that Onyemata is quieter but he's also a great veteran. Kwon brings a lot of energy but I don't know if he's here long term.

I guess I don't see why not bring Kwon in if the price is not a problem ($4 mil max?) because unless we're otherwise planning on signing like, Steven Nelson AND Geno Atkins, there aren't really other people out there we need all our ~$10 mil for, and it doesn't look like the team has interest in saving it to let it roll over lol. 

I agree losing the STs we did is unfortunate but afaik these ST LBs aren't big standouts or anything so I don't mind sacrificing continuity by cutting ONE of them to add a good player in Kwon. I just don't think it makes much of a difference, I think someone else would step up and I trust our ST culture and coaching.

The thing is, I don't see the aforementioned UDFA-type LBs as even decent backups on defense, so even if Kwon misses time or is more of a role player, I would appreciate being 4 deep with LBs who can make some contribution. There you have Demario and Kwon starting, because you're right, it's nickel and dime most of the time, add Werner in at M or W in base and maybe rotate him with Kwon into some starting time, have Baun as a backup, role-player (blitz packs?), and STer, and keep 1 of the designated STers. 

I think that lines up about right with the skill level of the players, too, rather than pushing Werner and Baun into bigger roles already, though that wouldn't be the end of the world if we don't add Kwon. I agree that Kwon isn't a must have or without weaknesses. You're right about the improvements our secondary made being key and about Kwon's sloppiness against the run, but none of the other LBs bring the speed that he can, and I really like the energy he added while taking some pressure off Demario. I don't think adding a player who makes us better and fills a different profile says much about Werner and Baun who should be allowed to still be growing anyway. Kwon is not a long term solution and they might be. Btw iirc I read Underhill post that they are looking to have Baun play W too so they are definitely in on him being full off ball, which is another reason he may still need to develop.",3.0,saints,t3_oo9n38,False,0.0,Shield,2021-07-20T21:34:30Z,saints,0.0526003006051369

Bringing Kwon back cheaply has no downside. It's undeniable that pairing him with Demario raises the ceiling of the defense significantly. Our defense has gotten worse from losses and we will need to lean on them to win games at least as much as last year.

Hansen, Ellis, Dowell, etc are not the type of players who get to be roster locks over an addition like Kwon simply due to some tenure on ST.

17228,161103,161103,TomorrowMayRain065,"Eh I guess we have ""depth"" now that we brought Crawley back but let's look, I don't think our situation is as good as you propose now that Janoris is gone. Cutting him pretty much leaves a gash in our secondary.

CB1: Lattimore. Great.

NB: CJGJ. Great. PJ Williams is good depth but both of these guys are really not relevant to the outside CB discussion.

CB2: Either Adebo, a third round rookie who probably needs time, or PRob, an old corner who has mostly been successful in the slot. Not great. I'm excited about Adebo and think he is a great option long term but relying on a mid-round rookie to start is suspect.

Otherwise, we have Crawley (below replacement level), Haley (below replacement level, but young), Keith Washington (young, but a practice squader so far)... none of which should be locks to make the team.

So, yes, we have a number of options, but I think most people would argue that depth and experience is lacking. CB2 is a major question, and if one of your secondary spots is weak, that is a particularly exploitable weakness. Adebo or PRob *could* succeed there but have equal potential to be liabilities. Adebo, PRob, and PJ would all make good 4th CBs (Crawley, Haley, Washington would make good 5ths), so we have lots of dudes, but none of them are good enough to lock down a starting spot.

With $11 mil free now (ntm that that's $11 mil of *Mickey's* money) we can sign any CB who is still a free agent. Loomis has explicitly said that we would like more depth at CB but cap is tight, and that if cap were different, the decision on Janoris may not have been the same. The Saints have Kris Richards from the LoB staff as their new defensive backs coach, and afaik Sherman's parameters are probably that he wants to compete/work with a well-run organization, and that he's interested in following coaches he likes (like, if not us, I've seen the Jets with Saleh mentioned a lot). The Saints have been trying to get a CB in the Sherman mold of our own since we brought in Brandon Browner, lol, and we know that the Saints like players with smarts and/or attitude. Sherman could be an amazing mentor for Lattimore (consistency), CJGJ, and Adebo (not too far in style from Sherman).

The downside to Sherman is that he's a bit physically limited at this point and not very good in man, which we run at a reasonable rate. He's still a very good player, though, and we have the ability to stick Lattimore alone and divert support from safeties or whatever elsewhere. Like I pointed out previously, some of the CBs we are looking at starting now make questionable starters but nice depth, so maybe they play certain roles.

Honestly, I think Steven Nelson might be an even better option on the field, being younger and more versatile, but Sherman seems more up the Saints' alley and brings notable intangibles, and there is clearly room, need, and interest in a vet CB signing. There really just aren't a lot of names left but Gareon Conley or Kevin Johnson in a lower tier could be worth a shot but aren't gonna be clear upgrades to CB2 like Sherman or Nelson.

17237,161120,161120,TomorrowMayRain065,"Drew Brees -- QB
 
Jerry Rice -- WR

Randy Moss -- WR

Rob Gronkowski -- TE

Jonathan Ogden -- OT

I want Brees because I'm a Saints fan but Rodgers or Manning would work, pretty much a push and Brees is just my favorite to watch. I miss his prime and I want to see it again. Early 2010s versions; 2011 Brees in particular. Elite awareness and anticipation, efficiency, ball placement, pocket sense, explosiveness, you love to see it. Any of these guys were capable of dropping 50 with, by these standards, just ""good"" weapons, like it was nothing on a night where they were fully locked and loaded, and now we're going to get them so unbelievable help. 

I really wish I had space for more OL, but I don't think it's worth sacrificing the elite weapons, as we're going for absolute downfield insanity, not a balanced, sustainable offense in the traditional sense. Line is just as important as weapons, but it's more of a function of the unit compared to the impact an individual skill position player can have. Since the surrounding team is guaranteed to be average, the line shouldn't hold us back, especially with an elite QB navigating the pocket and reading the defense. Still, I'm thinking an unbelievable tackle will probably be more helpful than a third receiver or a RB. Again, knowing we have consistently average players otherwise is huge; they'll look better thanks to these surroundings, and RB is known to be a position where that's especially true. We don't have time to run the ball anyway, we just need players that can handle the resulting heavy coverage, and I'm not sure the best pass-catching backs are worth for this scenario. Knowing Brees, interior pressure is a weakness, so it crossed my mind to get him some elite IOL like he did during this time irl with Jahri Evans and Carl Nicks, but I think you just have to go with a tackle, especially since I can only add one guy. And it's not like this opponent has Aaron Donald.

We have bona fide unguardable players to stress every level of the defense with Gronk, Rice, and Moss. I think the TE mismatch is too good to pass up, and Gronk would be like an even better Graham connection for Brees over the middle of the field. Red zone scoring is dealt with. Rice is the number one type, always open, chain mover, etc... I'm started watching the NFL in the 2010s but Rice seems so dominant that being among the ""bigger, faster, stronger"" current game will translate fine. Pairing Brees with such a technician leads to great things. Gotta get the best deep threat in Moss, and I think he will offer a lot of what people are going for with Calvin Johnson's physical dominance and Tyreek's speed. I'm salivating thinking about Brees' perfect fades to Colston and deep shots to the likes of Devery Henderson and Robert Meachem being elevated to these guys.

Oh and I don't think there's any way you can pick defense. Even the best ballhawks ever aren't reliably getting you more than one or two in a game. In fact, as plenty of people have pointed out, you probably want to cheese the defensive playcalling and let them score. There are probably plenty of offenses capable of putting up the necessary points, the issue is just gamescript allowing for it, which we will manipulate by never playing defense and never doing anything sensible or letting up on offense.

You could argue Adebo is a similar investment one round later in the 3rd but I think he's just understood as a little more of a project, and between Sherman rumors, Crawley signing, and Loomis saying they want more depth at CB, I think it follows that Adebo is seen as less of an instant answer than Werner, even if (imo) he's the more exciting pick long-term.

He provides a baseline at LB (if on the field) so won't sink your defense. Injury concerns coming out of the draft have persisted and have hampered his development and at this point what you see is what you get.

When we brought in Kwon Alexander, Anzalone stopped seeing the field, and it was night and day for our defense due to the explosive speed and coverage ability Kwon brought, as well as freeing Demario to have less responsibility (although I have heard the reasonable argument that we would've been slightly more stout against the run without Kwon, who is more aggressive than Anzalone; it's a sacrifice you make since coverage and range matter more than tackling RBs in the box and we were great in run D anyway). We were only ever playing two linebackers so this is less an indictment of Anzalone, more a demonstration that he's not the answer if you're aiming for any better than serviceable.

I'm not mad and I'm glad to have these players, I see the process they had for all the picks, and I'm not pretending to know better, but I was expecting more, especially with all the buzz there was going in. The selections were all very ""Saints,"" though.

Looks like we raised the floor of the team and did address areas we needed to. Just not very exciting, and I think there was the potential to be splashier and still secure the solidity they did. I wonder if A) they think we are closer to contending than fans do and thus just want to make sure holes are filled with okay players, or B) they think there is a bit of a longer haul rebuild coming and in a COVID year they would rather keep up a foundation of sure contributors rather than swing for talent. But, why not swing then, if we're rebuilding, the risk of bottoming out is fine? Or, of course, they think they took a bunch of all-pros and my perception as a fan is shit. Maybe part of what's weird is that the top 2 picks were a DE and LB that were perceived as reaches, and even if the picks seem to end up checking out, the Saints don't have amazing track records drafting at those positions.

Honestly just have to reserve judgement on Turner. I did not know much about him so I was pretty befuddled in the moment. I totally see what they see after some research, plus there wasn't an amazing board for us (I would've wanted Samuel Jr., who it doesn't seem like the team loved, JOK, which, same, he had the medical issue, or Barmore). It's still surprising and gives a little bit of Davenport vibes. B-/C+

Werner is not a pick I loved. He seems like he has a high likelihood of being role-wise like Anzalone without the availability concerns. That's useful, but I wanted more in round 2, especially after we just saw how night and day it was replacing an Anzalone with speed, coverage, and athleticism at LB with Kwon coming in. JOK had just went and I would've loved to have gone with Monty Rice or even Nick Bolton. Again, hey, I'm confident he'll be a contributor, so I'm not mad. I'm just whelmed. C

Adebo is my favorite pick. Would've been glad to get him in round 2 and it was nice to finally see the aggression we were being told was coming all along lmao. This is also about the closest you can get to ensuring plugging the need at starting CB without going there earlier. A+

Book, I mean, I can't actually fault throwing cheap darts at (backup) QB, even more so in the hands of Payton, but again seems to leave value on the board which we could sure use at IDL, WR, TE, or even more CB/LB while we get Book later or sign Mullens or just accept Siemian as our 3rd stringer or something. It's one thing if we still had Brees and NEEDED to make sure someone with a pulse could throw the ball around and keep our hopes alive but I think that mode has passed. Maybe they legitimately see Book as more than that, which...alright, I don't know what they know, but I'm not sure about it. C-

17271,161214,161214,TomorrowMayRain065,"Your basic point that Payton is as good an evaluator and developer of QB talent as anyone is obviously true. Even though his thoughts on QB prospects and all are interesting insight that fleshes out that point (I didn't know about the Brady thing) they are only snippets of a picture of decades of evaluations we don't have nearly all the info on--it's not like Payton is Chris Simms or something, publishing and explaining a board every year that we can hold him against, we just know these because Payton had a chance to consider taking those players AND they've proven to be notable--and they don't hold nearly as much weight as what he has *actually* done.

So, as far as that record, missing on a 3rd round QB in Grayson is not a very big deal, though it's a much more fair case to compare the Book pick to than anecdotes on Tom Brady from two decades ago or 1st round prospects like Mahomes. We know Payton and Loomis value having a good backup like Daniel, McCown, or Bridgewater and they have a good record spending this kind of medium-level resources to get that. The optimistic expectation--your worst case scenario--should be that they develop Book to perform in that role (replacing Siemian now as the third stringer providing insurance for Taysom). Book ever being even close to a acceptable starter is a total improbable bet, but for a 4th round pick, it's at least made on house money. I don't think anyone expects that. QB is still so valuable that it's worth throwing darts at, even for backups, and we know being chosen and developed by Payton is a great situation for that player: I agree with how you say Payton's patronage increases his odds. That doesn't stop the fact that Book could absolutely flame out, even as a backup--it's even somewhat likely--which wouldn't be a big deal, but would mean they left value on the board in this draft.

I'm skeptical about trading future 1sts right now for Surtain or Horn or whatever but QB is the one thing that's worth it. If you don't have one, and you can get one, especially on a rookie contract, and especially considering the evaluators and developers we have in Payton and co., a future 1st or 2 is a drop in the pan. The talk swirling around right now too indicates that NFL teams love Lance and his work ethic. I think Fields and Lance are super comparable, the difference being Fields has shown good and bad whereas Lance has just shown *little*, so if you're confident you can work with him as a slate a la Josh Allen, that's huge. I get that Fields is more comfortable as a typical top QB prospect, especially as we lack the intel and interaction teams have, though.

I agree with what someone else said, too, and tried to parrot it: the ranking of the QB as a prospect (assuming we're talking top guys and not someone obviously in a different convo like a Trask) doesn't matter if A. they're coming to be developed here in a great situation and B.

17299,161246,161246,TomorrowMayRain065,"Thanks for participating and offering some feedback.

I see your point, you're right about Horn. I think I'm a tad lower on him--still think he's great, but to me it's Surtain and then a bit of a cluster, even though Horn is probably at the top of that cluster--so I think grouping him in was a bit of subconscious bias because I definitely didn't think through all the teams he'd have to pass to make it to us. The results having him as the consensus preferred pick while having 0 points for expecting us to draft him proves your point, I think.

Mac Jones is similar in that, well, he won't be there, but I was more aware of that one and think it made for an interesting inclusion anyway. I like Jones but I completely agree with you about QB, I think any QB we could get--Jones is the only possible exception, and it's still real close, and again, we won't be getting him at 28 anyway in 99/100 timelines--would be a lateral move from Jameis team-building-wise, so we should ride the wheels off him for a season and see what happens.

I agree about TE, I think Freiermuth would be a weird 1st round pick, I was just surprised at how much he was one that would make people ""upset."" We need more TEs and we need WR (read: receiving threat) and I think Freiermuth is legit. Then again, that question is a little odd and could've been worded with less intense connotation because I doubt most people here have a blacklist of specific players that will have them foaming at the mouth in anger. And yeah, I agree about OL, I think people are caught up in the trend our front office has shown without understanding the circumstances as to why. It would be really weird to draft an OL in the 1st and would probably mean changing their long-term plans for Armstead or Peat, ultimately creating a hole just to fill it. 

I'm with you. I really hope it's one of Farley/Samuel/Newsome or JOK/Collins though. Add Barmore in there too for me. It's not like the Saints but I feel like 28 is rich for Davis or the Georgia corners and maybe they could trade down and still target them. I don't think they *have* to go with a certain position but I think they have to leave the draft with at least one projected starter added at CB and LB which is tough to do without picking them early. My ideal day 2 CB and LB options if needed are Paulson Adebo and Monty Rice.

17300,161248,161248,TomorrowMayRain065,"Winston this season, Tua long-term.

Winston is a proven NFL starter with immense talent who has been here to know the system. Tua was barely playing at a starting level at all. That said, it's very optimistic to bet that Winston turns a total new leaf and capitalizes on all of his talent, and there's a reason Tua was the well-regarded prospect he was; one rookie COVID year on a poor offense doesn't totally negate that.

This is without knowing what Winston (or Tua, for that matter) will do, so Winston could totally fail and the answer is obviously Tua, or he could show legitimate promise as The Guy and someone we could realistically win a Super Bowl with, and then to hell with Tua talk. More realistically, Winston could play well enough to compete for a wildcard berth on the back of our roster but continue to leave us in a little bit of a purgatory.

In that case that Winston has reached a ceiling and it isn't true franchise-QB-caliber, I think the opportunity for Payton to develop Tua would be preferable long-term just in case he can unlock something, considering Tua is real young. If we had to spend significant capital to obtain Tua, though, I'd rather someone else or especially go all-in for a promising QB in the draft. I'm not very high on Tua and it seems like he's on the path to a Jimmy G-like career but, just like Winston, if there's anywhere he could transcend, it would be here with Payton and a great surrounding corps.

What I love about JOK fitting here is he can instantly replace Kwon's role as a fast linebacker (but with even better coverage) letting Demario have less responsibility and thus more freedom to make plays, but it's totally true that he can basically be a safety. A slot corner, even. Never thought about it but kind of like Isaiah Simmons (maybe Simmons was a S with LB potential and JOK a LB with S potential).

The money definitely makes a difference, I remember we had a lot of safeties mocked to us (Moehrig in the 1st) before we knew Marcus Williams was staying. I think in most cases you wouldn't mind replacing Malcolm Jenkins at his age, so S would still be a decent bet, but the money means he's gonna be here and then you end up with one of your high investment safeties being a backup.

I don't get grouping JOK and Moehrig together though, Moehrig is definitely a true safety (with some free/strong flexibility, though) which wouldn't thrill me in round 1. Could replace Malcolm Jenkins down the line I guess (tied to money for now), or Marcus Williams if they're somehow not able to ultimately extend him after hitting him with the tag.

Couldn't hate either of those OL you mentioned because they're studs but picking OL just wouldn't make a lot of sense since we have 5 starters. Ruiz was alright and he was a rookie in a COVID year, I don't think it makes any sense to replace a 1st round investment before he has any time to develop.

17608,165474,165474,VanDenIzzle,"I love these Carson Wentz threads.

He is an amazing QB as far as athletic ability is concerned. He can do it all. He can scramble, make multiple reads, make the deep pass, accurate short throws. He has all of the physical ability to not only succeed, but be a top 10 guy.

The issue is his leadership which with every passing year is getting pulled more and more into question. He doesn't take accountability. Last year when he was making dumb mistakes, he would go to his post game interview and blame it on anyone else. Ended up losing the locker room because of it. You can see because not a single Colt came out and was shocked to see him get traded for pennies. That's why we keep getting ""leaks from the colts"" on how much happier they are just being rid of him.


He also gets startled. Kind of like how Sam Darnold saw ghosts, he gets rocked a few times and starts making boneheaded decisions. Bail out of pocket early, scramble into a defender, throw it away but into the chest of a defender. He gets in his head and loses control. 


Everytime I say this I get down voted, but he will start the year off as an MVP darkhorse. Throw like 7 TDs to 1 or 0 int through the first 2 or 3 games and look amazing. But all it will take is 1 game where he loses a step and gets sacked hard. He will blame it on his O-line which they will no longer wish to put their bodies through harm to protect him. He will lose his locker room again.",309.0,nfl,t3_w7tmlq,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2022-07-25T12:54:41Z,saints,-0.0220978485500164

The only real certain is TLaw at #1, everything else has been ""experts, blah blah blah""

If you watch the tape, Fields is 100% better for the Shanahan system over Wilson because he can run an offense with quick reads and take big shots (big body boi). Shanny's system will also reduce fields biggest weakness (shanny's offense does quick clear reads, fields takes too long moving through progressions)

Granted, that one year post-AB was when Ben missed almost the entire season, but even last year with Ben back and more passing the rookies taken in 2020 were outproducing him. Though you could also chalk that up to them being reluctant to push the ball deep with Ben’s arm.
