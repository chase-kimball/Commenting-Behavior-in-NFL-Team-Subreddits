373,6822,6822,AcidThunder,">He'd absolutely be awesome. I just don't think his game is going to age well. He's been mostly healthy the last couple of years but before that he was injury prone. Even the last few years he kept getting banged up and missing games. I don't feel like it's a Belichick move to trade for him and then extend him which seems to be what he wants.

I agree with you that this isn't prime Julio we are talking about. He will probably miss at least 1-2 games due to some nagging injury that becomes too common at his age. If the trade was for only a second and a player, I would take that trade in a heart beat. I do agree that this doesn't seem like a normal Belichick move but, this whole offseason was not a normal one with the big splashes in FA and drafting a QB first round.

>Agree with this but I'd rather see us just wait for FA and target receivers instead of trading a 2nd for Julio and then having to pay him FA money anyways.

I think Belichick thought that receivers would be getting big money this offseason and overpaid for the guys he wanted to bring in with Bourne and Agholor. Next year will probably be too pricy for us to go and grab an ""alpha"" receiver like Julio but younger. It just seems like this team was built with the next 2-3 seasons in mind.

>True but it's a passing league and while Van Noy will help I don't see Hightower who was already a very limited pass defender doing much to help. He was at his best when we had a decent rush and his blitzing was unexpected and he racked up the pressures but I think this year teams are just going to prep for the Pats blitzing because of how limited our DL is.

Another point I agree with you is that Hightower is not going to help us in coverage but, with his ability to get pressure along with a hopefully better DL, it will help our aging secondary attack the ball easier. We were tied for the most interceptions last year with 18 and the year prior we lead the lead with 25. Our strongest suit is causing turnovers by the secondary. I think the whole league will get better on defense due to having training camp and OTAs this year. Last year was kind of an anomaly with how bad most defenses were right out the gate.

>I prefer to be more level headed since some of my other teams are the celtics and the wolverines. Been hurt too much

I get you, I always like being super optimistic because I would rather be hyped up looking forward to the season rather than spend the next few months imaging the team being middle of the pack. The Patriots have spoiled me because outside of last season, they basically have never been bad as long as I have actually cared about watching football.

374,6823,6823,AcidThunder,">I don't think we have a receiving corps where people can just turn it on in the postseason.

That is the exact reason to go out and acquire Julio Jones. He will be expensive but, he can be our ""alpha"" receiver for at least most of Mac's rookie contract. Julio would still be drawing double coverage even at his age and if not then he would at least be covered by the CB1. This helps everyone just by being on the field.

>We did fine but again we had the greatest QB of all time. Even if Mac is good he isn't going to come back from 28-3 or put up 14 points in the 4th quarter against the LoB. He needs to be actually surrounded with help instead of surrounding him with Reche Caldwell and whoever tf.

I don't think anyone expects Mac Jones to be the next Brady. Those comebacks are arguably Brady's greatest so, why bother comparing them? Nobody can do what Brady has done. Not Mahomes, not Rodgers, not even Manning could of done what Brady accomplished in the playoffs. Again, I agree with surrounding him with talent, so why not go and grab Julio? Belichick cannot seem to draft WRs for shit so, I would rather take a shot on Julio versus another potential bust.

>We can't just assume the new rookies are going to fix the pass rush. Every other team that had a better record has new rookies too and if their rookies work out they'd be in a better place than us.

The defensive rookies outside Barmore and maybe Perkins are not going to be full time starters. So its more of can our FA class prop up the defense while our rookies learn under them.

>We were about average per drive in terms of points. Our offense was run heavy and ate up the clock.

I believe that our offense will be run heavy again this year with the trade for Trent Brown. If we start Mac Jones, he can use this to his advantage as he had the most efficient and accurate college quarterback season of all time. We don't have to lean on him yet, he just needs to make enough throws to keep drives alive. 

>Cam did get covid but the opt outs were overblown.

I agree that Cannon, and Chung didnt do much to change the outcome of the games last year, in my opinion Hightower opting out last year hurt us more. Our LBs last year looked lost when out on the field without a true leader back there. Getting Van Noy back along with Hightower would honestly change the way our defense operates.

>I just think you're saying everything works out with our additions and things go wrong for other teams. I'm not saying Pats won't have a great year. I'm just saying it'll take a lot of things going right for us and wrong for other teams for that to happen.

I am a biased Pats fan and an Alabama fan, of course I think that our acquisitions are going to do great things. Aside from that, I still don't believe that this team needs to go very far in order to win 11-12 games next year. The schedule is weaker and we face a ton of teams with questionable QBs or questionable defenses (Titans, Cowboys, Falcons, Chargers) I am someone who believes that going all in while the QB is on a rookie deal is the smartest thing to do and especially when the cap is going to explode upwards.

2014: Edelman, Amendola, & Lafell. 2016: Edelman, Amendola, & Hogan. 2018: Edelman, Hogan, & Dorsett / Patterson. None of these dudes were pro bowlers or all pros for being dominant wide-receivers

The only reasons Hunter Henry is labeled as injury phoned is because he tore his ACL 2 years ago and always misses 1-2 games per year. Gronkowski did the same thing and we did just fine without him. Outside of Gronk's 2016 and Henry's 2018 seasons, they have missed nearly the same amount of games. Besides that point, Jonnu isn't supposed to be a complete Game changing tight end, he will be lined up all over the place and might be a heavy red zone threat. Both of these players have dramatically improved the worst TE group in the league last year.

Our DBs are older, but with the improved pass rush and LB corps, we shouldn't have to rely on them as much as previous years in order to get some defensive stops. Belichick usually thrives on a bend not break defense and even with how bad this team was last year we ranked 7th in the league in points allowed and 17th in yards.  

This team got fucked last year with Cam getting covid, the injuries and the opt outs. I personally see a major bounce back and going 12-5 with how many teams we are facing with underperforming or rookie quarterbacks (Dolphins x2, Jets x2, Saints, Texans, Panthers, Colts, Jaguars) 

Yea, I agree that Mac would have to play like Herbert last year for us to compete with KC, I do think that this team will make the playoffs next year due and maybe even win the division.

Specifically, it can be found at footnote 11 on page 12: “After the hearing and after the submission of post-hearing briefs, Mr. Brady’s certified agents offered to provide a spreadsheet that would identify all of the individuals with whom Mr. Brady had exchanged text messages during [the relevant time] period; the agents suggested that the League could contact those individuals and request production of any relevant text messages that they retained. Aside from the fact that, under Article 46, Section 2(f) of the CBA, such information could and should have been provided long before the hearing, the approach suggested in the agents’ letter — which would require tracking down numerous individuals and seeking consent from each to retrieve from their cellphones detailed information about their text message communications during the relevant period — is simply not practical.”

In English, here’s what the footnote means: Although the text messages couldn’t be retrieved directly from Brady’s phone, his agents provided all of the phone numbers with which Brady exchanged text messages. His agents also said that the league could attempt to get the actual text messages from the phones of the people with whom Brady communicated, but the league refused to attempt to try, claiming that it would be too hard to track down the various people and to persuade them to cooperate.",3.0,nfl,t3_wc5jbf,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-07-30T19:57:19Z,patriots,-0.1171281249999999

I don’t think pocket passers are getting less relevant. I think it’s more because of what’s happening at the college and high school levels since these two levels develop talent for the NFL. In high school it’s becoming more and more common to make your most athletic player your QB this trickles up to the college level and then eventually to the NFL. The pocket passer isn’t dying because of the archetype going irrelevant it’s more because they’re simply not being developed at the lower levels anymore. 

Another thing which is just speculation of mine is that NFL teams are starting to value OL less and less. If you have a running QB or at least a scrambler the threshold for what’s considered a “good OL” becomes much lower because you know your QB will bail you out if your OL shits the bed. Comparatively someone like Brady will always need at least an above average OL to reach their full potential.",1.0,nfl,t3_pb8rhl,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2021-08-25T13:45:13Z,patriots,0.0381859951019287

The entire point of vaccines is that it is eliminated from the body quickly, so even if you did point to something in the ingredients that you find objectionable (which you can't) it wouldn't be in your body long term. All you are left with is the antibody response if the introduced pathogen were to enter the body in the future. This is how all vaccines work

The thing is, I understood every word you said, I just think you're looking at this whole process completely wrong and overall I completely disagree with you. 


>**But after that...It's a weird dichotomy where they'll miss on the their trop picks...but them find a a guy or 2 in the lower rounds**

Who cares? As far as i am concerned it doesn't matter what round the player is drafted in, whether it is round 1, 7, or an UDFA if the player is good the player is good. If we are missing on first round picks but getting consistent /equivalent production out of 6th rounders. That sounds good to me, the late rounds cost a tenth of the salary. Would it be better if we were hitting on first rounders and the seventh, most definitely. 

The draft is just a giant game of chance. There are 250-260 players in the draft and each team is given ~7 balls to throw onto the wheel. The expected chance a player succeeds is about 40-50% in round one and like 10-15% in round 7. As far as I am concerned, as long as you hit on 3-5 players a draft, you are doing good. And as far as i am aware this is exact philosophy BB goes by. (If you haven't read it, read the book War Room, I think that was the one that goes a little more in depth on this).

 So, sure, you're right we're missing on our easy picks and hitting on the hard ones. The result is the same as long as we're hitting on something. Sure, if we hit more early we would be in a better spot but the fact of the matter is no one is consistently hitting early. Every now and then some team gets hot for a year or two but they all come back to earth pretty quickly.

And on top of that, BB was starting to take shots on more high risk high reward type players nutty in the draft and in free agency as he was trying to squeeze one more run out of Brady for a couple years there. Maybe if he didn't go into it with the mindset that he would only have Brady for a couple years he would have been able to do it differently. Who knows.

The whole point of me going through and showing how many starters/solid role players we got in each draft / UDFA period is just to show that we are getting what we need and last I checked the Patriots are the winningest football team in the past 20+ years, I think it's working.



>First, I said, ""A large part of the first dynasty was built on picks not made by him."" 

I didn't specify one year. But go back and look at those first dynasty guys: (arguably Bledsoe for what he did in the AFCCF) McGinniest, Law, Ted Johnson, Bruschi, Milloy, Tebucky jones, Damien Woddy, Kevin Faulk....Some of the the biggest names in their secondary and and front LB group were all drafted before he was HC. 

The point about dynasty #1 was that, yes there was a 'core' of... you counted 9... players that were brought in before BB. Of which the large majority were gone before Superbowl number 2. How does having 3ish players (that BB still may have even had a hand in drafting then) on a roster of 50+ still being on the team for a couple years give Parcells or Carroll deserve any credit for any of what happened, the dynasty would have still existed if Parcells nor Carroll were in New England, add long as whatever Joe schmoe coach didn't whiff completely on their picks The same results would have happened. The only thing Parcells did for the pats was introducing BB to Kraft.  And of course he throws away a SB when he quit on the team before the game even started.

On a sidenote Parcells is literally the most overrated coach in NFL history, he has never succeeded without BB by his side


>> As for Pioli, sure, I am sure he deserves some credit but at the same time, he literally accomplished nothing after leaving New England. How can you assume that he is responsible for that dynasty?

> He didn't have Tom Brady. That's the answer for lots of coaches, GM, teams, ETC. 


So yes, as long as Pioli has the QB that BB drafted, took a risk on by keeping him in the starting role, and then developed into the GOAT, Pioli could have been great. The fact of the matter is, while Pioli was with BB they did great things together and I am not necessarily trying to write him off, I appreciate what he did while he was here. But outside of New England he did nothing of import and after he left, we still won 3 more Superbowls and went to  2 more after he was gone.",1.0,nfl,t3_uecp69,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-04-29T17:33:31Z,patriots,0.0206957091748497

>>What are you talking about? Both dynasties that BB has built in NE were built primarily through the draft.

>A large part of the first dynasty was built on picks not made by him. Either literally made by carroll or parcels teams or with a lot of help from piloli. 

The thing is, that isn't really how it was. If you go and look at their first Superbowl, only ~6 of the starters, including special teams, were draft picks or brought in by either Parcells or Carroll. And even then, a couple of them were brought in when BB was the assistant head coach of the Pats in 1996 so who even knows if BB didn't have a hand in that. And that's only looking at their first Superbowl, that number drops down to like 3 or 4 players the next year. That first dynasty had nothing to do with Parcells or Carroll.

As for Pioli, sure, I am sure he deserves some credit but at the same time, he literally accomplished nothing after leaving New England. How can you assume that he is responsible for that dynasty?

As for dynasty #2, I understand what you're saying, there were a lot of objectively bad drafts / players picked but on the other hand there were a lot of good/role players that win is those Superbowls.

>But the problem is rounds 2-4. He's been missing TONS of those. And for a team that lets players walk in FA, you can't miss as many as they have.

Looking at the drafts, by year since 2014 and I am going to ignore the players that didn't pan out, just trying to point out starters.


2014


* Probowl (Alternate) QB ( Jimmy Garoppolo)

* One of the best 3rd down backs in the league (James White)

* Solid Journeyman Tackle (Cameron Fleming)

* All Pro / Probowl CB (Malcolm Butler)*


2015


* Solid (maybe not great) Interior Defensive lineman (Malcolm Brown)

* One of the best D-linemen in the league at the time (Trey Flowers)

* One of the best guards in the league (Shaq Mason)

* One of the best centers in the league (David Andrews)*

* Solid Journeyman CB (Justin Coleman)*


2016


* First round pick stolen due to the league not understanding Ideal Gas Law**

* One of the best guards / All Pro (Joe Thuney)

* Journeyman QB (Jacoby Brissett)

* Solid linebacker (Elandon Roberts)

* Solid Guard / Center (Ted Karras)

* Solid cornerback (Jonathan Jones)*


2017


* First and Third round picks were traded for Brandin Cooks (eventually traded for a new first) and a 4th***

* Second Round pick for Kony Ealy***

* 4th rounder traded for Dwayne Allen***

* Solid DE (Deatrich Wise)

* Solid DT (Adam Butler)*


2018


* Great when healthy, but often injured Tackle (Isiah Wynn)

* Injury hampered but solid RB when healthy, no SB LIII without him (Sony Michel)

* Solid linebacker when healthy (Jawhaun Bentley)

* Probowl CB (JC Jackson)*

* And then Keion Croessen and Duke Dawson were both traded away for higher picks than they were originally drafted at


2019
 

* Joejuan Williams has barely played due to the all pro cast of players in front of him. He hasn't been super impressive but we will see this year

* Damien Harris is great

* Jake Bailey is one of the best punters in the league

* PR Gunner Olszewski I mean he was just a special teams guy, but he was good*

* WR Jakobi Meyers has been great*


2020


* Kyle Dugger is going to be a star

* Josh Uche looked great when he was on the field, but that's been the issue

* Anfernee Jennings has been hurt, but I think he can be good, too early to say anything.

* Asiasi and Keene were both injured and both spent a good chunk of their rookie season on ir. Keene missed season 2 and asiasi took the back seat to the free agents we brought in. Still don't really know what either of them look like, not looking good though

* Michael Owenwu has looked great; PFF All Rookie team

* JJ Taylor has been an interesting player, good for an UDFA

2021

* Mac Jones was a borderline ROTY.

* Christian Barmore looks like the real deal

* Rhimondre Stevenson looks amazing

* And a bunch of project players that are too early to say anything on.


So, in a league where the average first round picks bust on a rate of about 50% (closer to 60-70% busting when considering the patriots haven’t picked earlier than the #23 pick). So when the bust rate only gets worse in the later rounds and you see that the Patriots are still getting an average of 3-5 starting caliber players (mostly playing near pro bowl level) in each draft/UDFA period on top of the handful of role players that may not stick around in the league but play their part while they’re here… I mean what do you expect? How many starters per draft do you think we should be getting? 

Sure there were a couple years in there where the drafts were kind of rough, but those years were also the years that we traded the picks for players or it is time for the once a decade stolen draft pick where the league decides to screw the patriots and steal a first round pick. And yes, there have been busts, quite a few of them even, but that is expected. Like I said the average 1st round pick busts at a rate of 50% of the time and it gets way worse really quickly. And no, I am not saying that BB has been the best drafter in the league over this past 6-7 years but I also think that when you look at the whole picture, he hasn’t been nearly as bad as what people like you keep spouting off about. At the absolute worst he has been average, and while I would have loved to have drafted different players in multiple spots I am also sure that other teams would also feel quite the same about grabbing some of our players

>The biggest ""problem"" for belichick is that he always had Brady to cover up these ""meg drafts.""

And you aren't wrong here, having Brady gave us a bit more wiggle room with all of this. It allowed BB to take a higher risk on a player like Easley or Gronk. Knowing that Brady was there to hold it together let BB try to grab players that were high risk or more commonly players that played a hyper specific role. Sure a bunch of them failed, failed spectacularly even, but that is what every team in the league goes through. The draft bust percentage is extremely high.

5594,33182,33182,Bomber929,"Really? I think that there is a legitimate argument for Belichick being **one** of the best in the league at drafting / developing quarterbacks. He has drafted three pro bowl quarterbacks using picks no earlier than an extremely late 2nd round pick (each of these players played well enough for the Patriots that they were offered first round picks for each of them). On top of that he has also developed multiple quarterbacks, all drafted in the later rounds and as udfa's, that have become solid journeyman qbs / backups that have earned multiple contacts in the nfl.  Hell, there was even a point a year or two ago that the Patriots had 4 different qbs that they developed all starting in a game during the same week.

Other than Andy Reid, is there another coach in the league that has drafted as many, or even just more than 1, probowl level qbs as Belichick has over the past 20 years? History of the nfl? Either way, I think that list is going to be pretty small and you would have to be pretty ignorant to think that he hasn't been extremely successful in the area of drafting/developing QB's, at the very least he should be considered well above average.

I am not saying that all he does is draft world beaters, but when you are only drafting QB's in the later rounds and have had the results he has.... I mean what do you expect?

1. Offseason worries about the offense are overblown, Pats end with a top 10 offense with a combination of more experience, letting Mac loose after his rookie year, and the addition of Parker and Thornton.

2. Mac makes his case as a top 10 QB.

3. Stevenson has a dynamite year which results in Harris getting traded (I would hate to see him go too, but there’s a reason we drafted two RBs. It’s definitely on their mind.)

4. Bill revolutionizes his secondary with “positionless” talent, unit ends up surprising everyone.

My NFL general bold predictions:

1. Tyreek played his last playoff game ever in KC and will miss Mahomes.

2. Trey Lance underwhelms so bad this year that it results in the 49ers missing the playoffs and GM John Lynch getting fired for giving up all that draft capital.

3. TB12 wins the SB and rides off into the sunset.

You would day ""Well, they aren't certified franchise guys"", but Goff brought his team to deep playoff runs and a SB appearance and Wentz was a near MVP if not for his Acl. Both of these guess were signed with the expectation internally that they were franchise guys. I think both thought they were too. Yet had either of them waited like Lamar is now, they probably both get the Winston/Marita treatment.

I agree that if the guy is good enough, waiting likely won't hurt you. The issue is being good enough is much easier to say with retrospect.

I say this as someone who believes in Lamar, but also watched Cam Newton play after the wheels fell off. The team has the ability to franchise him twice. In the event of a bad injury that does actually impact how he plays, the team can test him out for 2 years and toss him and likely cost him tens of millions if he were to have he same events happen, but he signed a long term deal first.

But the point isn't about being criticized, but the type of criticism (them being judged as athletes and as such needing to prove more as quarterbacks vs less athletic pure passer peers).

After the bears game half of his games had a sub 80 passer rating including a passer rating of 40 in the playoffs.

12035,113286,113286,MFreak,"I still feel (and I think others do as well) a bit of disingenuousness from what Mahomes is saying. Lamar and Kyler do rely on their athleticism to play, in some cases a bit too much. In the same Josh Allen received the same criticism. The difference is that Allen played better more recently than Jackson or kyler.  It just feels insane that mahomes is saying he has to keep proving he belongs as if it's ever been in question since he has been starting.  And kyler does need to prove himself because outside of half season stretches he hasn't proven himself at all. 

When streetball comes up I think it's fair to point to it as an unsustainable style. Anything the relies on extending plays past the first few reads after the structure of the play breaks down is unsustainable. Some guys make it work better than others. Mahomes, Wilson, Romo, Rodgers and Roethlisberger were/are all guys who were able to play as well or better on off structure plays to an infuriating degree, but not all the time. Mahomes in the super bowl has twice looked like a sub par qb who had that style of ball fail him (if Jimmy G hits a wide open sanders or even if the Kittle catch at the end of the first half counted there's a solid chance the 9ers win). 

Now mahomes wins plenty on structure too, so to say that he only plays streetball is equally stupid. The most infuriating times to play against the chiefs isn't when mahomes is playing full hero ball, but when he's able to hit his first read immediately every play because he always has someone immediately open. I feel like I'm rambling at this point.

I consider myself plugged in to the league and haven't heard it once. Even when mahomes struggled early last year he was considered a top qb and was for some reason still in several MVP articles late in season during his resurgence as if he hadn't struggled the majority of the season.

By all accounts kyler isn't a tier 1 qb either. He's had consistency issues every season, hasn't won a playoff game, and his overall ownership of the offense is a direct reason for that. He is by the athletics definition of the tiers not a tier 1 qb.

And then for Lamar, his MVP season was predicated on an obscenely high TD%. His efficiency as a passer has objectively regressed. I do think that overall narrative on him has swung too far, but it is based in his actual play getting worse despite his surrounding cast supposedly improving.

All of this to say, if he had left out himself and kyler, he would probably had a reasonable point. But the biggest issue most people have here is that he used himself to point to some sort of uphill climb to prove himself that he has in part because he's a black qb (per this quote he does indulge in the race play while understanding is in response to a direct question) when he doesn't actually face this uphill climb. He is as universally revered in the sport as anyone can be so it's disingenuous to use himself as an example of media narrative being unfair.

It only looks good because Diggs ended up being significantly better with Allen than he ever was with the vikings. Knowing that could have taken Jefferson is rough hindsight, and nobody is unhappy with how Diggs turned out, but if he performed at the same level in Buffalo as he did in Minnesota I don't think people would think it was a good trade.

More context, diggs made 0 pro bowls in Minnesota. He was 1st team all pro in Buffalo after 1 season. It was a lot to pay for that resume and it worked out.

12181,113617,113617,MFreak,"Then they don't need to pay Goff to be the 6th highest paid QB in football.  Don't want to use full contract average?  Goff is the 3rd highest paid QB in cash this year.  And next year is guaranteed as well as the 8th highest paid in cash and 9th highest cap hit.  Can they restructure?  Sure, but that's only something you would do if you consider him part of the team's long term plan.

It's not just the value of Goff on field vs Bridgewater on field.  The cap hit to Goff is significant and a negative asset.  Any argument for why they shouldn't draft a high QB right now also means they shouldn't pay top dollar for a QB either which is what they are doing with Goff

Edit: Could they restructure again next year*  I'm aware that they restructured his contract this year out of necessity because they couldn't afford the as is cap hit so they pushed it into the next year.  He is obviously part of the immediate plan.  I don't see it making sense to restructure him in the future unless they plan on keeping him (or they are ready for a large dead cap hit when they do move on)",4.0,nfl,t3_pmq71g,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2021-09-12T09:42:45Z,patriots,-0.0386427842708111
12182,113618,113618,MFreak,"If you trade down the 8 with the Bears for Fields (I know you specifically wouldn't but hear me out), you get their mid 20s pick this year plus their 3rd plus their mid 20s pick next year (assuming they still make the playoffs which isn't a lock by any means).  That means you get the value of the Rams 2023 1st in 2021.  That alone is worth significant value. Either you pull the trigger on players who can provide value now, or you continue to trade back to get more value if you're in a position where you need to fill multiple roles.

I get your point on Goff probably being better than Bridgewater, but I'd say he most likely still won't be good enough to stop you from taking a QB in the first in the next 2 years (or otherwise making a major QB change).  At that point you should consider Goff costs over $41M in cap space minumum over the next two years while Bridgewater is a $4M cap hit.  That cap could be spent on better quality free agents to support a higher upside QB.

Again, I won't say that Goff won't end up being a franchise guy.  He has shown more than enough to see a Tannehill-esque career arc being viable that I don't think is possible for Bridgewater.  It just seems like an odd thing to bet on unless Stafford made it an issue, which he did.

Edit: Note on the cap hit, it's $41M over the next two years assuming you keep him after it.  If you cut him, you take another $10M hit to get him off the team.  If you keep him, it's another $30M.  So Goff is either a $71M hit for 3 years of production or a $51M hit for 2 years of production.  I don't see him returning value on either.  Again, not saying he can't, but in the Tannehill example, he was at least being paid near vet min so it was much lower risk.

For example, the Browns owners needed to put all of Watson's contract's worth in escrow, despite him getting the guaranteed money on a yearly basis. This mechanism is rumored to be why the Raiders shipped off Mack a few years ago, since Davis couldn't afford to put the money away as they were gearing up for the move to Vegas.

There's some deeper rumors (more so implied by tapped-in local guys than outright reported) that the Patriots didn't make any moves to manipulate the cap to make more signings this offseason, because Kraft didn't have the cash for any big moves this year anyway, even as one of the wealthier owners.

No he does not. He may not name them a coordinator the first year, but there were clear de-facto Coordinators taking over when the former ones left. When Weis left, McDaniels wasn't immediately made OC in title, but everyone knew he was the guy and play caller going into the 2005 season. When McDaniels left, BoB didn't have the title for two years but everyone knew he was the guy.

Mangini immediately took over for Romeo, Pees immediately took over the role from Mangini. When Patricia left, everyone knew Flores was the guy. When Flores left, Schiano was going to be the guy until he quit before the start of the off-season.

The only thing similar we had to now was 2010 on defense, when Bill called the plays, By 2011, Patricia was the known defensive play caller.

What we have now is complete unknowns all over the place, including for the players. With no DC or person in charge, defenders last year were openly talking about not knowing where the buck stopped, Mayo or Steve Belichick. Considering the defense fell off a cliff, with dumb penalties, mental mistakes, and multiple instances of players looking outright confused by the assignments, it looked like the issues made their way onto the field.

Now, on the offensive staff, there's former DC who hasn't coached offense in over a decade, and a Special Teams Coach who coached offense for one season leading that side of the ball.

Ras-I Dowling (2011) - Taken 33 overall, massive bust, made the active roster for three weeks on one other team (the 3-10 2014 Raiders), Bounced around practice squads and training camp rosters until 2016.

Darius Butler (2009) - Bust for the Pats, off teh roster after two years, eventually put it together and was a servicable corner in Indy for a few years.

Patrick Chung (2009) - BB had no idea how to use him and seemed to be a bust, allowed to walk to Philly in 2013. Came back and was a huge contributor to the second half of the dynasty. Is BB credited for the pick, or for the FA acquisition, or both?

This means that if you are a senior scout with a past Super Bowl participant, you are likely to be firmly in the mix. The numbers get more interesting from there. The data showed that teams with GMs from scouting backgrounds won less than those with GMs who had a salary cap and football operations background, a group that includes New Orleans’s Mickey Loomis, Buffalo’s Brandon Beane, and Philadelphia’s Howie Roseman.

He couldn’t separate last week against Washington’s second string corners. I don’t know why he jumped for this ball but this is jsut one of many reasons. I’ve been watching him for the past 2 years and this pre season. Every single time we’ve heard he is good in practice and he almost never backs it up in the game. I gave him the benefit of the doubt in his first year but last year he just was horrible. This preseason he hasn’t been able to separate regardless of reports from him showing improvement in training camp. And the one play he got open in the zone he had a minor slip and caught the ball but couldn’t stay up on his feet and get at least 5-10 more yards. I don’t wanna beat down a dead horse because obviously I don’t want any players on my team to get injured. I don’t think he’ll be cut but he needs to go to another team who can use his talents in another way. And you’re right a lot of ppl do have a hate boner for him but at the same time there’s a good reason for that. He’s a first round WR and he’s looking like a complete bust.

Adding Parker gives him the big outside 50/50 threat he couldn’t go to with N’keal. Mac threw more of those 50/50 balls last year than I was ever used to seeing with Brady, and having that type of receiver will help him immensely. He also allows them the flexibility to move Agholor around more, having him in more of a Z role, but his speed could also be really useful in the slot, too. 

On top of that there’s likely to be improvements just due to the chemistry of everyone being in the system a second year, and I expect better years from Bourne, Henry and Meyers bc of this. Not to mention better use of Jonnu could open up more as well 

Aside from this it’s rumored he’s worked on his arm strength this off-season with Tom House, which was the biggest knock on his game. I’m my opinion, if that improves a bit, combined with a better overall receiving group than last year and better chemistry/personnel usage, he is in a really good spot to make the second year leap. 

My biggest worry is the offensive coaching staff and being able to maximize his potential, but if the rumors are true that Bill will be very hands on with Mac and the offense, I trust it.
