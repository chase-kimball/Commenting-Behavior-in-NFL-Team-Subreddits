I know the Rams just changed, but they need another overhaul ASAP. The numbers are goofy and shiny, the horn is cut into segments, the bone colored road uniforms look dirty and terrible. It wasn’t broken, guys. Hell, it wasn’t broken in 2000. Fix it back.

Same goes with Atlanta: big swing and a miss. Gradient alternates? Chrome face mask? Boring all-white pajama roads? Pointy number font with matching jagged side panels? These uniforms are likely gone after another three years.

The Saints haven’t looked good for almost two decades. Their gold is too faded and almost none of their pants have stripes. Look, if you’re gonna do all-black, or all-white, put some stripes on the pants. These uniforms (other than the color rush/throwback) have NO character whatsoever.

The Broncos uniforms looked crazy when they were first brought out in 1997, then they looked kind of cool, then lame again. With the old-school horse logo and orange crush uniforms clearly more popular, why stick with what they have now? 

I also wish the Ravens hadn’t have won those two Super Bowls so we could maybe get a different take on black/purple/gold. Waaaay too many games in the plain black leotard pants.

Believe there were 3 all-pros on that line and 4 made the pro bowl. Ron Leary was amazing that season and one of the best run blockers in the league that season. Murray led the NFL in yards from scrimmage. 

While I think 2016 was great (same starting 5), 2014 was the best year. 2016 saw Smith & Leary injured and miss several games each. Leary had actually missed a lot of the 2015 season, so he was starting to wear down. La’el Collins was able to fill in for both and be a productive 2nd year lineman, after getting a lot of the starting time his rookie year while filling in for Leary. 

I would rank the Cowboys best offensive lines as:
2014 , 2016 , 2015 , 2017.

After 2017, Fredbeard was gone and Smith has been hurt every year since. Collins also missed time in some recent seasons. I would say the Cowboys offensive line hasn’t been truly elite since 2017.

So for Herbert, he’s played great from what I’ve seen and has put up the numbers, but he hasn’t won alot, BUT he’s been in the league only 2 years, and not 3, so after this season, THEN it’s when we can more “easily” decide if he’s overrated or not.

My dad and his wife have (my parents got divorced) gone multiple times over the past few years however. 

Some cool things about having a box/suite that I can share:

1) we do get underground parking which is super convenient when parking in general. (Not like player parking, but when we leave the building, we drive past the opposing teams busses).

2) we can go onto the field before warm ups and after the game, which is always cool, and we can see some players who come out before warm ups that do their own pre-warm up things

3) I can literally yell at the cowboys lineman, as they practice in our corner of the end zone that we’re on.

4) depending on if their are cheerleaders not performing that day, you can meet them (but you cannot touch them as greasy old fucks have gotten too handsy in the past).

Another interesting story I can share. When j was much younger, me and my brother and dad actually went to the old cowboys stadium when it was closed (I realize now he was probably there to choose which box he wanted), so it was quite literally me and my brother in an entirely empty stadium, and it was one of the most surreal experiences possible. We also got to go to Jerry Jones’ box in the old stadium and played Madden on the xbox he had in there, and as far as I know, me and my brother and my dad were some of the first people from the public who got to see the rendering of what the stadium might look like when finished, as they had a miniature one on display in some office area.",4.0,cowboys,t3_vhbwbm,False,0.0,Jason Witten,2022-06-21T10:07:55Z,cowboys,0.0639956706187524

2. If there’s a rangers game, maybe go check that out, just for the hell of it, as the stadiums are right next to each other. Just walking around near the stadium is also nice because it’s a very nice area.

3. The inside of the stadium is basically it’s own ecosystem of things to do. There should be I think 2+ art galleries, a few restraints, gifts shops, etc. as I said, it’s its own ecosystem, and there’s just a lot to do in there 

I will preface this by saying I am very lucky to be able to go the number of times I have, as my dad is a surgeon, and he’s owned a box in the end zone where the cowboys warm up before games. To give perspective, when Tom Brady scored a rushing TD against Dallas, I was at that game, and I could straight up hit Tom in the head with the soda I was drinking at the time I was so close to him, so results can definitely vary for your game day experience.

19593,160345,160345,RingingMallard,"I've got this, u/FoxBeach

Zeke vs Pollard - Zeke is a top tier back by way of all of these listed factors. Not production - *ALL* of the factors that make a great running back

  
1. Production - Measure of ability, scheme, and opportunity. So Pollard may have better efficiency metrics on the surface, but context is important here. He saw those rushes on outside runs where there is more space before contact. Zeke was rushed between the tackles and was often contacted in the backfield on those same runs - hence the porous OL (specifically up the middle with Williams and Biadasz). I want to call this a wash, but Ill give the point to Pollard.

  
2. Availability - Zeke has only missed a single game due to injury in his entire six year career. There isn't a single RB in the NFL playing today that can say that besides Zeke. Pollard has missed that many in half the time and 25% of the workload. Point Zeke.

3. Durability - Pollard has missed more games in just this last year than Zeke has missed in his entire six year career. Factor that in with the consistency in which Zeke is making contact and it's easy to see that Zeke is the more durable back.  With Zeke's ability to still be productive even when hampered by nagging bumps and bruises, which are a part of the game for all positions, in all phases of the game and the answer is clear. Point Zeke

  
4. Reliability - This is a measure of consistency with the ball. Zeke does have a significant number of fumbles compared to Pollard; however, that does not factor in opportunities, nor do their respective rushing efficiencies factor in the consistency at which they get that average (IE Standard deviations). Has Zeke fumbled 22 times? Yes, but it has been over the course of almost 2000 touches compared to Pollard's 3 fumbles on almost 400 touches (Zeke's 1.1% fumble rate vs Pollard's .7%). Now lets talk about standard deviations. They are a variance measurement based on a relative carry's relationship to a mean. So a player that consistently gets the same yardage would have a smaller deviation than a boom or bust player would have. Smaller Std. Dev = more consistent/reliable. Based on both of these factors, I lean towards a point for Zeke.

  
5. Speed - I think we can both agree that Pollard is faster, but with his plantar fascia injury last year we have yet to see him hit that top speed again that made this true. That said still a point for Pollard.

  
6. Vision - This one is hard to measure based on scheme and opportunity. To me being able consistently get yards in the trenches is more impressive than getting a higher YPC on outside runs where speed gets you in open space. Being able to navigate 10 bodies and get consistent yardage is a better reflection of good vision than the latter. Slight Edge to Zeke.

  
7. Contact Balance - This one isn't close. Pollard is fast and shifty but often gets tackled by the first defender that makes contact. Zeke often pushes piles for extra yards after contact and by the time he goes down there are 2-3 defenders assisting on the tackle. To still be able to control 2 to 3 bodies through contact is clearly a point for Zeke.

  
8. Strength - This is no contest. In a short yardage situation we are betting on Zeke 100% of the time. Point Zeke

So out of 8 factors that determine what makes a great running back the score is 6-2 in favor of Zeke, and not once did I even mention pass protection, which most of our fanbase does not seem to value as a skill even though it is a valuable one.",3.0,cowboys,t3_utd3b4,False,0.0,Ezekiel Elliott,2022-05-20T06:36:22Z,cowboys,0.0189665736351908

19609,160364,160364,RingingMallard,"First off, ""stacked boxes"" is a pre-snap metric and does not account for any post snap movement from the defense. Defensive schemes constantly rely on misdirection to confuse the opposing QB and get them to audible into less favorable situations. That's defense 101.

Second, you are equating production to value (that's fine if that's all you care about), but that only supports the fact that you really care about fantasy stats. The game of football is more nuanced than yards and TDs. It's a game of chess where everyone is subject to extreme physical stress, relies on 10 others to consistently do their jobs, and fall into a little bit of luck.

>Henry before injury was probably going to get 2k again. He’s leagues better than Zeke, it’s not even a debate.

Henry was getting 30 touches per game which is also the reason he broke his foot. Even still a healthy Henry had the same yards per carry as Zeke who was playing on one knee for 13 games. Now Henry, after missing most of the season last year, is rehabbing a broken foot as the biggest back in football and you think he's leagues better? Come on.

If Zeke was getting 30 touches per game, do you know where he would have finished? 2300 yards from scrimmage and 24TDs. In previous seasons, when Zeke was getting similar volume, all anyone said was, ""of course he is leading the league, he's getting the most touches"" but now that it's someone else, not only does that make them ""better"" but it's being used against Zeke as ""evidence"" to why they think he is worse. If that's not a form of bias, I don't know what is.

Najee, Mixon, Kamara, McCaffery, and Taylor were all averaging 20 touches per game consistently. In the 2021 season, when Zeke got 20 touches (weeks 3-7, injured week 4), do you know what he was averaging? 5.1 per carry, 6 yards per catch, and 5.26 yards per touch overall. Hell the only ones of those you listed that played in every game were Harris and Taylor, yet you are trying to tell me that because they got the ball more, they are better Running backs? That goes back to the double standard being shoved onto Zeke right now.

We haven't even discussed Zeke's ability to pass block either. That plus his durability are probably what gives him the greatest versatility among all the backs you listed. Can you nitpick and find a single thing or two that one of them does better than Zeke? Probably, but there is not a single other back in the league that can do *everything* you can ask of a running back at an elite/high level, and do it every single game to boot. Not one. Versatility has value, durability has value, and reliability has value. That's why Zeke's contract isn't just about production - it's about everything he brings to the table and the fact that no one else can do that.

I said all that to say this - If all you want are fantasy stats and flashy plays, that's cool, just admit that you are only looking for that when you say ""better running back,"" and that you aren't actually evaluating players based on all of their abilities but rather the ones that show up on the stat sheet. You aren't alone either, most football fans these days fall into this trap.

There isn't a single RB in the NFL playing today that can say that besides Zeke. Pollard has missed that many in half the time and 25% of the workload. Point Zeke.
3. Reliability - This one is tricky because I understand your point but you aren't factoring in opportunity or standard deviations. Has Zeke fumbled that many times? Yes but it has been over the course of almost 2000 touches compared to Pollards almost 400 (Zeke's 1.1% fumble rate vs Pollard's .7%) Now lets talk about standard deviations. They are a variance measurement based on a relative carrys relationship to the mean. So a player that consistently gets the same yardage would have a smaller deviation than a boom or bust player would have. Smaller Std. Dev = more consistent/reliable. Based on both of these factors, I lean towards a point for Zeke.
4. Speed - I agree that Pollard was faster, but with his plantar fascia injury last year we have yet to see him hit that top speed again that made this true. That said still a point for Pollard
5. Vision - This one is hard to measure based on scheme and opportunity but at no point is contact balance lumped in here (nice try though?). To me being able consistently get yards in the trenches is more impressive than getting a higher YPC on outside runs where speed gets you in open space. Being able to navigate 10 bodies and get consistent yardage is a better reflection of good vision. Slight Edge to Zeke.
6. Contact Balance - This one isn't close. Pollard is fast and shifty but often gets tackled by the first defender that makes contact. Zeke often pushes piles for extra yards after contact and by the time he goes down there are 2-3 defenders assisting on the tackle. Point Zeke.
7. Strength - We both agree that this is Zeke.

So in total that leaves this comparison at 5-2 Zeke. I'm not suggesting that he is the same player he was in 2016 with the explosive plays, but to expect him to be that same player after 6 years is unreasonable in it of itself. I would be happy to continue this conversation if we can keep it civil. Thanks for your opinion in advance.

Edit: Left out durability, but still follows the principals of Availability. So in actuality this comparison is 6-2 in favor of Zeke.",0.0,cowboys,t3_uql4ud,False,0.0,Ezekiel Elliott,2022-05-16T12:24:34Z,cowboys,0.00980903244541

You are setting that bar way too high. The average hit rate on 1st round picks is 53%. There is such a thing as expecting too much:

2011: Tyron Smith - No explanation needed, he was a great pick.

2012: Morris Claiborne - Started for us for 5 years before we let him go

2013: Travis Frederick - All Pro Center that started from day 1.

2014: Zack Martin - All Pro Guard that started from day 1.

2015: Byron Jones - A stud at multiple positions, but we let him walk. He is still a starter in the league.

2016: Ezekiel Elliott - He's been a top 10 RB in 6/6 seasons as a Cowboy.

2017: Taco Charlton - This was a miss, I think we can all agree on that.

2018: Leighton Vander Esch - Didn't play up to expectations but has had neck injuries.

2019: No Pick

2020: CeeDee Lamb - Phenomenal so far, and any team in the NFL would be happy to have him.

2021: Micah Parsons - 1 season in and he started and was arguably our best defender last year.

But nobody claims we are the best offense in football while missing all the guys we were. That was what bothered me, not the underlying point that we needed to do way better on offense (which again I still agree with).",11.0,nfl,t3_qzqq83,False,0.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,2021-11-22T12:54:24Z,cowboys,0.0481200245767373

We claim to be the best offense because of CD, Coop, Tyron, Zeke, Dak, etc. How many teams can really say they would be effective down their two top WRs and a HoF LT? Not to mention losing both of them essentially at game time so you can’t plan for it (Coop like a day before and CD during the game). 

Sure we should’ve done more on offense and it was a very winnable game, but to say we were operating at close to full strength an offense just isn’t the case.

These guys missing also basically allowed them to play how they did. They basically ran single man coverage all game and you can’t do that if you have to account for Coop and CD. That basically helped kill out already underperforming line in the game. Tyron also essentially takes away the entire pass rush of a guy on the left side as well.",50.0,nfl,t3_qzqq83,False,0.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,2021-11-22T11:51:09Z,cowboys,0.0218462869696083

**TRADE**: Cowboys send picks 24 and 167 to the Chiefs for picks 29, 94 and 103. Chiefs select the best WR available, Olave.

**TRADE #2**: Cowboys send picks 56, 129 and a 2023 3rd to the Texans for picks 37, a 2023 7th and a 2024 7th (PFF trade logic idk man.)

1.29: Kenyon Green. I wanted Zion Johnson here but he went two picks earlier to the Bucs. Luckily, we stayed ahead of the Bengals to take him for ourselves. Probably the best iOL in the draft and we get him at 29 while getting two extra 3rd round picks. 

2.37 Nik Bonitto. Hes a first round talent that no one seems to realize is gonna be available in round 1 for everyone. I believe he had the highest pass rush win rate among all edge rushers in college last year. Big name to trade up for to put next to D-Law and Micah Parsons.

3.88 Marcus Jones. He’s a bit small for the CB position at just 5’8, but his ball skills are amazing. He’s also by far the best return man in the draft, so now we have a punt returner available to us and a KR if Pollard goes down.

3.94 Romeo Doubs. I’m not gonna lie, I don’t know much about Doubs. He was ranked as the best WR available and I took him. Very good value anyways, considering we still have another pick from the Chiefs trade.

3.103 Cade Otton. Yes I know Jelani Woods is a monster, but Otton is very good. He is a very solid receiving TE and can block better than probably any TE we’ve started in a game in the last couple years. Very solid value.

**No 4th round picks**

5.155 Cordale Flott. Just a case of BPA, there’s never an issue with having a good CB room so we go with the best player there and get another solid CB, making an insurance policy if we were to get rid of AB and Lewis after this season.

5.176 Nephi Sewell. He’s a very solid linebacker out of Utah and I had just noticed I hadn’t taken a single LB up to this point. He can definitely be a solid player for us if used.

5.178 Noah Elliss. He’s our Bohanna in this draft, just a big dude who’s gonna stuff the run. Nothing wrong with deepening the DT room again, as it seems we won’t be getting Urban back.

6.193 Dai'Jean Dixon. Another great value pick at WR. He’s a very underrated player in this draft and he’s gonna go very late. We get a steal here.


I will admit, not my best mock draft for us but I think if we did this IRL, I wouldn’t complain one bit. Trades may be a bit unrealistic but might as well have a bit of fun with PFF trade logic.",5.0,cowboys,t3_u0thpf,False,0.0,Micah Parsons,2022-04-11T08:44:33Z,cowboys,0.0217091796343687

>>When he recovered, Jackson ran home, picked up a .22 caliber rifle and was determined to kill the teen-ager who had just brought him to his knees.

Tony Romo was a very good QB, who became elite a bit too late in his career, after injuries had already taken their toll. Additionally, he had the misfortune of operating throughout all but maybe two of his seasons with average-or-worse offensive lines. If he had the o-line that Dak has been afforded, we would probably be singing a different tune. Would he have a ring? I don't know. Brees only got one, Peyton - my pick for GOAT QB - just got 2. The list of greats who didn't get a ring is longer than the list of not-that-greats who did get one, so if that's your (royal you) measuring stick then it's not even really worth debating, since the disagreement is on a foundational level.

But the one thing Romo has always been really good with is his fortitude, both mental and physical. So I don't think a mistake he made in his ""rookie"" year is going to haunt him in games 10 years down the line.

I feel like if the Cowboys hit 50 years without a Super Bowl, they'd still be up there, whereas if the Patriots hit 20 years without one, you probably won't see them in the top 5.

Besides, parity is too prevalent nowadays. If you have a high grade QB, you've got a decent shot at a ring. So even the lowest valued teams in the league can win one, because there is so much money in the game now that the salary cap, even maxed out, is chump change to most owners.

""This is of literally no importance."" This is such a dumb-sounding take, you realize it looks like you're saying they're pointing for no reason, right? Like they just do that for fun and all QB's ""point"" the same way. I'm guessing what you are meaning to say here is that all QB's direct their OL pre-snap, and this is true. The author of the article is claiming *Dak is especially good at this*, meaning while the OL is executing the action effectively, Dak is directing them and calling attention to defensive positioning prior to that happening, and therefore has some credit to the OL play. To suggest all QB's are exactly equal in this is wrong, and you're being deliberately obtuse to chalk it up to some meaningless ""pointing.""

As far as WRs go, I purposely ignored it because I figured everybody understood that regardless of which QB you're referring to, they require some level of offensive talent to achieve success. When a QB that people like or consider good like has a down season, they can chalk it up to not having receivers or OL help. When Joe Burrow or Stafford or whoever have Ja'marr Chase and Cooper Kupp, they get praise and nobody says ""oh they're just being carried by their WR group,"" yet here you are, making that claim for Dak because you want to create a narrative, despite Amari Cooper being a good but not top 5 WR that just got traded for a 5th round pick.

Dak, Stafford, Burrow, whoever, all need some level of OL help and WR to succeed. If you personally think Dak should be below the other two, that is fine, I don't care, but to act like Dak is only a product of those around him but other QB's are the ones that deserve the credit regardless of their cast is pretty clearly just showing off your eagles flair.",1.0,nfl,t3_x7bbro,False,0.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,2022-09-06T15:41:24Z,cowboys,0.0830340041707746

From the article:

>	BIGGEST STRENGTH: PRE-SNAP
It’s odd how little credit Dak receives for the work he does before the snap. It’s not like this is a recent development; he’s been vigilant in that phase of the game since his rookie season. He’s just a lot better at it now, which tends to happen as a quarterback gains experience. Dak’s success is often attributed to his offensive line, but he can be seen pointing them in the right direction on certain plays and making sure any potential pass rushers are accounted for. Next time you watch Dak play, pay attention to what he’s doing at the line of scrimmage.",3.0,nfl,t3_x7bbro,False,0.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,2022-09-06T13:00:57Z,cowboys,0.0672883487654321

Our O-line is play is poor. It can't run block and can barely pass block. Plus we had so many Drive killing penalties by the O-line.  


  
Our Run Game is ineffective. Zeke averaged 1.6 yds a carry, Pollard 3.0. Some of the Blame falls on Kellen Moore for his playcalling. I know the O-line didn't help, but good running teams aren't this O-line reliant.  


  
Dak needs to step up. He has been missing throws or making it hard for the Receivers to catch them. He also Checked it down way too much. Why doesn't he throw downfield? Kellen Moore's playcalling is reminding me of Jason Garret.

The thing that people were quoting regarding the WAS loss + strength of victory didn't happen because NE lost to IND on Thurs and some other game results (Chargers loss too, iirc).

I would argue that our losses were always the plan.  Coopers contract literally had an out built in for this year so that depending on what happened with Gallup's contract, they could choose.  I would rather have cooper this year than not, but he probably wasn't living up to his contract.  

Lael clearly was planned to let go.  They though Steele was better last year and cheaper and less of a headache.

I dislike losing Gregory, but I think we currently have more talent at RE than we did last year with him.

Beyond that, our holes are on the OL, and to be honest after using our 1st round draft pick on an OL, there aren't high level starters out there just available for the taking, or I think we would've.

We literally had no idea what we were getting in terms of recovery from the leg/ankle, or what would happen with the shoulder, but we knew that we were paying him like the #2 highest paid QB in the league no matter what.  

Now, by all accounts Dak 100% healthy (knock on wood) and is already like the 5th-7th highest paid QB with more guys to be signed in the nxt yr.

Not 'RIGHT NOW' per se, but Tank Lawrence broke his foot in mid Sept.  This year he's healthy and making less money per year.

Last year we drafted a perceived trouble maker in the first round who right now appears to be a real team glue guy who came in 2nd in DPOY votes as a Rookie.

Last year, Travon Diggs was coming off of a decent rookie year but we didn't know what we had, or that he would have the best CB season any Cowboy has had since Deion.


Add in Dan Quinn, Jayron Kearse and Malik Hooker, last year question marks who this year are huge contributors.  We know more who Schultz is.

We also know that allowing Pollard to just be Zeke's breather isn't in the plans this year.


So we still have questions for sure, but I think to Jerry's credit, we have more answers than we did last year.

Go back and watch games from last year, especially later in the year... specifically the 49ers game.  When we didn't come out scoring and teams stuck with the run against us, they just gashed us.  When Micah blitzes on a run play, unless he stops it dead on the blitz, it's wide open.  When Micah blitzes on a pass play, if he doesn't hurry/sack the qb, a they leak a RB out with no one near him.

LVE is just ok at best, and people expecting the world out of Jabril Cox are setting themselves up for disappointment.  He has potential, but he's essentially a rookie this year... also, his biggest strength was in coverage.  So 50% of the time, we're left with no LBs to play the run.

Parsons is an obvious stud, but he's rushing the passer on most 3rd downs.

If you watch some of the games late in the year, specifically the 49ers game, they exposed our LB play.  Parsons would rush the passer and a RB would leak out of the other side and be completely wide open.  Or, Parsons would line up on one side and they would run to the other.  It became painfully clear they were just exploiting our LB play at anyone not named Micah.

Jevon Kearse essentially plays LB in a lot of passing downs, but he likely covers a TE leaving whoever our other LB is to cover a RB.  If its anyone but Parsons, it's a 1st down.
