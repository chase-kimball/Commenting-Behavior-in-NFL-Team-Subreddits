That same data shows that Lance has traits that are more superior that Lock:

* More athletic
* Better footwork
* Came from a pro-style offense (I don't think Lock took a single snap from under center in college)
* Made calls at the LOS
* Less turnover-prone

> [...] I hope you said no because those are the stats from Peyton Mannings first 18 games.

The difference between Manning and Lock is that most people believed Manning would figure it out. He also has an arguably worse team than the Broncos the last two years. The stats you call out are from Mannings rookie season, plus two games, while most of Lock's are from his second season. 

> You idiots need to chill the fuck out and have a little faith in developing a QB, before you go begging for another project that is going to yield the same results.

First off, calling people idiots is pretty childish. We can disagree, but your views on this doesn't mean that you're right and I'm an idiot. I was on the Lock train, but after not seeing any real development between year 1 and two, I'm not holding my breath.

I never said he wasn't a project. I said he's less of a project compared to Lock. Josh Rosen wasn't considered a project and the most pro ready QB in his class and it's currently on a super cheap deal with his 3rd team. The draft is a crap shoot, the two best QBs to ever play were the #1 overall pick and a 6th rounder. No one truly knows how good anyone can be.

> The kid has rushed for 1/3 of his total TD's, played one season of CFB and against not a single ranked team at that.

He also threw 28 TDs and 0 picks, he's a not a gunslinger and doesn't make bone headed decisions.

I think everyone in the world understands that covid carries some risk but as the world and the US gets vaccinated these players and everyone need to learn how to return to real life and understand that the risk to the younger population is pretty much non-existent. They actually have greater risk of mental issues than covid. I am vaccinated and know first hand how bad the virus is so it's difentaly here but with all other 30 teams playing idk how us skipping out on OTAs keeps them save from anything when we start back up...I for one would be at OTAs and trying to win...seems like they don't think we can win.

It feels good to have something to be excited for with regard to football. We have a legitimate chance to be a competitor again.

something i posted in another thread:

This is my opinion but I think he never got a fair shake. Last year was basically his rookie season. I've followed the Broncos since 1998 religiously and I have never seen injuries on a team like last year. No OTA, no minicamp, new OC, the entire book was stacked against him. Drew has essentially improved every single year of his football career since his freshman year at college (except last year) and he was still improving this offseason. The dude really, really had the chance to turn the corner. It just makes zero sense to me how you don't start him and bench him if he's not continuing to show improvement. I feel for him because I feel like he's done everything asked of him and shown the growth to get the shot. I'm a little bitter about it tbh.


edit: i'm glad to see there are a lot of like-minded Broncos fans regarding this. I was expecting there to be a lot of rejoicing by the Broncos fans when/if this decision was made after all the hate Lock got last year.

edit2: just to throw some optimism into this somewhat bitter day, if our defense even shows a glimpse of the potential they have then we could see something very special this year from them. those boys are all grading out beautifully this pre-season and we're pretty much stacked at every single position on defense with good depth too.



 i just hope it's enough to get us to the post-season. kinda feels like the days of ball control offense/hard nosed defense winning championships are over in this new day and age with the young dynamic OCs who use a lot of technology/metrics for playing calling and the rule-set basically favoring offense over defense now.",14.0,denverbroncos,t3_pbi8m8,False,0.0,Demaryius Thomas,2021-08-25T14:24:30Z,denverbroncos,0.0565823186887821

Tyreek did not break his son's arm. That was never what the case was about. The doctor said from the very beginning that it looked like it was caused by a fall. The problem was that the boy had bruises all over his body. Tyreek and the boys mom both said they spanked the child with their hands and with a belt, so it was impossible to determine which parent caused those bruises. When those two found out how serious it was about to get, they lawyered up. Sadly, those cases are really hard to win when there's no plausible deniability. When both parents can plausibly deny that they were the ones who caused the bruises, you're not going to win so no one was charged even though some really wanted to go after him.

Second of all, he has been found guilty in the past and has admitted his guilt on domestic abuse several times over. The fact that he privately denies it to the person he abused is horrifying.

Personally, I don't care what your life experiences are. If you choke and punch a woman you know to be pregnant, you don't get a second chance in my book. Nothing excuses that kind of behavior. If you are given a second chance and all the therapy and management he received, life experiences are no longer an excuse for ANY of that behavior.

All hate means is to dislike intensely. There is no connotation of that word that automatically equates to a death wish. I dislike Tyreek Hill, and anyone who has done the types of things we know he has done, with a passion. I think his transgressions are more than enough to bar him from the league. Instead, my son's elementary school has ""Cheetah Day"" where they're all supposed to wear cheetah print in his honor and look up to him as a role model. That's a privilege he should not retain. There's nothing wrong with this whole situation causing hate. Hate is not something to be ashamed of or ridiculed. Hate is simply having intense feelings, and I embrace our ability to have such strong emotions.

As far as my morals go, is it really too much to ask that people condemn domestic abuse? We're not talking about splitting hairs on some complex issue here.

Those aren't the same thing and they word it that way purposely. All it means if you aren't charged is that there wasn't enough evidence against you. All it means if you are found not guilty is that there wasn't enough evidence to convict you. That doesn't mean you aren't innocent, but it's absolutely not a statement that you are.

The legal system's job is to determine when there is enough evidence to prosecute a case. They're not the moral standard filing charges every time someone has committed a crime regardless of what they can prove.

The arm was the big media focus-point. You are right about that. And it's unfortunate that everyone got absorbed into that one little part of this whole event. It wasn't what the investigation was about and there was likely no crime surrounding that portion of it. The investigation was about the bruises and welts after both parents admitted using a belt on a toddler.

It was a big enough deal for them to investigate. It was a big enough deal for a DA to lose his professionalism for a moment out of frustration that there was nothing he could do with the amount of evidence they had. There was a crime. He knew who likely did it. There wasn't enough there to convict against a public defender, let alone the lawyers they would have been facing.

Personally, I don't think it's a waste of energy to have these discussions. The public's perception of what the criminal system is and does is extremely skewed the wrong way. They aren't infallible. They aren't magic. They're human beings who have to look the other way when other cases are a better use of their resources. The CPS is all of that multiplied a dozen times over.

I've said it many times before, but here is what we can say 100 percent. There is no doubt about these facts:

* The toddler had bruises and welts.
* Tyreek and his significant other both hit the child with their hands and with a belt.

Are you really OK supporting those people? Is that really the hill you want to make your stand on?

Like I said, the only way that CPS will try to prosecute when no one is working with them is in extremely severe situations or repeated incidents. One incident of bruises and welts without a clear guilty party is enough for them to spend their resources on.

Hell, it's estimated that up to 5 percent of people in prison have been found guilty but are innocent. The legal system isn't the be all and end all of our morality. 

Unfortunately, when it comes to child abuse, the system's hands are tied more often than not. When parents don't want to work with child protective services, the cases are nearly impossible to move forward. The only cases that typically bring charges are when there is severe malnutrition or serious injuries. In the case of welts and bruises, it typically has to be a reoccurring and frequent factor for charges to be brought. 

Hill didn't cooperate with CPS. Neither parent did. And since both admitted to acts that might have caused the bruising and welts, the case couldn't move forward.

He committed that crime and the fact that he's able to try and tell her he didn't hurt her is a really serious sign of continuing abusive behavior.

He also never denies punching his son in the chest to ""man him up"" when he's crying. They both admitted to investigators to using a belt on the toddler. And I can't imagine one single man who isn't abusive EVER saying ""you need to be terrified of me too, bitch"" after being told that his son is scared of him. 

I get that they have a toxic relationship and that she isn't a good person, either. But that doesn't clear Hill's name. He's not some great father who hooked up with a crazy woman who tries to frame him all the time.

I'm not even saying that Hill (or others like Adams) are ""wrong"" per se, I just figured more of them would go the route of Brady with trying to win with a good supporting cast that does as much as they can to get those wins, instead of just trying to get paid as much as possible. Money is absolutely a factor, I just figured it would be slightly less important than winning the game they're out playing.

My **only** criticism throughout all of this is the mindset of choosing to go to a team with a significantly lower chance of winning a championship instead of trying to win AND get paid, something that KC was offering to him (and has proven to be capable of doing both).

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

We all said who Teddy was and he proved us right. He‚Äôs a mediocre QB who failed to utilize our skill position players and elevate the rest of the team. Starting him was a waste of time and set back the development of other players. Jeudy had 0 TDS this year, Sutton only 2. 

I also don‚Äôt support the argument Vic hasn‚Äôt had a QB and thus a fair shot. Good coaches find a way to win, not make excuses. Bill Belichick went 10-5 with Matt Cassel in ‚Äò08.

11490,70370,70370,Lieutenant_Meeper,"Too many cheeky answers, not enough help in this thread. 

You don't have to pick a team right away, although you can if you want. Much like the football clubs in the UK, people tend to pick the team that's from the town they live in/near. But some people just pick a team that plays in a way they like, or that has uniforms that appeal to them, or that are associated with something they like (e.g. are tigers your favorite animal? Then consider the Cincinnati Bengals), etc. Another big consideration is the history of a franchise. Taking the Bengals as an example, they've had some highlights of success over the years, but overall they've really struggled and have occasionally earned the nickname ""Bungles"", having never won a Super Bowl and having long stretches of bad years. Right this moment, though, they're decent, having just won a playoff game with a bright young star quarterback (the guy who throws the ball) and wide receiver (one of the guys whose job it is to catch the ball). 

As a counter-example, take my own Denver Broncos (the logo is in my flair). From the time they were started in 1960 up until about the mid-70s, they were absolutely putrid. From then until about five years ago, though, they were consistently in the top tier of the NFL, winning more games than most and going to the Super Bowl eight times (3-5). The last few years have been bad, though: five straight losing seasons and two coaching changes. The team has a lot of talent on it now, but it all hinges on getting a good quarterback and a good new coach. Also, the team is almost certainly going to be getting a new owner this spring. So, the Denver Broncos might be a great team to hitch your wagon to if you're optimistic that it will rise again, with a really rabid fanbase and a history of success....or, perhaps it will take years to recover, if ever, and you'll be cheering for a perennially disappointing ""Donkeys"" team. 

The NFL famously has a lot of parity, but for some reason some franchises just seem cursed.  For instance, the Detroit Lions have a storied history of championships, awesome colors/mascot, and represent a grand old working class town‚Äîbut they haven't won a playoff game since 1992, went winless once (0-16 in 2008), and just can't seem to quite get it together.  

Then you have some franchises that have reputations for accumulating bandwagon/ignorant fans who just want to be associated with a ""thing"" and might or might not be ""real"" fans as such. Perhaps unfairly, the Dallas Cowboys are one of these‚Äîthey're like the Man. United of the NFL. EDIT: The upside of this, though, is that they have enough fans spread all over the world that being able to see them on Sky or whatever service you have should be fairly easy.

I recommend learning more about the sport through youtube tutorials, highlights of games, and just watching games, as others have suggested. As you watch these, you might gradually find yourself finding a team you like. Also, feel free to hang out here. this sub is friendly and there's a lot of gentle ribbing so it's a good time, but more than that you can really learn a lot about the sport: people post statistics, news, and historical stuff all the time, and the banter in the threads draws a lot on both the history of the league and its teams/players.

I hope you enjoy becoming an NFL fan‚Äîall of us here thinks it's a great sport and there's a reason that, despite the seemingly capricious reffing and the incessant commercials and stoppages, it's absolutely king in the US. ""Sunday Night Football"" has been the highest rated show in the country for something like 20 years running, and shows little signs of being knocked off that pedestal.  Hell, televised coverage of the NFL Draft (the process through which teams pick new young players) gets higher ratings than championship games of any of the other sports.

12755,77140,77140,Mister_Jay_Peg,"> Yeah I was pretty shocked that a player who‚Äôs position is largely dependent on offensive line play

Our OL was garbage his first two seasons (remember, Bolles was a penalty machine, we rotated RT's like ball bearings and Risner wasn't drafted yet).

> didn‚Äôt do well on one of the worst teams in the league.

To clarify, he was worse behind that line than Ingram, Johnson and Burkhead. They all did bad, but he was the worst by a margin.

> Lindsay is a burner and thrives on speed not power, he hits holes in the line hard, if they aren‚Äôt there he will fail.

Lemme call you back to those first to OL's again, before Munch got to Denver. They sucked. SO this really isn't holding water.

> I never claimed he was a great back but he has always been a good player and people seem to have a hard time understanding that a 2 time 1000 yard rusher and pro bowler would have been good to keep on the team as a 1B back to javonte or melvin

Except with a better line in 2020 than he had in 2018/2019 he WAS the 1B back to Melvin and uh... 118 carries for 502 yards and 1 TD.

Now, my turn. For a back that relied on speed, not power, he had an amazingly hard time turning that speed into break out runs. Wanna know how many 20+ carries he had in 3 years with the Broncos?

Answer: Less than 8 in every season. Less than 8.

Speed backs should be able to get the edge on an outside zone run, right? Then why was he SUCH AN INSIDE THE NUMBERS BACK?

How is his run blocking?

Answer: It's hot garbage and it never got better in 4 seasons. So you can't really put him out there on passing downs to block.

How was his pass catching and route running?

Answer: Also hot garbage. He could run a swing route DECENTLY but like... RB's can actually... ya know... have route trees. Not just be the last dump-off option. So you couldn't really put him out there on passing downs as a viable receiving option.

So he's what I love. When Lindsay was every on the field it basically TELEGRAPHED that we were running the ball or only putting 3ish viable receivers into the field to defend, and that the defense could hot call to a blitz to blow his ass up in pass pro.

YEAH, THAT'S USEFUL.

>People really love to pretend athletic LB's who show little coverage ability in college will become Luke Kuechly in the NFL. He does neither of these things with regularity and you're projecting these traits onto him.

Not sure where the ""comparing him to Kuechly"" thing is coming from, but if you don't think Parson's has shown the traits that translate into coverage ability I wanna know what tape you're not watching. If all you're saying is ""we don't have a lot of tape on that"" well then that's a different story. But his lateral quickness shows you he can move across the middle on the dart and jab routes without breaking down, his ability to turn his hips when he recognizes outside run and goes into pursuit shows you he has the body skills to flip when he needs to carry with a TE, his 3-cone of 6.89 shows you that he can keep on top of a TE/RB on cuts in their route, and a 4.40ish straight line tells you he's not going to get outrun on a go.

But yeah, he shows NO TRAITS that translate to good coverage, even with light tape.

I'd ask again, if we are at 9, outside of QB is there a bigger need with a better player available?

Sure, we could still pick Farley or Surtain since Fuller is on a 1yr deal. Sure, we could grab a 3rd WR1... Sure we could grab an eventual RT starter when this OL class has starter level tackles up and down the first 3 rounds...

But like... Couldn't you also fill those low-need positions with ""capable mid-round guys""?

12803,77312,77312,Mister_Jay_Peg,"Phil made the Pro Bowl as rookie in a year where the AFC RB field was........... *light*. Mixon led the AFC with like 1100 yards. And he got the fan vote because he was a good story.

I hate to knock down a good local kid, but Lindsay is not a starting RB in the NFL, and he's going to have to go to a weak team to even be a #2.

His pass blocking is 100% garbage, and he was just absolutely not good as a pass catcher so when he was in the game on passing downs, opposing defenses loved to check to gap blitzes that would isolate him because they knew he'd be blown up. Remember how many times over the last 3 years we'd see promising drives end up puffing away like a fart? Wanna know the #1 recipe to make that happen? A running back who gets 0-2 yards on almost 1/4 of his carries, gets negative yards about 10-12% of the time, and who is a liability on 2nd/3rd and long no matter how he's used, blocker or receiver. 

He plays zero on special teams, so he's useless there, and like... People think he's got this great vision to pop thru holes but like... The dude is SMALL. It's not his GREAT VISION that does it, it's that his size allowed him to hit the hole while being shielded from the opponent's front 7 by lineman bodies until he squirted thru. Even when you look at his per-game stats, you see a really clear trend. He has six 100-yard games in 42 career games. One out of every 7 games. 

2018 Raiders, Steelers, Bengals. 2019 Chargers, Lions. 2020 Patriots. All except the Steelers played stacked 4-3 with their IDL's playing 2-gap.

And yeah, you can say the 2020 Pats play a hybrid that runs 2-3-4 up front but they also sucked ass this year missing what, 4 starters due to opt-out?

But that brings up another point. Fans LOVE Lindsay's break out runs, but really they uh... They're not nearly as common as people think. And when they do happen, they tend to bolster an otherwise not awesome game. And also when they happen, they rarely end up being SCORING plays, which is a big deal, since his propensity for negative-to-plus-2 carries are like... About 1/3 of his carries, so drives stall... Of his 18 TD's in 3 years? TWO have been 50+ yards. (65, 55, 41, 30, 29, 28, 27). So shit, only 7 out of 18 were even 10+ yards. That doesn't get the job done.

Now yeah, he's had 11 out of 42 games where he averaged over 5.0 YPC. That's a nice tidy number. (Ignore that he has 17 games under 4.0 YPC for now............) ((For now.))

In those 11 games a single run of 20+ yards accounted for 30%+ of his yards for the day. So it's not like he was ripping off 4-5-6-10 yards at a time. He was getting 2-3 yards and then broke one (and at BEST two) 20+ runs. 

So like... SUPER, he's made one Pro Bowl. Awesome.

If Phillip Lindsay is on the field in an obvious passing down defenses will check specifically to gap blitzes that they KNOW he has to pick up because... He's gonna get run over. In 2019, he was rated by PFF as LITERALLY THE WORST PASS BLOCKING BACK IN THE LEAGUE THAT HAD ENOUGH SNAPS TO QUALIFY. In 2020 he didn't even have enough snaps, but what they graded him on IS JUST AS BAD.

He's not a great or even good receiver either. Even before MelGo was added did you ever notice that Royce Freeman was out there in most passing situations? Because he is a DECENT pass catcher, which is still better than Lindsay was. Literally. Royce Freeman. Royce. Freeman. Better receiver than Lindsay. And Eckeler is 10x as good as that. Chargers let MelGo leave because Eckler is a better pass-catching back, and MelGo is damn good himself.

And his ""vision""? Dude, do you even know what you're talking about with that? He doesn't see holes better than the rest of the AFCW backs, he's not finding these insanely hidden gaps a split second before they open. He's small AF and is able to get up to the line behind blockers and the defense can't see what gap he's running to, so they're a hair late on the runs he breaks. But when defenses maintain gap discipline? He gets SMOKED for 0-2 yards on almost ONE QUARTER OF HIS CARRIES. Stuffed for loss more than any AFCW by a large margin, too. SO what if he breaks off a couple of 15-20 yard runs per game when they are followed up with drive killing stuffs on 1ns and 2nd immediately after?

And dude, screens, when properly run, are ABSOLUTELY not easy to stop. Watch KC and Reid execute the screen game to perfection week in and week out. Watch the Chargers get Eckler like 40 receiving yards a game on 2-3 screens. Lindsay only gets screen routes because they SHOULD be no-brainer gainers. At least as good as an outside sweep. But he is TERRIBLE at the most critical part of a screen game. Catch and move. A good screen game has a back who will be on his plant foot as soon as the ball is in his hands. He doesn't have time to catch, secure, look and go. And guess how Lindsay catches the ball? Catch. Secure. Look. Go. SO he's getting the LB's and DB's coming up into linemen who literally can not get set to go and block because they can't leave him too far behind them when they go. SO they have to wait, and be flat footed, and now all of a sudden those missile-aimed defenders are harder to block, too.

And now ask, why did Gordon and Freemen get the actual wheel or jet or needle routes out of the backfield? Same reason. They could catch the ball, plant and go. Lindsay can not.

Bruh, I get it. Phillip Lindsay is a great hometown story and a fan favorite on par with Tebow-mania.

But just like Tebow, Lindsay's MASSIVE faults and failings are being ignored because of the great story and the VERY rare flashes of awesome that just flat out don't happen enough to matter.

I like Phil, I really do. Good story, great guy. Not a starting caliber RB. Not a lead back in a committee.

His pass blocking is just bad. There's no other way to say it. It's just not good. And it won't GET good. That's not something that clicks in Year 4. He's too small to take on a stunting DE or a blitzing LB.

When he's in the game, defenses KNOW it's likely a run. Because he's not good in the passing game for whatever reason. But when he's in defenses are stacking the box on 1st/2nd. If he's in on 3rd and anything long-ish? They check to blitzing all the time, and they check to a blitz that's going to target him.

Wanna know why our offense is sluggish all the time? Try starting like half your drives with a second and long because something like 1/4 of his runs are for like 0-2 yards. That's not good at all. Sure, his YPC is close to 5, but that's because he'll break one or two 20 yard runs a game. And those would be GREAT if they ended up as scores. But they don't. They're then followed by those 0-2 yard runs that stall promising drives.

Phil Lindsay is going to go to another team and end up like a lot of those fan favorites that we hype so much here. He's gonna be a backup, change of pace kind of guy.

Three or four times a season, we'll have fans giving him the Tebow treatment, remembering the occasional AWESOME play and just absolutely forgetting the 75% of his game that was AT BEST average, and often much less.

I am simply pointing out that it should not matter the amount of cases or accusers Ben and Kobe were both rapists and are treated way differently than people are treating Watson. so I was making the point that you cannot and should not take the moral high ground in this case if you are also not willing to agree that Ben and Kobe and others are in deed rapists and deserved to be kicked out of their respective leagues.

Wright was a five-time Pro Bowl choice (1977-79, ‚Äò83, ‚Äò85) and is one of nine players in franchise history to be selected to at least five Pro Bowls. He was named All-NFL by The Sporting News, Pro Football Weekly and the NEA in 1977, a year in which he was a key member of Denver‚Äôs 12-2 team that became the first in franchise history to make the playoffs en route to reaching Super Bowl XII against Dallas.

For his career, Wright helped the Broncos earn six playoff berths (1977-79, ‚Äò83-84, ‚Äò86), four division titles (1977-78, ‚Äò84, ‚Äò86) and two Super Bowl appearances (XII in ‚Äò77 and XXI in ‚Äò86). He received All-AFC honors from UPI in 1985 after posting five interceptions that year while his teammates voted him Denver‚Äôs MVP on defense following both the 1982 and ‚Äò84 seasons.

Wright played 166 career games as a Bronco, including 163 starts that ranked fourth in club history at the time of his retirement and currently stand eighth.

The defensive back played every game in a season eight times, including the 1983 campaign in which he recorded a career and team-high six interceptions.

What's your understanding of his role on the coaching staff? I've seen him mentioned as almost a co-defensive coordinator.

>MR: ""Well said by you in terms of the title not always reflecting the responsibilities. The actual title is inside linebackers coach. Watching him during the game days, my read on what he does is he's in charge of the personnel groupings. You want to go nickel? He's the point person that's making sure nickel gets on the field. You want to go dime? Jerod's the point person for that communication. He's not holding the play sheet to make the calls on defense. That looks like Steve Belichick to me, the outside linebackers coach. That's why I think you sort of hear the co-defensive coordinator, because you have one guy calling the plays, it looks like, in Steve Belichick ‚Äî and Bill Belichick, the head coach, has sort of referenced that in the past, that Steve has called the plays ‚Äî and you have another guy signaling in the personnel packages, that's Jerod, right there on the front lines, very active in what's happening defensively. And then you have Bill himself, Bill Belichick, who you watch on the sideline and he's always flipping through the still pictures of, you presume, what they're looking at from the other team's offense. So Bill is still involved defensively. It's sort of like that trio, however you want to piece it together, that's my read on what's happening defensively and where Jerod fits in the whole scheme of things. I think it would be interesting to talk to players and sort of really drill down and say, 'OK, when you go from your full team meeting to your defensive meeting, who's leading that discussion in the room?' My sense of it ‚Äî and I don't know this for sure ‚Äî is there might be a mix of sorts, depending on what they're talking about or trying to accomplish that day.""",2.0,denverbroncos,t3_s7ynm0,False,0.0,4-Star Mod,2022-01-19T14:05:06Z,denverbroncos,0.0360551201398774

We walked out for a practice this year, and Dan Quinn's got a helmet on and he's doing these different drills with the defensive linemen to get them ready to play. They were playing New England, and he was getting them ready for the different things they were going to see from their offensive line and different blocks that the New England offensive linemen would do. That was just another example where you see he's a very hands-on, fiery guy. Very relatable to the players, to the point where it kind of surprised me that he would call games and ‚Ä¶ prefers to call the defense from up in the box. He just seems like a guy that would be perfect on the sideline, and he certainly was in that New Orleans game. ‚Ä¶ I think honestly that the Cowboys should try and make him their head coach. I just think the way he turned over that defense, with the way this season ended, I think Dan Quinn is the type of guy that they need to be their head coach. [If] they lose him, it's going to be a huge blow to their defense and to their team in general. It's not going to be easy to replace a guy who did as much as he did.""",13.0,denverbroncos,t3_s7fvwn,False,0.0,4-Star Mod,2022-01-18T21:11:17Z,denverbroncos,0.0192088866383577

**On what he‚Äôs learned about QB Teddy Bridgewater**

‚ÄúJust his leadership day in and day out. Seeing him out on the field the way he commands things, the way he communicates with the guys after the plays, and things like that. [I‚Äôve always] seen him from afar and seen what he‚Äôs been able to accomplish and the way he‚Äôs played throughout his career but to be here with him on a day-to-day basis talking to him throughout the building and seeing him on the field his leadership definitely sticks out to me. I think that‚Äôs a great asset to have for a quarterback. To be able to communicate with the young guys, communicate in ways that they can understand things, to break it down to them and tell them I want you here in certain situations. Just being able to see his leadership around the building and on the field is something that I wouldn‚Äôt have known before now.‚Äù

**On what it means to him to be named a team captain**

‚ÄúIt means a lot to be voted captain by my peers. Obviously with me coming in and I just want to be the same guy every day; come in, work hard, put my best foot forward and be a piece to the puzzle to help this team be successful. Not only that but for me, it‚Äôs all about giving what knowledge I have to the younger guys and helping bring those guys along. To be seen as a leader on this team by my peers means a lot. It‚Äôs all about coming in and every day having that energy about myself and being the same guy as I mentioned so I‚Äôm definitely grateful for that opportunity, and it means a lot.‚Äù

**On the challenges Giants RB Saquon Barkley presents to the defense and if it will be difficult due to not tackling much in training camp**

‚ÄúI mean it's hard and especially with it being the first game out of the gate not tackling much throughout camp you get a‚Äîobviously this year having a couple of preseason games we were able to go out and talk a little bit‚Äî but it's hard. [Giants RB Saquon] Barkley has tremendous talent. We know what he's capable of running the ball and out of the backfield as well.  It's just one of those things where we're going to have to get eleven hats to the ball. If he makes one guy miss, you'll have to have two or three more guys swarming the ball so I think if we can do that, we'll be fine.‚Äù",4.0,denverbroncos,t3_pkiwgk,False,0.0,4-Star Mod,2021-09-08T19:20:57Z,denverbroncos,-0.0107139278911731

**On what he‚Äôs learned about QB Teddy Bridgewater thus far**

‚ÄúTeddy likes getting a little extra work in. It's him liking to be prepared. We‚Äôll be in special teams, and he'll say, ‚ÄòHey Mel, let me get this route,‚Äô or he'll say, ‚ÄòAt the end of practice, let me get a couple routes.‚Äô He's always trying to work something with us, which I like, and which is good. He's trying to run his own meetings as far as like protection meetings, which I like. I really didn't know Teddy had that to him because I've never seen it. I just kind of assumed it, considering he's been a starter and a captain in other places. I felt like that just kind of comes with it. It's my first time seeing it firsthand, so it's good to know.‚Äù

**On QB Teddy Bridgewater‚Äôs even keeled demeanor**

‚ÄúIt just shows that no moment is ever too big for him. You‚Äôd hate to see if a quarterback made a mistake, and you see it on his face, and he's flustered. You don't want to see that from your quarterback. His calmness brings calmness to the whole group. It kind of calms everybody down, and we're going to need that. We're going to need that type of leadership from him. Teddy has been around for a while. It's not like he's the new guy coming in. He's learned from some greats, especially [former Saints QB] Drew Brees, a Hall of Famer. He knows what it takes, he's seen what it takes. There's no question that Teddy knows everything he needs to do, and he knows what he needs to do to get the job done on game day for us.‚Äù

**On why he believes the team can have success this season**

‚ÄúA lot of guys are hungry‚Äîwe‚Äôve been saying it. We've been in position last year where it just wasn't good. We started slow. We made good runs coming back but being in the hole is not a good feeling. Coming down that stretch where it's like you have to win to get in, is not a good feeling. You want to know that you have some security. You want that bye [week]. I've been part of a winning team before. The atmosphere is just so much better. When you're losing, everyone can feel it, and everything is so tense. It is what it is. That's part of the game. Everyone is tense, everyone is on edge. When you walk around, it's just tough. When you win, it's just loose. Loose is a better atmosphere, it's a better place to be. For the rookies that came in last year, they don't know how that feels, and we kind of want to get them that. Teddy has been part of a winning season. I‚Äôve had a winning season and some guys in here had some winning seasons before, especially other guys that have been with different teams. We want to bring that here because this is a winning culture here. We want to get that Super Bowl. We want to know how it feels. We‚Äôre tired of looking at [Chiefs QB] Patrick Mahomes holding it up and [Buccaneers QB] Tom Brady holding up the trophy at the end of the year. We want to change that.

**On if he believes he can fully trust WR Courtland Sutton with the difficult throws and jump balls**

‚ÄúI mentioned something in my post-game conference at the last preseason game that I saw a side of 'Court' (WR Courtland Sutton) that I had never seen. And honestly, even though he may have been limited to different things out here, it's like man, just get this guy to Sunday. He's a dog. He's out there and his energy is contagious. I'm on the sideline and I might have missed him on a throw, and he comes up to me like, 'Nah man. We got this. Trust me. You know I'm going make a play, they can't check me.' That confidence‚Äîand of course in practice you tone things down a little bit‚Äîbut to see it on gameday it's like man, let's get this guy to Sunday because he's going to lay it all on the line for the team. I have all the trust in the world in 'Court' and that entire room.‚Äù

**On what his demeanor will be like on Sunday**

‚ÄúSunday I'll be calm, cool, very chill, and I'll be excited. I'll be more excited for the guys because so many guys around here are overcoming adversity and returning to play for the first time. So many guys get to go out and live out their dream, so many guys get to go out and just compete for the families. I'll be excited also because I get to do all those same things but I'll be so excited for so many guys because like I said you've got a guy like [OLB] Von [Miller] who's going back out there in the regular season, 'Court'‚Äîguys who have overcome adversity. 'Big O' (Albert Okwuegbunam), [OLB Bradley] Chubb, and different guys so I'll be those guys' biggest fans with the right mindset though for myself and making sure I'm calm and cool.‚Äù

**On how he plans to win the fans over this season**

‚ÄúI think you win the fans over by winning football games. I've never been the guy to try to win the fans over with my words. I try to be who I am. A genuine guy, be the same person every day and hopefully, my play can be enough to win the fans over in the end. I appreciate the fans that we have here. In the last preseason game I think we had 50,000 fans or something like that so we appreciate the support that we get from them‚Äîespecially at home games. I'm pretty sure on social media guys get a lot of love and things like that‚ÄîI'm not really on social media‚Äîbut you definitely can tell that this is a football environment, and the fans want to just see the Broncos win.‚Äù",5.0,denverbroncos,t3_pkj1z7,False,0.0,4-Star Mod,2021-09-08T19:16:17Z,denverbroncos,0.0488024724213049

There‚Äôs a correlation to the point you‚Äôre making. I feel good with where he‚Äôs at. He‚Äôs had familiarity with the system coming from Minnesota.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs honestly something that I‚Äôve thought about for the past couple of years. It means everything. I think it means more because it comes from your peers‚Äîobviously, coaches and players. You would like to receive that honor from your peers, but I think it just means a great deal. Guys step into leadership roles and you can kind of feel like, ‚ÄòOK, I‚Äôm a leader on this team.

It‚Äôs truly an honor, and I‚Äôm excited for this year.‚Äù

**On the differences of playing with the ‚ÄòNo-Fly Zone‚Äô versus the current secondary**

‚Äú[Former NFL CB] Aqib [Talib]‚Äîthe whole ‚ÄòNo-Fly Zone‚Äô was kind of loud and boisterous. They let you know they make a play. My personal game style is not it‚Äôs not that way. Obviously in the moment, you get hyped up and you make plays, but you‚Äôre talking about [Former NFL CB] TJ [Ward], ‚ÄòStew‚Äô (Former NFL S Darian Stewart), Aqib, [Texans CB Bradley] Roby, [Chargers CB] Chris [Harris Jr.]. Those guys‚Äîalways, no matter what‚Äîwere going to let you know they made a play and that was their MO. That‚Äôs who they were, and they did it. I think this group carries that same type of confidence, but probably just isn‚Äôt as loud or as boisterous as that. It‚Äôs cool man‚Äîfinding your own groove as a secondary. I think we‚Äôre jelling together really well, and the biggest thing that‚Äôs going to be important is making sure that shows up on Sundays when we‚Äôre out there trying to execute on the back end.‚Äù

>With nimble feet, fantastic speed and the ability to change direction with tremendous vision, Upchurch proved himself to be a force as a return specialist, perhaps the most talented one of the era. For five consecutive seasons from 1975-1979, he ranked in the top five in punt return average, and he ranked first in that statistic in 1976, 1978 and 1982. His career average of 12.1 on punt returns ranks fifth all time.

>His eight touchdowns on punt returns also rank tied for fourth in pro football history. During his 1976 first-team All-Pro season, Upchurch became just the third player to return two punts for a touchdown in a single game.

>Upchurch also had the honor of recording the Broncos' longest play of Super Bowl XII, a 67-yard kick return, which at the time was a Super Bowl record.

>In 1979, Upchurch surpassed Emlen Tunnell to become the NFL's all-time record holder in punt return yardage.

>Simply put, Upchurch was one of the NFL's most dangerous players. Only Rod Smith and Floyd Little totaled more all-purpose yards during their Broncos careers.

>His prowess earned him selections to the NFL's 1970s and 1980s all-decade teams at the kick returner position, and in 2014, he was at long last elected to the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame.",3.0,denverbroncos,t3_nh2zem,False,0.0,4-Star Mod,2021-05-20T10:22:36Z,denverbroncos,0.04352364629183

His injury was literally a freak-accident only happens to a small percentage of athletes, its not like he's coming off an ACL/MCL,  he's fully rehab'd. 

Speaking of 'Being available is a skill' Von Miller has been our healthiest and most reliable player in the last 10 years. The guy has been healthier than JJ Watt and your concerned about him?

Von has adjusted his game as a more complete DE given our D-line has been inconsistent. Von has been a beast at stopping the run the last 3 years. Until Chubb showed up Von has had no help.  

Aaron Donald is the better player, I'll admit that but to compare performance value to Von's is not fair given the position they play and the supporting cast around them.

And one thing about Dan was he got fired so early last season that he almost went through the process that some coaches do when they have the full year off. He did that in the matter of months. He went out to Hawaii for a while. He thought through everything in terms of how he'd run the program, his scheme ‚Äî really did a self-scout, so to speak, on himself.

'DQ' is a positive, high-energy coach, whose players loved him so much in Atlanta, they basically lobbied for him to stick around a year longer than maybe Falcons ownership wanted. Also, his relationship with Paton certainly won't hurt. If Quinn takes a job elsewhere, I think Nathaniel Hackett would be a great fit in Denver.""

Quinn brings the most experience in that department to the table. Hackett and [Eric] Bienemy would be my next two picks. The separator would be the specific head coaching experience.

>""Hackett is ready to take the leap to head coach. He has play-calling experience and did wonders in Jacksonville, getting them to the AFC Championship in 2017 with Blake Bortles at quarterback. Now, he's a key piece of the high-powered Packers offense. While George Paton said he is more concerned with leadership qualities than what side of the ball the coach comes from, Hackett seems to be the best of both worlds - an energetic and creative leader with the offensive prowess to fix a Broncos offense in need of serious TLC.""

Nick Kosmider, The Athletic: Nathaniel Hackett

>""George Paton said the Broncos are looking for a coach who will 'lead the entire operation,' but we'd be naive to think putting someone into place who can jump-start the team's offense ‚Äî and the quarterback play in particular ‚Äî isn't at the top of the priority list. Hackett appears to be a candidate who would fill Paton's stated No. 1 priority: leadership. He's drawn rave reviews at each of his NFL stops for the way he connects with an energizes players, both on the practice field and in meetings. Taking that in front of the entire team on a daily basis as the head coach would be a natural transition. Then there is his work with quarterbacks. Hackett called plays for the Jaguars when they reached the AFC Championship game after the 2017 season, helping Blake Bortles to the only winning season of his career in Jacksonville. During the 42-year-old's three years as the offensive coordinator in Green Bay, Aaron Rodgers has put up some of the best numbers of his career, throwing for 111 touchdowns and just 13 interceptions during that stretch. Hackett's resume ‚Äî he also called plays as the offensive coordinator for the Bills and has been in the NFL since 2006 ‚Äî says he's ready for a chance to be a head coach, and the fit in Denver appears strong.""

20947,118149,118149,Welcome2Broncoland,"My thoughts based on the local media‚Äôs tweets/reports:

- Drew is ahead in the QB battle right now. He had that one really bad day on day 2, but has bounced back well and really benefitted from Teddy blowing up yesterday (3 interceptions). Lock still hasn‚Äôt thrown an interception despite a few throws into triple coverage that could easily have been picks. Drew has done well with the deep ball, throwing deep TDs to Hamler and Sutton. Teddy is just so boring so frequently. Teddy can throw a nice intermediate ball here and there, but just loves the dink and dunk.

- My observation from attending camp is exactly what we expected with these guys: Drew likes to let the play develop and take the shots downfield for chunk plays, Teddy likes the short throws to his first read or check downs to the safe option on deeper pass concepts. It‚Äôs noticeable how much longer Drew takes to get through his reads than Teddy, and a factor there could be decision making tendencies, but also Drew letting the play develop for his receivers deeper down the field. Drew needs to speed up his decision making though or keep developing that pocket presence because he would have been sacked a lot so far this camp.

- Jerry Jeudy is gonna be a monster. He‚Äôs always open, his route running is so crisp and he can shake any corner. He‚Äôs been extremely impressive every day.

- Another receiver really balling out: Trinity Benson. He‚Äôs caught a touchdown damn near every day at camp so far, and he has caught every ball that has come his way at all levels of the field. He‚Äôs got the burners and has ran by corners daily.

- A receiver that has been disappointing: Tyrie Cleveland. He seems to get open fairly often but has dropped so many passes these first four days. Gotta catch the ball with a receiving room this deep.

- Noah Fant has been very active in the short field. Haven‚Äôt seen him run a lot of vertical, seam routes so far. They like to run him across the field as a dump off option, which allows him to use his amazing athleticism to turn up field for a big gain.

- Lloyd Cushenberry seems to have locked down the center spot which is great. Looks like he bulked up more this offseason and is playing much stronger. That was needed as he often got pushed back by defensive tackles last year.

- Calvin Anderson got some first team reps at RT the first two days. He plays LT and RT with the second team along with Cam Fleming. Good competition between those two for the swing tackle spot as I believe Massie will be starting at RT this year.

- McTelvin Agim is making a lot of plays. Seems he gets through the line or bats a pass down every practice. Definitely looks like he has taken a step forward this offseason.

- Shelby Harris still has the best hands in the league.

The Broncos have some damn good cornerbacks, and Jeudy was getting open regularly against these guys.

>Arguably the best play from Jeudy didn‚Äôt go for a touchdown, but just showed his premium effort. He slipped on an out route, and the pass was incoming from Bridgewater. Rather than give up on the play, Jeudy leapt from the ground to snare the football on a catch that seemed like something out of ‚ÄúThe Matrix.‚Äù No matter who the passer is, Jeudy is becoming a favorite target of both.

I'm rolling out the PFF arsenal because I want to double and triple down on what my computer vision tells me about Jones: That he executed what was asked of him in Alabama's offense exceptionally well. The system that he operated within obviously featured a lot of high-caliber players. Jones was asked to value execution over improvisation, especially since he wasn't in many unfavorable game-script situations. This isn't a knock -- it's a strong foundation for learning, at least in most prospects. This also helps many QBs learn how to recognize defenses. However, we can't always get an accurate picture of the player's ultimate upside.

So I don‚Äôt know how much there is to this idea, but I have seen the argument that even if there was no racist intent behind it, it‚Äôs an example of a black coach being asked to do something that would hurt the organization and, if there with no guarantees that he‚Äôd come out of it unscathed (i.e., that the team wouldn‚Äôt fire him as a scapegoat), a subsequent (white) coach could come in a reap the rewards of a brand new top-tier QB.

- Rodgers: We also know that our FO expressed interest in him, but that the Packers weren't willing to part ways. Not much you can really do there.

Noah has brief flashes of what he could be but they are too few are far between if you ask me. In my opinion most of the time he‚Äôs horribly out of sync with what the rest of the offense is doing, mostly because the guy can‚Äôt block to save his life. In addition to this whenever he does get the ball he more acts like a paper airplane, dropping to the ground after the slightest contact. Because of his inability to play the TE position at a high level every single play he more times that not he seems to never be in the right place at the right time. If what people say about Pete Carroll‚Äôs preference for blocking TE‚Äôs is true, this is a total whiff if you ask me and I hope for Seahawks fans that either Pete changes or they get a new coach who could work with Fant to bring out the best in him

A quick note on the other players involved/the picks traded:

I used to believe in Drew, and from the beginning I really wanted the best for him. That was until I started noticing that it was not just the team/coaching staff putting him in tough positions but also his inability to rise to any occasion when he was put in a tight spot. Most of the time when met with this adversity he‚Äôd dig deep into his ‚Äúgunslinger‚Äù mentality often costing us a possession in his attempts to throw a frozen rope or hospital throw into an incredibly tight spot. People will probably scrutinize my comment and bring up how Fangio was against him and never put him in a spot to succeed which is partly true. But in my opinion with the little time he did play he did himself no favors and like Fant his flashes of what a great player he could be were too far and few between to even get someone with a grand vision like Paton to have faith in him. 

The Broncos made out like bandits in this trade, that being said I‚Äôm really bummed we are losing Shelby Harris. Not only is he an amazing player but the energy and passion he brought to the locker room was one of the few things keeping us fans energized about the team seeing someone like him trying his hardest to succeed. On top of that fans loved his pride and passion for his family, and the community. Seattle got a real one with him. 

When it comes to the trades, George Paton proves yet again why he‚Äôs in the place he is today. We still have picks in this draft and an ability to bring in some quality talent at positions we need. On top of that it‚Äôs looking more and more like Von Miller may be willing to take a team friendly deal to not only return to his original team, but also chase yet another Super Bowl ring alongside the likes of one of the best QB‚Äôs to play the game in recent times.

I‚Äôm going to this game! How fun. Broncos tailgaters, hmu. For this reason‚Äîand this reason alone‚ÄîI think we‚Äôre going to wipe the floor with these guys. It‚Äôs not because of the cult of aggression that Joe Judge has built, which has so far driven two recently signed players to quit on the spot. It‚Äôs definitely not because they just lost their starting LG and are nursing an injured their 2019 #2 pick back to health, swiss-cheese style. It‚Äôs most definitely not because Daniel Jones is Drew Lock but a little less exciting to watch. No, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôll be there on opening day, full of beer and hope. This one is a must-win for both teams, if they hope to be competitive with the consensus good teams. Should be a hoot.¬†

**WEEK TWO @ Jaguars‚ÄîW**

There‚Äôs no reason we should lose this game. Our rock-solid secondary will be a significant test for rookie Sunshine impersonator Trevor Lawrence. Despite reports from JAX that Etienne can‚Äôt be covered, and despite my love for JRob, this Jaguars team just hasn‚Äôt had enough pieces for long enough to uncover a proper identity. I‚Äôm sure that they‚Äôll get there‚Äîsay what you will about Urban, the man knows how to win‚Äîbut there‚Äôs just no way that last year‚Äôs 30/32 points for and 31/32 points against dumpster fire beats this roster.¬†

**WEEK THREE vs Jets‚ÄîW**

Speaking of dumpster fires that will soon emerge as beautiful trash Phoenixes‚Ä¶this one should (hopefully) be a repeat of the last. Elijah Moore looks great in the training camp highlight reel, but I‚Äôm just not convinced that Zac Wilson‚Äôs in-game processing will be able to handle NFL-caliber secondaries. Yet. Kid‚Äôs got all the arm talent in the world, and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll get there, but for now‚Ä¶I think we rattle the Disney villain.

**WEEK FOUR vs Ravens‚ÄîL**

Okay, okay, the fun and games are over. While the homer in me wants to give us the benefit of the doubt at all times, the real person in me knows that last year‚Äôs PFN #2 Defense is likely going to put our quarterback room in its place. Unless we‚Äôve figured out how to Swiss Army Knife Surtain into Dime packages, Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews will likely pick apart the middle of the field for at least two TDs. Add that to Jackson‚Äôs slipperiness and you‚Äôve got a recipe for disaster.

**WEEK FIVE @ Steelers‚ÄîL**

I know. This one too. I struggled with this game. The Steelers lost several key Defensive players to Free Agency, which should buy Drew (please let it be Drew) a bit more time in the pocket. I think this will be a competitive game. Pittsburg‚Äôs receiving core is excellent, and Najee looks like the truth. In my mind, this all comes down to QB play. If Ben is still Ben‚Äîand I anticipate him to be, the wiley old bastard‚Äîthen Steelers pick this one up.

**WEEK SIX vs Raiders‚ÄîW**

The Raiders had our number last year, but don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll stay the case‚Äîthey won by just one point in our heartbreaking last matchup. With a no longer decimated secondary and our passing game (hopefully) firing on all cylinders, I‚Äôm giving this one to the good guys.

**WEEK SEVEN @ Browns‚ÄîL**

While reports of Baker Mayfield missing all of his Red Zone targets have me wanting to give this one to us, I have a feeling that their Offense is going to be scary good by mid-season. Add that to a defensive front led by Myles Garrett, Malik Jackson and Jadeveon Clowney‚Äîand with JOK shoring up the middle of the field‚Äîand I sense trouble for Drew Lock & co.

**WEEK EIGHT vs WFT‚ÄîW**

Look, I don‚Äôt buy the hype. Chase Young is great, and the Jamin Davis pick will be excellent for the team, but WFT ranked just 14th in run defense in 2020. Ryan Fitzpatrick is a wild card, and although I love Scary Terry, there‚Äôs little else to write home about on this offense. I think this will be a close game‚Äîa real squeaker‚Äîthat we manage to ground and pound our way to victory in.

**WEEK NINE @ Cowboys‚ÄîW**

Another tight game, but Dallas‚Äô defense was one of last years‚Äô worst. Assuming that our Secondary is now firing on all cylinders‚Äîkeeping CeeDee and Amari Cooper in check‚Äîthen I don‚Äôt see why we couldn‚Äôt shut down Zeke for another measly eight yards like we did in 2017. Right? Guys?

**WEEK TEN vs Eagles‚ÄîW**

The Eagles might maybe possibly be considering a trade for Deshaun Watson and are unwilling to name Jaelen Hurts the starter yet, which should tell you everything you need to know about the post-Wentz era in Philly. This should be a breezy one for us, and if it isn‚Äôt, we‚Äôre in trouble.

We‚Äôre not good enough to each other for this to be real. No, I think that Goff will fail without his ventriloquist, without his weapons, and without his scary big knife-swatting man-bear. Broncos take this one handily.

**WEEK FIFTEEN vs Bengals‚ÄîW**

There‚Äôs trouble brewing in Cincy, according to recent reports. Burrow looks as shaky as someone who got his knee obliterated only to have the same play happen over and over and over in practice because of a lack of proper blocking. Maybe the Bengals D is really that good? Probably not.

**WEEK SIXTEEN @ Raiders‚ÄîL**

Okay, this time they get us. I could lie and say I know why, but the reality is, these prediction things are a crapshoot and I just have a feeling that we split the series. Maybe Ruggs finally figures out how to be a WR in the NFL, who knows?

I grew increasingly frustrated that *no* changes were made all season.  Vic wasn't fired, Teddy wasn't benched, McMahon wasn't fired.  Also, articles like the below made it sound like there was a decent chance that Paton would run it back with Fangio.  Everything combined led to me, quite unfairly, characterizing Paton as another run of the mill, crony-istic good ole boy, who even if he did fire Fangio, would just replace him with someone like Mike Zimmer or Dan Quinn.  

Ultimately, nothing would change and we would enter another wasted year led by a defensive minded HC thinking it's still 1990's football, with mediocre QB play creating a bridge to nowhere.  How glad I am to have been wrong.

Getting super deep on a drop totally changes the angle edge rushers have to take.  They can run almost in a straight line at the QB instead of having to turn the edge - which is much harder to do when fighting off a blocker.  

It's one reason Denver's defense was so dominate in 2015.  Yes, we had Von, but the real ingredient was the pressure Malik Jackson could get on a QB up the middle.  That would force a QB back further, putting him right in Von's sights.

1.  The game was out of realistically out of reach.  I'm sure an analytics guy could better tell you the percentage odds of (a) getting a TD; (b) getting a 2 point conversion; (c) recovering an onside kick; (d) throwing another hail mary TD; (e) getting another 2 point conversion; (f) doing all of the above with 10 seconds on the clock, but it's low.  It's really low.  Now, **I'm not saying Vic should have knelt**.  You're right - that would have been chicken-crap.  But we could have run the ball there and gotten out of that ass-kicking of a game.

2.  Vic continues to earn some much-deserved criticism (in my opinion and others here on this sub) for his absolute lack of emotion and engagement during games.  You mentioned Teddy's hit that you thought should have been flagged.  There were a couple other questionable no-calls.  What was Fangio doing?  Wandering the sideline with a dazed and confused look.  He just seemed . . . disinterested.  Meanwhile this week, I saw two rookie coaches in Nick Serianni, and Brandon Staley, along with vets like Andy Reid, absolutely light into refs for bad calls.  I mean, Nick looked ready to throw hands.  For being so concerned about 'player safety,' Vic sure didn't seem that worried when his QB was getting creamed.

3.  Don't like it?  Stop it.  The Ravens telegraphed what they were trying to do.  Vic says he expected them to do it.  Okay, so why the fuck didn't you have a run blitz called to stop it?  Let Simmons light Lamar Jackson the fuck up.  You want to keep playing until 00:00?  Okay, we will too.  Lamar gets concussed or whatever, that's on Harbaugh, not us.  The Ravens didn't do anything sneaky like run out of victory formation.  They came out in shotgun and wanted to keep playing.

4.  I hope we would be petty enough to break a Raider's record. for not other reason than it's the Raiders, so fuck 'em that's why.  Vic and the Broncos are taking this so personally.  Meanwhile the Ravens are over there with Don Draper ""I don't think about you at all"" energy.  They are so unconcerned with the feelings of a mediocre irrelevant franchise (that's what we are, like it or not) that they're more focused on getting a chance to spit in the eye of their biggest rival.  

5.  They weren't throwing the ball or trying to score.  Yes, trying to run up the score is bush-league, even among professionals.  They ran for a few extra yards, so who cares?  Again, along with point 4, this wasn't about us.  This is about the Ravens despising the Steelers.  

6.  Again, Vic shows zero emotion on the sideline.  His QB gets roughed up and he just looks like ""whatever man it is what it is.""  This silly streak gets broken and he looks like he's ready to fist fight Harbaugh at center field.  Now, I'm not questioning that Vic's players don't like playing for him.  I think he has the support of the locker room, players' respect, etc.  But, the emotion displayed here vs. the complete lack of it during much more relevant and significant portions of the game, *makes it look like* he's more pissed about the fact his precious defense couldn't hold the Ravens under 100 yds. rushing AND became just the second team ever to allow Lamar a 300 yard passing game.

I'm sorry my dude, but these 'hot takes' are not ridiculous. I would call Baltimore a 'good' team, but they're not as great as some of the teams we're going to face if we want to get where we think we belong.  They're not a juggernaut.  Also, it's not the fact we lost to them.  Yes, I agree, good teams can lose games to other good teams even at home.  That's not what happened.  We got straight up fucking dominated on our own field. 

Vic Fangio came into the season on a very warm (if not hot) seat.  A string of nice games where the Broncos demonstrated competency does not change that.  I said last week that the questions surrounding Fangio have not been answered by three blowout wins against bottom teams.  The second he gets into a close game against a good team, he starts mismanaging the clock again, seems passionless and clueless on the sideline, and appears disinterested in anything not related to his defense.  Speaking of his defense, it's now only the second unit ever to give up a 300 yard passing game to Lamar Jackson. 

You're making it seem like it's outrageous to be questioning Shurmur's play calling after one bad game.  In reality, it's been questioned here (rightfully, in my opinion) for a couple of years.  It seems like he's incapable of getting the most out of his players, instead requiring them to fit his scheme.  He completely abandoned the run again yesterday for some unknown reason.  That's not a hot take - it's a valid criticism.  

Tom McMahon has had people calling for his head for weeks now - literally everyone wants him fired.  Even when we were winning.  

If Chief's fans started saying, ""You know, I think it's time for Reid and Beinnemy to go"" after a 1-2 start *that* would be a hot take.  But when a coaching staff has been bad for two years, the 3-0 start is the outlier, not the home blowout loss.  Yesterday was not ""one football game against a great team.""

To me, this is where Vic is still a little bit of a question mark.  He blew at least two games last year due to nothing more than bad clock management.  Will he know how and when to use his timeouts in a tied game with less than 2 minutes left?  When it's a tight game down the stretch, will he stay aggressive and try to put the game away, or will he revert to his conservative, 'win-with-defense-and-special-teams nature and punt on 4th and 1 from the opponents 42 yd. line?

The NFL has been somewhat ruthless in terms of doling suspensions in the years since.   Several dozen players have faced suspensions since Ray Rice, many of them triggered by allegations of mistreatment of women.  Zeke Elliit's 6 game suspension was the result of a single accuser.

Watson has 22 accusers.  Suddenly the NFL thinks that if only it can discredit 22 accusers, this will go away?  This story has dominated headlines for months.  The NFL knows perfectly well what its best move is here.   Watson will be punched so hard he won't know which way is up.

So why are these NFL-appointed investigators asking these difficult and invasive questions?   Because the NFL has to fight the Players Union tooth and nail to enforce its suspensions.   Remember Zeke Elliot, his accuser was credible, the NFL doled out 6 games, and the Players Union reacted by lawyering up so hard that Zeke's suspension wasn't fully served until late in the season -- the Union kept dragging the NFL to court.

Probably get downvoted for this, but exploring **both sides of the story** is a responsibility of NFL investigators.  In this case, both investigators and women and former prosecutors. Prosectors by nature are going to ask hard questions.  They are going to try to catch inconsistencies in your story or uncover ulterior motives.  

At this point 99% of us think Watson is a scummy guy, given the number of women who have come forward.  Accusing someone of sexual assault is a serious matter, and it is a sad truth that in some situations, false allegations are made.  A fair investigation will not assume all statements made by claimants are true by default, any more than a fair investigation would default to taking Watson's side.

6) Rodgers might still play for them.  If he doesn't, they will recoup lots and lots of money and can still trade him later, so it's not a total loss",2.0,denverbroncos,t3_oo1n35,False,0.0,Broncos,2021-07-20T16:32:01Z,denverbroncos,0.361125
32617,206200,206200,yearz,">Instead of the Packers running the org like the Rams where they have a Wall Street Bets mentality, they have the mentality of just tuck away 10% of your earnings into your 401k mentality.

You're arguing that the Wall Street Bets mentality is smart and the 401K mentality is dumb?

If the desire of Aaron Rodgers' heart is to win a Superbowl, where does he have the best shot,  in Green Bay (back-to-back NFC championship appearances, elite WR, elite RB, top-tier O-line, good defense), or some other team who, a) has none of that recent success, b) will be depleted because of the king's ransom they just paid to get Rodgers?  It works out from Tom Brady, a) because he's Tom Brady and has lost more SBs than Rodgers has appeared in, b)  he went Tampa Bay as a free agent on a team friendly deal.

This is personal to Rodgers, he wants out, that much is clear.  If Rodgers does think that being traded will work out for him the way it worked out for Brady signing with Tampa Bay, he is setting himself up for a rude reality check.",-2.0,denverbroncos,t3_oo1n35,False,1.0,Broncos,2021-07-20T16:25:46Z,denverbroncos,-0.0622310699588477
32618,206201,206201,yearz,"I would add that contracts imply risk on both sides.  What a difference a year makes.  In 2019, when Rodgers was in the second of back-to-back mediocre seasons (by his standards), articles were published questioning if the Packers had hamstrung themselves by overpaying for a declining QB.

In first phase of Rodgers' contract, with all the guaranteed money, the risk was on the Packers, as they committed a giant portion of their salary cap to a single player, and they were on the hook regardless if Rodgers lived up to it or not.

The second phase of Rodgers' contract, the current phase, the risk is on Rodgers.  It's true the Packers can cut him with little dead money.  In my view, this is fair because the Packers held-up their end of the bargain in the first phase and paid the guaranteed money in full.  The Packers are now being rewarded for their risk by controlling Rodgers; rights even if the market value for QBs has gone up.

In my view, this cadence of NFL contracts is both normal and fair.  If the Packers had made a public stink, after 2019, about not honoring Rodgers contract unless he agreed to accept less money... we all know how that would go down.   Which is to say, there is a bit of a double standard in terms of how we regard players who are disgruntled with their signed contacts.",1.0,denverbroncos,t3_oo1n35,False,0.0,Broncos,2021-07-20T16:04:46Z,denverbroncos,-0.0011947885594794
