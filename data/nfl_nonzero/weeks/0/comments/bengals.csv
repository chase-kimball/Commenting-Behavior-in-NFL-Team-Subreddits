• A rushing defensive player won't be allowed to forcibly hit a quarterback below the knees. He has to make every effort to avoid such a low hit. Palmer, Griese and Roethlisberger suffered knee injuries on low hits but those three plays were considered legal by the committee because they involved defensive rushers coming off blocks. Several other plays such as the old Rodney Harrison hit on Trent Green when he was with the Rams along with a Jared Allen low hit on Kerry Collins would be subject to a 15-yard penalty. That proposal passed, 25-7.

Burrow could have checked to max protect and kept Perine in to block and for all we know he checked out of that. That's not an option for Mixon. With Mixon out there they could have dialed up a blitz knowing he couldn't pick it up and we have the same result

Their statistical records will be broken, that's inevitable. But that doesn't automatically mean their season was better, hence why I included the context portion of my argument.

Newton did it with an offense where no offensive player that recorded a Stat that season was drafted higher than the 4th round, and none of the drafted ones were skill players. Burrow put up the stats he put up and did it against arguably one of the tougher schedules of defenses any Heismann winning QB has ever had to face.

>Newton never transferred out of a bad situation; he got kicked out of UF for throwing a stolen lap top out the window. If he hadn’t, he would’ve had an even crazier season at UF.

That's not my argument, I was talking about in the future. A QB of Cam's talent caliber likely wouldn't wind up in that situation again with transfer rules. Either they don't get in trouble and transfer when they see their bad weapons or they do get in trouble and a school of Auburn's caliber likely goes with a less risky but just as talented QB looking to transfer.

It's a chicken or the egg argument for sure, but throwing windows for a QB are so much different going from playing CUSA defenses and defenses full of future draft picks. Even if you have talented guys yourself, they react so much faster, are coached so much better, and have lots more time to study film on you getting a better grasp of your tendencies. Still, this is coming from a guy who hasn't watched Zappe play 1 snap, so I could be full of it.

They were certainly on track, they Y/A was even slightly better and if I were to guess based on Tua/Jones' Alabama career, the turnovers numbers were comparable, too.

10797,74241,74241,Freebirdhat,"Well that player was actually Anderson's predecessor, the ill-fated Greg Cook. In 1969 the Bengals in there second year in existence, had a new rookie quarterback Greg Cook who started off 3-0 for the season. Unfortunately he injured his throwing shoulder in a week 3 win over the Chiefs, the eventual super bowl champs that year. Cook missed 3 of the next 4 games and played a handful of snaps in the 4th game being replaced by QB Sam Wyche, the eventual Bengals HC, but the Bengals fell to 3-4. Cook came back in week 8 for his last win of the season a 31-17 win against the Oakland Raiders, who finished 12-1-1 that year. Cook was voted the AFL rookie of the year and still holds the rookie records for yards per pass attempt at 9.411 and yards per completion at 17.5. That offseason it was discovered he had torn his rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder during the week 3 injury, he also had a partially detached biceps. 

Bill Walsh developed the ""west coast/ohio river"" offense to make use of the arm Cook had left and the skill set of Sam Wyche and Virgil Carter, who were not known for their long ball. Virgil Carter was traded for in 1970 as a placeholder while Cook had surgeries to repair his arm. Medicine being what it was, Cook never made a full recovery, he threw 3 passes in the 1973 opener and that was it, his career was over.  Ken Anderson came along in 1971 and ending up mastering the short dink and dunk offense.

The offense that Walsh had initially designed with Cook was completely different than what was later known as the west coast offense. ""It would have started with the deep strike,"" Walsh said, ""and everything would have played off that. It would have set records that never would be broken.""

As far as the culture he’s totally changed it. And it took big balls to do that. Getting rid of fan favorites like AJ Green and Carlos Dunlap who didn’t buy in. Picking chase over Sewell when probably 70% of the fan base hated it. Letting burrow start the first few games of this season and having him on a pitch count despite knowing that would make for a couple ugly games.

He’s got a bunch of young dudes that are all just hitting their strides who buy into what he is preaching. So many coach’s can’t get to that point.

15854,104894,104894,Kanusian,"ok im obviously a bit pessimistic here. But from the few twitter videos and reports from our beat writer you can clearly see that the d-line was feasting to start camp so far. The D-line Unit was good last year and i believe improved a bit, but it wasnt as good as pressuring as often as the writers noticed so far. I havent heard anything about cappa. Collins hopefully will be a massive improvement, but i dont know if lady luck will be on our side with him all year long. Karras at center is kind of my biggest worry though. Bellichick himself said he is a better Guard then Center, everybody who watched film said he is better at Guard and yet the Bengals will try him at center. I dont think that he will fail, i just think pushing him to LG and finding a Center in the Offseason would have been a better Solution. Better than trey still isnt enough though. 

The Fact is that the Bengals FO has tried to sell us a ""good"" Oline for the last 6 years and did so through the Draft and some low key Free Agents. This time around they are betting on more high Key Free Agents. I just hope it doesnt end up in disappointment again. And if thats the case: yeah less than 8 wins are very unlikely but wouldnt shock me either.",-1.0,nfl,t3_wlxe7r,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2022-08-11T14:22:36Z,bengals,0.051989749484133
15855,104895,104895,Kanusian,"bengals. we literally had so many factors go right for us last year: Eli Apple was playing good football for a good stretch, but only against bad qbs, we werent hurt at all, we had a rookie wr in an all time season. Our D was pretty spectacular and probably overperformed. 

now this year it might look like the bengals went out and solved their o line, i believe it when i see it. From what im seeing: center is not better than last year, RG might be and RT is a injury concern in itself. Our LB are SUSPECT. so are our DB's, especially with Bates sitting out we are banking on our rookies to ball. Also the playcalling last year sucked. Every bengal fan will tell you that we ran it up the middle all regular season when we couldnt get more than 1 or 2 yards. And then in the most crucial situation that caught up to us in the SB. 

I mean somewhere between 8-10 wins is realistic, more is surprising and below wouldnt shock me.

Im a negative kind of person tho,

Ever since cousins left the play was inconsistent. i dont like watching games played at fedex because its just so depressing looking. IDK maybe if u actually take away the skeleton part of the stadium it gets better. But from an onfield perspective i would say the same. The defense seemed to be in a good spot but then last year threw me off a little and i dont know what to think. Becuase this could be a situation, where when u get a passable offense the defense isnt on the field so much and they get better. But that where my main problem is: your offense is depressing. Like i watch when your defense plays. But as soon as that offense is on the field i just dont wanna watch anymore. So lucky for me that i dont have to watch you so much rn. But i was at that point with my team as well a couple a years ago. From my point of view i think the wentz trade could land you at 3-5 in next years draft. or. maybe in a wc spot. no idea, that man is a god in one minute and then peterman in the next.

Snyder aint it. Rivera aint it. Fedex aint it. Wentz aint it.

I would say chances are pretty high that at least on massage therapist didnt consent which would make this very very bad. Others did consent but are now jumping on the lawsuit. I dont think those cases are high tho, maybe 1 or 2 but not upwards of 3. 

In most cases the actual lawsuit will probably have settlements which are going to be costly. This is the sad truth and we wont find out the whole truth.

You can have both quarterbacks line up in shotgun directly behind each guard, and the defense won’t know which one the center would snap it to. It would add an extra layer of confusion. The only way to stop this would probably be running super aggressive blitzes as every play, as you’re plugging up every hole if it’s a run, and you’re putting in more bodies than the OL can block if it’s a pass. But even then, somebody would surely get open very quickly in the passing game. You would have to be lightning fast getting to the quarterback.

Ken Riley has easily the best case. Riley is 5th in NFL career interceptions with 65. There are 32 defensive players that are currently in the Hall of Fame with less. Some of those are LBs who don't catch many interceptions, but a lot of those are guys like Emmitt Thomas and Mel Blount, who played in the same era, caught less INTs, and just happened to be on better teams. Riley was on the 1981 Super Bowl squad, but most of the other Bengals teams Riley played on were mediocre at best, but more often than not utter garbage. He did way more with way less than anybody else in his era.

16823,115106,115106,Lionheart_513,"The Logan Wilson call is the only thing that haunts me. I'm completely okay with the loss, but the Logan Wilson call was absolute bullshit.

The entire call hinges on the fact that Cooper Kupp's hips were turned and then Wilson Propelled himself forward. The assumption is that because these two things happened at the same time, it must've been because Wilson forcibly turned Kupp's hips and launching himself forward. Nobody considers the fact that maybe Kupp turned his hips on his own power to maybe... I don't know... CATCH THE FUCKING PASS????? YOU TURN YOUR HIPS SO THAT YOU CAN PULL THE BALL IN TOWARDS YOUR CHEST AND SECURE IT. Every NFL WR has only been doing this for the past 80+ years.

Let's entertain the idea that Logan Wilson WAS grabbing Kupp's jersey. Where is the picture of Wilson noticeably, beyond a reasonable doubt, grabbing the jersey? Most people reference [this image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLz5ON6WYAItTJ9.jpg) to defend the call, but this plain and simply isn't holding. Here is the text of the rule:

* ARTICLE 6. DEFENSIVE HOLDING. It is defensive holding if a player grasps an eligible offensive player (or his jersey) with his hands, or extends an arm or arms to cut off or encircle him.

You CAN see the jersey being stretched, but there is no evidence that the jersey is being stretched because Wilson is grabbing it. The gloves that DBs, WRs, LBs, anyone who might have to catch a ball at some point, wear create a shit load of friction, it makes catching balls a lot easier. It is far more probable that Wilson had his hand on Kupp, and the jersey got caught on the palm of the glove as Kupp was shifiting his hips while running. No other angle shows Wilson with a closed fist CLEARLY AND BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT grabbing the jersey in such a manner that would've given him an unfair advantage. As for his other hand, [you can clearly see his other hand is not even on Kupp.](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a0f7b518ce014f26f3455807bff6f423) That picture is actually the view that the ref who threw the flag had. There is no fucking way that a ref in the back of the end zone noticed the jersey getting subtly stretched from an angle he couldn't even see in real time. The ref who threw that flag did not even have a clear view of the angle that everyone says makes it ""obvious"". This is football. This is a full contact sport. Logan Wilson is allowed to have his hands on Kupp.

If there is no such image of of Wilson obviously grabbing Kupp's jersey ([something like this, which wasn't called](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLhB2NHXoAAY7r0?format=jpg&name=900x900)), then any advantage gained by whatever jersey grab may or may not have been present was negligible at best. Furthermore, penalties are meant to be called when there is an obvious violation of the rules that gave one team a clear unfair advantage. If the advantage is negligible, or the violation of the rules isn't entirely clear, THEN THE CALL IS BULLSHIT. An offensive lineman jumping the gun early is a penalty because it gives the offense a clear, unfair advantage. If the lineman's foot moves literally a frame before the ball is snapped, that should not be a penalty because the advantage given to the offense by giving the OL a 0.03 second head start is negligible. Penalties don't exist to give the refs a moment of spotlight, they exist to keep the game fair. The ref can't just throw a flag because something looks like it may or may not be a penalty, the ref can only throw a flag when he believes he has seen an obvious penalty and then the review is there as a safety net.

Logan Wilson made the play of his fucking career that night and was robbed of it. It's honestly a crime that he will never get the recognition he deserves for having made that play. That should've been one of the greatest pass breakups in the history of the Super Bowl, and the refs robbed him of having that play.",18.0,bengals,t3_vhgfvx,False,0.0,#JusticeForIrwin,2022-06-21T22:51:17Z,bengals,0.0255787739498284

16831,115117,115117,Lionheart_513,"Chase will not take the crown.

Cooper Kupp had a great season, no doubt, but the reason he won the triple crown was largely down to volume. Robert Woods went down early on and OBJ came in pretty late so Kupp got way more touches than he otherwise would’ve. The Rams offense basically ran through him, and even though it worked, having your entire offense run through one receiver is a really bad spot to be in. The Rams were always just a minor Cooper Kupp injury away from their season being over. The Rams only won their division by one game, so if Kupp goes down for A GAME then it’s very likely they don’t win their division and if Kupp goes down for 2+ games we might even be talking about the Rams missing playoffs altogether.

The Bengals coaching staff has shown that they don’t really care about passing volume. Joe Burrow was 6th in passing yards, and every QB ahead of him had AT LEAST 80 more pass attempts. There have been games where they leaned on passing volume more than others, the week 17 Chiefs game comes to mind, but for the most part, all this coaching staff really wants to do is get a comfortable 2ish score lead and then manage the game down from there. Think the Steelers home game we won 41-10 and yet Burrow only had 190 passing yards. That’s the style of game you’re going to see behind the new OL. It’s not gonna be the deep ball offense that people loved from last year (unless it’s a close game) because you don’t need to throw deep balls when you’re up by 2 scores in the 1st quarter.

The game plan is: establish the run, take a deep shot or two, get ahead early, park the bus. Ja’Marr Chase will be lucky to have a 100 yard game every once in a while.

17122,120474,120474,McWitt,"Here's a breakdown of the picks + a guy who was in the discussion from each round in my selection.

**R1: CB - Andrew Booth Jr**

One of the few guys who could actually win a starting job on this roster.

Debated: S- Cine, Georgia

**R2: DL - DeMarvin Leal**

- Listed as edge but at 6'4 280 has played inside as well. His skillset and versatility is appealing with him spelling Reader on passing downs while providing rotation at DE. 

Debated: Edge- Paschal, Kentucky

**R3: Safety - Nick Cross**

- Cross is raw and an absolute freak. Bates and Bell are both FA in '23. This pick was between Cross and Bryan Cook from safety. Cook is more of a strong box safety imo, like Bell who I think we will resign. Bates however, I feel is headed to FA. So decision made.

Debated: S - Bryan Cook 

**R4: T - Rasheed Walker**

- 3 year starter at LT for Penn State. I know we really need an interior guy but I had no value there. Impressive player with good size, I wonder if we landed a good enough LT, if we would slide Jonah in to ~~compete~~ win at LG. 

Debated: TEs but no value.

**R5: TE - Daniel Bellinger**

- Give me a D-, idc. Bellinger ran a 4.6, had 22 reps (most I've seen so far by a TE) and has good hands. Hurst is TE1 though I'm not drunk.

Debated: nobody.

**R6: C - James Empey**

BYU Football is a zone heavy scheme. Empey has great size(6'4 305) and above average initial quickness. Fits the scheme here and can play C/G.

Debated: CB Chamarri Connor

**R7: WR - Devin Thompkins**

- I have no idea why he would still be here outside of size and durability concerns.. But click the highlights.. Go on, click it.

https://youtu.be/gr3S9LFcuVA

Debated: WR Rambo, S Kenderick Duncan

**R7/252: Ed Tyree Johnson**

- I first noticed this guy watching Leal and Clemons. His past 3 year he's tallied 4, 4 and 8.5 sacks despite competing for those stats vs Leal, Clemons and Peevy who are all NFL bound this year. Pass rushing specialist.

- Makes perfect sense

- We shouldn't go with depth our first pick.

Here's my take on why I think we will go Safety in first round.(I'm personally hoping for a trade back)

**Calculated Cap Casualty Strategy**

We cannot retain all this young talent with the bill that's coming. I've been calling it, we are going safety at 31. BPA at 31 I think will be a safety. KC will determine a lot for us, at pick 30 it looks like DB is very much in play for them. 


**D Daxton Hill (Michigan)**

A great tackler (probably his best attribute imo), has crazy ball skills for a DB (see int vs Wisconsin) and ran a 4.38 forty. For those reasons, his position at the next level is debated mostly to the need of whoever selects him. He's versatile like Mathieu in that he can play NCB where he logged a ton of play at Michigan, most say FS and some believe he would be there SS. I think he'd be a perfect fit in our single high look heavy scheme. Consider the following:

**Reasoning**
1. **Bates and Bell both set for FA**

With no news of a Bates payday and as much as I'd hate to see him leave, we need to accept that as a real possibility. Vonn has one year remaining (6.1 million in 2022) and in need of a new deal. He will be cheaper then Bates but who knows what will happen. If we lose one or both, Hill is able to fill either position.

2. **Depth**

In 2021 we were incredibly healthy and that isn't typical or expected again. Ricardo Allen retired and if Bates, Bell or Hilton were to go down, who would be filling in? Hill imo, would be our next best on the depth chart at all of these positions for the 22 season.

Kelce is arguably still the best C in the league. Can't say the same about the guards we would acquire in FA. 


Jax redid Norwells contract so they could let him walk into FA(that's weird, maybe he requested it). He played LG which is interchangeable for the most part but there were 17 LGs who graded higher. Is he worth 9-11 million? Because Spain was one of those 17 and we pay him 1 million.

The league itself has become a passer-happy league. So the numbers you see for good and even great QBs looks gaudy compared to other HOF QBs who happened to play in a more run oriented version of the league.  


A QB like a Matt Ryan might look like a HOF QB with his numbers. However, as a somewhat die-hard NFL fan of the last 15 or so years, I'd say he doesn't get in. He was maybe a top 5ish QB at one point in the league, but he never stayed there long enough to really warrant the HOF.

Elliss at 136 is acceptable, but is more of a NT than a 3T and therefore doesn’t really provide us with much DL depth behind Hill.

Anderson at 174 is a great pick and there are other alternative safeties likely available at this pick such as Weatherford, Bell (Not Vonn), O’Neal Jr., Corker, Woods, Monday, Bolden, McKinley III.

27216,206583,206583,UnitedIndividual6768,"If I could order them: 

1. TE: Our only proven tight end, Hurst, is on a one year deal and we have no legitimate depth behind him. Drew Sample was a bust and simply does not provide the pass-catching skills we require in a tight end.

2. LG/C: Although the offensive line has been greatly improved through the free agency revamp, there is not a proven starter at one of our interior positions. Carman disappointed last season and is still undergoing his positional change from tackle to guard. We need a starting calibre player LG or C (in which case we can move Karras to LG, where he graded better at and has more experience than C). This allows Carman to be an immediate backup for the entire line and asserts a safety asset in case of common offensive line injuries.

3. CB: We could really use a new outside cornerback. Honestly, Eli Apple provided good value at CB2 last season; but he failed to perform during the playoffs and Super Bowl. Resigning him was the right move and gives us a very solid CB3, but we need another man between Awuzie and Apple that can start right away.

4. S: Both Bates and Bell are set to be free agents next off-season. Bates performed mediocre during the regular season, but thrived during the playoffs and Super Bowl. Bell had a pretty decent season, as well. However, various players are set to be extended next off-season and I’m not sure we can bring both of these guys back. It’s for this exact reason I hope we sign a mobile, deep-set safety that can start in the near future. 

5. DL: The defensive line is looking strong after the off-season resignings, but lacks depth in case of the usual injuries. We lost Ogunjobi and could use a decent interior defensive lineman to provide depth under Hill and Reader and also perhaps rotate snaps with them. A 3T player who can pressure the quarterback and replicate Ogunjobi’s stat line last season is preferred.

Based on combine results and actual tape, Dulcich is slightly more athletic in most categories and can make bigger plays than McBride, but McBride is a consistent target who is faster and stronger. In today’s NFL, McBride is the prototypical TE and mirrors a guy like Mark Andrews. If McBride and Winfrey are both gone, I would take Dulcich.

•Zion Johnson is arguably the best IOL in the entire draft. It’s either him or Linderbaum, and Linderbaum never appears to fall to 31 by PFF’s draft logic, so Johnson is the pick. He put up the best combine of any offensive lineman; boasting 32 bench press reps, a 32” vertical jump, and top 5 times in the short shuttle and 3-cone drill. This gives him an overall RAS (relative athletic score) of 9.59/10, which is absolutely insane when you consider it ranks him 58/1406 OGs from 1987-2021. This guy is an athletic freak who is supercharged with strength and intelligence. He also has positional flexibility and has essentially lined up across the entire line during his college career.

I’m all in for Kirby Joseph. He’s an athletic safety with flexible position who could fill in for Bates or Bell if one of them do not re-sign next offeason. 63 feels a bit early for a backup safety, but if no other positions of need (DL, CB, TE, G) are available, then he’s a fair pick. 

Fortner has been massively overlooked and only recently started to gain hype. Put up wonderful stats and has an impress PFF grade. If he’s available in the 3rd or 4th, we should draft him or Zach Tom. Both provide inside flexibility that could move Karras to guard and allow them to play at center or vice versa.

I don’t know much about Thornton other than the fact that he’s very fast. That has some special teams value to it and he could develop nicely opposite of Chase. Worthy of a day 3 pick.

27276,206679,206679,UnitedIndividual6768,"Kenyon Green - Green fell down the ranks a bit after a fairly poor combine saw Zion Johnson become G1 of the class. We still need an IOL to replace Spain, unless we re-sign him of course. That doesn’t seem guaranteed at this stage so I went with Kenyon Green. He can play across the entire line and compete for the starting position at LG. Green will infuse the interior of the line with an elite youth prospect.

Trey McBride - The best TE in the class. Not only did he rack up 1100 yards last season (has that vertical threat we’ve been lacking in the tight-end department), he is also a monster blocker. His overall PFF grade was approximately 94 so this guy can be an instant starter if he stays healthy. I like the trade up with the Buccaneers became it lets us snag two critical positions of need.

Marcus Jones - The best returner in the class. Special teams was concerning this season. They essentially lost us the 49ers game (as well as our o-line, but that’s a given). Jones is slightly undersized at 5’8”, but he has unbelievable speed and talent. Combine that and you get the best punt/kick returner in the class who can also play the outside cornerback role; exactly what we’ve been looking for. He will likely play snaps at the slot as well. His dimensions are very similar to Mike Hilton and I love Jones as an experimental prospect.

Tyreke Smith - The Bengals are very interested in Smith. Multiple scouts has their eyes on him during the Ohio State pro day. He’s listed at ED, but realistically can play any defensive role in the box. He only had 3 sacks last season, but his display of pure strength and motor have swayed many, including me. He’s a solid depth option as an edge rusher who will definitely get his handful of snaps.

Jelani Woods - It isn’t often that a team drafts two TEs (Ravens did this with their 1st and 3rd round picks back in 2018), but I simply could not pass on Woods. He is arguably the best athlete in the draft class. No other tight end came close to combine performance. He dominated the bench press with 24 reps and at an astonishing 6’7”, he ran the second fastest 40 yard dash for tight ends. He has the physique, hands, and skillset. Now, it needs to be put altogether in order to generate production.

Brad Hawkins - With Bates on the franchise tag and both of our starting safeties expected to be free agents next season, it’s acceptable to explore options at safety. Hawkins is no superstar, but he’s a solid guy with a decent PFF grade. Ricardo Allen retired last season so depth is minimal at the safety position. At this later pick, Hawkins fits the scheme and provides us with the safety depth and security we’ve been looking for. Could legitimately be developed into a starter next season if we let Bell and/or Bates walk. 

Matt Araiza - This pick is very controversial, but it is always an option. I understand that we’ve had Drueman on and off the practice squad, as well as the fact that he is a serviceable, young punter. But if Araiza is available in the 7th round, there’s no reason not to draft him. He has a disciplined leg that can launch balls from one side of the field to the other. Combine him with McPherson, and you have the best young special teams duo in the league. Also, if McPherson ever goes down, Araiza is a legitimate substitution at the kicking position. He’s scored 50+ yard field goals in college, and he’s only going to get better in the NFL. Definitely worth a 7th round pick.

Michael Woods II - Couldn’t find much on this guy. He had the highest PFF grade out of the remaining WRs, so I took him. Very little tape on him so it’s hard to grade him. He put up 400 yards last season and 619 the season prior, so he’s a honest piece at receiving depth.


Darien Butler - Another late-round depth guy. Butler put up a decent statsheet last season, totaling 2 sacks and 3 interceptions. He also racked up an impressive 68 total tackles. He was the best remaining linebacker, so I took him. Provides solid depth and can be found easily developed in the future.",2.0,bengals,t3_tomv21,False,0.0, Tee Higgins #85,2022-03-26T07:20:04Z,bengals,0.0096328698472745

However, we were definitely helped by the Raiders with some late hit penalties (Burrow) and the unnecessary roughness (leading with the helmet) that extended drives that would have otherwise ended in 4th down punt scenarios. I believe there was an offsides and 12 men on the field that helped us pretty significantly too. 

I can't recall specifically how that impacted the game in terms of points, but simply remember we were helped in ways that were nothing more than bone-headed stupid plays by the Raiders, unlike a pass interference, holding, or other type of penalty of the like. 

7 penalties for 77 yards, almost half of Burrows total passing yards (148). 

Our defense was key this game. I'm glad we allowed the run game to find it's gear. I'm glad we got Boyd involved. However, until we get Boyd, Higgins, and Chase all going, along with protecting Burrow, we're going to keep squeaking by.

They used her breeding and then Siegfried and Roy purchased three of the white tigers bred to start their infamous act, further popularizing the white bengal and thus the Cincinnati Zoo.

Claypool probably has the talent to be better than Boyd but let's just look at last year's stats because they are comparable. Claypool was the #2 option and Boyd was the #3 option. 

Claypool went for 59 catches, 860 yards, and 2 TDs. His catches and yards were basically the same as a rookie but had 9 TD. 

Boyd went for 67 receptions, 828 yards, and 5 TD. His yards and TDs were similar in 2020 but had more receptions without Chase. 

Here's a key difference. In the past 2 years Boyd has 2 dropped passes. Claypool has 11 drops in that same timeframe. 

Before Claypool entered the league, Boyd had back to back 1000+ yard seasons.
