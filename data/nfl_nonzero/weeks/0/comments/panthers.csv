The CMC injuries have nothing to do with the franchise’s stability. He’s still young and we’re not talking about torn ligaments or head injuries or something that shortens a career. [They’re all sprains and strains.](https://www.draftsharks.com/fantasy/injury-history/christian-mccaffrey/7750). I was in the small camp that said we should trade him before last season to maximize his value. So I obviously have some concerns about the injuries but he’s not overpaid. He is, however, overworked. I don’t think we’ve *wasted* any seasons with Matt Rhule. They gave him a shot during an obvious roster rebuild. You can’t give him one or two seasons and then cut him loose. Time takes time. Expecting a new coach to come in and microwave success with no quarterback is naive. It’s also a bad look and only makes it harder to attract the next coach when you do go looking. We have loads of cap space. I don’t know what you’re talking about but if you know something I don’t know I’m all ears, honestly. If we are what our record is then were we one the best teams in football through the first four weeks last year? That’s just coachspeak. There are a handful of teams every year that are better than their record or worse than their record. The average game in the NFL is decided by less than a touchdown.

40,506,506,11_25_13_TheEdge,The QB situation is unstable because we have been rotating through clowns. There hasn’t been an opportunity to get “our guy” so to speak so they’ve been reaching and overpaying for guys to bridge the gap and hopefully get lucky with a breakout. The head coaching situation is no different than any other team who is moving on from a long tenured head coach. Rivera spent 9 seasons with Carolina and was preceded by John Fox who also spent 9 seasons in Charlotte. Tepper is polarizing but he’s loaded and he wants to win. He just doesn’t necessarily know how in the current landscape. That’s not unstable. Outside of the QB position and the OL (which will be vastly improved this season) the roster has been capable and stable. The perception that the Panthers organization is a bad one to be a part of is largely a myth perpetuated by the media circus that can’t take its eyes off of the quarterback position.

No fans were happy, now asking ""Should we tank?""  
The stockings were hung on the statue of Sam,  
Our hope of winning, was just another sham.  
The fans were all snuggled, asleep in their beds,  
While visions of Super Bowls danced in their heads.  
And Mama in her jersey, and I wearing my Panthers cap,  
Had just settled in for a long restless nap.   
When out on the field, there arose such a clatter,  
I sprang from my bed, and asked ""What's the matter?""

With a driver so speedy, he moved in a blur,  
I knew in that instant, it must be Sir Purr!

He whistled and shouted, called them by name.  
""Now CMAC, now Burns, now DJ and Luvu,  
On Chinn, on Chuba, on Robby, and some random kicker, any will do.""  
With the sleigh full of defeats, Sir Purr called.  
""Now dash away, dash away, dash away all!""

My girlfriend was feeling adventurous that night and after the hit on Cam that night she really blew me away even more than I could remember how badly the Panthers got blown out of the game. 

The next night one of her friends had matched with me on bumble and she came over upset and accused me of cheating. As much as I wish I did (in hindsight), the app was freshly deleted from my phone but we had our first big fight in our relationship that night.

1 year and a 8 months later we were still together and I decided to buy her a ring. 
2 months later she had moved out of what was my first owned property, after I developed a drinking problem watching USC and Carolina get their asses whooped every weekend. 

11 months later we’re staying in Vegas together for our friends delayed Wedding. 
About 3 years separated was when she blew me away further than my mind was blown that the Panthers had started 3-0 with Darnold.

2760,15593,15593,BelowMikeHawk,"The sky is a brilliant shade of blue in Charlotte, North Carolina. The sun's rays smolder the skin with the coolness of a gentle breeze as your only relief. The smell of slow cooked pork permeates the air with a dominance only matched by fresh cut grass in the spring. All the signs were there. Football had awoken from its hybernative state. It was opening day 2014.

Like a young child filled with eagerness and excitement on the first day of school, the fans filled the stadium. They scattered the corridors buying cold beer and 75% off Steve Smith jerseys, until they heard the staccato notes of snare drums. They then scurried to their seats in anticipation of the player introductions. 

Drummers, flag wavers, and cheer leaders dotted the field. The crowd roared with the intensity of a Boeing 757.

The team, escorted by smoke and fire, ran onto the field. 

""And now, your starters!"", exclaimed the PA announcer. He started with Ryan Khalil, and worked his way down the list to the ninth player, Cam Newton. 

A sense of bewilderment wafted through the air. 

What's going on? Why didn't the star QB come out last? Who was the last two players?

The PA announcer could then be heard breathing heavily over the microphone. 

""This...This can't be right! It must be some kind of mistake!"", he said in a rattled voice.

""King McNuttatron""

The skies turned pitch black. A lightning storm filled the sky with loud strikes of electricity.

Out of the tunnel walked Marvin McNutt and Tavarres King. They had emotionless, almost robotic, faces. They stopped at center field, and stood back to back. 

The PA announcer came back on the microphone. 

""Gettleman told me I'm supposed to say this."", he said in a voice of disbelievement.

                     ""Fire, water, earth, and wind,
                   let the powers from below, ascend.""

At that moment, their eyes started glowing green. Their bodies then began contorting and binding into one. When the spectacle was over, a sight that could be mistaken for the 8th wonder stood. 

A 7'0 350 pound receiver. It was built of solid muscle. It had hands the size of catcher's mitts, and shoulders as wide as the Mississippi. 

Cam Newton bravely walked up to this towering beast. 

""How fast do you run the 40?"", Cam asked.

""3.8 seconds"", it replied. 

""How many bench reps can you do?"", Cam asked.

""All of them."", it replied. 

It was at that moment, that the whole free agency debacle made sense.

While fans cheered for their new player, David Gettleman sat alone in a luxury suite, with a grin stretched across his face. 

""Who's laughing now?"", he whispered

""Who's laughing now?""

He obviously should have played that differently, but it doesn't replace the fact that his 2015 campaign was an absolute masterclass in leadership.

To anyone who is not ready to label a whole season based off of one game, this game shouldn't be super surprising. I think the result of this game is on the bottom end of an acceptable performance. I said earlier as long as we don't get blown out, I think it's par for the course.  I stick by it. We got blown out, but we caught back up and Dallas was gifted 6 points. We knew the D hasn't been tested. We knew the oline sucked. We got answers. Our Oline Sucks. Like really really bad. Between Cam Erving being the worst LT in the league to unnecessary false starts by the rest of the line...theres a lot to work on here. Our Defense is good but can't do everything, and clearly has its own holes. I'm not sure the D is as sound as we can be, but we still have incredible big play potential, which has the power to shift games. In my opinion, this game was simply Dallas maximizing a clear shift in momentum rather than our team being bad. I'd like to see the alternative universe where they make the right call with it being a fumble and seeing how the game plays out.

That said,  I think we can compete against every team out there, which is about all you can ask for at this point.  We are still young...all the way around...offense..defense..special teams..coaching...ownership...there's still plenty of chemistry to be built.

4880,25089,25089,CPC_Mouthpiece,"In order to kick money down the road they have to have salaries they can reduce. Over the cap is guessing at 202 mill for a cap next year.  Right now they have 26 mill in space.  If they restructure 30 of this year to get to 15 mil over  and do some cuts for the other 20 mill to get them in the black to sign rookies. For this year that goes down to 11 million and they have about 90 mill in salary next year that they could do something with. So that is about 100 million in money they have if they were to take another run at the cost of pushing even more of it back. At this point you have 2 rookie classes and half are on their second year and since they are under the required number of players they won't offset other players.  There's about 25 million.  They have 0 QBs so lets best case and say they get Brees to sign 1 more year for 25 mill and one of the rookies is his backup.  That's 50 mill left, You need 10 more people to fill your roster and you lost every FA that's scheduled to leave this year and and next. So add like 6 very good players for 30 M to get close to the talent they had last year.  So that's 20 million they could afford not to restructure and add ANOTHER 70 million to that dead cap.  I guess it's possible but to do 1 more year but they would literally be a team full of practice squad players in 2023 and 2024 as they would have so much dead money and less contracts to push back and more FA/resignings needed to field a roster.",0.0,nfl,t3_m1w6fl,False,0.0,:Panthers: Panthers,2021-03-10T12:00:20Z,panthers,-0.0658476686713524

4882,25091,25091,CPC_Mouthpiece,"Yeah they are pretty fucked for the future.  I think they are all in on this year for them to be doing this.  As it stands they have 46 million in dead cap space in 2023 that is not including ANY salary or bonus money that would be owed to these people actually playing.  And they still have 46.5 million to cut to get under this cap number.  If they restructure some more they might end up over 60 million in dead money in 2023 (even at 220 mill that would be  ~27% of the cap) without even paying any contracts.  For comparison the Panthers have 17 million in 2023.  I did some counting the other day before the final numbers were out and these new restructures. I compared their minimum dead money.


Panthers | Saints

Year | Dead Money | Active Players | Dead | AP
---|---|---|----|----
2022 | 27.1 | 20 | 53.55 | 27 
2023| 17 | 10 | 28.3 | 11
2024 | 4.3 | 1 | 16.2 | 3
Total | 38.4 | 31 | 98 | 41

So the Saints already had +60 million in more dead cap over the next 3 years and those players only have 10 more contract years.
This was before these new restructures.  Instead of 28.3 for 2023, with these new restructures it is now 46 mill, and since it's spread evenly the same or more must be for 2022 so that's another 36 million over my numbers. So 100 million in dead cap more than another team over the next 3 years and they still need to shed 46.5 million this year to get under the cap.

>Breakout candidate(s)?

Panthers offensively don't have a ton of under the radar guys as most their skill positions are known commodities at this point, but Shi Smith could be a guy who ends up as WR3/4 and likely has low O/U numbers. 

>Underrated player?

DJ Moore. Maybe not so much underrated as much as he's under appreciated outside of this fanbase. 

>Overrated player?

Low hanging fruit but Robbie Anderson is the first one to come to mind. Granted he was great in 2020 so we'll have to see how he performs with Baker. 

>Strongest position group?

I'll say CB has the potential to be that if Henderson and Horn take the next step. RB is the obvious answer if CMC stays healthy.

I'd say LB. Outside of Shaq Thompson there are players that are either unproven or new to the team and its yet to be seen how well they'll play in a Phil Snow D.

- my point: “Hubbard is not a good RB2 and we could stand to improve there.”

- what you keep trying to say my point is: “we should go spend major money on a RB2! RB2 is the most important position ever!”

Your “points” are wrong:

1. Pollard: 161 touches in 2021/Elliott: 284 touches in 2021. Elliott was RB1 for the cowboys. Add Cowboys to the list of teams you don’t know shit about.

2. The Cardinals realizing their RB2 was good enough to carry the whole load for their team does not help your point, as that is something I would like for the Panthers to do.

3. AJ Dillon was bad decision to draft in the 2nd round, but he is not an overpay, he’s still on a rookie contract at 4 years/$5million. The Panthers have the most cap space in the league currently and could afford a post-1st-round rookie contract. Aaron Jones (like CMC) was an overpay - not the depth guys lmao.

Meanwhile every single team you listed had a better record than us and routinely had to rely on RB2s throughout the season, as RB1 injuries are very common. Yet, the salary for those guys is extremely low (aside from Connor who is now a RB1 so his salary is good for RB1). You’ll recall that I **never** once implied that we should overpay any RB2. You’re pulling that out your ass because you’ve had to backtrack on every point you’ve attempted to make thus far. In fact, I mentioned cheap FAs and 4th-round picks specifically. 

I won’t even go into how guys like Hunt and Mattison are dirt cheap. The bottom line is Hubbard = ass. RB2 = easy and cheap to upgrade.

8430,55118,55118,FuckinWalkingParadox,"Honestly, as much as I can’t see it, the Packers make sense. Aaron Rodgers is phenomenal in the RZ, but he’s getting older and the team just reinvested in the idea that his age won’t diminish his play. Which is fine, but a serious injury would be brutal and likely play-diminishing, while defenses typically send heavy blitzes in RZ (especially goal line) situations which presumably makes injuries more likely.

If you’re often strapped for time and own a strict schedule, simple pellet smokers are relatively affordable and provide flexibility in how you go about cooking. However, that method often involves shorter cook-times, and while shorter cook-times are fine for casual smoking, the best BBQ is made “low and slow” (low temp/slow cook). Additionally, pellet smokers use wooden pellets, which may not give that precise natural flavor that actual cut wood does.

If you want to really get going with a serious hobby of smoking, traditional iron smokers or in-ground methods are likely preferred. Again, it’s more time consuming and iron smokers can be expensive, so you might want to start with a method of less commitment. However, it’s still not a rocket science and the traditional methods have a worthwhile pay-off if you can “sacrifice” a Saturday to tend to your cook. 

Lastly, there are a hilarious amount of methods out there, and you can find something that fits your need easily.

With that said, I lean more towards the third option personally. We have/had a decent amount of skill players to work with and he never really seemed to be super creative with his calls. He was better than Shula was for us, but more of a slightly below average OC overall it seemed. The NFL and CFB are obviously different ball games, yet it didn’t really look like he even brought over his own general philosophy.

Some of that was probably to adapt to our QB situation since we don’t have anyone Burrow-esque, sure. It’s just not a great sign if the Jets and Gase were able to get more, or equal, production out of Darnold.

8610,55416,55416,FuckinWalkingParadox,"So I’ll try to explain this as best I can without over explaining how complicated it kind of is with that. However, I can provide you the answer you and your friends are looking for.

So the best blanket I could put on the answer is that Greenville, Spartanburg, and Anderson are relatively big cities for SC standards (outside of Myrtle Beach, Columbia, and Charleston, those are some of our biggest cities in the state, yet they’re not particularly big objectively). However, collectively with those 3 being in the upstate, they comprise a nice market that would likely be bigger than say Buffalo’s. This is largely because Greenville, Spartanburg, and Anderson are surround by *MANY* towns of ~1k-10k people, and a few ~20k towns. The area for Anderson essentially extends from its location to Georgia, and the areas of Greenville and Spartanburg cover a lot of the bare areas from their locations to NC.

Meanwhile, Greenville and Spartanburg have grown quite a bit over the past 10 years, SC is lucrative for big business production, so factories and Greenville’s general revamping into a pleasant place to live has attracted way more people then were present before the 2000s.

Lastly, Asheville is also big in its own right, although like the others, not particularly huge (not near the population of Raleigh/Charlotte). It’s kind of the central city for a wider population of former settlements that sprouted along our end of the Appalachian mountains (this is also the case for Greenville but to a lesser degree). Thus, Asheville collectively still covers those many towns with small populations, and grew itself for being the place to live with opportunity.

Our areas were probably combined as a last ditch effort to create an “appealing” market among the company of Charlotte/Atlanta/Columbia/Charleston, yet failed for a long time. With the cities of Greenville/Spartanburg/Asheville unexpectedly growing recently, it’s given rise to the ability for Charlotte to get an MLS team approved.

One last note but I won’t dive into it, these towns contain a lot of small colleges, which also keeps the market rolling.

If they decided to go on strike and the general public (especially the socially progressive one we live in now) became widely aware of the very lackluster pay they get in comparison to team revenue, progress in the pay department could likely be made. Twitter and alike have their evils, but also advantages in these scenarios.

I think it would have been most effective if the Snyder stuff was fully leaked. Unfortunately, the mass of the NFL’s viewership wouldn’t necessarily go to bat for the cheerleaders as the opinions in this thread and general demographic of the NFL suggest on just pay alone. The Snyder situation, had it not been so well-swept under the rug, is something that we’ve seen even here on /r/NFL to amass widespread and adamant disproval. That’s of course due to the absolute shitty nature of his actions, but if coupled with the full story of what it’s like to be a professional cheerleader, things could easily snowball favorably.",2.0,nfl,t3_r3002h,False,0.0,:Panthers: Panthers,2021-11-26T18:42:20Z,panthers,0.1231141931872409

I definitely don’t think there’s any reason to get rid of them or not pay them a livable wage at all. Whether people really care about them or not, they serve the purpose of keeping a crowd relatively entertained during halftime shows, while cheerleading also remains as an iconic part of American football culture. 

However, as unfortunate as it is, the cheerleaders are stuck with little bargaining power in the pros. I think a lot of people wouldn’t be quick to notice if they disappeared (aside from the Cowboys cheerleaders and their historical fame). Even if an owner didn’t want to get rid of them entirely despite a squad’s demands of increased pay, the sport of cheerleading itself is huge with incredible national competitions, so it wouldn’t be difficult to replace a single “demanding” squad. Plenty of viable candidates would be lined up, as the professional aspect of cheer isn’t flourishing with jobs related to the skill.

10135,60739,60739,HLambo7,"Yeah I get the sense that Bieniemy just doesn’t  do much as an OC... Let’s look at the facts:


1. He’s been interviewed for HC 14 times over the past few years, yet hasn’t been hired. Before you say “it’s racism!” Remember that other minorities were chosen over Bieniemy, hell, the Ravens WR coach/passing game coordinator (who is black btw) was chosen over Bieniemy... that’s right, the WRs coach for arguably the worst passing game in the league, who also just so happened to be the chiefs WRs coach the year they had NO TDS SCORED BY WRS, was chosen over Bieniemy. 

2. He doesn’t call plays. Before you trot out the example of how both Nagy and Pederson were hired, remember that they are exactly why people should be hesitant about hiring a OC who doesn’t call plays. I also hear a lot about how Reich didn’t call plays, but remember that he was a last second hire and would not have gotten the job if he weren’t the only guy left.

3. It’s hella sus how much Reid and the Chiefs players are pumping this man up. When was the last time players went on their own campaign to get a vital part of their performance as a team, hired somewhere else? (Ex. Was Matt Ryan campaigning to get Shanahan hired? Was Josh Allen campaigning to get Daboll hired? Was Tom Brady campaigning to get McDaniels hired? No. Because they recognize the value of someone that makes them and their team perform better, and they want to win) 

UNLESS... wait what’s in it for the Chiefs? Oh, that’s right, they get 2 third rounders if another team hires a black person form their staff. Funny how Mahomes and Reid only started to give a shit about Bieniemy getting hired, AFTER the new minority coaching hire rule was enacted. So what does that tell you? If Bieniemy was a huge part in getting them to a super bowl, then he ain’t worth 2 3rds. BUT... if he’s replaceable and didn’t really do much of significance, then OF COURSE Mahomes and Reid are going to want him hired somewhere else! Remember, their number one priority is to win, and if 2 3rds would help them win, more than Bieniemy’s contributions, then that’s what they will try to get.

Overall, it just seems like maybe Bieniemy isn’t what he was hyped up to be. Maybe he doesn’t interview well? Maybe he didn’t give a good enough explanation for some of his off the field issues from back then? Apparently he was number one on the Falcons coaching candidates list and Arthur Blank was ecstatic to have him as his HC, but after his interview with Bieniemy, apparently he was not as impressed as he thought he would be, leading him to move Bieniemy towards the bottom of his list.

> The Jets, like the Dolphins, threw a lot of resources at the offensive line this offseason. That included a first-round pick spent on Louisville tackle Mekhi Becton, who impressed in his rookie season. His 74.3 PFF grade ranked 19th out of 38 qualifying left tackles despite battling injuries, and he showcased that his rare blend of size and athleticism could cause serious problems for defenders.

> Overall, however, it was a disappointing season for the offensive line in New York. They allowed pressure in 2.5 seconds or less on 28% of their dropbacks — the worst rate in the NFL. The line wasn’t creating many lanes in the run game, either. The Jets averaged just 1.1 yards per carry before contact per rushing attempt in 2020 (30th). Once again, they’ll have to look to add pieces to their offensive line this offseason.


Panthers were 18th
> The Panthers haven’t had any disastrous efforts along the offensive line this season, but they also don’t have all that many players to highlight. The clear choice for the best player along their line this season is right tackle Taylor Moton, who enters the offseason as an unrestricted free agent along with the majority of the Panthers’ starters on the line.

> Moton has delivered three straight seasons of quality play as the starting right tackle for Carolina, but his career-high PFF grade of 81.2 this season — third among qualifying right tackles — came thanks to his run-blocking grade catching up to what he’s been able to do in pass protection throughout his career.

13183,89190,89190,Laszlo_Cravensworth,"10. Christian McCaffrey, RB, Carolina Panthers

The 2020 season was a miserable one for Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey.

In Week 1, it appeared that the 24-year-old would pick up right where he left off in his All-Pro 2019 season, gashing the Las Vegas Raiders for 135 total yards and two touchdowns. That made the four-year, $64 million extension McCaffrey got from the Panthers in April 2020 look like a wise investment.

However, while piling up 88 scrimmage yards and two more scores the following week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, McCaffrey suffered a high ankle sprain that landed him on injured reserve. He returned in Week 9 to scorch the Kansas City Chiefs for 151 total yards and two touchdowns, but McCaffrey suffered a shoulder injury in that game that ended his fourth season.

Still, those three big games were indicative of the talent that landed McCaffrey that extension. Two years ago, he joined Roger Craig and Marshall Faulk as the only running backs in league history to gain both 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season, catching an NFL running back record 116 passes and scoring 19 total touchdowns.

The 116 receptions broke McCaffrey's own record of 107 set the year before.",14.0,panthers,t3_mvjmyz,False,0.0,Ice Up Son,2021-04-21T13:57:55Z,panthers,-0.0402964204822941
13184,89191,89191,Laszlo_Cravensworth,"19. Brian Burns, Edge, Carolina Panthers

The Carolina Panthers were not a good defensive team in 2020. Carolina ranked in the bottom half of the league in total defense, and the team's 29 sacks ranked 24th.

However, those struggles can't be laid at the feet of edge-rusher Brian Burns, who in just two seasons has become arguably the Panthers' best defensive player.

The 16th pick in 2019 was solid as a rookie, amassing 7.5 sacks despite playing just 43 percent of Carolina's defensive snaps. In 2020, Burns' playing time increased, and so did his production—he piled up 58 total tackles, nine sacks, 21 QB hits, 16 hurries and three forced fumbles.

The 22-year-old was also one of the NFL's most effective pass-rushers on third down. Per [Pro Football Focus](https://twitter.com/PFF_Panthers/status/1377800420584796161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1377800420584796161%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpantherswire.usatoday.com%2F2021%2F04%2F02%2Fpanthers-brian-burns-pressure-rate-pro-football-focus-third-down%2F), his third-down pressure rate (22.1 percent) was the second-best in the league.

I whole heartedly believe if he didn't attempt to play through an injury and just sat the bench while he healed he would still be the qb for the browns. They picked up his 5th year for a reason. 

I made a post here a few months ago that I think he's a great fit and that was when I thought we'd have to give up a 3rd or better for him. A conditional 5th and 5m this year is an absolute steal. 

At this point if you're not excited about this trade and the moves we've made this off-season its hard to believe you're not just a troll.

In a perfect world we have Ickey, Neal or Cross available and our FO feels good about them. And Darnold or Baker somehow has a career turn around with good weapons and a good line. 

The less perfect scenario is we get one of those guys, we're the worst team in the league and get our qb next year without giving up our future.

Obvious run games inbetween the guards are always getting snuffed out as we can't develop any push; basically that forces us on any short yardage play to move the ball east & west which less efficient than a simple dive play and less successful. 

Robby Anderson is playing atrociously even when he gets empty he has too many drops. Generally there are too many dropped passes from everyone apart from Moore. 

Darnold is clearly spiralling and he either needs to be benched or he needs help so far the simplification of the playbook backfired as the defense finds us even more predictable as before.

Special team is a mess. 

These are glaring problems that needs to be addressed ASAP; worse some of these already been existing last year too with Bridgewater under the helm; which is very telling about the coaching staff. 

Overall; if these issues goes unaddressed in anyway by this season I believe the Rhule era needs to put to an end as his decisions about his assistance and game management aren't NFL level. We have an offense that can't run the ball inbetween the A&B gap, can't throw the ball further than 10+yrd, one of the starting receiver is playing hide & seek, and even the ball gets to the receiver there is still a good chance the ball will be dropped.",1.0,panthers,t3_q5jc2f,False,0.0,Double Trouble,2021-10-10T18:48:02Z,panthers,0.0500370465073673

15839,100899,100899,MrGonzo11,"It's not that he can't beat them; but when territory behind the defender shrinks its a lot easier to cover territories; the system is all about forcing defenders to commit to a person by leaving someone else in a one on one situation where skill does the job. 


For example we played this bootleg right pass attempt; while the receiver (I think it was Marshall) ran an outside post. The play was drawn up in a way that if it's man the receiver is on a 1 to 1 easy touchdown, if it's zone the corner will be forced to step up on the QB otherwise he runs for touchdown; leaving the space empty behind.
Instead what happened is that Darnold ran the bootleg too deep so the corner and safety could both settle in their zone covering the receiver. 

On another instance he drawn up a quick go play to the TE left on a one on one with a safety; unfortunately that TE was Ian Thomas and the ball been dropped. 

Third instance he called a play where the Darnold extended his arm out too quick and the FB/TE hit the ball out of his hand; or it was a FB dive play and not having experienced FB on the roster bites back at this case. 
Either way the play calling down the field is largely acceptable even though I could argue that putting so much workload on a single man is questionable, also favouring long passes with bad pass protection isn't the key to success. The problem comes at the redzone where bad personal choices; and problems with execution is killing the plays, I would favour a more straight forward approach as I suggested with quick tempo passes and see if our receivers as good as they been said to be.",1.0,panthers,t3_pnbhkx,False,0.0,Double Trouble,2021-09-13T16:20:54Z,panthers,-0.0735487666547298

I did see that the NFL tried to have Jerrry Richardson change the name and colors:

>There were concerns raised within league circles about the nickname Panthers. A team nicknamed the Panthers and one whose color scheme was predominantly black might have appealed to street gangs and reflected poorly on the NFL. Around the same time, a team with the same nickname, the Florida Panthers, began play in the NHL in 1993. They were owned by Wayne Huizenga, who also was a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins.  
>  
>On July 12, 1993, the NFL sent a letter to the Carolinas’ ownership group suggesting an alternative nickname. The following are excerpts from the letter. …  
>  
>“To offer you some alternatives, enclosed are 13 comps for a potential Carolina Rhinos. If the creature is not native to the Carolinas, then neither is the Lion (or Tiger) to Detroit, the Bear to Chicago, the Ram to Los Angeles, etc. The rhino is a large, powerful creature, fierce when provoked with a skin that is almost a natural version of football pads.“  
>  
>“We never wavered off of the Panthers, even though we had pressure to,” Mark affirmed. “They wanted us to minimize the black and they wanted us to consider a different nickname. At the end we said, ‘We’re paying $140 million, so we ought to be able to name the team what we want it to be and have the colors that we want to have.’ In the end, they agreed.”

If you were like me, you want Steve Smith jerseys, because Agent 89 is on the Mt. Rushmore of Panthers players. But, sadly every year since his retirement, more and more Smitty jerseys are becoming harder to find.

In an effort to replace my Smitty jersey, I saw that the Panthers had a [Mitchell and Ness Smitty jersey here](https://shop.panthers.com/mens-mitchell-and-ness-steve-smith-black-carolina-panthers-2003-legacy-replica-jersey/p-15151167596295+z-9883-2352145890), on the official Panthers website. Sadly, they are limited in sizes.

I spent weeks searching everywhere for these jerseys, even contacting Mitchell and Ness themselves asking when they would make more. They said they weren't going to.

Fortunately, [I found a place in Seattle that had them listed on their website](https://seattleshirt.com/products/nfl-carolina-panthers-steve-smith-sr-2003-legacy-jersey?variant=42785232060674). I emailed asking to see if they legitimately had them in Mediums and Larges (as no other website had those sizes), and they said they did. 

I skeptically placed an order, hoping it wasn't a fake, but in actuality, it's a legit M&N Smitty jersey!

So, if you have the coin to burn and want to grab one of these rarities, the above linked website has them.

39- Asante Samuel Jr- great corner, May be gone but I'd still be happy taking someone like Stokes or Melifonwu here too.

73- Creed Humphrey- great centre if Paradis walks next year, could he a starting guard this year no problem.

113- Jamin Davis- doubt he falls this far, could easily go in the 2nd. Couldn't pass him up here though.

151- Tommy Tremble- high upside TE prospect who I have no doubt will beat out Thomas to back up Arnold in year 1.

193- Shi Smith- solid receiver to add a little depth. Graded well last year and could be a starter fairly quickly

222- Michael Menet- great lineman who I doubt gets this far but if he does can't pass on him. May need a little development early on but gives us a shot a decent line in the future.

226- Ben Mason- yes, we don't have this pick but apparently PFF doesn't know that, listed as TE but could very easily be our starting FB for years to come, love him as a prospect but with a FB already on the team now, he may not even be on the teams radar.

Of course DJ has been able to elevate the team, imagine where the Panthers would have been last year without him, so 'elevating a team' is really a question of comparison.

OBJ averaged about 3.3 catches and slightly below 40 yards per game over the 8 reg-season games he played there. 

He did catch 5 TDs, which is good, but considering catches and YPG he was definitely not fantastic.

DJ Averaged 5.5 catches and 68 yards. Sure, his TD production was frustratingly low but look at some of the red zone throws there.

I'm not saying DJ is better than OBJ, but he put up those numbers with Darnold, PJ and busted Cam, while OBJ had Stafford and a functional Oline.

2nd the reason no charges were brought was because there was not enough evidence for each case. The reason why that may be the case is because other than physical evidence: video of the assaults, audio recordings, semen. All the evidence they had was circumstantial or hear-say. And from my understanding (im not a lawyer) unless he was convicted in the other cases AND a judge ruled it was okay to use the other cases as corroborating evidence, then it became a he said she said scenario. That's where the court system is limited, whereas we can look at the scenario as he said, she said (x22). The statements of the women all indicate he had a common MO: he would reach out on instagram via DM's, show up to the appointment and expose himself/force them to touch or blow him (or attempt to do those things). Being that these are situations where it's literally 2 people 1 on 1 alone in a room, it becomes really really difficult to prove that he did those things in a court of law (hence why he wasn't charged). BUT when we have 22 professional women say that he did the same or similar things to them, it is safe to conclude that he did do those things. There really isn't a question in my mind.

33291,220401,220401,jakaedahsnakae,"ARTICLE 9. PLAYERS IN A DEFENSELESS POSTURE

It is a foul if a player initiates unnecessary contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture.

Players in a defenseless posture are:

A player in the act of or just after throwing a pass (passing posture).

A receiver running a pass route when the defender approaches from the side or behind. If the receiver becomes a blocker or assumes a blocking posture, he is no longer a defenseless player.

**A player attempting to catch a pass who has not had time to clearly become a runner. If the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player.**

The intended receiver of a pass in the action during and immediately following an interception or potential interception. If the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player.
Note: Violations of this provision will be enforced after the interception, and the intercepting team will maintain possession.

A runner already in the grasp of a tackler and whose forward progress has been stopped.

A kickoff or punt returner attempting to field a kick in the air who has not had time to clearly become a runner. If the player is capable of avoiding or warding off the impending contact of an opponent, he is no longer a defenseless player (for enforcement, see 10-1-1 and AR 12.72).

A player on the ground.

A kicker/punter during the kick or during the return (Also see Article 8-h) for additional restrictions against a kicker/punter).

A quarterback at any time after a change of possession (Also see Article 11-e) for additional restrictions against a quarterback after a change of possession).

A player who receives a “blindside” block when the path of the blocker is toward or parallel to his own end line.

The offensive player who attempts a snap during a Field Goal attempt or a Try Kick. He is no longer a defenseless player after he has had an opportunity to defend himself or moves downfield.

Prohibited contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture is:

forcibly hitting the defenseless player’s head or neck area with the helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder, even if the initial contact is lower than the player’s neck, and regardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle the defenseless player by encircling or grasping him;

lowering the head and making forcible contact with any part of the helmet against any part of the defenseless player’s body; or

**illegally launching into a defenseless opponent. It is an illegal launch if a player (i) leaves both feet prior to contact to spring forward and upward into his opponent, and (ii) uses any part of his helmet to initiate forcible contact against any part of his opponent’s body. (This does not apply to contact against a runner, unless the runner is still considered to be a defenseless player, as defined in Article 9.)**

Notes:

The provisions of (b) do not prohibit incidental contact by the mask or helmet in the course of a conventional tackle or block on an opponent.

A player who initiates contact against a defenseless opponent is responsible for avoiding an illegal act. This includes illegal contact that may occur during the process of attempting to dislodge the ball from an opponent. A standard of strict liability applies for any contact against a defenseless opponent, even if the opponent is an airborne player who is returning to the ground or whose body position is otherwise in motion, and irrespective of any acts by the defenseless opponent, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact.

Penalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down. The player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant.",-3.0,nfl,t3_pw8d01,False,0.0,:Panthers: Panthers,2021-09-27T08:56:29Z,panthers,-0.0159108306742276

Wanting 30-33 rushes/game is not absurd. With 12 games played this season, we have 333 attempts. That is an average of **27.8 attempts per game**.  

Here are some other teams averages:

-	Baltimore: 11 games, 359 attempts, **32.6/game**
-	Philly: 12 games, 371 attempts, **30.9/game**
-	Tennessee: 12 games, 379 attempts, **31.6/game**
-	Indy: 12 games, 335 attempts, **27.9/game**


And holding down last place:

-	Jets and Seattle: 11 games, 243 attempts, **22/game**

Wow, Indy has almost identical numbers to us and their rush game is pretty fucking great. We shouldn’t need more attempts, right?  

We rank 24th in average yds/rush with 4.0. 
Indy is best in the league at 5.2. 
Thanks o-line.  

So while ~28 attempts per game is just fine for Indy, we need a bit more.

The rest of us sucked pretty hard. But I have been required to mention that /u/JCoxRocks chose three players that we drafted. Whatever the eff that means.

He's the long term solution at LT, and he needs all the reps he can get. Quite frankly neither of them is probably ready to square off against Myles Garrett anyways.

Brady Christensen should be the starting LG and backup LT. Yes he's better at playing tackle than guard at this point early in his career. That doesn't mean he's best suited to play tackle long term. Austin Corbett played every snap of his college career at Nevada at left tackle, but moved inside to play guard in the NFL.

They treat free agency as a way to plug holes so they don't have to reach for a player in a position of need in the draft.

These are often viewed as stopgap signings, although some players have recently been re-signed, like Robb(y/ie) Anderson and Frankie Luvu.

Sometimes these are older players who probably don't fit the team's long-term plan, such as at a position where they have young players who aren't quite ready to be a full-time starter, and a veteran is needed to give them time to develop. Matt Ioannidis comes to mind (his deal is a 1-year deal with a bunch of void years) and DaQuan Jones before him. Reddick kind of fits that too with YGM behind him, and other players capable of making an impact in a rotational role like Haynes and Luvu.

> Charlotte bankruptcy attorney Andy Houston says a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing often is an attempt to bring order to what can be a chaotic and adversarial process.
> 
> “It’s an effective and efficient way to work through complicated legal matters,” he said. “Filing bankruptcy stops all litigation and channels everything into one forum, the bankruptcy court.”
> 
> The three largest creditors in the GT Real Estate’s bankruptcy filing have combined claims of more than $48 million. All of those claims are listed as “disputed.” That means the creditors will be required to file proof of what they are owed with the court, Houston says.
> 
> Tepper’s company can contest the amounts. Even so, Houston says, bankruptcy court offers a far more streamlined process of administering assets and resolving disputed liabilities than, for example, lawsuits filed in state court.

GT Real Estate Holdings is an LLC (limited liability company). The whole point of setting up an LLC is so you're not personally liable if the company fails. In this case, the city of Rock Hill reneged on their contractually agreed upon financial obligations after construction was well underway. Also a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is different from a Chapter 7 filing, which is used to discharge debt; Chapter 11 is filed to *restructure* debt and pay creditors.

I get that people don't want billionaire owners getting public funding or tax breaks for projects like this. I tend to agree, but I don't live in Charlotte or Rock Hill, so I don't have a dog in this fight. But like it or not, the city of Rock Hill signed a legally binding contract to finance a portion of the project, then was unable to raise the money they committed to spending.

McAdoo comes from a successful NFL coaching tree and was himself once a young hotshot coordinator candidate. 10 years ago he was a 34 year old tight ends coach for the Packers that the Bucs and Dolphins were interested in hiring as their offensive coordinator, but the Packers blocked them from interviewing him. He got promoted to QB coach for the Packers before getting hired away by the Giants to be their OC.

I initially hated the hire thinking back to McAdoo's disastrous tenure as the Giants' head coach, but I have since done a 180 and now I actually think it's pretty smart.

When the Panthers drafted Ekwonu it was a done deal.

>He was bad last year at guard

BC played 84 snaps at guard last year. That's too small of a sample size to definitively say he's bad. He was also taking snaps at 4 different positions in practice. He should get better over time getting consistent reps at LG.

Let me be clear: I'm not saying he's going to be an All Pro, particularly not right out of the gate. But it doesn't make sense to bring in a veteran LG before Christensen has even had a real shot.

LB is thin but Shaq and Damien Wilson will be the starters, with Littleton being the next man up in the event Wilson is suspended. Brandon Smith could be in the mix but he's pretty raw. The Panthers play a ton of nickel though, so there shouldn't be too many instances of having 3 LBs on the field at once.

Xavier Woods is gonna be a starting safety, like it or not. The Panthers didn't sign him to a 3 year deal to be a backup. Juston Burris is back, plus there are some young guys who are still developing like Kenny Robinson.

TE is the same group as last year, but with an OC that will actually use them more in the passing game. Tremble could be really good. Ian Thomas isn't going to light the world on fire but he's not as bad as people make him out to be. He should see more opportunities this year in 2 TE sets with Tremble.

Terrace Marshall is the biggest question mark IMO. Ideally he takes a step forward and becomes a bigger part of the offense, but that could be just wishful thinking. I'm a little surprised people are completely writing off Robby Anderson though. He's just a year removed from a 1000 yard season. He's been extremely durable, not missing a single game in the last 3 years. I don't think it's a stretch to say that between Anderson and Marshall someone will step up and be a solid WR2.

IMO you're conflating ""holes"" with non pro bowl level players, when in reality a ""hole"" is a below average player that's a liability at a given position. For example, last year we had ""holes"" at LT, LG, and RG on the offensive line. We certainly could have upgraded at center over Paradis, but he wasn't a complete liability. Meanwhile Erving, Elflein and Daley were all below average starters at their respective positions.

This year Bozeman, Corbett and Moton are all proven, solid players. Ekwonu is expected to step in and play at a high level from day 1.

Evaluating and drafting a true franchise QB is hard. That's why the Broncos gave up so much for Wilson, and why the Browns gave up a ton of money AND looked past legal troubles AND gave the highest amount of guaranteed money in NFL history to land Watson.

The Panthers easily could have used the #6 pick on a QB. Instead it cost them a pick at the end of the 4th round and a future 3rd round pick. That's a pittance for a team without a franchise QB.

The one problem I have with their draft is they only took 5 players. Considering the Saints' cap issues, they could have used more players on cheap rookie contracts. My grade: B

I think the Falcons, more than any other team perhaps, should have traded down in the first round. They had a ton of holes to fill and a terrible cap situation. I think they could have still gotten their guy in Drake London but added an extra pick or two in the process had they traded back from 8. I'm surprised they didn't address the safety position in a deep draft, but then again they had a ton of holes to fill. I don't mind the Allgeier pick in a vacuum as a depth guy, but the Falcons still have one of the worst RB rotations in the league. My grade: C

It's hard to nitpick the Bucs' draft when they have a fairly talented roster. They filled their two biggest needs with their first two picks, they double dipped at TE, and they added a RB who can potentially replace Gio Bernard. I think taking a punter in the 4th was a bit high, but this is a team with relatively few holes in the roster, so it's more forgivable. My grade: A-

And finally, I think the Panthers killed it. I was pounding the table to trade down, but then again I never thought Ekwonu would be there at 6. Once he was drafted I figured the Panthers would trade back into the 1st or 2nd to get Corral or Howell, so getting Corral at the bottom of the 3rd is nuts. The rest of the picks could be complete busts and this still would be a great draft if Ekwonu and Corral both work out. Corral was my QB1 in this class based off of his potential fit in the Panthers' offense. Smith, Barno and Barnes are nice lotto tickets; if 1/3 pans out that's a great outcome. I like the Cade Mays pick, but that could be from name recognition more than anything else. Philosophically I am all about drafting a ton of offensive linemen because you can never have too many.

38454,258167,258167,tank4trevor,"Y'all are missing the part where the team that trades for him only has to pay him $1.2 million this year. If you're a contender like the Packers that's tight against the cap, having an experienced receiver on such a cheap deal is very valuable, especially considering the inflated contracts that receivers have been signing this year. $1.2 million is less than Terrace Marshall's cap hit as a rookie 2nd round pick.

I think the Panthers could get a 2nd round pick in return, particularly if there's a run on receivers at the end of the first round. The Packers and Chiefs both have 2 second round picks and a need at wide receiver. The Patriots have a terrible track record drafting WRs and might be better off trading for a known commodity. I doubt the Lions would give up their 2nd but who knows, considering they've got another pick at the end of the first round.

To everyone saying that wouldn't happen: why would the Panthers take on $19 million in dead money for anything less than a day 2 pick? This is different than the Teddy Bridgewater situation, because that trade actually gained the Panthers some cap space (Robby would be a net loss of $8 million), and you can't play two QBs at once.

38455,258168,258168,tank4trevor,"No offense Kaleb, but you don't seem to be very plugged in to the Panthers beyond looking at Darnold's statline from 2021 and the Panthers' record since Rhule has been hired.

It's true the Panthers have been bad the past 4 years. It's also true that last year Darnold stunk and the offensive line was one of the worst in the league. Matt Rhule didn't come in and immediately turn things around, and by winning percentage the Panthers were technically worse last year due to the 17 game season.

All that said, the roster is miles better than it was since Rhule was hired. The bulk of the effort in overhauling the roster was focused on the defense in years 1 and 2. Derrick Brown, Yetur Gross-Matos, Jeremy Chinn, Jaycee Horn and CJ Henderson were all drafted / traded for, as well as a bunch more guys filling depth roles. Overall the defense has no gaping holes after signing a few veterans in free agency.

On offense there's still work to do, but it's not the dumpster fire everyone is making it out to be. People fail to realize just how much better the offensive line is going to be this year. Bozeman and Corbett are MASSIVE upgrades at their respective positions. Brady Christensen didn't get a ton of playing time last year, but he looked promising in limited snaps. I'm not going to say Deonte Brown will even crack the starting lineup, but he will at least be playing it a scheme that is way more suited to his skillset. The only major question mark is LT, assuming Christensen slots in at LG to start the season.

The elephant in the room is obviously the QB situation. Personally, I don't want to draft a QB at 6, but I don't think it would be a disaster with the right guy. The Panthers could sign Duane Brown as a stopgap at LT, and regardless of whether it's Darnold or a rookie under center they would be in a pretty good situation with a solid offensive line, good receiving corps, and a solid rotation of running backs.

I think it's a bit overstated too how bad the coaching staff is. Although Rhule is still the head coach, McAdoo is arguably an upgrade at OC over Brady, and considering how bad the offensive line has been Campen is most likely an upgrade over Meyer as well. Bringing Wilks back as the secondary coach is an under-the-radar big move to work with some of the ascending young players in the secondary. Special teams should show some improvement as well under Chris Tabor.

On top of everything else, the division got worse. Bruce Arians and Sean Payton retired. Matt Ryan was traded away. The Saints and Falcons both are in salary cap hell. And the NFC as a whole had a mass exodus of talent to the AFC. So while the Panthers may not truly be ""a QB away,"" they very well might be a QB with a pulse away from a winning record and even a possible playoff berth.",1.0,panthers,t3_ucepad,False,0.0,Tepper,2022-04-26T16:49:05Z,panthers,0.0188658225522678

If one of the top EDGE players falls to 6, there could be some interest in trading up. Ditto for Gardner/Stingly or Hamilton, or maybe even WR1. The Eagles, Saints, Packers and Chiefs all need WR help and all have multiple first round picks.

And finally, as much as this sub would hate it, if Neal or Ekwonu falls, the Panthers could almost certainly trade back with one of the many teams needing LT help. Personally, I love Ekwonu as a prospect. If the Panthers had a starting OL of Ekwonu / Christensen / Bozeman / Corbett / Moton, that might be the best run blocking OL in the league.

Will Grier was right there, ready to drive that tank. He could have landed us Trevor Lawrence the same way Jimmy Clausen got us Cam. But instead, the team spent a bunch of money in free agency, wiping out any chance at comp picks. McCaffrey signed a huge extension, becoming the highest paid RB in the league.

If the offensive line can keep a clean pocket for a half second longer this year, whoever is under center might have more of a chance to progress to his third read more often.

That said, I do think TMJ needs to get more separation in his routes as well as being tougher in contested catch situations. He basically disappeared on film for long stretches during games.

38470,258184,258184,tank4trevor,">Trading back in hopes that a guy will still be there isn't a wise strategy

I'm really torn on this and I think the front office is as well. I'm basing this off of four nuggets from Fitterer's most recent press conference (paraphrasing here):

* The ideal way to build a roster is a QB on a rookie contract
* Fitt wants to get to a point where the roster is a QB away
* They're willing to continue to take swings at QB until they find their guy
* The Panthers want to be aggressive in their pursuit to improve the roster

Those statements are somewhat contradictory. If the Panthers swing and miss at a QB at #6 overall with no more picks in the top 100, they won't be in a good position to pursue a veteran QB in free agency or by trade. If they trade back and try and beef up the roster the could miss out on a potential swing at a franchise QB this year. Both options have merit.

There are a ton of guys on one year deals who are free agents next year: Bozeman, Ioannidis, Littleton, Foreman, Zylstra, Higgins and basically all the depth players at safety to name a few. The Panthers need to draft players to backfill some of those roster spots or they'll be right back where they started filling holes again next offseason.

The top 150ish picks are where the bulk of the starting caliber players are drafted. You can look at last years' draft and draw a line around there between the starters and the backups. Right now the Panthers only have 4 picks in that range, and obviously only one is in the top 100.

Because the Panthers restructured McCaffrey and Robby Anderson's deals, making them unlikely to be traded, the only realistic way to accumulate any 2nd or 3rd round picks is to trade back. This is the bottom line: Fitt has to get the buy-in from Tepper and Rhule to take a calculated risk and trade back in the first, hoping their preferred QB is still there.

I think ultimately that's the route they go. I could easily see the Panthers making moves and getting an additional 4 or more top-150 picks from trading down in the 1st. If they can do that an still get their guy, they look like geniuses. Additionally, if he busts, they won't do as much long term damage if they still manage to draft some impact players from the picks acquired from trading down.

There are multiple reasons why I think a trade down with specifically a team like Baltimore makes sense, but I'll save that for a later day.

If McAdoo can scheme up a bunch of RPOs and screens, Corral can step in day 1 and effectively run the offense.

Also based on everything Fitterer has said, drafting a QB is the direction the team is going. The million dollar question is: do the Panthers try and trade back and risk losing Corral if he's the guy?

Brady Christensen was the highest graded OL on the Panthers' board at 59. They actually wanted to draft him there, but they got word the Saints were going to take Terrace Marshall with the next pick so they took him instead and took a gamble that Christensen would fall. That's why they traded up to get him 18 picks later.

If you want to make the argument the Panthers shouldn't have traded down, you have to consider what the Panthers got in return. For their original 2nd round pick (39) and 5th round pick (151), they got picks 52 (traded), 83 (Tommy Tremble) and 204 (Shi Smith). With the 52nd pick and their original 4th (113) they got picks 59 (Terrace Marshall) and 89 (traded). They flipped the 89th pick for 109 (traded) and 158 (Daviyon Nixon). Pick 109 got them 3 more picks -- 126 (Chuba Hubbard), 166 (Keith Taylor) and 232 (Phil Hoskins).

Realistically the best available *tackle* at pick 39 was Samuel Cosmi, who ended up being drafted with pick 51 by WFT. But he's only played RT this year, and he only played in 6 games before being placed on IR. Most of the high end guards were off the board too, with the exception of Trey Smith, who **everyone** passed on until the Chiefs drafted him in the 6th round. I guess you could make the case center Creed Humphrey (KC, pick 63) should have been the pick at 59. In hindsight, with Paradis getting hurt and Humphrey playing well his rookie season, that would have been a great pick. But again, Christensen was the highest ranked OL on the Panthers' board at that pick, and tackle / guard was a way bigger position of need. (Side note: KC crushed it with their OL picks this draft class!)

I still think Marshall could develop into a legit receiver. Also Brady Christensen and Deonte Brown haven't gotten a lot of playing time this year. They could also develop into starters or at least very solid depth pieces. Regardless I'm happy with Tommy Tremble, Shi Smith, Daviyon Nixon, Chuba Hubbard, Keith Taylor and Phil Hoskins.

Darnold has to read the linebacker (in this case safety Logan Ryan) and figure out if he's blitzing or dropping back into coverage. Darnold just read it wrong. If Ryan had come on a blitz then DJ Moore would have been wide open for an easy first down, which is why you see Darnold looking to throw to him.

Instead Ryan did drop back into coverage and the running lane was wife open. Instead of facing a double team trying to tackle the running back, Williams was able to get outside of Christensen, who couldn't slow him down with his T-Rex arms. He tried to turn around and block Williams afterward but at that point there was nothing he could do.

This was actually the perfect play call for the situation, and everyone did their job but Darnold couldn't execute it.

38505,258244,258244,tank4trevor,"1. No. Bridgewater is who he is at this point. Sean Ryan wasn't going to fundamentally change Teddy's mechanics this far into his career. Darnold is just 24 years old and very clearly has more upside with his arm talent, so there was more room for improvement in his game. Additionally, Bridgewater is not as good of a runner as Darnold, who already has 3 rushing TDs this season. Darnold is on pace to throw for over 5,000 yards this season; for reference, Bridgewater threw for 3,700 in 15 games last year.
2. In terms of the W/L I think the Panthers would still be 3-0 with Bridgewater at the helm simply because of how good the defense has been. I don't think the offense would be quite as potent for the reasons mentioned above. While it's true Teddy has been airing it out a ton and has generally looked much improved with the Broncos, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. The Broncos' offensive line has overall performed much better than the Panthers' through the first 3 weeks; Bridgewater may have struggled not having a clean pocket to throw in.
3. The draft capital given up for Darnold wasn't too substantial. Of the picks traded away, 2/3 have already been recouped -- one from trading Bridgewater and another from trading back with the Texans. The Panthers are still down a 2022 2nd round pick, but again that's not a huge price to pay taking a swing at a potential franchise QB.

In training camp DA was Darnold's favorite target. He's basically a big possession receiver, good hands without much YAC ability. He's fairly thin for a TE, weighing in at only 220. He's still developing as a run blocker. FWIW he has no drops through the first 3 games of the season.

Overall I think this is a net positive for the Jags. Arnold should really help Lawrence by being a reliable target to move the chains vs going for the home run every time. He's not a game changer but he could definitely have a 500 yard, 5 TD kind of season and be a solid contributor.

Most importantly, he does more the pay lip service to analytics from roster construction, to health and nutrition, to in-game decision making.

The Panthers were a missed field goal from beating the Chiefs in a game they had no business being competitive in. Rhule called a ballsy fake punt on 4th and 7 in Panthers territory, which the Panthers converted and later scored on that drive. A week before that, against the Falcons, the Panthers converted another fake punt on 4th and 9 deep in their own territory with a direct snap to Jeremy Chinn, who ran for 28 yards. The Panthers lost both of those games, but you can't always be results-oriented with a rebuilding team.

38515,258259,258259,tank4trevor,"* Fitterer and Rhule absolutely crushed this draft. Keep in mind they traded down *twice* before drafting Marshall. Of all the players drafted, 10/11 made the final roster (1 on IR), and maybe half of them will get significant playing time this season: Horn, Marshall, Hubbard, Smith, and I'm going to go out on limb and include 5th round CB Keith Taylor. IMO there are also bunch of guys that could be special after a year or two developing, like TE Tommy Tremble, DT Daviyon Nixon and G Deonte Brown. I really like how forward-thinking Fitterer was with this draft, with a blend of guys who can make an immediate impact and others who will pay dividends in 2-3 years.
* It's hard to gauge, but I think there are probably more people who wanted to draft a QB at 8 vs rolling with Darnold. That said, fans seem to be warming up to him, and if he has a good ""revenge"" game in week 1 I'd expect a lot more to jump on the bandwagon. I'm in that camp as well; I though Fields was the 2nd best QB in this class and I was majorly disappointed that the Panthers passed on him, despite trading for Darnold right before the draft. But I'm starting to drink the cool aid and I believe that Panthers QB coach Sean Ryan can fix some of Darnold's mechanical issues, plus Joe Brady can design plays to give him a lot more easy throws. I keep consistently hearing that Darnold works his ass off and in every interview he does he talks about cleaning up his footwork.
* Any time Robby Anderson is mic'ed up it's pure gold.
* I'm going to go against the grain here and say Ian Thomas will get more snaps, because he's a better blocker and it doesn't telegraph the play calls when he's on the field.

I think Thomas will be the first man up in 11 personnel, which is how the Panthers lined up 57% of the time last year. Of course, the Panthers now have 5 TEs on the roster (kinda -- one is classified as a fullback), so they may run a good bit more plays out of 12 personnel.

* I doubt we have 10 OL. Since Elflein can play center I don't think Tecklenburg makes the roster.
* Rashaan Melvin is very likely to make the roster, at least initially while Bouye is suspended (does not count against the 53 man roster for the first 2 weeks)
* Likewise I think Hartsfield is in the mix at safety, with him playing nickel while Bouye is out.
* We only had 9 DL last year and I don't think Christian Miller makes the team.
* It seems like Roy and Hoskins are fighting for the final DT spot but we could end up with both on the roster if we get more pass rush production from the linebackers.
* We'll probably have 6 LBs again, particularly with Reddick and Luvu being used partially as pass rushers. Stanford made the team last year as more of a special teams guy.
* Rodney Smith might beat out Bonnafon and I think Hubbard is going to be #2 on the depth chart. Cannon is basically a lock as the KR; whether he's RB4 or WR7 on the depth chart is semantics.

38549,258304,258304,tank4trevor,"I know PFF is controversial around here, but they had a good point about the Panthers' defense in 2020: they benefitted greatly from turnovers, which is not sustainable in the long run. Specifically, the Panthers led the league in fumble recoveries, which are very much luck-based as opposed to interceptions.

They correctly pointed out the Panthers could not get off the field in 3rd down situations, and performed poorly against the top rushing teams in the NFL. Fortunately both of those areas should improve this year after signing DaQuan Jones and Denzel Perryman, and playing more press man with a revamped group of CBs.

The pass rush should also be better with Reddick lining up opposite Brian Burns, as well as an improved interior pass rush from Fox and Nixon. Last year we were forced to rely on a bunch of rookies, while this year Horn is the only rookie who will probably start on day 1.

It's not too much of a stretch to say the defense will be good. Offensively though, it seems less likely Darnold takes a massive step forward AND multiple guys on the o-line have a breakout year. I think the most likely scenario is we'll have below average but not terribly play from the line, and Darnold will be inconsistent with some bad games but some really good games as well.

IMO that still might be good enough for 10 wins. We were competitive in a good chunk of games with terrible QB play last year, so even a slight upgrade could make a big difference in the win column.

38550,258305,258305,tank4trevor,">The Panthers instead used Moore as a deep threat, Anderson as a possession receiver, and Samuel as a weird RB/WR hybrid. I was not a fan of this usage. I don’t think they maximized the talent of any of the three players, and their passing attack was mediocre as a result.

I actually liked how Brady deployed the WRs in 2020, despite the lack of success in the red zone. Brady's best quality as an offensive coordinator is getting the most out of his WR corps, scheming WRs open by playing to their strengths. Keep in mind Joe Burrow had the same group of NFL WRs in 2018 (Chase, Jefferson and Marshall) that he did in his record-setting 2019 season under Brady.

Last year Robby Anderson was able to stretch the field horizontally with his speed and he was basically always open. He's traditionally been seen as a deep threat, but, as others have pointed out, Teddy wasn't the best at getting the ball downfield on deep passes. He's also not the biggest guy in the world and isn't great at making contested catches.

Similarly, DJ Moore was previously viewed as more of YAC guy, but he actually thrived running more vertical routes, with the 3rd highest yards per catch in the NFL last year. He was arguably the most affected by Bridgewater's play last year. He could be in for a huge year if Darnold can get him the ball on time and on target.

Finally, Samuel was phenomenal in his role last year. He got more carries out of the backfield with McCaffrey missing so much time, but where he really shined was on 3rd down. With Olsen gone and McCaffrey out, Samuel became the go-to guy for 3rd down conversions, and he was clutch.

With the addition of Terrace Marshall, a lot of those red zone woes from 2020 should be rectified. Marshall is a TD machine with a massive catch radius, one that Joe Brady has worked with before at LSU. Having a big bodied target in the red zone with good hands is an element the Panthers' offense has been sorely lacking for years.

And that's not counting any of the other additions, like Dan Arnold, David Moore, Shi Smith, Tommy Tremble or even a healthy Christian McCaffrey. If Sam Darnold can complete passes to a wide open Robby Anderson (something he's proven capable of doing) and take more shots down the field to DJ Moore and Terrace Marshall, this offense should be drastically improved from last year's version.",14.0,panthers,t3_o7on43,False,0.0,Tepper,2021-06-25T14:49:53Z,panthers,0.0279498997559996

Losing Okung certainly doesn't help, but remember he played less than half of the season last year. He played well enough last year but he couldn't stay on the field, which IMO is Little's biggest problem as well. Trent Scott is also a dark horse candidate to get the LT job, although I'd say he's probably better suited as a depth piece.

Christiansen has all the athletic traits to be a very good guard. He's got much better feet than Elflein and should be able to beat him out in camp. I wouldn't read too much into his draft position; the Panthers were prepared to take him in the 2nd before they got wind that the Saints were about to draft Marshall and pivoted. Keep in mind this was also a deep class for OL.

I think the hope is Brown can shed a bunch of bad weight and eventually take over at RG, but I would expect 2021 to be more of a ""redshirt"" year for him. I wouldn't expect the OL issues to be solved in one offseason, because we were never just a player away.

The OL can also get better as the season progresses. Fortunately, the tough part of the schedule is towards the end of the year, so if they get off to a shaky start they could still be okay.

I just think the pure volume approach the Panthers have taken this offseason to address the offensive line should result in an incremental upgrade.

C: Paradis

RG: Daley

RT: Moton

I have a hard time seeing all 3 of Erving, Elflein and Daley beating out Christiansen. I think a more likely scenario is Christiansen slots in at LG and Miller/Daley/Brown/Moore battle it out for RG. Elflein becomes the primary backup at center with the ability to play guard if needed. That leaves us with a starting 5 more like this:

LT: Erving

LG: Christiansen

C: Paradis

RG: Miller

RT: Moton

That's returning 3 starters from last year's 18th ranked OL (per PFF), potentially upgrading at LG, and a below average starter at LT. It's worth mentioning PFF actually graded Erving above average in pass protection, but his run blocking grade was poor, dragging down his overall grade significantly. That's a tradeoff I'm willing to accept, particularly with Tremble in the mix opening up running lanes downfield.

And that's not even an overly optimistic outlook, which would include Brown slimming down and winning a starting job, a bit of positive regression for Paradis, and Christiansen stepping in at LT. I think this group has a much higher floor than 31st in the league, and a decently high ceiling if our draft picks / UDFAs pan out.",27.0,panthers,t3_nuinjd,False,0.0,Tepper,2021-06-07T16:07:11Z,panthers,0.0104823237601148

38566,258327,258327,tank4trevor,"Sam Monson has been fairly dismissive of the Panthers' offseason moves overall, after taking a seemingly cursory glance at them. For example, he was critical of the Horn pick, citing a lack of a scheme fit, but if he'd done a slightly deeper dive he might have read where Rhule explicitly stated the team didn't have the personnel to play press man in 2020 but will be implementing it a lot more moving forward. Additionally, in PFF's draft review they didn't even acknowledge 5th round pick Keith Taylor, a 2nd corner who can also play press man.

He does have a point about the offensive line. Guys like Paradis and Deonte Brown are polar opposites who seemingly would not fit together on the same line. But what if the Panthers also moved from zone to more of a power scheme? Instead of an IOL of Elflien/Paradis/Miller what if it was Brown/Moore/Daley? What if all those guys with bad PFF grades are purely backups?

Monson claims there's no discernable pattern to the Panthers OL draft strategy, but to me there seems to be a clear emphasis on improving the running game. The Panthers drafted a road grader in Brown, the best run blocking TE in the draft (Tremble), another RB (Hubbard) and signed another massive OL in priority UDFA G/C Moore.

The free agency moves made before the draft should be taken with a grain of salt. For one, the Panthers had to do SOMETHING because 4/5 of the 2020 starters were UFAs. They had to at least get warm bodies on the OL before the draft. Secondly, there's still an outside chance the Panthers could bring back Okung at LT, then suddenly the OL looks a LOT better.

I do acknowledge there are a lot of ifs here. It seems unlikely the Panthers would pay Paradis, Elflien and Erving so much to ride the bench. It's a bit of a long shot for Brown and Moore to make the active roster. And the likelihood of Little or Christiansen playing LT at a consistently high level this year seems slim.

All that said, I think Monson and his cohorts at PFF are being a bit hyperbolic about the Panthers' OL situation. They gave the Panthers' OL a middle-of-the-road grade last year (18th), which was much better than the Jets (29th). It may not be likely the stars align and the Panthers field a top-10 OL this season, but I don't think it's an unrealistic expectation the OL is around league average, which would still be a massive upgrade over Darnold's situation with the Jets last year.

TLDR:

The Panthers drafted PFF's highest graded OL player of 2020 and should be able to piece together at least an average offensive line, which would still be a drastic improvement for Darnold.",15.0,panthers,t3_nuaqpp,False,0.0,Tepper,2021-06-07T09:27:08Z,panthers,4.139000584337281e-05

>Panthers owner David Tepper has made no secret of his desire to upgrade at the quarterback position. And Watson looks to be Plan A, B and C.

The NFL has launched an investigation into the allegations, which Watson has denied. The timetable of the league’s inquiry is unclear, but it seems unlikely it would conclude before the draft.

Which is it? Because it sounds like you're simultaneously saying he's too good to trade away yet we'd be lucky to get a 5th in return.

Context matters for these trade scenarios. Curtis Samuel was drafted during Rivera's time in Carolina and he was already familiar with Scott Turner's offense. Plus his contract was dirt cheap. And he was just 24 years old. Not to mention WFT was still very much in the mix to win their division.

It's completely reasonable to suggest he would have gotten a 3rd round pick in return. Especially considering how much of a hot commodity he was in free agency this year. There were reports of teams calling and inquiring about Samuel in the preseason. Even if he was a one-year rental he could have ended up netting a team a compensatory pick.

As far as not helping us win a Super Bowl, you never know. Let's just say we did get a 5th from Washington for him. Last year we traded Kyle Allen to Washington for a 5th. We then used that pick to trade up and draft Jeremy Chinn.
