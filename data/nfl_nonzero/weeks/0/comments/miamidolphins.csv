300,2449,2449,03Jinx03,"Here's what you need to know about Tagovailoa's extensive injury history, dating back to his college days:

Tua Tagovailoa injury history

In the past, Tagovailoa has missed significant time with an unfortunate hip injury, but

‚Äî March 2018: During a spring practice before his first full season as Alabama's starter, Tagovailoa hits a lineman's helmet while throwing a pass and suffers a broken left index finger. The injury requires a quick surgery, but he misses no practice time.

‚Äî October 2018: Tagovailoa tweaks his knee during a win over Missouri. It's later revealed that he suffered a knee sprain, but he misses no time and is back in the lineup the following week against Tennessee.

‚Äî November 2018: During a late-season game against Mississippi State, Tagovailoa in the third quarter takes a hit to his left quad, the same leg of his knee injury a month prior. He sits out the rest of the game, an Alabama win, and returns the following week against The Citadel.

‚Äî December 2018: In the fourth quarter of the SEC championship game against Georgia, Alabama left tackle Jonah Williams accidentally steps on Tagovailoa's right ankle and causes an injury. Tagovailoa sits out the rest of the game and eventually has a tightrope procedure performed on his ankle so he can return for the College Football Playoff.

‚Äî October 2019: Tagovailoa suffers another right ankle injury, this time a high ankle sprain during a win over Tennessee. He again opts to undergo a tightrope procedure for a quick recovery. He misses one game (a win over Arkansas) before returning to start in Alabama's loss to LSU.

‚Äî November 2019: Toward the end of the first half of a blowout win against Mississippi State, Tagovailoa suffers the nasty hip injury that prematurely ends his college career.

‚Äî November 2020: Despite having a fairly clean rookie season, Tagovailoa suffers a thumb injury in practice. Thankfully, though, it should only keep him out a single game, a Week 12 matchup vs. the Jets.

‚Äî September 2021: Tagovailoa gets through his rookie season relatively scot-free, but in a Week 2 game vs. the Bills, the Dolphins QB is carted off after a rough hit. He would later be placed on IR with rib fractures.

‚Äî November 2021: Somewhat out of nowhere, Tagovailoa now has a fracture in the middle finger of his throwing hand. He misses the Week 9 matchup vs. the Texans.",0.0,nfl,t3_qvhjk1,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2021-11-16T20:36:07Z,miamidolphins,-0.0110476320750991

- A huge part of being a head coach is being able to manage strong personalities and diva players. See: Mike Tomlin. Flores absolutely failed at this with Minkah.

- Minkah was probably right all along since he's an All-Pro center-fielding FS in Pittsburgh and the problem was that Flo wanted to use him closer to the line of scrimmage with heavy snaps as a nickel CB.

All these red flags and he's coming off a season that started 1-7 and only turned around thanks to a very easy stretch of games. Then it fell apart in a need to win December game...for the second season in a row.

I see the logic in pulling the plug when they did. The signs that he wasn't going to be ""the guy"" were spotted, and there were already large fractures in all the working relationships.

Going purely by these measurement's, Mackey's long speed is non-existent. His explosiveness is bad, and his size ain't good. So, bad athlete, but he profiles basically the same as Needham in these areas, with a slower 40 and worse size. But you know what really stands out about him?

His 3-cone time is absolutely *elite.*

And that's the same thing you see with Needham, he's a poor overall athlete, but his short area agility is pretty good. This guy blows his 3-cone out of the water.

> I'd rather have Devonta Smith and a 2022 1st than Jaylen Waddle.

Good chance you'd have neither receiver without trading back into 6. Jamar Chase was was taken at 5. Without Miami trading up, Philly would pick at 6, where they likely would take Smith again(or Waddle).

Miami would still be sitting at 12. Philadelphia needed to trade up from 12 to 10 in order to draft Smith originally. They needed to jump the Giants, who, after Smith was drafted one spot ahead of them, immediately traded down. It's likely New York takes whoever is left between Waddle and Smith at 11. This leaves Miami empty handed at 12.

They could try the same trade with Dallas that Philly made, but:

- Miami might not be operating with the same knowledge Philly was, and might not be aware of New York's intention to take a WR, and thus not deem the jump necessary. It's an unknown.

- How much of that trade happened because Jones found it amusing to watch the Eagles fuck the Giants over? Would he still make the trade if it didn't involve inter-division shenanigans?",1.0,nfl,t3_ttsabs,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-04-01T11:55:18Z,miamidolphins,-0.000626951507189

- Sanders, Good pick.

Another strong draft class. If Minkah wasn't shipped off for the Flores drama, we'd be gushing about this class. Another B+.

2019:

- Wilkins, Good pick.

- Dieter, Meh pick right now, if he can turn into our starting center(he showed flashes last year), it becomes a good pick.

- Van Ginkle, Good pick.

- Prince/Cox, ""Bad"" picks, 6th/7th rounders again.

- Gaskin, Good pick(this is weighted for being a 7th rounder).

Very ""meh"" draft dragged down by the Rosen trade. C grade, C+ if Dieter becomes a starter.

2020*:

- Tua, I'm not starting any arguments by grading this one.

- Jackson, Bad pick.

- Igbinoghene, Bad pick.

- Hunt, Good pick.

- Davis, Good pick.

- Jones, Good pick.

- Kindley, Bad pick.

- Strowbridge, Bad pick.

- Weaver, Bad pick.

- Ferguson, Meh pick.

- Malcolm Perry, ""Bad"" pick, but 7th rounder.

This draft class is marred by AJ and Noah, but we did get three starters and a long snapper from it. Missing on 2(possibly 3) 1st rounders is not something you want to see though. This is a D+ right now, but can easily jump to a much higher grade if Tua becomes a franchise QB in McDaniel's offense.

To note, this class and the next one are astrericked because I don't like to grade a player/pick before they have three years in the league. After their third year I'm comfortable grading the pick, but not before that.

2021*:

- Waddle, Great pick.

- Phillips, Good pick.

- Holland, Great pick.

- Eichenberg, Bad pick.

- Hunter Long, Bad pick.

- Doaks/Coleman, ""Bad"" picks, but 7th rounders.

Knocked this one out of the park. If the top 3 build on their rookie campaigns and if even just one of the other four picks develops into a viable starter this is a home run draft class. A for now A+ if we manage to get an average starting OT or TE out of it.

$14.6m left.

Roberts signed a 1 year, $3.25m deal. Offset by ~$800k

$12.15m left.

Trent Sherfield signed a vet minimum $920k contract. There's a chance he isn't even in the top-51 contracts. Even if he is, his effective cap cost after the offset will be less than $100k.

$12.05m left.

Redwine's contract details are a mystery, but it's a one year deal for probably close to minimum. Let's be generous to your argument hear and say after the offset he costs us $1.05m to get our numbers clean.

$11m left.

Connor Williams is also a mystery, but his deal is 2 years $14m, so let's just take the APY of $7m, even though his 2022 his will likely be lower than that. Estimate an $800k offset again.

$4.8m left.

So even with conservative offsets, accounting for the rookie pool, and likely overestimating Williams' and Redwine's cap hits, we still end with nearly $5m in cap space. Good chance Armstead's deal is cheaper too, it all depends on the signing bonus.

That brings Miami's available space to ~~$54.2m~~ $52.7m(**EDIT:** I didn't account for the offset of bringing two minimum salaries into the top 51 to replace the two cuts, so lower this number, and every total after this, by like $1.5m). Now let's subtract Cidolfus's estimate of $7.5m to sign our PS and rookie pool from that. ~~$46.7m~~ $45.2m is left to play around with.

Collins is $10m right off the bat. Trading for him will take at least one rookie out of our pool and Collins' salary will be marginally offset by kicking someone out of the Top 51. I don't feel like doing the exact numbers, so let's just call it an even $2m offset. So $8m for Collins.

~~$38.7m~~ $37.2m left.

Armstead won't likely hit for $23m in year one of his deal, so let's be generous here and take $10m off it to make it an even $13m cap hit, then account for an ~$800k offset for $12.2m.

~~$26.5m~~ $25m left.

Now Jensen is a complete unknown for what his value is going to be. I'm just gonna use JC Tretter's contract with the Browns and call it a day($10.85m/yr). Tretter's year one cap hit was $8.875m, so lets take that decimal out for the offset and call it an even $8m.

So, after signing just 3 players, we're left with ~~$18.5m~~ $17m in cap space.

Now we also know that Howard wants a rework of his deal. Grier *could* get creative here to raise his pay but lower his cap hit, but let's say he doesn't and just straight up gives him a raise. We know being paid less than Byron rubbed him the wrong way and that he wants to be paid closer to the top of the market. So let's jump him over Byron and push him into the top 5, over Darius Slay, and say we pay him $17m. That's a ~~$3.5m~~ $4m pay bump(**EDIT** Just straight up wrote the wrong number).

So we're down to ~~$15m~~ $13m with 56 players on the roster. 

Grier likes to leave extra cap space going into the season for in-season moves and trades, so in all reality, he's not gonna let the cap drip too far under $10-15m, so if you want those 3 linemen, that's basically all we can do in FA. Just bringing back Mack Hollins and Elandon Roberts will basically bring you to $10m. So other than that you're bringing in rookies and scrubs. Hope you weren't looking for a halfway decent backup QB.

For the team, the risk comes if you need to move on from that player in the near future.

Say a 30 year old player has the current season and 2 more years left on his deal and is getting a salary of $26m this year, and none of his future salaries are guaranteed. To save some cap, the team might restructure his contract and convert $25m of his contract into a signing bonus, whilst adding 2 void years to the end of his contract. So that $25m gets spread out through 5 years and becomes $5m/yr. Now his cap hit is decreased by $20m($26m becomes $6m) this season and increased by $5m over the next 4(really $5m/yr over the next two and $10m in the third because of how void years work).

Now, this is fine if his level of play stays the same...but what happen if he suddenly drops off a cliff this year as older players do sometimes? Originally his salary for next year would be non-guaranteed and you could move on with no issue...but if you try to do that now, all of those future cap hits accelerate into the season you cut him and suddenly he has $20m in dead money that didn't exist before.

2579,10355,10355,AgelessJohnDenney,"This...isn't really accurate. You're right that Miami(and everyone else) rarely use traditional 4-3 or 3-4 ""base"" alignments anymore, but calling Ogbah a 3-4 DE or Landry a 3-4 OLB is still off. They're both just edge rushers. They will line up in whatever position puts them on the edge, whether you wanna call that an OLB in a 3 man front or a DE in a 4 man front.

For example, [here's](https://youtu.be/Uop-ohsXsrs) every sack from Ogbah in 2020. 

- Sack 1: DE in a 4 man front(9-tech), 2-point stance.

- Sack 2: DE in a 4 man front(7-tech), 3-point stance.

- Sack 3: DE in a 3 man front(7-tech), 3-point stance(how Baker lines up makes this more of a 4 man front, but there's technically only 3 down linemen, so...)

- Sack 4: Weird front. One IDL as the 4i tech, a standup linebacker as the other 4i tech, and then 2 edge defenders as 7 techs, Ogbah in a 3-point stance and Baker in a 2 point stance.

- Sack 5: DE in a 3 man front(5-tech), 3 point stance.

- Sack 6: One, two, three...8 man front, Ogbah's the 4-tech, 3-point stance

- Sack 7: Another all-out blitz, Ogbah's the 7-tech, 3-point stance

- Sack 8: Another all-out blitz, Ogbah's the 7-tech, 3-point stance.

- Sack 9: 4 man front(9-tech), 3 point stance.

- Sack 10: 3 man front(5-tech)

This is a pretty good distillation of what Ogbah does. He's, usually playing 7-tech in a 3-point stance. Traditionally, that's a 4-3 DE. Traditionally, a 3-4 DE would be playing 5, 4, or 4i tech in a three point stance, which Ogbah will occasionally move to. The traditional 3-4 OLB would be the 7 or 9-tech and usually in a 2-point stance, which you'll rarely see from Ogbah, but it'll happen occasionally.

Landry does essentially the same thing for the Titans, he lines up as either the 7 or 9-tech and rushes from both 2 and 3-point stances, no matter the front. He doesn't reduce to the 5-tech as much as Ogbah does, and he uses a 2-point stance more often, but their jobs are the same.",9.0,miamidolphins,t3_t9v8l9,False,0.0,:CW91:,2022-03-08T19:40:49Z,miamidolphins,-5.135115318766477e-05

Flo had MUCH better rapport with his defensive guys, similar to how Gase had 0 respect from his defensive guys.

3. I feel like in the NBA, even with mistakes like Spo made, it‚Äôs easier to manage relationships amongst 15 guys than it is 53. Udonis is an old seasoned vet who‚Äôs been around Spo for 15 years (Spo was on the staff since the early 2000s). Those kinds of misunderstandings can fly when you‚Äôve had such a long established history with your players, Flores was on year 3 and never had a grasp on the offense, so his ability to do something similar was limited.

I agree he‚Äôs a rare coaching talent, but Flores will only truly take that next step as a coach once he has a coordinator to take care of the offense completely. That‚Äôs not an indictment on him, even Bill trusts McDaniel completely for the offense. I just feel as if Flores needed this wake-up call to realize his true potential as a coach.

6314,46213,46213,Cidolfus,"I mean, the scheme fits the rest of our roster's strengths. The scheme uses a lot of pre-snap motion and creative run schemes to make defenses second guess and also relies heavily on speed to create separation and maximize yards after the catch. Basically all of our offensive personnel excepting Gesicki aligns exactly with that.

Gesicki is the odd man out. When this was being discussed in the Dolphins subreddit back in January, there was a lot of people saying that you basically have to consider his value as a wide receiver because he's so bad at blocking. [The problem is, when you stack him up against other wide receivers, he's not that great.](https://www.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/rttgj7/mike_gesicki/hqwciua/)

I think Gesicki is talented and can definitely excel in the right system. A team that needs a dedicated, big-bodied receiving threat could make great use of Gesicki. I feel like he'd be a nightmare to play against if he had Aaron Rodgers throwing to him.

The reality for the Dolphins is that we have the opportunity to build a passing offense around Waddle and Hill who are both extremely fast, generate a ton of separation, and get chunk yards after the catch. Meanwhile, Gesicki is literally bottom three among high volume receivers in the NFL at generating separation, isn't particularly fast, and is also among the worst blocking tight ends in the league.

6315,46214,46214,Cidolfus,"That's how he's been used for the past several seasons. Over half of his snaps the past three seasons have been from the slot. The problem with that now?

- Half of Jaylen Waddle's 2021 snaps were from the slot.
- Throughout his career, Hill's gone from about 30% of his snaps being out of the slot to half of his snaps out of the slot over the past two years.
- Nearly half of Cedrick Wilson's 2020 snaps came out of the slot and more than three quarters of his 2021 snaps were out of the slot.

The reality is that we've got *plenty* of talent who are productive from the slot and only so many snaps to go around. As a tight end, Gesicki needs to bring something else to the table (blocking) to justify taking that position over the wide receiving talent we have in those roles.

Last year, Cedric Wilson had 77% of Gesicki's receiving yards and  three times as many touchdowns on 45 (42%) fewer snaps. I don't know why we'd displace Wilson (who's also cheaper) for Gesicki if Gesicki isn't going to block.

6324,46249,46249,Cidolfus,"That's fair, but I think it depends what you're trying to look at. There's a huge difference between the way deals are reported and the reality of what the player will actually earn, and Kelce's contract is a great example of that. It's reported as a four-year deal worth $57 million in new money, but the reality is that if he'd had a career-ending injury last year at the end of his original extension, he would have only ever realized $7 million of that $57 million.

> Right now, you're essentially just taking the highest two years of the contract and saying that's what they're getting paid, which doesn't make any sense.

That's not at all what I'm doing. I'm observing the break point in the contract at which it becomes a net gain in terms of cap space to cut the player rather than keep them (i.e. the team's ""out"") and calculating total cash earned before that point. It's not the ""highest two years""; in fact, in most cases, it's the lowest individual years in terms of cap charge because the deals are backloaded with unguaranteed money. Because I'm looking at cash flow, though, that includes the full signing bonus (if it exists), which is pushing many of the deals over the 50% mark in the first couple of years.

Kelce's lack of signing bonus is the major reason why his deal is so bad. They advertise the deal as a four-year $57 million extension with $22.75 million guaranteed, but $15.75 million of those guarantees are for money from the previous contract. It sounds like he got about 40% of the new money guaranteed, but in reality it's only the $7 million roster bonus for just more than 12%. The Chiefs have all the leverage to move on whenever they're ready (which, given Kelce's age, isn't great for him if he starts to fall off at all). Obviously he's still producing at a high level, so he's doing well enough.

If we're trying to determine value of a contract based on how much earnings security it provides, the latter years don't matter because they'd already earned it and the pre-extension year doesn't matter because it's fully-guaranteed for veterans the second they make the 53-man roster. That's what the post I was originally responding to was talking about, after all: that latter years are bloated, un-guaranteed base salary that skew APY upward and don't really matter. I was just pointing out that comparing gross guaranteed money in a four-year extension to guaranteed money in a two-year extension is a very different conversation and tried to provide a more level point-of-comparison.",1.0,nfl,t3_w87gxm,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-07-26T11:30:29Z,miamidolphins,-0.0281814788496768
6325,46250,46250,Cidolfus,"That's intentional. 2021 was the last year of Andrews's previous contract. The four-year contract extension added years 2022-2025. So while technically the signing bonus was paid out in 2021 (and a pro-rated portion hit the 2021 cap), I'm looking at this specifically from the perspective of new money earned in the new years of the contract.

So, by the end of the second new year of Andrews' extension, he will have earned nearly $37 million of his $56 million deal or 65.5% which is really, really good. That's another good metric to consider with these figures, and I'll amend the original post to include it.

6327,46252,46252,Cidolfus,"Even looking at the guarantees in a vacuum is misleading, though. Compare how much cash they're making before the team has an out to cut them. When you look at it from a cash flow per year of the new contract played before the team can cut them, it's a lot less favorable to the tight ends.

Player | Cash Earned Before Out | New Years | Cash/Year | % Earned Before Out

Kelce|$7,000,000|0|N/A?|12.2%

Anderson|$21,000,000*|1|$21,000,000|71.2%

Andrews|$36,663,055|2|$18,331,528|65.5%

*The figures for Anderson's contract on both Spotrac and OTC don't quite add up. I don't have the premium membership and can't verify, but they disagree on the signing bonus figure and other bonuses complicate things. This $21 million figure is calculated from the low-end estimates where he earns an $8,000,000 signing bonus, $200,000 in workout bonuses, $11,765,000 of restructured 2022 base salary, and the $1,035,000 remaining base salary. Spotrac reported a higher signing bonus, but that pushes his total extension value well over their reported $29.5 million, which both sites agree on.

Kelce was the strangest of the bunch because he signed his extension to add years 2022-2025 when he was still under contract for 2020 and 2021 from his previous extension. None of the base salaries in his new years were actually guaranteed, and only $7 million of the new money (the 2021 roster bonus which has been restructured) on the contract was ever guaranteed. The 49ers technically had an out this season when they could have outright cut Kelce and saved just over $1 million against the cap. His whole contract effectively existed to guarantee the base salaries of the final two years of his last extension and throw him a $7 million bone in the last year of his deal and then just tacked on four non-guaranteed years for good measure.

It looks to me like Anderson and Sutton are coming out ahead like Sharp suggested and Andrews (since you mentioned him) made out best of them all.",12.0,nfl,t3_w87gxm,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-07-26T00:49:11Z,miamidolphins,0.0762092910667557

I expect that we'll run more, but I don't think the roster construction backs up the notion. See below for the rationale, or skip because... well yeah, understandably it's more of a response than your comment warranted.

Obviously we should expect to run *more*, but consider our investment in terms of cap space and draft capital on offensive skill positions:

Player | Fully Guaranteed Money | Draft Picks
:-:|:-:|:-:
Alec Ingold|$3,500,000|N/A
Chase Edmonds|$6,100,000|N/A
Sony Michel|$850,000|N/A
Raheem Mostert|$1,000,000|N/A
**Rushing Total**|**$11,450,000**|**0**
Erik Ezukanma|$724,992|4th (125)
Cedrick Wilson Jr.|$12,750,000|N/A
Tyreek Hill|$52,535,000|1st (29), 2nd (50), 4th (121), 4th (2023), 6th (2023)

The spending disparity between the two is stark: we dumped nearly six times the guaranteed cap commitment and a boatload of draft picks into receivers. That's without even considering the money we spent to retain *both* Mike Gesicki and Durham Smythe (Miami's second- and fifth-most targeted receivers in 2021). While we brought a lot of new faces into the backfield, only Chase Edmonds (14th) is in the top 30 highest-paid running backs (Mostert is next at 34th). While Ingold is the fourth-highest paid fullback in the league, that's hardly a point of distinction given how rare fullbacks are. Importantly, the Dolphins haven't committed to any of these backs beyond the 2022 season. There's only $600,000 of dead money on Edmonds's contract in 2023; Ingold's has only $750,000.

Teams ran an average of 1077 offensive plays last season. If we throw the ball at the same rate as the 49ers did last year, that would suggest 563 passing attempts. Only six teams finished with 563 or fewer passing attempts last year: New England, Indianapolis, San Francisco, New Orleans, Seattle, and Philadelphia. On average, teams passed on 57.9% of plays (624 attempts) last season. I'm just not sure how a team whose top three receivers combined for 411 receptions in 2021 drops off *that* much, and if we do we're spending way too much money for *someone*.",4.0,nfl,t3_w7skq6,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-07-25T15:50:50Z,miamidolphins,-0.0017107543530131

The 89% salary cap floor is calculated based on the official salary cap, not the team's salary cap (which includes cap and rollover). That means that when a team saves money against a cap and rolls it over into following years, that rolled over money *does not count towards what they need to spend on the floor*.

So, for example, the total salary cap from 2013 to 2016 (the first of two defined periods in the previous CBA) was $555.15 million and teams were required to spend a minimum of about $494.1 million. If a team had been really cheap and spend exactly that minimum, that means they could have rolled over a maximum of $61.05 million into 2017.

From the second period (2017 through 2020), the total cap was $730.6 million and the floor was about $650.2 over the same period. The extra $61.05 million they'd rolled over collectively from 2013 to 2016 doesn't matter. The team could keep rolling that over as well as the additional $80.4 million.

Theoretically, a team then could have $141.45 million in total rollover available from 2013 through 2020 and have been completely compliant with the salary cap floor for all those years while also having a team available salary cap in 2021 of $323.95 million (the highest actual team cap in 2021 with rollover was the New York Jets with just shy of $206 million).

$15 million APY would put Ogbah at 16th among current contracts. Carl Lawson and Trey Hendrickson got $15 million per year just last year. Hendrickson exploded this year, but he'd been a rotational guy at best in NO for three seasons before playing big in a contract year.

Ogbah is coming off of back-to-back double-digit sack and 60+ pressure seasons and a 27-pressure, 6-sack season in only 10 games the year before. Neither Hendrickson nor Lawson had a stretch like that before signing their big deals. I'd be stunned if signed as cheaply as you suggest.

Even if, in the wake of uncertainty at the quarterback position and the loss of Payton at head coach, Loomis wanted to take a year and reset the roster, the team literally cannot afford to do so. Because of the constant restructures, there's so much dead money on these contracts that the team does not save enough cap space by cutting or trading veterans on bloated contracts.

Loomis avoided playing musical chairs because he was able to add new long-term contracts which were future restructure targets at roughly the same rate he restructured existing contracts. Running with the musical chairs analogy, when one chair was removed, he found a way to slip in a new chair. COVID derailed that plan, and now he's restructuring the same players two or three times and he has less flexibility to add new chairs (long-term, large-money contracts) to the game. The pool of fungible base salary and roster bonus available for restructure is drying up and being replaced at an unsustainable rate with dead money.

In the interview, Flores and his lawyers are happy to let Gumbel conflate NDAs (usually understood to be non-disclosure agreements) and non-disparagement agreements.

Gumbel states that the NDA (non-disparagement agreement) came ""ultimately"" from Ross and that Flores declined it. Flores agrees (literally says ""Uh huh"" and nothing else).

Gumbel asks about the NDA, which he immediately clarifies to mean a non-disparagement agreement, even though an NDA is typically understood to refer to a non-disclosure agreement. Flores and his lawyer Wigdor are perfectly content to allow Gumbel to conflate the two. It helps characterize a standard legal process (and one which the documents they provide clarify was part of his original contract) as something nefarious because the sentiment regarding non-disclosure agreements is overwhelmingly (and justifiably) negative whereas most people have almost never paid any attention to a non-disparagement agreement. Then, only a few sentences later, Wigdor makes the *distinction* between the two:

> **DOUG WIGDOR**: ...if a coach is terminated with a couple years or a year left on their contract, they don't get paid, to John's point, unless they sign a waiver, an NDA, confidentially, and non-disparagement.

That's an acknowledgment from Wigdor that the NDA and non-disparagement are typically understood to be separate things, but they're happy for Gumbel to conflate the two at the beginning and continue to do so shortly after in the same interview:

> **BRYANT GUMBEL**: It was Steve Ross who asked you to sign the NDA. Ultimately, the owner of the Dolphins. You chose not to.

> **BRIAN FLORES**: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

So even after Wigdor has listed an NDA and a non-disparagement separately, they're happy to continue to obfuscate the discussion for their own ends. The Dolphins, on the other hand, narrowly refuted that Ross mentioned an NDA to Flores:

I know that's parsing everything to the minute detail, but that's exactly what lawyers on both sides of this are going to do in the court of public opinion. Just the same way that Flores said he had been asked to sign an NDA (typically understood to be a non-disclosure agreement rather than a non-disparagement agreement) and he's still technically right, the Dolphins will deny that Ross discussed it with him and also probably be technically right because an intermediary was likely the one who handled that discussion.

Non-disparagement agreements are routine not just in football but in any industry. So routine, in fact, that it's transparently obvious that it's part of his media strategy to drum up something mundane as somehow nefarious to sway public sentiment.

6364,46405,46405,Cidolfus,"The big issue that I see most Saints fans ignore (especially those spamming the same video by Underhill as a rebuttal) is that the restructures are compounding now in a way that they hadn't in the past. Previously, Loomis had the *option* to restructure contracts in order to keep the team together, but now it's not a choice, it's a necessity. It's literally the only way the Saints can save enough money to get under the cap, because there's so much dead money on the books already that cutting or trading players doesn't make enough of a dent. The team cannot afford to do a reset year even if they wanted to.

The only way that the Saints can afford to get under the 2022 salary cap is to restructure almost every major contract on their team.  A good example of this that [I've pointed out before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/scwgt1/menon_people_are_going_to_overreact_to_saints/hu9k0ev/) Michael Thomas only saves the Saints $2 million if they cut or trade him, but since they need to free up over $70 million in cap space, they're pretty much forced to restructure him, which creates the same problem in 2023. If the team restructures Thomas as Underhill suggests, the additional $10.2 million in dead money is spread across 2023 and 2024, meaning that the Saints only save $1.3 million in dead cap in 2023 if they cut or trade him then. Given how much time Thomas has missed over the past two seasons, that's going to be an awfully tough sell that restructuring him this year so that he has that kind of dead money in 2023 when he's 30-years-old is good cap management.

The real consequence of this is that the Saints are forced to restructure the same players in consecutive years. The strategy of restructuring money each year to borrow from the future isn't necessarily a bad one, so long as you're not putting all of your eggs in one basket. It would be fine, for example, if the Saints had restructured Michael Thomas this year and were able to make their cap commitments by restructuring only players like Lattimore this year. Ideal candidates for restructures are younger players who recently signed large contracts and have not yet been restructured. Restructuring 33-year-old Cameron Jordan in his 12th NFL season when it's his third restructure in a row *is not good cap management*. It's desperation. It creates a cascade of dead money, but what's worse is that it creates a cascade of dead money that *can't* be pushed into future seasons.

Just because you can manage to sneak under the cap by restructuring your team does not mean you're not in cap hell. Underhill's proposed solution is essentially the team's only path forward, and it still defers $60+ million in dead cap into future seasons (more than $20 million of which hits next year no matter what you do), putting the Saints once again over the cap, and you're going to see the consequences of that because it makes it that much more difficult to retain young stars like Marcus Williams this year or Marcus Davenport next year, never mind veteran contributors like Armstead and Onyemata.

Never mind that many of the cap figures that Underhill suggests are also (slightly) wrong. For example, you can't actually restructure all $15.3 million of Thomas's base salary, because he's not allowed to run the season with a $0 base salary. He has to have at least the veteran minimum cap charge ($1,035,000 million for Thomas's accrued years), so you can only restructure about $14.3 million of his base salary, so you save marginally less than Underhill suggests. It's a small difference, but that adds up over multiple restructures (and admittedly doesn't impact the players whose roster bonuses rather than base salaries are getting restructured). But when OTC lists you as $79 million over the effective salary cap (and that's before even considering the effective cost of the rookie pool, two final roster spots, and a practice squad), those little amounts add up.

The work you have to do to get to the break even point is substantial, actively pushes considerably more dead money into years which already have a lot of dead money, and makes re-signing your own young talent in the future more difficult. As noted elsewhere in this comment chain, the light at the end of the tunnel is the salary cap jumping back up in 2024 with the new TV contracts and normal revenue streams hitting the cap post-COVID, but keep in mind that every other team enjoys those benefits too, and most of them won't have four straight years of deferring cap charges hitting as dead money.",31.0,nfl,t3_slujcf,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-02-06T14:02:13Z,miamidolphins,-0.0257193286218512

6366,46407,46407,Cidolfus,"It's not about using that money to compete, it's about the cap flexibility. With Tom Brady on the active roster, the Bucs are estimated to have only about $500,000 in cap space assuming the roster is filled out with minimum contracts to the Top 51. That's with Brady counting just over $20 million against the cap.

If Brady is moved to the retired list, the dead money from the signing bonus accelerates. While they get to wipe out his base salary and roster bonus, the dead cap from the signing bonus results in an extra $12 million in dead cap over his current cap charge, pushing the Bucs over the cap, and forcing them to make other cuts to compensate.

If they keep Brady until June 1, however, they can more easily keep their heads above water cap-wise ahead of the draft. They probably won't be super active in free agency anyway, but they can draft all their rookies and then move Brady to the retired list in June and use the savings to sign their rookie class and then roll over the rest into next year.

It's just clever accounting, and so long as they don't make any big non-rookie signings post-June 1, it doesn't actually change their available cap in 2023 due to rollover.

6368,46417,46417,Cidolfus,"I'll chime in as one of those Dolphins fans who argued that Flores failed in Miami on his own merits. I still believe that. He had many high-profile fuck-ups in terms of player mismanagement (Stills, M. Fitzpatrick, Rosen, Tua) completely irrespective of any pay-to-lose scheme his first season, and his inability to put together a competent offensive staff is apparent to anybody with eyes. We ended up promoting co-coordinators internally after drawing no interest from serious external candidates last year; that doesn't speak particularly well of Flores as a head coach who can successfully manage his staff, nor does the rest of the offensive staff turnover which preceded that baffling hiring decision.

Flores's failures are not mutually exclusive from Stephen Ross quietly being one of the worst owners in the league. The type of organizational incompetence alleged in the lawsuit is absolutely on brand for the Dolphins under Ross's ownership. Ross is still the same idiot who reached out to attempt to hire Jim Harbaugh despite having Tony Sporano under contract. That he might try to pressure Flores into tampering with a quarterback is entirely believable. Even the bonuses for losses doesn't shock me; Ross was open ahead of the 2019 season that he believed the team losing in the short term was a favorable outcome.

6371,46433,46433,Cidolfus,"The reason they need to keep kicking the can down the road with the Super Bowl window is clearly closed is because *they have no other options*.

The Saints need to clear nearly $80 million in salary cap space by March 16 to be compliant. On their *entire* roster, they have only three players who offer more than $3 million in salary cap savings (Onyemata, Jenkins, and Roby) if they're cut, and they only combine for $17 million in savings. That doesn't do nearly enough.

Beyond those cuts, the Saints have two options:

1. They can trade their young star players like Ramczyk, Lattimore, Davenport, and Kamara to free up bigger chunks of cap space and get some draft assets.

2. They can aggressively restructure all their contracts so that they can afford to keep their young star players.

Restructures are fine when you're staggering restructures, but they're already in the position where they're stuck restructuring players who have already been restructured once or twice within the past two seasons. The dead money is already piling up as pro-rated signing bonus that they can't move.

If they wanted to keep their young players and suffer a down year while they cleared the books, last year was the year to do it. Instead, they mortgaged their future so that they could go 9-8, and now the only way to dig themselves out of the dead money hole is to keep digging deeper and wait until 2024 when the cap explodes, fielding increasingly less competitive rosters as their expensive, bloated stars age out on giant contracts with loads of dead money.",6.0,nfl,t3_sd871s,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-01-26T11:24:27Z,miamidolphins,-0.0741002552286422

This is probably going to be reminiscent of the Saints 2014 to 2016 run where they were always top 5 in dead money and went 7-9 three years straight, except now they need to do that without Payton and Drew Brees on the team.

6373,46435,46435,Cidolfus,"A lot of tl;dr to follow, but it's not just the hivemind:

All the moves recommended in the [video linked in the comment chian below](https://twitter.com/nick_underhill/status/1483539454971334665?t=tjeOAkNaiiOVgBMCXoBLKA&s=19) about how the Saints can save $88 million in 2022 salary cap leaves the Saints about $14 in effective cap space million to:

- Sign the entire rookie class (~$3.7 million)
- Sign the practice squad (~$2.5 million)
- Sign the remaining two roster spots (~$1.4 million)

That leaves the team with just under $7 million for free agency. Problematically, it also increases the dead cap commitments in 2023 by over $20 million. The 2022 rookie class's cap cost also balloons to about $11 million in actual cap cost in 2023. Those two figures alone eat up all of the remaining projected actual salary cap in 2023. As the video suggests, the Saints can be more aggressive, but that comes at the cost of higher dead money charges in future years.

Restructuring contracts to kick the can down the road is an effective strategy so long as the team is not restructuring the same contracts multiple times. Once money has been restructured, that dead cap hit cannot be spread into future years again, so multiple restructures compounds the problem by stacking increasing amounts of dead money in years where the team has already committed dead money. Until recently, Loomis has been good about staggering restructures so that this doesn't happen, but the COVID season's impact has forced his hand into restructuring players several years in a row. We're seeing this problem cascade now. This is *not* the same situation as previous years, and last year was just the beginning.

The video recommends using restructures as the means of freeing up cap space because it's the team's *only* means of freeing up cap space. The Saints only have three players who offer more than $3 million in cap savings after being cut or traded (David Onyemata, Malcolm Jenkins, and Bradley Roby); combined cutting or trading them saves $17.1 million, but the Saints need to clear $74 million in effective cap space by March 16. Loomis must restructure most of the players cited in the video because that's his only tool available for freeing up the necessary amount.

Michael Thomas is the perfect example of how this is becoming a problem. Thomas has missed 24 games over the past two seasons. He intentionally delayed surgery so that he would miss this season. There's obviously tensions between him and the team. They can't afford to cut him. They can't afford to trade him. In either case, the team saves only $2 million in salary cap because of the dead money from last year's restructure. That leaves the option discussed in the video: restructuring his $15.3 million base salary to save $10.2 million in cap space. The problem is that this increases his pro-rated signing bonus by $5.1 million in both 2023 and 2024. That means his dead money in 2023 increases from $13.8 million to $24 million and his cap savings if cut or traded falls from $11.55 million to just $1.35 million, so they're essentially stuck paying for a 30-year-old Michael Thomas whether he's contributing to the team or not. You can't convince me that this is successful roster management.

When people say the bill always comes due, this is what they mean. After restructuring several contracts to keep the team together last year, the Saints are forced to do so again this year because they literally have no other option. This causes a new feedback loop that they've been able to avoid in the past: the majority of the contracts that the Saints need to restructure this year are contracts that they restructured last year, forcing them to double down in dead money committed in future years. The dead money committed in future years makes cutting or trading the players financially unhelpful, so the team is forced to again restructure contracts they restructured the previous year, again compounding dead money in future years. Every time they restructure the same contract a second (or third as they need to do with Cameron Jordan!) time, they're digging themselves a deeper hole each year.

The light at the end of the tunnel is that the salary cap is projected to explode in 2024 when the COVID-reduced revenues from 2020 are paid off and the players catch up to new league revenue streams from new TV contracts and the extra games, but for the 2022 and 2023 seasons they're likely to languish without much flexibility to improve. They've got to both absolutely *nail* the draft and also hope that their older contributors don't fall off due to age just to tread water.

They also have to hope that those players whose contracts they've restructured multiple times don't retire, because they can't afford all that dead money accelerating. Cameron Jordan will be 33 in the 2022 season. If they restructure his $13.6 million salary this year, they can save $9 million against the cap at the cost of $4.5 million in pro-rated signing bonus in 2023 and 2024. That means they'll have a 34-year-old Jordan signed for $27.6 million against the cap next year and can only save about $1.5 million if he's cut, traded, or retires.

Will the Saints clear this salary cap? Of course they will. Will it be in a sustainable way that provides a positive direction for the team to improve? Hell no. It was a good plan while Drew Brees was their quarterback and Sean Payton was their coach and they were competing for Super Bowls. Unless they luck into another Hall of Fame coach/quarterback combo, they're likely to decline to a slow talent drain as they fail to replace their free agents over this off-season and the next, and they probably won't be in a position to compete again until after 2024.

**If you take nothing else away from this post, take this away:** the situation for the Saints right now is so bad that even if they wanted to, they literally cannot afford to trade away their aging veterans for draft picks and attempt to start a rebuild because they have so much dead money committed on those contracts that cutting or trading them does not free up enough cap space to get under the salary cap by the March 16 deadline.",28.0,nfl,t3_scwgt1,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-01-26T00:52:35Z,miamidolphins,-0.0205621734255756
6374,46457,46457,Cidolfus,"Which ""locked in"" do you mean? If you mean the early-March deadline to designate tags, then sure, you can posture all you want that you're going to tag him, but it's empty leverage unless you actually clear the cap space for the tag if he signs it.

If you mean the mid-July deadline to extend tagged players to multi-year deals, the same problem applies. Even if the player doesn't sign the tag, you have to keep the cap space for the tag in reserve in your top 51 contracts all that time.

The problem is that any time after you issue the tag, the player can simply sign the tender and immediately force that amount onto the team's salary cap. If you don't have the cap space to absorb that tender in your top 51 contracts, player contracts are automatically terminated in reverse order that they were finalized. Since the player signing the franchise tag would be the last one in (pushing the team over the cap), they become the first one out, immediately becoming a free agent. I don't even know that the team would really get an opportunity to try to terminate other contracts to make the cap space first, because they've technically already submitted the tag to the league office and the player is signing it at their own whim. If the player didn't want to play ball and give the team heads up, he could just work with his agent to sign it without warning the team.

DeVante Parker even went as far as to like the press release on Instagram and tell a fan to shut up when they asked him why he was liking it.

If Flores gets another job as a head coach (he probably will) and manages to hire a remotely competent offensive coordinator (jury's out on the likelihood of that one), he'll probably be successful. Winning solves everything, and if we had a competent offense, Flores would still be our head coach despite his flaws.

Obviously a lot of the blame for our bad offense falls on Grier's shoulders (which is why I wanted him fired as well), but I think in general Flores gets *way* too much of a pass for organizational incompetence on one side of the ball just because he's so good at the other.

I've been a pretty consistent critic of Flores from a managerial standpoint. I was willing to excuse early stumbles (the aforementioned Stills situation, his inability to compromise with Minkah Fitzpatrick, and his publicly-muddled messaging on the starting quarterback situation between Rosen and Fitzpatrick), but when he started the back-and-forth between Tua and Fitzpatrick last year, I started to become increasingly concerned.

Relationships definitely is the word to sum up where Flores has gone wrong in Miami. He's great defensive mind, but he's far from blameless in the quarterback controversies throughout his tenure, and our turnover (four offensive coordinators and four offensive line coaches in three seasons!) on the coaching staff lands squarely on his shoulders. I'm on board with firing Flores if only because his co-coordinator situation at offensive coordinator was obviously (and predictably) a failure, and who wants to be the fifth offensive coordinator under a head coach on a must-win hot seat in his fourth season? Who except somebody desperate for the opportunity would take that job rather than other options or even just waiting a year?

One of the criticisms I've constantly levied against Flores is that I feel like I'd hate having the guy as my boss. I feel like because people thought we'd overperformed the first two seasons under him that they were willing to ignore the warning signs that he has a lot of the same flaws that other Belichickian disciples do in how they manage players and personnel. Feels like this season a lot of that came home to roost. The winning streak glossed over a lot of it, but even last night a (much disliked) beat reporter tweeted (and then deleted) that Flores had been the one who pushed for cutting Van Noy because Van Noy had started questioning defensive play calls last year and had become a player advocate.

6390,46491,46491,Cidolfus,"I'll answer since I've been very critical of Flores since about the middle of last season. I think Flores is a fantastic defensive mind, but he's made some serious mistakes as a head coach:

1. There's nobody to blame except Flores for continued churn and incompetence on the offensive coaching staff (four offensive coordinators and four offensive line coaches in three seasons). There's something fishy about the situation with Caldwell as well. He was hired and then missed his first season due to undisclosed health issues and then never returned to the team the following year despite being under contract.

2. Aside from the churn of coaching personnel, we've seen some questionable decisions regarding the starting quarterback in each season (first between Rosen and Fitzpatrick, then Tua and Fitzpatrick, and then even this year around Tua's injury with Brissett).

3. He's terrible at the head coach's most important game-day responsibilities. Clock management is consistently bad and he's absolutely awful on challenges.

4. He started his career with high-profile disagreements with Kenny Stills and Minkah Fitzpatrick that resulted in both players being jettisoned from the team. The Stills situation was unnecessarily petty, but the Fitzpatrick situation is a huge black mark on his resume. A head coach needs to be able to manage relationships with their top talent so that we're not trading away a guy who goes on to back-to-back All Pro seasons.

5. In his career, Flores is 7-14 against teams with a winning record. Even if you want to excuse his first season because he was playing with a depleted roster (fair enough), he's still only 5-10 over the past two seasons. The Dolphins are a game out of the playoffs in back-to-back seasons because we can't consistently beat good teams and had tough losses to teams who finished with sub-.500 records.

6. For as much as we want to credit Flores for the winning streaks, he also has to bear blame for the slow starts that have put the Dolphins behind the curve in the past two seasons.

I think Flores and Grier probably get a fourth year, but they'll both be on really hot seats. If we start slow again in 2022, I can see mid-season firings coming before the trade deadline. The Dolphins are at a crossroads now. We have the most cap space in the NFL and three first round picks in the next two years. We're in position to dramatically change this franchise, and I'm not comfortable with a tandem on the hot seat being the brain trust for overseeing that kind of change.",11.0,nfl,t3_s066r1,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-01-09T19:16:30Z,miamidolphins,0.0061040024508322

I'd be curious to see the average time to throw on 5- and 7-step drop backs. From the above I've got to wonder: is Tua's pressure rate low on 5- and 7-step drops because he's getting good protection, or is Tua's pressure rate on those drop backs low because he hits the top of his drop and the ball needs to come out? If it's the former, then yeah, we've got some real concerns about Tua not looking down field. If it's the latter, it could be that Tua's recognizing pressure is breaking down and getting the ball out.

DeVante Parker has missed three games. Preston Williams has missed time both for injury and for disciplinary reasons. We traded away Jakeem Grant. Even Albert Wilson has been a healthy scratch and barely plays when he is available.

6416,46693,46693,Cidolfus,"Flowers was never intended as the long-term solution at guard. In the same year that we signed him, we also drafted both Robert Hunt and Solomon Kindley. Kindley started the season at right guard and was beginning to get comfortable and perform well there (particularly in pass protection) until Flowers went down. Kindley shifted over to Flowers's spot at left guard then and struggled a bit before getting injured. Similarly, while Hunt spent most of his rookie season playing right tackle, most thought him a better fit at guard.

Early in the offseason, it was pretty clear that Flowers likely wouldn't play out the third year of his deal and that we were interested in Kindley and Hunt as the team's guards for the future and we were instead looking for another option at right tackle. In fact, three days after we traded Flowers to Washington, we drafted Liam Eichenberg to lock down that right tackle position.

The Flowers trade makes sense in the context of a young, inexperienced offensive coaching staff failing at self-scouting and properly evaluating their young talent. We knew that the plan was to have Kindley and Hunt starting at left and right guard respectively, but instead of waiting for camp and seeing how that actually played out, we pulled the trigger on the Flowers trade. The move was made assuming that Kindley (who had shown promise at guard) and Hunt (who was arguably our best offensive linemen last year) were ready to start now. If we kept Flowers, it would be as either a backup or a starter who would be gone the next year anyway. Might as well save on some of that guaranteed money in a trade if we wanted to start someone else in that spot anyway.

That's how the season started, too. Kindley started week one at left guard and (at least per PFF) had a solid game. He was our highest-graded offensive lineman (70.7 overall) allowing only one hurry. Robert Hunt started at right guard and had our highest pass-blocking grade (72.5) and allowing only one hurry as well (he struggled in run blocking in his first game at guard). Kindley had a rough game week two against Buffalo (allowing four pressures), but he wasn't even the worst performer on our line (Jesse Davis also allowed four pressures and Austin Jackson allowed eight; every offensive lineman allowed multiple pressures).

Generally speaking, guards have not been our problem this year, and while I think this regime has made plenty of dumb moves, I'm not convinced that Flowers is one that moves the needle much. Sure, we overestimated our rookies and having Flowers right now would probably be better, but this team desperately needs better play from both its tackles, and we saw how awful Flowers as a bookend. Moreover, given that all of our rookies (even Hunt who looked good at the end of last season) have regressed terribly, I have to wonder how much of the problem is having two inexperienced co-offensive coordinators and an internally-promoted offensive line coach in his first year in the job.

tl;dr: Flowers isn't the missing piece on this offensive line. Our guard play hasn't been great, but it's not what's breaking this line. Bad tackles and bad coaching are much, much bigger problems. The best argument for keeping Flowers would be as a veteran presence, but I don't know how much that compensates for the bad coaching.",22.0,nfl,t3_qll0cv,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2021-11-03T00:03:02Z,miamidolphins,-0.0264876733702545

Houston proper has no coastline. Port Houston is on the Buffalo Bayou which of course connects to the bay, sure. If you want to include the whole greater metro area out to League City and Galveston, then yeah, Houston is a coastal city. But the city of Houston itself is not on the bay, and the center of the city is 50 miles away from the nearest beach. It's not Dallas, Austin, or San Antonio levels of landlocked, but it's not exactly on the water. The very south end of the city abuts Clear Lake, but even that side of the take is a couple miles from the Bay.

The vast majority of what is colloquially considered Houston doesn't get a whiff of ocean breeze to cool it down the way Miami does.

They are not. Miami has the ocean. Houston is landlocked. That makes a huge difference. Miami has only recorded 100 degrees *once* all the way back in 1942. Houston averages seven such days per year. Houston's summers are 4-5 degrees hotter than Miami's on average as well. Houston is also 5-6% more humid on average than Miami.

Those sound like small numbers, but that shit adds up. Never mind which of the two has the more recent history of bigger storms and hurricanes (obviously Miami is far from in the clear on that front in the future), but there's a pretty big difference in feel between Miami's hot but tropical summers and Houston's ""fuck this is fucking hot"" summers.",43.0,nfl,t3_ql247d,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2021-11-02T08:02:03Z,miamidolphins,0.0029856184050522

If we're sitting at 1-7 (or even 2-6) right before the trade deadline, there's a very real chance that we make the judgment that even if Howard is our best player, he doesn't fit this team's timeline as we're staring down another rebuild. Unless you think that the Dolphins can turn it around and compete next year with some roster tweaking, it may be time to cut bait. The window to contend with Howard is arguably a very, very slim one.

That lasted all of another week before Fitzpatrick was back to starting and Rosen wouldn't play again and would be off the team in short order.

That's even assuming that I buy into the excuse that the GM and owner forced his hand. I'm sure they had input, but it's not like expectations for the season were a surprise. We went into 2019 with a very clear plan to rip the team down to the studs in order to clear bad cap commitments and accumulate draft assets.

1. his passive aggressive antagonism towards Kenny Stills,

3. his poor handling of the starting quarterback his first two seasons,
4. and extreme inconsistency on the offensive coaching staff.

Flores got the benefit of the doubt his first year due to a terrible roster, and last year we overperformed expectations due largely to a very favorable turnover differential. Now that we're not generating turnovers at an unsustainable rate anymore (something the recent Ringer article discussed well), our defense (which is otherwise extremely similar statistically to last year) is struggling and our offensive woes from the previous year have carried over.

This rule makes little sense to me. Before I get downvoted by the hive mind, hear me out.  
  
Does the vaccine protect you from getting infected? Every source I've seen says that the vaccine isn't an antidote against infection.  
  
How is this any different from vaccinated as opposed to non-vaccinated players getting infected, if the standard that we're using is that they are, or are not vaccinated and the team forfeits a game due to infection.  
  
Does this mean that players that test positive for COVID but ARE vaccinated will still be eligible to play even during their COVID positive time period? (Barring actual symptoms, of course)  
  
Because if so, that would be huge. And it seems like the NFL is saying:  
  
""we don't really care whether you forfeit or not, but if you do forfeit AND you have unvaccinated players, you will be penalized"".  
  
Also, how do we measure this? Do we measure at point of infection? So if you only have 3 players that are unvaccinated but they got the rest of the vaccinated team sick, then does the team get penalized? What if the players that start the epidemic on a team get sick but ARE ALREADY Vaccinated, and then as a result of the first group the unvaccinated players get COVID positive tests, does that mean the team is still penalized?  
  
Because had they been vaccinated or not, they would have all been susceptible to infection regardless of who got infected first?!  
  
This just seems like an excuse to exert social pressure/penalize teams that have players that don't get vaccinated.

That being said: Waddle is a beast. And maybe Waddle himself isn't the answer. But a line up of DVP, Waddle in slot, and Fuller on the weak side, with Gesexy on the TE just made me jizz a little.

If they put two high safeties we blunt force them with Gesicki outs or a RB wheel.

If they play us man, then either Fuller or Waddle burn the shit out of their secondary.

19425,159731,159731,Roctopuss,"Excellent thread from Chris Kouffman that every Dolphin fan should read:

&#x200B;

""That 2/10ths of a second is enough for a DB moving at common NFL speeds to close an extra 4-6 feet on a stationary target, in certain circumstances. In a game of inches, 4-6 feet can really make a difference. Despite what some say, I'm always going to shoot you straight on this.

The big question is just how detrimental is it? Is this velocity at this distance something you might've seen from Drew Brees? Yes. Tom Brady? Yes. Peyton Manning? Yes. Joe Burrow? Yes. Plenty of others. Most minuses (relatively speaking) can be overcome.

Timing variances between the sub-average, average, and above-average NFL arms are often dwarfed by the variances in QB decision-speed and release speed. It's tough to throw that ball 2/10ths of a second faster. It's not as tough to make your decision 2/10ths of a second faster.

When a guy has a below-average arm, it can bleed into decision making. He might (e.g.) shy away from this throw. Found it interesting Tua did not. He got his head around off the fake, located the safety, saw him flat-footed, so he turned and made the throw to the sideline.

What's more important than pure velocity is a QB's feel for his own arm, and ability to sync up to it with his timing and placement. Tua's timing and location on this throw were impeccable, regardless of velocity. Ball is well out before the receiver got his head around.

Recall that extra 2/10ths of a second can give a DB an extra 4-6 feet of closing on a stationary target? This wasn't a stationary target. QB's ball location and the route choice made sure of that. Not quite as easy to close an extra 4-6 feet on a receiver who is still running.

Which brings to mind something Tua's old Bama play-caller, Steve Sarkisian, once said at a coach clinic:

""I don't like throwing the ball to a stationary target. Because I'm as slow, or as fast, as Julio Jones at that moment ... Let's get the guys catching the ball on the move.""

Fan of Tua's though I am, I've never tried to deny or hide this velocity shortcoming, going all the way back to Bama. Ultimately, you're going to choose your own opinion as to how much it will hinder a quarterback playing in what has become overwhelmingly a dink-and-dunk league.""",35.0,miamidolphins,t3_x7wqwa,False,0.0,AKIMBO WADDLES,2022-09-07T00:33:54Z,miamidolphins,0.002696452332615

19578,160118,160118,Roctopuss,"Let's explain this in elementary terms. OK, boys and girls. 1+1=2. Yellow and blue make green, boys and girls. And when a talented quarterback doesn't do what people anticipated, then there are reasons. But in today's modern culture, people's video game and fantasy football fandom think the word ""reasons"" means ""excuses."" But they are not the same. Are we following boys and girls?  
  
Now, boys and girls, let's begin with the basics. Have we heard anyone besides media and fans say this is a make-or-break year for Tua besides the media? Of course, you haven't. That is that clouded judgment that fandom has blinded boys and girls with. Nobody has heard anyone in the Dolphins organization say that. It's all speculative, boys and girls.  
  
Now boys and girls, for why his play hasn't been good enough is that there are reasons. They are called reasons, not excuses boys and girls. The average football fan doesn't watch every second of every game played for a single team. Most fans will catch highlights of games. Now boys and girls, for those fans catching YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook highlights of Tua, we live in an easily manipulated by media generation. And when two or three bad plays are constantly showed in multiple videos on multiple platforms, manipulation of the mind plays into thinking that those 2 or 3 bad plays must be why Tua hasn't been good enough. So that is the type of QB he is. But boys and girls, what the media doesn't show you, those that despise Tua, the trolls from the Jets, the Bills, and the trolls that have infiltrated the Dolphins fanbase, is that you have just seen videos from only 16.3% of bad throws Tua made in 2021. That is a real stat. They have intentionally refused to show you the other 83.7% of good throws he made that shows exactly how good he is.  
  
Now, boys and girls, there are the trolls that say if Tua can't throw in anything but clean pockets he's not good...as they are referring to Tua being the best QB in clean pockets. Well, boys and girls, Tua had the worst pocket time in the NFL averaging only 2.1 seconds behind the worst o-line in the NFL, and he still was the 7th most accurate quarterback in the NFL. And boys and girls, for those ""well it's because he only threw 5-yard passes"" crowd, no boys and girls, even screen passes break down on collapsed pockets. You see, the trolling part comes from the education about football from a pamphlet instructing people how to play a John Madden video game. And that is where the extant of football knowledge comes from for those saying that Tua must have clean pockets to be good, boys and girls. See, context is everything boys and girls.  
  
Now, boys and girls, do we honestly believe that Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert played for a coach that allowed Deshaun Watson rumors to continue all year without stopping it because that coach never wanted them in the first place? Do we really believe Herbert and Burrow were recovering from a major hip injury? No, Burrow's injury wasn't the same, boys and girls. Now do we think that Tua had receivers and running backs like Austin Ekeler, Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, Joe Mixon, Ja'Marr Chase, and Tee Higgins? Do you think Burrow led the league in getting sacked because he had a bad o-line like Tua? But, the real answer is, Tua had the worst o-line in the NFL and was the least sacked QB, boys and girls.  
  
Did Burrow and Herbert's offensive coaches draw up playbooks that was only designed to throw to one receiver and didn't have plays designed to throw downfield?  
  
Now what has Tua showed us in the last two years that he can't be the guy, boys and girls?  
  
What did we learn here, children? Wait, why am I addressing adults like children, again? Oh, I remember. It's because when it comes to Tua, it appears that most of the knowledge about the game of football is from the mind of an elementary school child, because they haven't gotten past what fake football is and what reality footballl is.

OL are just more of a long-term investment since a significant part of the position relies on chemistry within the unit which certainly incentivizes getting them in sooner than later to start the clock on that.

Above was in general terms however I also think it fits our specific team situation (along with the NFL landscape in general).

Wouldn't be the first nor the last time this has happened.

Just my 2 cents, but I don't think teams would even hold it against Baker if he had to do something like that to force himself out of that toxic situation. It would be understandable for him to want out given the way things have played out and now with them posturing to have him serve as one 2 backups going into the final year of his contract. 

I'm not even 100% sure they would even play Baker over Jacoby at this point. Imagine Baker balls out and the fans are chanting his name while you are on the hook for $230m to Watson. Sure that scenario would increase Baker's perceived value, but that's not even the main obstacle here which is the Browns have 0 leverage.

1) Intangibles - this is almost cheating but if I don't lump some things together, this list will get lengthy fast.

-Composure: No stage is too big, never gets rattled. No better example than his freshman szn at Bama where he came off the bench to stun UGA in the National Championship.

-Work Ethic/Heart/Passion: I think a lot of what makes him a good leader can be traced back to his heart. He's ""all-in"" and it rubs off on his teammates

2) Accuracy - elite accuracy. Won't waste time here as this is probably his most unanimous agreed upon trait.

3) Football IQ/Mental/Coachability - another combo entry. Disregard the media propagation of the Tua not knowing the playbook when he was just falling on the sword like a leader. He can and will master the playbook while beginning to diagnose defenses. Sark's playbook wasn't watered or dumbed down at Bama. Mentally, even in the toughest moments Tua is going to be that beacon of positivity and hope you look for in a leader. Tua has responded well to some of the most demanding coaches in the game has been able to implement advice from them, but also veterans such as FitzMagic.

4) Release - he has a smooth, quick release.

5) Anticipation - assuming the understanding of the playbook, Tua has shown in the past the ability to anticipate at a very high level.

6) Mobility - he isn't Lamar Jackson, but that's because they play different positions (I kid).

Now after my Gronk rant, Long isn't that as I'm obviously very high on Gronk. But having a TE that can do both relatively well makes the team-building process that much easier and allows you to add an extra ""specialized"" player to the depth chart since you have a TE capable of doing both jobs.

Sewell seems to have a high floor and would seemingly be the Tunsil replacement I have hoped for with Jackson hopefully also developing into good starter in his own right. For way too many years (decades at this point) we have been plagued by usually far below average o-line play, so I'm onboard with investing heavily into the o-line like the Cowboys did a few years back. I acknowledge there are a couple other OTs being mentioned as being in the top tier which is why Pitts is my top option.

Pitts is a rare breed and my dream pick. TEs have become the biggest matchup nightmare in the NFL and he has the potential to be elite at it. A Pitts/Gesicki duo could take the NFL by storm and really help Tua out. Obviously, Flores has seen the value and impact of running a 2 TE scheme when you have 2 playmakers at the position. TE has also been a position of weakness for the Dolphins over the years with maybe a few bright spots. I'm a huge believer in Gesicki.

21336,167126,167126,SkyzYn,"> Expected Points Added, commonly referred to as EPA, is a measure of how well a team performs relative to expectation. For example, if a team starts a drive on the 50-yard line, its expected points to start the drive would be about 2.5. If the team ends the drive with a field goal, thus gaining 3 points, its EPA for that drive would be found by subtracting its expected points from how many points it actually gained, 3 ‚Äì 2.5 or 0.5 EPA.

> This same logic can be applied to individual plays. Say the Chiefs start with the ball first-and-10 from their own 25-yard line, where its expected points would be about 1.06. If Patrick Mahomes throws a 15-yard completion, making it first-and-10 on the KC 40-yard line, where the expected points is now 1.88, the EPA of that play would be 1.88 ‚Äì 1.06 or 0.82. In other words, that completion increased the Chiefs‚Äô expected points on that drive by just over three-fourths of a point. If instead of the completion, Mahomes was sacked for a 10-yard loss, making it second-and-20 from their own 15, the new expected points would be about -0.54 and the EPA for that play would be -0.54 ‚Äì 1.06 or -1.6. This means the sack decreased the amount of points the Chiefs were expected to score on that drive by 1.6 points.

That being said, I think there is a greater chance for a huge leap than normal. Last off-season his sole focus was rehabbing a very serious injury and there was little to no in-person offseason on top of that. While other players were at least able to do strength and conditioning, positional drills, etc... Tua was rehabbing a major injury. From what's been on his social media feed he looks stronger and possibly has put on some weight/muscle this offseason. I think with a full offseason plus an increased focus on being able to train vs. rehab he has a really good shot of taking a leap this year.

TLDR: I think he has a massive chance to take a huge leap, but if he doesn't I would consider moving on next offseason. Fins have the capital to do it too.",2.0,nfl,t3_n4xlnt,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2021-05-04T16:28:10Z,miamidolphins,0.0044599144971911

Ok, I just looked [here](https://overthecap.com/salary-cap/miami-dolphins/).  

OOOF! By far the BIGGEST dead cap hit is cutting Erick Flowers (8M) - almost half the dead cap space! The next highest dead cap is Kyle Van Noy at 4M.

So it's really one TERRIBLE move there that blows up the dead cap amount. Take out the Erick Flowers cut, and we are way below average.

I didn‚Äôt know anyone at the time other than my sister and it‚Äôs safe to say we don‚Äôt exactly hang out in the same crowd. Anyways, it was my first day out of isolation after testing negative and it was a Friday night. I ended up going out to a bar with her and some her friends. It wasn‚Äôt totally my scene, so I ended up taking an Uber home around 10:30.

Right after I left I got a text around 11:00 from my sister saying ‚Äúoh my god I just met Jay Cutler‚Äù. I quickly responded ‚Äúpics or it didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù not believing a single word she said, despite the fact she knew nothing of football.

Flash forward to the next morning and I see a string of texts from my sister going until 5am explaining this absolutely ridiculous night of hanging out with Jay Cutler. I still didn‚Äôt believe her, and headed over to her apartment since we were supposed to get brunch. But once I got there, her roommates said she wasn‚Äôt home. We talked about how none of us believed her, and then she sent me a picture of him in a bathrobe. That‚Äôs when my jaw dropped.

That‚Äôs when I got the call from my sister asking me to pick her up from Jay Cutlers hotel room. I immediately grabbed her car and started driving, absolutely fanboying over the fact I was gonna meet Jay cutler, when I get another call from her saying ‚ÄúJay and his agent want to take me out to brunch, and he said you‚Äôre invited‚Äù

At this point I‚Äôm full on geeking. But she made me promise to play it cool. I finally showed up around 2:00 and my sister, Jay Cutler, and his agent, were all miserably hungover at a diner. He stood up and shook my hand and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jay, nice to meet you. Want some wings?‚Äù

I proceeded to spend an hour at brunch with Jay Cutler drinking beers and crushing wings after he bought like everything on the menu, while he was preparing to speak at a veterans event in another hour.

At the end of the day, I expected him to kind of be an asshole but he was a super nice guy. Apparently he is a really conservative guy, and my sister mentioned I happened to be very liberal and working in government; and so he asked me all about my job and never once brought up his political opinions. 10/10 would share wings with Jay Cutler again.",1.0,nfl,t3_rwx0fj,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-01-06T09:51:51Z,miamidolphins,0.0141904408616612

33704,249159,249159,goodbiforever,"# 2021 Draft Selections (expanded) 

**Jaylen Waddle, WR, Alabama** 

Like many fans, the selection of Jaylen Waddle initially surprised me; I was almost certain that Miami would opt for Heisman winner DeVonte Smith, Waddle's teammate and one of Tua's former top targets. Or, if not Smith, then the Dolphins would instead select Oregon tackle Penei Sewell, considered the best lineman in the draft and a fool-proof choice for an offensive line as weak as Miami's. Fortunately, any skepticism I had about Waddle has since disappeared on the tails of Waddle's record-breaking season. He's proven his ability to open up a formerly anemic offense and shown remarkable chemistry with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Waddle now holds the all-time rookie reception record with 104 and ended the season with seven total touchdowns, 1,015 receiving yards, and one of the best TD celebrations in the league.

**Jaelan Phillips, DE, Miami** 

Another somewhat surprising, but ultimately rewarding selection. Just like Waddle, Phillips produced a record-breaking rookie season, now possessing the Dolphins' rookie sack record and finishing only behind Micah Parsons in rookie sack numbers on the year with 8.5. Even when he did not make it to the quarterback, he was an immensely disruptive player against opposing offenses. Any concerns about his injury history or his brief retirement from football while still in college have been put to rest. 

**Jevon Holland, S, Oregen**

On the heels of longtime safety Bobby McCain's departure from the team, Jevon Holland could not have come at a better time, nor could he have made a bigger entrance. Holland ended the season with an 84.7 grade from PFF, recording three sacks, two interceptions, and one forced fumble. At just 22-years-old, Holland has the makings of a longtime anchor of the defense and a true franchise player. 

**Liam Eichenberg, T, Notre Dame** 

Liam Eichenberg had a rough start to the season. There's no sugarcoating it. But there is a silver-lining; his performance in the latter half of the season improved every game. He gave up just one pressure against the Jets in  a Week 15 matchup and showed flashes at both tackle and guard. Unfortunately for Eichenberg, the constant shuffling to different positions on the line did his development no favors, but hopefully a new coaching scheme and more experience in the offensive staff will make the most of his talent. I still think he has starter or very high-end backup potential. 

**Hunter Long, TE, Boston College** 

Looking back with the gift of hindsight, this pick feels bizarre. Chris Grier's (or Flores's?) thought process on selecting Long is still unclear. Was he looking for another big player to block in the passing game? Insurance for the possible departure of starting TE Mike Gesicki? A camp body with high upside? Considering the fact that Long was a healthy scratch for most of the season, and Mike Gesicki has just received the franchise tag, virtually none of these questions have been answered. The recent re-signing of TE Durham Smythe makes Long's future even more confusing. Surprisingly, Long appeared in seven games this season, though he only recorded one reception for eight yards. 

**Larnel Coleman, T, UMass Amherst** 

A huge project tackle with high upside, Coleman has great size but lacks polish. He was placed on IR in August and never saw the field. Whether he will become a starter or even a reliable backup remains to be seen, but new coach Mike McDaniel has background as an O-Line coach and loves big bodies on the line, so Coleman may see much more action in 2022. 

**Gerrid Doaks, RB, Cincinnati** 

Doaks, who enjoyed an impressive career at the University of Cincinnati, has spent most of the year on the practice squad and has yet to see the field in the regular season. The Dolphins recently signed him to a futures contract, however, signaling their belief that he can be a solid contributor to the offense in the future.",10.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:56:02Z,miamidolphins,-0.0024402346469532

**Will Fuller V - WR - Houston Texans** 

Look away, Dolphins fans. Remember how excited we were? Finally, some real weapons for Tua. Oh, how wrong we were in. Looking back, I guess we were all fools to think that an incredibly injury-prone receiver could walk into our incredibly injury-prone receivers room and not become incredibly injured, incredibly quickly. But come on---two games? Four receptions? 26 yards? For ten million dollars. Fuller also disappeared from the team for long stretches of the season, and because Brian Flores is Brian Flores, he gave only cryptic non-answers about Fuller's absence whenever he was asked about it. Suffice it to say that I'd be shocked if Miami signed him to another deal. The Dolphins have made some truly egregious free agency mistakes in my time, but this one will go down as one of the worst. 

**Jacoby Brissett - QB - Indianapolis Colts** 

Another signing we couldn't have been more wrong about. I can't speak for every Dolphins fan, but my impression of the Brissett signing was positive; I thought that he was a high-level backup, but not good enough to spark another year of quarterback controversy. Colts fans also lauded him as a high-character addition to the locker room and a smart player. And then he started some games while Tua was on IR with broken ribs. And then he lost every single one of them. If I never see Jacoby throw another pass into the dirt five yards from his receiver's feet, it'll be too soon. Also, judging by the fit he threw on the sidelines of the Ravens game after being benched for an injured Tua, I'm not even sure he's as much of a team player as advertised. 

**Duke Johnson - RB - UFA** 

Duke was a last resort signing after the entire Dolphins RB room went on the COVID list, and for once, this worked out great for everyone. Johnson became the Dolphins first 100-yard rusher all season and was good for three TDs in his limited apperances. A true hometown hero, Duke grew up just a few miles from Hard Rock Stadium and played there in college with the Miami Hurricanes. He posted a second 100-yard game against the Patriots in the season finale and will likely have more suitors as teams continue to fill out their rosters over the coming weeks.

 **Jason McCourty - CB - New England Patriots** 

Former Patriot? Defensive back? Yeah, this signing had Brian Flores written all over it. McCourty played only a few games before being placed on IR in October. His one-year deal now up, expect him to go back to New England or maybe end up on a contender later in the year. With the development of young players like Nik Needham, Jevon Holland, and Brandon Jones, it feels like the Dolphins' need for a player like McCourty has somewhat diminished.",8.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:52:19Z,miamidolphins,0.0263010429953827

**Ryan Fitzpatrick - QB - Washington Football Team** 

Goodbye, sweet prince. Dolphins fans will forever cherish him for the Fitzmagic and forgive him for the Fitztragic. Noted Harvard graduate and NFL journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick delivered real excitement and charisma to the QB position, something that Miami has been lacking since, I don't know, Chad Pennington? Fitz and his gunslinger attitude ignited a Stone Age offense and gave us some of the greatest highlights ever, particularly the Braille Mary. I would have loved to keep him as a backup for the rest of his illustrious career, but Fitz had aspirations of starting, and the Dolphins have what they hope will be their franchise quarterback in young  Tua Tagovailoa. Despite the good times, Fitzpatrick unfortunately played a role in the exhausting quarterback circus of 2020, stirring media controversy when he knew full well that Miami had signed him as a stop-gap QB while Tua developed. Fitzpatrick would move on to Washington, where he suffered a (water-slide related?) hip injury and has not played since. In with a bang, gone with a whisper. 

**Kyle Van Noy - ILB - New England Patriots** 

Another controversial departure. Despite having been signed to a four-year contract, Kyle Van Noy was released by the Dolphins after just one season and he was not happy about it. It seemed like a strange grudge back then, but now, in light of reports that Flores is far from a daisy to work for, perhaps Van Noy was truly the wronged party in this bizarre roster move. In any case, Kyle quickly returned home to New England. 

**Bobby McCain - S - Washington Football Team** 

McCain was one of the last dominoes to fall in the complete overhaul of the Dolphins roster since the Gase days. He was a pillar of the defense and highly graded, but with the drafting of his young, talented replacement Jevon Holland, this move made sense. Nonetheless, we'll remember him as one of the few consistent players of the 2010s Dolphins. McCain followed QB Ryan Fitzpatrick to Washington after his release. 

**Matt Haack - P - Buffalo Bills** 

The Dolphins let special teams god Haack walk in free agency. While he was a good but not elite punter, we'll always appreciate him for being a trick play king. Anyone remember the Mountaineer Shot?",7.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:50:17Z,miamidolphins,0.0021180607941694

**Tua Tagovailoa**: Tua moved into 9th place on the team's all-time yards list (4467) and is one mediocre year (2647 yards) from moving all the way to 5th place, passing Chad Henne (7114). When it comes to completion percentage, Tua is the man, ranking 2nd for Dolphins QBs with more than 20 starts behind only Chad Pennington (67.6%). Being behind Chad Pennington is not a bad thing, as he has always been considered one of the most accurate passers in league history. Not to mention being a staggering 6.8% better than Dan ‚Äòthe man‚Äô Marino. For being 9th in yards and 8th in completions, Tua does fall behind a little, being 10th in TDs. But no need to worry, Tua gets it done on the ground much better, have 6 TD‚Äôs in his 2 years on the ground vs career numbers of 11 for Jay Fielder, 9 for David Woodley, 9 for Dan Marino, 6 for Ryan Fitzpatrick, 6 for Ryan Tannehill, 2 for Chad Henne and 2 for Matt Moore.

**Jaylen Waddle**: Most receptions by a rookie ever with 104. Posted a 1000 yard season, becoming the first Miami rookie to ever do that (though Duper didn‚Äôt play his rookie year at all, he did post 1000 yards in his 2nd year). Waddle also gave us the most first downs this year with 59.

**DeVante Parker**: Moved into 8th overall receptions and 6th overall yards. Parker is now in a three-way tie for 8th overall receiving TDs with Anthony Fasano and Kenny Stills.    '

**Jason Sanders**: In four short years he has made it to 8th all-time scorer in Dolphins history, 10 points behind Nat Moore for 7th, and is at the exact same 6.8 PPG as the Dolphins all-time leader Olindo Mare. He is now in a three-way tie (Olindo Mare / Pete Stoyanovich) for the most 50+ FG‚Äôs made (14).

**Mike Gesicki**: His 73 receptions were the most for a Miami TE since Randy McMichael posted 73 receptions in 2004. No statistical proof, but probably the worst hurdles of the year as well as the most one-handed grabs (in the league) this year.",14.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:48:20Z,miamidolphins,-0.0453866665347312

 The Dolphins were again a running by committee team. Six different players ran for over 100 yards for the year, with Myles Gaskin leading the charge with 612 yards. Duke Johnson got his hands into the mix late and ended up with 330 yards for the year, with two 100-yard games. The Dolphins active roster had just three total 100-yard rushing games by active players (the third by Salvon Ahmed). There were also only two 100-yard receiving games: one by Waddle and the other by Gesicki. 

Defensively, Emmanuel Ogbah crushed it this year with 9.0 sacks, 24 QB hits, 9 TFL, and 12 PD. Jaelan Phillips was another force, starting only five games but posting 8.5 sacks, 16 QB hits and 9 TFL. The Dolphins secondary was again disrupting everyone they could with Xavien Howard (5 INT, 16 PD), Jevon Holland (2 INT, 10 PD), Nik Needham (2 INT, 5 PD) and Byron Jones (10 PD). The Dolphins defense had no true stand out tackler, besides Christian Wilkins nabbing 89 tackles from the DT position. Otherwise it was very much a team effort in tackling all around with Jerome Baker leading the charge with 92 total (62 solo) tackles. 

As for Blitzing, the Dolphins were one of those teams that blitzed uniquely and from a lot of angles. LBs Andrew Van Ginkel (115 times), Jerome Baker (91 times) and Jaelan Phillips (69 times) came at the QB a lot. The defensive backs posted pretty impressive blitz numbers too, with Brandon Jones (69 times), Jevon Holland (51 times), Eric Rowe (24 times) and Nik Needham (20 times).",16.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:46:14Z,miamidolphins,0.0577378953065131

37575,273932,273932,lythy2016,"Apologies for the block of text, but this is the article:

An intriguing outside-the-box option has emerged as the Dolphins mull what to do with their starting center job: Well-regarded left guard Connor Williams, the free agent addition from the Dallas Cowboys, has been splitting his time between guard and center during the team‚Äôs offseason program and is now viewed as an option to play center if the team chooses to go in that direction, according to multiple sources. Williams took snaps at center in preseason for the Cowboys the past two years, and the Cowboys liked how it went. ‚ÄúI thought Connor had his best day [July 25]‚Äù at center, coach Mike McCartney said at the time. Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, offensive coordinator Frank Smith and offensive line coach Matt Applebaum are experimenting with offensive linemen at different positions, and decisions might not be made until training camp or after multiple preseason games. The Dolphins don‚Äôt have a single veteran player on their roster who began their NFL career as a center, but they have multiple players who have experience at the position and can handle the job capably. Michael Deiter was a 15-game starter at guard as a rookie, played only 23 snaps in his second season and moved permanently to center last summer. He won the starting center job in training camp, beating out Matt Skura, and started the first three games before a foot injury sidelined him for eight games. He came back and started the final six games. Pro Football Focus rated Dieter 28th of 39 qualifying centers, including 28th as a run blocker. In pass protection, Deiter allowed one sack and 10 pressures in nine games, which was decent. The Dolphins think enough of Deiter that they didn‚Äôt make center a priority in the offseason. If the Dolphins don‚Äôt have Deiter or Williams as their starting center, they have enough cap space ($20 million) to address the position via free agency or a trade if they choose. But there‚Äôs only one above-average center left in free agency ‚Äî former Cleveland starter J.C. Tretter, whom PFF ranked sixth among 39 centers last season. The Dolphins did not aggressively pursue him before the draft, according to a source. But he can‚Äôt be ruled out, either. Find more sports news, plus coverage from Sports Illustrated. READ MORE Besides Deiter, the only other center on the roster is Arkansas‚Äô Ty Clary, who signed with the Dolphins after going undrafted last weekend. Aside from issues with penalties (17 of them last season) that led to a temporary benching last November, Williams was otherwise very good at left guard for the Cowboys last season, allowing only 13 quarterback pressures, fourth fewest among NFL players who pass blocked at least 300 snaps and fewest for players who pass blocked at least 600 snaps. Pro Football Focus rated Williams 11th among 83 guards as a run-blocker. Williams played left tackle at the University of Texas and has the skill set to play any position on the line. He signed a two-year, $14 million deal with the Dolphins in March. If the Dolphins start Deiter or a player who‚Äôs not yet on the team at center, the rest of the line likely would include Terron Armstead at left tackle, Williams at left guard, Robert Hunt at right guard and likely Austin Jackson or Liam Eichenberg at right tackle. As reported weeks ago, the Dolphins believe Jackson ‚Äî a former starter at left tackle and left guard ‚Äî and can be a productive right tackle. He has been working at right tackle in the offseason program. If the Dolphins move Williams to center, then the line could feature Armstead at left tackle, Hunt at right guard, Eichenberg or perhaps Solomon Kindley at left guard and Jackson or Eichenberg at right tackle. The Dolphins have the option of moving Hunt from right guard to right tackle, but the team likes how he played at right guard last season and he seems more likely than not to stay at that spot. Robert Jones has a good chance to stick as a multiposition backup and could push for playing time; he started the 2021 season finale at right tackle. Jones has been working at center on his own in case the team needs him at that position. There‚Äôs also an outside chance that undrafted Arizona State left tackle Kellen Diesch ‚Äî who was given $140,000 guaranteed ‚Äî could compete for immediate playing time if he‚Äôs outstanding in the months ahead. Greg Little, Larnel Coleman, Adam Pankey, Kion Smith and undrafted rookies Blaise Andreis (Minnesota) and Clark are the other offensive linemen under contract.",23.0,miamidolphins,t3_uhocno,False,0.0,:DM13:,2022-05-03T15:46:12Z,miamidolphins,-0.0144276706872427

41107,304208,304208,solidnandz,"Fallout from Brian Flores‚Äô Dolphins dismissal in the wake of an NFL Network report that he will interview for the Chicago Bears head coaching job: ‚ñ™ Flores already was essentially running the Dolphins building, according to a source in direct contact with Dolphins management. But he wanted even more control, the source said. He wanted the authority formalized, to eliminate the contract annoyance of general manager Chris Grier having final say on the draft and free agency.

He wanted more power in everything, final say on virtually everything. He wanted more people to report to him. He already had full authority to pick a coaching staff and planned to make more changes, beginning with the offensive staff. At least one of the offensive coordinators was expecting to be dismissed, if not both.

What‚Äôs strange about this is that Grier ‚Äî who likes to avoid conflict ‚Äî basically gave Flores everything he wanted. There wasn‚Äôt a single player on the roster that Flores didn‚Äôt sign off on. And yet Grier‚Äôs deference still wasn‚Äôt enough to appease Flores or sooth tensions between the two. As one Dolphins person said, people need to stop blaming Grier entirely for the personnel moves that didn‚Äôt work out the past three years and blame them both equally. And both deserve credit for the ones that worked out. ‚ñ™ There were plenty of examples of Flores demanding his way on things that weren‚Äôt necessarily under his domain. He lobbied for the dismissal of Matt Taylor, the team‚Äôs top football media relations person, last spring, over the objections of the two executives who wanted to keep him, including team president Tom Garfinkel. Flores got his way, as he usually did. ‚ñ™ There were plenty of players who liked and admired Flores, and let‚Äôs be clear about that. But his arrogance and bristling personality rubbed some the wrong way.

A close associate of multiple young Dolphins said the players complained to him that ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt understand dealing with men. He‚Äôs not approachable.‚Äù When Flores saw one young player in recent months, he told him: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come to my office talking about playing time.‚Äù The player had no such intentions. But multiple sources said he treated players different ways; a veteran such as Jason McCourty wouldn‚Äôt be treated with that same heavy hand. ‚ÄúHe was stern with some but joked around with some guys,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúIt was hard to read him.‚Äù ‚ñ™ One veteran complained that Flores would pass him in the halls and never say hello, never even acknowledge his presence. He asked his friend why he wanted to work in a place like this. ‚ñ™ Some players were puzzled by Flores‚Äô livid reaction to media stories. When a trainer for a Dolphins player who had sustained an injury tweeted an update on the players‚Äô injury after the 2020 season, the agent was immediately called and threatened with unspecified consequences if he didn‚Äôt delete the tweet. Why was this a big deal, when the season was over? Was there a competitive advantage lost? Other players were threatened with consequences if they revealed their injury status to reporters. When a story leaked about a potential offensive line change, Flores stormed into the meeting room and demanded to know who leaked it. Nobody said a word. But that was his primary concern that morning. ‚ñ™ As for the relationship with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, a source confirmed that angry words were exchanged during the Tennessee game, as two media outlets have reported. Flores was furious with how Tagovailoa was playing and let him know. Tagovailoa resented Flores‚Äô tone and his way of talking to people. But a very close associate of Tagovailoa said their working relationship was generally fine and that Tagovailoa doesn‚Äôt dislike Flores, joking that their dynamics were good enough for Tagovailoa to send him a Christmas card. That source said the two men could have continued working together and that the Tennessee incident wasn‚Äôt uncommon in the NFL during the heat of a poor performance.

‚ñ™ I asked someone who has worked with both Grier and Flores why Grier keeps surviving but the coaches (Adam Gase, Flores) take the fall. That source said Grier has aligned himself with Garfinkel ‚Äî who has Ross‚Äô ear ‚Äî and Grier‚Äôs ability to get along with people and be a good soldier carries weight with owner Stephen Ross. Grier also is respectful to the owner. An unidentified Dolphins person leaked to a local columnist after Flores‚Äô dismissal that Flores disrespected Ross, but I have no corroboration of that. A similar story was planted after Gase‚Äôs firing, suggesting that Gase blew off Ross. That‚Äôs important to Ross ‚Äî perhaps more important than Grier‚Äôs (and Flores‚Äô) personnel mistakes during the past three years. ‚ñ™ Ross believes that Grier has upgraded the roster significantly and is fine with overlooking the mistakes, including the selection of Charles Harris over T.J. Watt, Noah Igbinoghene over a running back and the Tagovailoa/Justin Herbert decision.

Again, Flores was involved the Igbinoghene and Tagovailoa decisions and on board with both. But it‚Äôs easier for Ross to keep the long-term employee with the pleasant demeanor ‚Äî the one who treats him royally ‚Äî than the only that‚Äôs perceived as difficult to work with. ‚ñ™ What about a CBS report that Flores preferred Herbert over Tagovailoa? Flores has told NFL people he‚Äôs a ‚Äúheight, weight, speed guy,‚Äù which led to speculation that he preferred Herbert. But a league source insisted both Grier and Flores were on board with drafting Tagovailoa, who was Ross‚Äô preference. Ross didn‚Äôt order them to pick Tagovailoa, however. ‚ñ™ Like many from the Bill Belichick coaching tree, Flores prioritized secrecy.

He called me fuming one day in 2020 when I reported ‚Äî 20 hours before game time ‚Äî about the likelihood of an offensive lineman entering the following day‚Äôs game against Arizona in the second quarter. He was livid and insisted that nugget of information could help the Cardinals strategically, though I didn‚Äôt understand why because the Cardinals knew that lineman might play. That said, he was always respectful and civil with the media. ‚ñ™ The above anecdotes might suggest that Flores‚Äô dismissal was justified. To be clear, the view here is that it wasn‚Äôt. Flores made mistakes in staff hires (especially with his 2021 offensive coordinators and offensive line coach) and he has only himself to blame for not fostering a better relationship with Grier.

But he generally maximized the talent on the roster, which is the top priority for any coach. I‚Äôm not sure how many coaches would have extracted five wins from that woeful 2019 roster, and the 19-14 record the past two seasons was at the high end of this roster‚Äôs ceiling. If Ross wants to fire him for not making the playoffs in three years or his role in bad personnel decisions or his coaching staff missteps, that‚Äôs one thing. But firing him because of communication and collaboration, the two factors Ross cited publicly? Dumbfounding. ‚ÄúThe move is stupid. I‚Äôm pissed off about it,‚Äù ESPN‚Äôs Marcus Spears said.

And ESPN‚Äôs Ryan Clark said: ‚ÄúWho the hell ya gonna get? Is he gonna motivate the locker room? Is it a quarterback whisperer? This team fought through adversity. Who is the upgrade?‚Äù",102.0,miamidolphins,t3_s1i1he,False,0.0,:MIA74:,2022-01-11T11:18:53Z,miamidolphins,-0.0001351253516699

Another NFL rumor has linked the Dolphins to Watson. But with the first Sunday of the regular season two weeks away, I‚Äôm not sure anyone could convince me that trading for Watson is a wise idea. Not unless the Texans are suddenly giving him away after spending months saying they wouldn‚Äôt trade him.

And more importantly, it would have to become undeniable that Watson is innocent of all the sexual assault allegations made against him.

I‚Äôm a big believer in innocent until proven guilty by a court of law. Not the court of public opinion, or NFL Commissioner Roger Goodall‚Äôs need to get ahead of a public relations scandal.

I‚Äôve always encouraged everyone to let the legal process take its course when an athlete gets in trouble, and Watson deserves the same reminder.

But at this time ‚Äî for this season, at this moment ‚Äî I‚Äôd rather ride the Tua Tagovailoa train and see where it takes the Dolphins in 2021.

Tagovailoa was impressive during training camp and the preseason. His accuracy, anticipation, pocket presence, and leadership indicates that he‚Äôll become a good quarterback in time if he can stay healthy.

While I believe in Tagovailoa‚Äôs ability and believe he has potential to continue improving, I wouldn‚Äôt wager anything of substance on the Dolphins‚Äô 2020 first-round pick reaching Watson‚Äôs level over the next two years, becoming one of the NFL‚Äôs elites.

Tagovailoa needs time to grow and develop, and this season ‚Äî where he‚Äôs had his playmakers upgraded and his offensive line has gained experience ‚Äî will provide that opportunity. We need to see how it plays out before pivoting in another direction.

We need to learn if Tagovailoa could potentially get Miami to its final destination, which is owner Steve Ross holding up the Lombardi Trophy after his team wins the Super Bowl.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said Watson couldn‚Äôt get the Dolphins there faster than Tagovailoa and Miami holding onto the bounty of draft picks it would likely require to trade for Watson.

Draft picks are important commodities in the NFL, especially if used correctly. But it‚Äôs the caliber of a team‚Äôs quarterback that gives them a real chance to make it the final dance.",20.0,miamidolphins,t3_pe14ag,False,0.0,:MIA74:,2021-08-29T13:48:05Z,miamidolphins,0.0206087159642099

41141,304263,304263,solidnandz,"The Miami Dolphins, on Friday, hold their final practice in front of reporters and remarkably, they were able to hold every one of them outside without any weather disruption.

After Friday, no practice ‚Äî aside from a few minutes at the start ‚Äî will be seen by the media for the remainder of the calendar year. Fans cannot attend Friday‚Äôs session or any others this year.

Seventeen takeaways from watching the 17 practices held at the team‚Äôs sparkling new training facility:

The Tua Tagovailoa on display during the Falcons‚Äô preseason game has been the one we have seen most of camp.

No, he has not been perfect, but the velocity, the pocket presence and the quickness in making decisions have been clearly better than a year ago.

Including red zone drills, Tagovailoa has thrown at least 25 touchdowns in camp, compared with just six interceptions on 11-on-11 drills.

‚ñ™ Jacoby Brissett looks like he could enter the season as the Dolphins best backup in a decade.

Though he was off target on several throws this week, Brissett has been generally sharp in practices and games, displaying impressive accuracy on intermediate and deep routes. He‚Äôs just 12-20 as an NFL starter, but the Dolphins probably have one of the five best backup quarterbacks in the league.

‚ñ™ Michael Deiter and Robert Hunt look very competent in their new positions.

What‚Äôs reassuring with Deiter is the lack of egregious errors; there was one high snap earlier in camp and one errant one Wednesday, but the job doesn‚Äôt seem too big for him. He‚Äôs very hard on himself and eager to correct mistakes, and coaches believe that ‚Äî plus his toughness and intelligence ‚Äî are assets that will help him thrive in a thinking man‚Äôs position.

Hunt has made some punishing blocks in the run game, and the Dolphins might have been on to something when they told people this past summer that that they believe he has Pro Bowl potential at guard.

‚ñ™ The young offensive line has had some hiccups but deserves time to grow.

Aside from Austin Jackson‚Äôs difficulties in the Chicago game (against strong competition), this first-team line has been competent. The question is whether it can become a strength.

We need to see over a full season whether Deiter can be a slightly better version of Ted Karras or Daniel Kilgore; whether Jackson can grow into an average (or better) NFL left tackle; whether Solomon Kindley can become the type of dominant run game mauler that Troy Aikman expects; and whether Hunt can achieve the team‚Äôs aforementioned lofty goals.

In time, though perhaps not immediately, we will see whether Liam Eichenberg‚Äôs streak of going 2.5 seasons at Notre Dame without permitting a sack was a harbinger of what he can become as a pro. At the very least, he‚Äôs a skilled technician. But he might come off the bench initially.

Albert Wilson‚Äôs first 10 days of camp were the best I‚Äôve seen from a Dolphins skill position player in the past decade.

Wilson was a veritable reincarnation of Tyreek Hill, darting past defenders to catch bombs and slithering through the secondary for yards after catch. The Dolphins hope that type of production resumes in the opener after he is fully healed from a minor injury that has kept him sidelined recently.

‚ñ™ Rookie wide receiver Jaylen Waddle is more than just a weapon on screens and deep threats.

Waddle‚Äôs ability to make difficult catches ‚Äî whether rising in the air or diving on the ground ‚Äî has been one of the revelations of camp, though not surprising to Alabama fans. Coaches have marveled at his ability to stop on a dime and change directions, leaving defenders flummoxed.

‚ñ™ Salvon Ahmed has joined Zach Sieler and Nik Needham as the best young scrap heap pickups of this regime.

Even beyond Ahmed‚Äôs potential as a runner (4.3 yards per carry last season), this team is going to get a handful of big passing plays this season when Ahmed is defended by a linebacker. The most successful ones in camp and games have been sideline routes.

‚ñ™ Receiver Lynn Bowden Jr. didn‚Äôt do enough to incentive the Dolphins to keep him available this season.

Though an MRI on his hamstring revealed no tear, the Dolphins ended hopes of him playing this season by placing him on injured reserve. To play this season, he would need to be subjected to waivers ‚Äî which the Dolphins implied they won‚Äôt do.. The Dolphins could have waited until Sept. 2 to place him on injured reserve, making him eligible to return in Week 4, but obviously weren‚Äôt interested in doing that.

‚ñ™ One of these young receivers that won‚Äôt fit on the Dolphins‚Äô 53 will have NFL success elsewhere.

That‚Äôs no fault of the Dolphins, who simply can‚Äôt keep more than six or seven. But Kirk Merritt looks like a different player in Year 2 ‚Äî he could develop into a No. 4 or 5 NFL receiver ‚Äî and Robert Foster (who was released injured) has caught the deep ball as well as anyone in camp (along with Wilson and released receiver Isaiah Ford).

It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if the Dolphins call Foster or Ford if they have injuries at receiver later this season. And while odds are against Merritt making the 53, the Dolphins must hope they can sneak him onto the practice squad.

‚ñ™ Myles Gaskin deserves some respect.

Metrics sites that rank the Dolphins‚Äô running backs consistently place them in the bottom three. But Gaskin has built on a breakout season with an impressive training camp, showing burst and toughness as a runner and elusiveness as a receiver.

Nobody expects him to be a top-third of the league running back, but maybe he shouldn‚Äôt be considered a bottom-third back, either.

‚ñ™ The 2020 breakout of Andrew Van Ginkel was not an aberration.

This is an ascending, disruptive player who can help in a lot of ways ‚Äî against the run, as a pass rusher, in coverage, forcing turnovers, knocking down passes. The decision to release Kyle Van Noy makes more sense after seeing more of Van Ginkel.

‚ñ™ Jevon Holland has the type of Pro Bowl ceiling that the Dolphins haven‚Äôt had at the position beyond Reshad Jones.

Creating turnovers is a coveted gift, and Holland‚Äôs four interceptions in camp reinforced a skill he flashed at Oregon, where he had nine interceptions in two seasons.

Once the coaches are confident enough in his knowledge of the defense and ability to make presnap calls, he will surpass Jason McCourty and join underrated Eric Rowe to form a safety combo that could rank among the league‚Äôs top 10. For now, he‚Äôs out with an injury that doesn‚Äôt appear serious.

‚ñ™ If Byron Jones or Xavien Howard is injured, Needham looks like the best option at boundary cornerback.

Needham has been largely effective on the boundary and in the slot. He made a bunch of plays this week and seems a better option than Noah Igbinoghene (uneven camp) and McCourty, whose advanced age (34) makes him a better fit at safety.

‚ñ™ The Dolphins‚Äô best free agent move on defense was signing former Patriots defensive lineman Adam Butler.

Miami badly needed another skilled rotational pass rusher in its front seven, and Butler has a proven track record of that. What‚Äôs more, he‚Äôs the quintessential team guy, eager to help teammates and comfortable with being a backup.

‚ñ™ Stopping the run remains the biggest concern.

Linebacker Benardrick McKinney‚Äôs addition will help, and behemoth defensive tackle Raekwon Davis should be better in his first full season as a starter. But it‚Äôs unclear if the Dolphins will be anything more than mediocre against the run.

If the Dolphins could become a top 10 team against the run, their strong secondary could further feast on teams on second or third and long.

And the pass rush, on paper, seems good enough with Emmanuel Ogbah, Van Noy, Butler, Jerome Baker (seven sacks last season) and Jaelan Phillips, if he‚Äôs as good as everyone expects him to be.

‚ñ™ Ogbah has made a case to get the contract extension that agent Drew Rosenhaus covets.

Ogbah ‚Äî due to make $7.5 million this season ‚Äî has consistently generated pass rush in camp, including three would-be sacks of Matt Ryan during a 10-minute stretch of a Falcons-Dolphins practice. The sense is that the Dolphins are interested in an extension; the question is whether the parties can agree to terms.

‚ñ™ If I‚Äôm in a fantasy league (and I‚Äôm not), I would be eyeing Mike Gesicki.

Gesicki has now thoroughly justified Adam Gase‚Äôs suggestion that the Dolphins select him ahead of Dallas Goedert, and aside from Travis Kelce and Darren Waller, there‚Äôs no tight end in the league who‚Äôs clearly better than Gesicki as a receiver.

Adam Shaheen‚Äôs ability to get open in the red zone suggests he will match or exceed last season‚Äôs three touchdown catches, and Hunter Long made two catches for sizable gains on Thursday.",50.0,miamidolphins,t3_pc7s38,False,0.0,:MIA74:,2021-08-26T15:31:07Z,miamidolphins,0.0087029571755516

41146,304269,304269,solidnandz,"The Dolphins are privately optimistic that first-team receivers DeVante Parker and Will Fuller will be healthy enough for the start of the regular season, though Fuller would not be available until Week 2 because of a 2020 NFL suspension.

But there‚Äôs less certainty regarding several other players.

Receiver Lynn Bowden Jr. sustained a strained hamstring during Thursday‚Äôs practice, and that type of injury could sideline a player for a few weeks, depending on how quickly he heals. An MRI revealed no structural damage or tear, according to a source.

Receiver Isaiah Ford, a perpetual bubble player who has had a good camp, is nursing what an associate identified as a leg injury. He hasn‚Äôt been on the field this week.

Tight end/H-back Cethan Carter, Miami‚Äôs first free agent signing in March, has been sidelined with a sprained knee sustained in the preseason game against Chicago. He‚Äôs expected back in a week or two, according to a source.

Safety Brandon Jones is working his way back from an ankle injury, and though he hasn‚Äôt had a severe limp, the team is being cautious.

Linebacker Vince Biegel ‚Äî after tearing his left Achilles tendon last summer ‚Äî is now nursing a foot injury on his right leg. He ditched his walking boot this week but remains out indefinitely.

Bowden, Carter, Ford, Jones and Biegel could become options to start the regular season on injured reserve if they don‚Äôt get back to 100 percent in the next two weeks, though there‚Äôs hope at least a couple will.

The NFL last season began permitting teams to place an unlimited number of players on IR after preseason ends and to remove an unlimited number of players after missing a minimum of only three games.

That rule will continue this season, and it could help the Dolphins manage their roster, with difficult decisions looming at several positions before teams must cut to 53 players on Aug. 31.

For example, if Bowden isn‚Äôt ready to start the season on time, that could compel the Dolphins to keep Jakeem Grant instead of possibly trading him.

But keep in mind that only players on the 53-player roster after Sept. 1 are eligible to be designated for return from IR or the non-football injury list. So any injured players must start the year on the 53 and then moved to IR, allowing the Dolphins to re-sign other players to fill empty spots on the 53.

Previously, a team had only two IR-return designations it could use in a season and a player was required to miss a minimum of eight weeks.

There is some good news on the injury front:

Fuller‚Äôs lower-body injury, which has sidelined him for three weeks, is not serious, a source reiterated. He has been seen walking on the field ‚Äî and riding the exercise bike ‚Äî without apparent discomfort. The Dolphins expect him to play in Week 2 after serving an NFL suspension in Week 1.

Parker, who has a history of soft tissue issues, should be fine for the opener barring any sort of health setback, according to a team official. The Dolphins have always been careful with Parker.

Though receiver Albert Wilson has missed more than a week of camp, he was walking around the field Thursday, throwing the football in the air and catching it. His issue is not at all serious, according to a source.

The Dolphins have cleared receiver Preston Williams to do individual drills, and soon he will be permitted to do team drills. He said there‚Äôs no discomfort at all in his surgically-repaired foot.

Cornerback Nik Needham, who was carted off Thursday before walking into the facility under his own power, is OK. His issue on Thursday was cramping, according to a source.

Cornerback Noah Igbinoghene ‚Äî who missed practice this week ‚Äî has been in concussion protocol, according to a source, but should be back in the coming days.

Tight end Hunter Long resumed practicing with a brace on his left knee and caught several passes. The fact Long is back so quickly after being carted off Aug. 3 is really encouraging.

Linebacker Sam Eguavoen, battling for a roster spot, is expected to come off the COVID-19 list within a week or two.

Injury prone?  He had a outlier fluke injury where pressure was placed on many parts of the body in the perfect positions to combine for a perfect storm to cause the hip injury. His other minor injuries kept him out of one total game. One. 

Alabama‚Äôs O-line had insane talent individually, but played like absolute dogshit as a unit. Why? I have no clue. But that was the reason he was running for his life so much. Bama‚Äôs O-line last season with Mac Jones was 10X better as a group than the previous year.

He absolutely has the skill set and anyone with football knowledge knows it. People way smarter than you and I. Still TBD if he uses it fully of course.

He had an absolute fluke of a hip injury, which combined with COVID dealt him one of the shittiest deals as a rookie QB as he had no training camps, no preseason, etc. Not to mention the cast he was working with was a mostly rookie O-line and a subpar WR group, especially after PW went down and the other injuries that occurred.",7.0,miamidolphins,t3_oh4pmp,False,0.0,:MIA66:,2021-07-10T07:53:40Z,miamidolphins,-0.0013170419120454
