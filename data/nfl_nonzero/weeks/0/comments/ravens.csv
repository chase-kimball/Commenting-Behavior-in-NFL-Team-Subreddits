4702,23494,23494,Blacramento,"You right that the numbers ain't terribly impressive, but I guess I'm moreso looking at it in the sense of expectations vs production, as well as the Ravens history of drafting WRs who never really take the next step we want them to. In those two aspects, Duv has been certainly a successful draft selection.

Additionally, the conversation around him after the draft is that he was a speedy WR who would get lots of YAC, but with questionable hands. The aforementioned speed has been on display, especially on the return game, but when it comes to hands, I was surprised to find that:

- In each of his two seasons, he had the highest catch % of any Ravens WR that year (minimum 25 targets)
- Stupidly tiny sample size, I know, but he actually has the 2nd highest career catch % of any WR in Ravens history (only 1.3% behind Proche, who has only 23 career targets to Duv's 73)

I realize that we, as Ravens fans, have a tendency to want every mid-late round/UDFA WR to be the next big thing (Tim White, Quincy Adeboyejo, Jaleel Scott, etc.) but I think Duv has proven that he has the ability to take that next step and continue improving and be an ideal WR3 behind Hollywood/Bateman.

And that's not even to speak of his potential in the running game, which I feel the Ravens have been horribly under-utilizing. If they incorporate more run plays for him, I believe that would add a really strong additional dimension to the offense.",3.0,nfl,t3_txm3c5,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-04-06T14:34:55Z,ravens,0.0768342912270519

The pocket breaks down, Tom Brady is running, looking for something, anything. He sees Edelman, completely unable to get separation, slowed down from his broken foot and his skipped breakfast of PEDs. He sees Gronk running the wrong route, not looking his direction, his robotic arm has fallen off. Chris Hogan is dead. He looks deep down the field and sees double coverage, but a glimmer of hope. One last spark of hope for humanity. He throws deep. Its going to the back corner, but the coverage is too tight, there is too much traffic, the ball is too high, there is no way he is going to connect, no mere mortal could bring this ball in... Suddenly we see the majestic hands of our lord and savior JOSH GORDON slowly rise up. The light blazing around his body is so bright it causes everyone in the stadium to shield their eyes. He is in the air for what seems like minutes, slowly rising, rising, rising. He makes the perfect one handed catch, He keeps rising. He is 20 feet above the goalposts now. The clouds open up and a single beam of sunlight falls to the field as JOSH GORDON does a forward flip and comes slamming down to the ground in a marvel-like superhero landing. The shock-wave from his landing causes the entire opposing team to fall to the ground with CTE. Miraculously, everyone on the Patriots is unharmed, Tom Brady is young again, Edelman no longer needs PEDs, and Hogan is still dead on the field. The crowd goes wild. The Patriots win. JOSH GORDON ascends back into the heavens as a god. Bill Belichick later comments ""“Well, umm…he’s a good player.

Love Josh Bynes, one of my all-time favorite Ravens.

I thought it was really cool that in his first and only season with the Bengals, he was one of their team captains which speaks to his awesomeness.

Honestly with LJ out, I hope we promote him to the active roster in place of Welch.

I think there is something to be said about our game planning last season that was drastically different than the previous two. Roman had to over-simplify the playbook when he lost RB1, 2, and 3. This means you can't do tricky mesh point shit with play action, which is where Lamar shines the most. 

On top of that, last year during camp, Roman talked about how we're trying to move Lamar under center more. So Lamar is doing a newish thing, the playbook is simplified, and the OL was terrible. 

There were a lot of factors here, but I think the only true answer is a combination of the above, along with ""Lamar is a very instinctive football player.

7179,37107,37107,Chc36,"""injury issues"" - the one injury he's had in his career that knocked out for the rest of the season. 

Otherwise, yes, last year was a down year - but confounded by the fact that the Ravens had an atrocious O-Line, starting CB's who had no business being on an NFL roster - leading to shootouts, a retirement home of RB castoffs and hasbeens, and Hollywood Brown's inability to catch a football. Lamar and Andrews were the only competent part of the team. Lamar's strength has always been to make teams afraid of the run which opens up opportunities for less than stellar offensive weapons. A perfect storm of injuries and poor offensive adjustment led to a Ravens team unable to run the football effectively, which in turn forced Lamar to try and make plays with his arms, but without any protection and no playmakers to throw the ball to. 

Does he have weaknesses? Absolutely, he needs to make better pre-snap reads, adjust protections, etc. Would I rather have Bridgewater starting for my team? God no, are there 10 other QB's in the league I'd rather have? Also no. Are there 5 other QB's I'd rather have? Probably, but not even that is 100%.

He's been pressured 95 times this year, he was 102 all last year. I know you pulled all those stats from PFR so you'll probably say his overall pressure rating is down, but that's because he is being forced to do everything on his own. The O-Line is the worst that he's ever had and the senior center of a backfield can't make anything happen that isn't schemed. No one is afraid of the Ravens running game right now so teams and plan around just stopping Lamar, and the way to currently stop him is to blitz the shit out of him. Pressure rate is lower because he has to throw the ball more and because teams know he's going to throw they're better prepared. Can he get better, absolutely - the blitz is beatable, but he doesn't trust his line and his mechanics have regressed because he needs to play hero ball all the time.

8879,51108,51108,DarkPriestScorpius,"Since we are talking about Jerry Rice, here is an old post that went into details about his training schedules:

https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/g16crr/jerry_rices_workout_routine_was_so_physical_and/

Here are some interesting observation about Jerry Rice's workout routine and how he managed to keep himself in shape for so long:

https://jamesclear.com/jerry-rice

http://thegameology.blogspot.com/2010/11/game-training-compilation-of-jerry.html

This short excerpt from Talent is Overrated (audiobook) explains Rice’s typical training schedule.

""In team workouts he was famous for his hustle; while many receivers would trot back to the quarterback after catching a pass, Rice would sprint to the end zone after each reception. He would typically continue practicing long after the rest of the team had gone home. Most remarkable were his six-days-a-week off-season workouts, which he conducted entirely on his own. Mornings were devoted to cardiovascular work, running a hilly five-mile trail; he would reportedly run ten forty-meter wind sprints up the steepest part. In the afternoons he did equally strenuous weight training. These workouts became legendary as the most demanding in the league, and other players would sometimes join Rice just to see what it was like. Some of them got sick before the day was over"".

From Outside Magazine:

""Rice's six-day-a-week workout is divided into two parts: two hours of cardiovascular work in the morning and three hours of strength training each afternoon. Early in the off-season, the a.m. segment consists of a five-mile trail run near San Carlos on a torturous course called, simply, The Hill. But since five vertical miles can hardly be considered a workout, he pauses on the steepest section to do a series of ten 40-meter uphill sprints. As the season approaches, however, Rice knows it's time to start conserving energy — so he forgoes The Hill and instead merely does a couple of sprints: six 100-yarders, six 80s, six 60s, six 40s, six 20s, and 16 tens, with no rest between sprints and just two and a half minutes between sets.

For the p.m. sessions he alternates between upper-body and lower-body days. But no matter which half of his body he's working on, the volume is always the same: three sets of ten reps of 21 different exercises. Yes, your calculator's right: That's 630 repetitions a day"".

From the New York Times:

""Tiny puddles begin to form on the track at Menlo College in Atherton, about 20 miles south of San Francisco, and the participants in Rice's workout -- one of them a reporter -- step through them while doing 20 minutes of stretching and warm-ups. Leading the workout is Rice's trainer, Raymond Farris, who has worked with Rice for nine years and helped him become the hardest working player in the league and arguably the best receiver ever in the National Football League…""

""After the warm-ups, the workout shifts to the football field, where Farris has set up a series of cones for the running exercises. The sprints are called ""accelerators."" One cone is set up 20 yards downfield and the runners build up steam until they reach the cone. The group then sprints full speed for 60 yards until the next cone, which is the signal to downshift for 20 yards. Rice eventually does 14 of these, each one in perfect form, each one at 100 percent, with no rest in between…

Usually the group will run for another hour or so, scampering up hills, sprinting through agility drills. They also do ""pyramids,"" which are full-speed sprints for 100 yards, then 90 yards, then 80, all the way down to 20…""",1.0,nfl,t3_w1bb44,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-07-17T12:26:08Z,ravens,0.0007463954911064

8881,51121,51121,DarkPriestScorpius,"Congratulations to the 49ers for an amazing win.

However, Even if the 49ers win the Superbowl, I would still move on from Jimmy G in the offseason. 

They have a Superbowl caliber roster that just need a good quarterback who can make the game easier for the entire team. 

I am not even talking about a Brady or Mahomes, just a QB who can make smart decisions and not give the game away with turnovers

The amount of pressure that is put on the defense and running game to consistently make plays is insane.

Seriously, Jimmy should have had 3 or 4 interceptions if the Packers defenders had played the ball instead of going after the receiver.

Aikman even talked about how the Packers could have had 2 pick six if the defender had just tracked the ball when Jimmy threw it

Jimmy constantly makes bad decisions trying to force the ball to receivers who are covered when there is no need to. 

It is a pattern of behavior that keep happening repeatedly. 

At this point, the 49ers are scheming around Jimmy instead being able to rely on him.

We saw the same thing during the 2019 playoffs against the Vikings, Packers, and Chiefs.

I would thank Jimmy for what he has done for the team but in the end, it would be nice to be able to rely on a QB for the entire game instead of hoping that the defense can shut down other top tier QB all the time.

8884,51156,51156,DarkPriestScorpius,"Actually, for the Chiefs, the correct answer would be Jim Tyrer.

Tyrer signed with the American Football League's Dallas Texans in 1961. He played 13 years with that franchise (180 consecutive games), which became the Kansas City Chiefs in 1963, helping set the standard for his position at left offensive tackle. His 14th and final season was with the Washington Redskins under head coach George Allen, who preferred veteran players.

In his career, he racked up these accolades:

8× All-AFL (1962–1969)

7× AFL All-Star (1962–1966, 1968, 1969)

2× Pro Bowl (1970, 1971)

First-team All-Pro (1970)

3× AFL champion (1962, 1966, 1969)

Super Bowl champion (IV)

AFL All-Time Team

Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Fame

He is widely considered to have been the greatest player in AFL history.

Unfortunately, the fact that he shot and killed his wife and then committed suicide guaranteed that he will never be inducted into the HOF.

I believe that he suffered severe depression and mental problems that were never addressed as a result of playing football which led him to commit the murder-suicide.",13.0,nfl,t3_ovupw8,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2021-08-01T14:48:35Z,ravens,-0.1363696079014696
8885,51168,51168,DarkPriestScorpius,"Honestly, it is genuinely surreal that Daniel Snyder isn't the worst owner that Washington had.

Despite all the loathsome things that Snyder has done, the sheer racism of George Preston Marshall was unmatched among NFL owners.

There is a reason why the JFK Administration had to threaten Marshall with the loss of his stadium to get him to allow black players on his team.

However, not to be outdone by all the racist things he did while he was alive, he made sure that his hated of black people lived on in death:

https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/249119/dead-man-giving/

""And, as a coup de grâce, Marshall’s last will and testament was racist.

Marshall stipulated in his will that he wanted his money to go toward the establishment of the Redskins Foundation, and that the group was charged with dedicating all proceeds to the betterment of “health, education and welfare” of children in the Washington area.

All well and good. But Marshall added a caveat that no money from his foundation would ever go toward “any purpose which supports the principle of racial integration in any form.”

A local furor developed when word of the clause got out. A multidenominational group of area pastors, priests, and rabbis formed to publicly denounce the will as “onerous and racist.” Even Marshall’s kinfolk were appalled.

“It was so absolutely ridiculous that he put it in there, but he did put it in,” says Jordan Wright, Marshall’s granddaughter and a Northern Virginia resident. “But with the family, when we saw that, it was all, ‘Egads! Why did he put that in?’ It was never acceptable to anybody in the family.”

Marshall’s pro-segregation verbiage wasn’t acceptable to anybody in the legal system, either.

“That clause got thrown out by the courts,” says Wright. “It’s just not legal to say something like that in a will.”

So when the foundation was established, in 1972, it began giving out grants based on Marshall’s first wish—the one about promoting the health, education, and welfare of local children—while ignoring his second. And over the past three-plus decades, the group (which changed its name to the George Preston Marshall Foundation after severing all ties to the football team) has grown into quite a benevolent force, quietly doling out millions of dollars to all sorts of worthy kids’ causes.",137.0,nfl,t3_ojf1e0,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2021-07-13T09:27:24Z,ravens,0.0592161793480339

I can't fault Browns fans for hating him at face value for moving the team and then watching him win a super bowl in Baltimore. 2 wrongs don't make a right and Ravens fans justifying it with the Colts stuff is irrelevant.  
  
Having said that, here's why Art Modell is brought up in HOF talks:  
  
He's the person most responsible for the marriage of primetime TV and the NFL by spearheading Monday Night Football, probably the NFL's most iconic game aside from the Super Bowl. He worked in TV, advertising and PR in his 20's and 30's and was a visionary in how he saw the NFL as a TV program. So, this whole 24-hour news cycle revolving around the NFL really got started with Modell getting a prime time TV slot.

2010 - Ravens were up 21-7 against the Steelers, then Ray Rice fumbled, then Joe overthrew Heap and then AB's helmet catch on 3rd and 21

2011 - The filling of the shit sandwich between Evans and Cundiff was Harbaugh forgetting he had a timeout left.

2014 - The 2 Patriots trick plays, Matt Elam forgetting to tackle and Torrey Smith not fighting for the deep ball that got picked.

The Ravens never really seemed in the game in 2019 and it's a testament to Lamar and a great matchup on defense that the Ravens even beat the Titans in 2020. Losing to the Bills the following week was disappointing, but that o-line was just so bad.

Not having a salary cap sucks ass and it seems like they have to work so hard just to have a couple years of a window to be competitive. Then, when they finally build a roster, are they going to be gun shy on resigning the players to sustain the thing or make a dumb ass decision to resign the wrong guy like Chris Davis?

The last time the Orioles entered a rebuild they at least had players like Brian Roberts, Nick Markakis and Melvin Mora before they struck gold with the Bedard trade.

45:30 - Adam Vinateri's FG hits the crossbar and bounces over. 3 - 9 Colts

1:12:55 - Ray Lewis tips another INT away from Ed Reed. 3 - 12 Colts

1:21:05 - There's a sequence of 3 plays had 2 penalties and a no call that stalled a Ravens drive   
in Colts territory. Todd Heap had a false start, then Ogden had a phantom holding   
call and then the Colts gang tackled Derrick Mason after the whistle that wasn't   
called. 3 - 12 Colts

1:27:55 - Ed Reed picked Peyton again and while he was lateraling the ball to Chris McAlister, the refs called the play dead thinking he was out of bounds, but he wasn't. 6 - 12 Colts

1:32:35 - McNair stares down, then throws behind his receiver for a pick. 6 - 12 Colts

&#x200B;

19214,116276,116276,Nlegan,"The issue of gun violence in America is an extremely convoluted problem that lacks anything but a simple answer. To start things off, there are around 400 million weapons in circulation backed by a federal amendment. If I had a chance to clap my hands and make all 400 million weapons disappear i would, but the world doesn't work like that. If you want to be realistic about things, you would have to...

A. institute a federal buy back program so that gun owners have the option to return their weapons.

B. Increase the age limit of purchasing specific firearms.

C. overhaul the background and mental health check system for obtaining firearms.

D. Actually fund Mental health programs, and healthcare in general, instead of talking about it.

E. make slow and methodical changes to the constitution so in the future our government hopefully questions what it means to ""have the right to bear arms""

F. vote

Miscellaneous Things that i want to mention.

- I don't think that a gun buy back program is going to be effective for various reasons but i think we should try it

- There's more to go into detail for each point but its just a summary.

- The way that media conglomerates report news is harmful to society. Always Doom and gloom just to make profit.

- The issue of gun control is always going to be a long term issue with no viable short term solution.

- Ideally you'd want to limit the terms on congressman as well as do something about their ""campaign contributions"" but good luck getting congress to pass laws that give them less money, influence etc.

Thanks for reading up to this point, please let me know what any of you guys think. There's no right or wrong answers.

The dude was absolutely dominant in lacrosse.  These highlights often look rather easy, he's just running from behind goal, past his defender, and shoveling it in, right?  Well, many of the guys defending him in this video are among the very best defensemen in NCAA, and his athleticism is making them look slow in comparison.  He has really good lateral quickness and burst, and his ability to shoot the ball from all sorts of release points and with different styles (shovel shots, or backhand, are more difficult than they look) speak to his stick skills (not that those matters to football, but still).


Being able to make those kind of dodges consistently also speaks to his ability to read a defense, as he is able to identify very well when the slide won't be there to stop him.  That cerebral playing style will translate well to any sport.",21.0,nfl,t3_tycx5i,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-04-07T11:32:51Z,ravens,0.0726646575831498

Eli doesn't deserve to sniff the HoF and is getting in based on his last name/the Pats dynasty. Rookie Russ and Rookie Big Ben were carried just as hard if not harder than any other name on that list.

No one in the world is taking Rex over Lamar obviously. All I'm saying is the league's more flush with QB talent than at any point in it's history. If Lamar's only willing to take the absolute highest APY in the league while it's 100% guaranteed and there's 0 cheap rookie years to spread it out over than I'm probably gonna get as many years as I can out of him and then try to get a fucking haul.

* Manning(who didn't sign for top of the league APY and is a top 5 QB of all time). 

* Newton and Garoppolo's deals were top of the market APY but had a rookie year to spread it out over. 

* Stafford wasn't even top 10 in APY and had a banger of a deal for the Rams due to it being traded with money left in Detroit.

* Alex Smith was averaging 9 mill APY. Him and Foles were on opposite sides but both were paired with a rookie where the entirety of the QB room was making below market average by a good bit.

Ryan is the major argument you can make a Super Bowl with a top of the league QB salary. Ryan played out of his mind that year(as did Peyton in 2013) but the fact is the overwhelming majority(like 80%) of teams to make a SB in the past decade had a steal of a QB contract.

31681,178305,178305,ZombieFeedback,"So I used to work at a certain worldwide leader in sports. Never on-air, I did production behind the scenes, but I existed in that world for a few years, talked with and prepped for a variety of hosts regularly, you name it, I did it.

You ask what his deal is, and I'll tell you simply: Laziness. Garbage hot takes are easy because you just hate on whatever the team does, every answer is the wrong answer, and unlike being the homer who loves every thing the team does, being the contrarian grants you that air of intelligence that comes from being a self-styled ""free thinker going against the grain."" 

On top of that, it is perfect social media fuel. If you post a thoughtful breakdown, you'll get maybe a couple dozen responses. Post something insane and incendiary, and you'll get hundreds, maybe thousands. Look at r/nfl on an average day tell me the ratio of insightful analysis and well thought-out breakdowns versus incendiary garbage hot takes and clickbait quotes taken out of context. Football Outsiders, one of the pioneers of modern football analytics, only has 75,000 followers on Twitter, while First Take, the show of shows when it comes to Sports Shouting nonsense, has over 1.7 million. I know some folks here have mixed feelings about him, but Brett Kollmann is one of the single best people on youtube when it comes to breaking football down in an understandable, digestible way for most fans. He only has about 100k followers. Skip ""Tim Tebow is more clutch than Tom Brady"" Bayless? 3.2 million. The algorithm *loves* divisive, incendiary bullshit way more than it loves quality analysis.

In the world of radio, it also has the luxury of doing your job for you. If I'm a host on 105.7 and all I say that all star player contracts take time, Lamar clearly wants to be in Baltimore, and the Ravens aren't stupid enough to let a generational talent walk away, I'll get maybe five callers, one of which is probably a racist idiot you're not going to put on air in case he lets an N-bomb slip. The other four will be a quick simple ""Love the show, good thoughts, keep it up."" A nice pat on the back but not really content. But if I'm a host and I say that Lamar is an idiot for not signing and not having an agent, the Ravens should bench him for Huntley until he learns his lesson, and they should let him walk if he doesn't want veteran minimum, I will get dozens of callers, all of whom are going to want to rip into my terrible idiot take. Let each of them rant for two minutes, and boom, I just filled thirty minutes of my four-hour show with angry callers doing my job for me. I just sit back, thank them for calling, then give a short response that basically boils down to reiterating my point. Easy money. (Disclaimer, I haven't really listened to 105.7 in a while, so idk if JLC makes heavy use of calls, I just know that more than a few of the hosts I worked with whenever I did radio used this exact format. Not going to name names, but multiple hosts would basically schedule a segment as ""I'm going to say something that'll get the lines buzzing, and let them talk for me."")

This shit is why I left the industry. I adored getting to run shows with former coaches, listen to them break down the Xs and Os, teaching me and our audience the same way they used to teach their players. *That* is the good stuff. But it's time consuming, expensive, and in the algorithmically-driven world of modern media, less efficient than shouting a hot take into a microphone and letting people get mad about it. I don't know La Canfora, and I haven't worked with him, so I can't say for 100% sure if this is the guy he is and this is what he's doing. But the handful of times I've listened to him, it sure as hell sounds like it.

**TL;DR** as someone with industry experience, I'd put good money on a mix of Jason playing the social media game - a game that, frankly, he's beating me at by having me write this long post about him in the first place - and wanting to take the path of least resistance to sign-off time.

Brandon Stephens is continuing to struggle. I really liked him in the draft and last year, but he's had a really rough preseason.

Personally this is why I want to see Badie get some snaps with the ones this week.

If you think any combination of those four players can give you 80% of what Chuck does, the cruel math of the cap makes him expendable, especially since A. two of those names are on rookie contracts that are basically fully guaranteed, B. One is a rookie and another is a sophomore, so if you're confident they'll hit 80% in the next year or two, very realistic they'll hit 100% before long, and C.

They have a need for a strong safety, Chuck will either be traded or released due to redundancy, and Wink has a notoriously complex scheme that Chuck not only understands extremely well, but has shown an ability to execute and run as the green dot player for multiple successful seasons.

Better than I expected, worse than I hoped. He's not going to be Orlando Brown, starting the majority of games successfully in his rookie year, he needs time. We knew that when we took him though, and he doesn't look as bad as I thought he might.

> How concerned should we be at this point with our OL

LT: uneasy. James is going to sit around average at best if preseason is anything to judge by, probably a bit below. That's an upgrade from Villanueva, but it's still not great. Ronnie will be an upgrade once he returns even if he's a shell of himself.

LG: curious. I liked Cleveland last year, but reportedly Ben Powers has the lead. Powers has been inconsistent in his career, but it'd be hardly unprecedented for a mid round lineman to take a few years to develop. I imagine next week will weigh heavily on it 

C: TBD. Linderbaum is reportedly going to play next week. We haven't seen him yet so we don't know.

RG: good. Zeitler has the position locked down.

RT: comfortable. We wouldn't have paid Morgan Moses if we didn't think he'd be a big upgrade given Mekari was no slouch last year.

31705,178342,178342,ZombieFeedback,"Super early, super overreacting thoughts:

**STOCK UP**

* Isaiah Likely. Y'know I didn't think my opinion of Isaiah Likely could get any higher than it already was, but here we are. It should not be legal to be this hyped about a fourth-round rookie who's probably third on the depth chart behind Mandrews and Boyle. *Maybe* TE2 depending on how coaches feel about Boyle right now, but they're basically very different specialists who are about equal, and a tie goes to the veteran on the depth chart most of the time. Whatever the case, did you know that if you put $20 on Likely winning ORotY, you'd get $1,500 if he wins? I'm not saying he's going to win it, but I *am* saying that's a bet I'm definitely open to taking given A. how amazing he looks, and B. how many targets he is likely - hehe - to get given how thin we are after Bateman and Andrews.
* Odafe Oweh. While he didn't make any splash plays, something I saw with Oweh's limited snaps tonight was that he's getting double-teamed pretty regularly. I want to see if this changes once we're into the regular season and guys like Houston and Calais are on the line alongside him, because if he's already requiring a double-team even for first-team blockers, that's a situation that gets me very excited because of just how much pressure that puts on every single other blocker. Now imagine how things will get once Ojabo is back.
* Malik Harrison. I'm not a huge fan of him in pass coverage, but Malik looks excellent against the run. That's not ideal, you want a guy to be able to play the pass in today's NFL, but I'll take a good two-down linebacker out of a third-round pick, especially given Pittsburgh and Cleveland are both going to rely a lot on the run.
* Tyler Huntley. No, he's not replacing Lamar Jackson. Let me tackle that right away because that was somehow a real honest-to-god talking point around here for like two months in the offseason. That said, we all saw last year why having a backup you have faith in is important, and Huntley looks much improved. He still has his flaws, but he looks like a much better guy than our end-of-year starter last season. Ideally he never takes the field because Lamar plays all 17 games, but if Lamar does miss time, it might not be the death sentence it was last year.
* Travis Jones. Jones reportedly just has a hyperextension, not a tear. Obviously not good, but probably the best case given the circumstances. He'll be out for the remainder of preseaosn but should be back for most of the regular season. Which is good, because he looks like he's going to kill it. You cannot understate just how valuable interior disruption is, anyone else here who remembers Haloti Ngata knows just how insane a guy who can consistently cause problems up the middle is for any offense. I don't know if Travis will be as good as Haloti was, but I do feel confident that he's going to be very good.
* Pepe Williams. Marlo and Peters have CB1 and CB2 on-lock, but if he has another good week, I think you can make the case that Pepe Silvia has earned CB3 honors as a rookie. It's hard to judge without all-22 film because of how much of a corner's job happens outside of the TV camera angles, but from what I did see, he has been the clear gold medal between himself, Stephens, and Fuller for two straight games. Will it last into the regular season? I dunno, but I do know that he's playing better than any other CB on the roster right now.
* Tyler Badie. I want to see this kid get some first-team reps. I don't want him to be our week one starter, but you use RBs in a rotation anyway, so RB2 and RB3 see action even with a fully healthy starter, and he has looked excellent against the second and third teams. Next time Mike Davis needs a breather, don't put in Justice Hill, put in Tyler Badie. If nothing else, we need to go into the regular season knowing whether it's him killing it against glorified college ball late in the preseason or if it's something that will translate to NFL starters.
* Daniel Faalele. I don't think he's ready to start any time this year. He still has a lot of flaws that come from being a giant *and* being a raw, unrefined project. That said, he's further along than I expected him to be. Again, he's having trouble, he's getting beat at times, but it's not as bad as I expected. (Disclaimer, I never played OL and I know a *lot* of good OL play comes down to intricate handfighting and footwork that's hard to pick out if you're not trained in it, so there is a decent chance I'm missing the finer points of his play. From my perspective though it looked solid-ish.) Also glad that he dodged the bullet with the injury.

**STOCK DOWN**

* Ju'Wuan James. Is he an upgrade from Villanueva? Yes. Will Ronnie Stanley be an upgrade even if he's a shell of his former self? Probably. James looked solid-but-unspectacular last week. This week he downgraded to somewhere between average and below average. Again, we won games with worse last year, but this line will get an upgrade the instant Ronnie steps back onto the field.
* Tyre Phillips. He's a depth lineman and we're in trouble if he has to start. At least at tackle anyway, I think he's a respectable guard. Outside though, it's ugly. Penalties, and lost matchups.
* Interior run defense. Letting Brandon Williams walk made sense. He will be 34 come playoff time, and far less intense positions break down far earlier. The decline already started last year, I get it. That said, he was still a big factor in the run game, and at least tonight, it looked like we're missing that. We weren't abysmal against the run, we held them to three through most of the game, but the ground game looked like it had more life than it usually does against a Ravens defense. Time will tell if that's just because of the lack of veterans in the front seven like Calais.
* Brandon Stephens. I like Brandon Stephens, but this was not a game you want if you're him. Rough night in coverage coupled with some bonehead PI penalties.

**REPLY HAZY, TRY AGAIN LATER**

* Undrafted WRs. After a great game against Tennessee, Shemar Bridges came back down to earth with a quiet game tonight, one reception for eight yards. Raleigh Webb bounced back from an unremarkable week one with 46 yards and a TD, but against backups. Makai Polk made a nice catch, but on that same catch he slipped and fell, where if he kept his footing and ran with it, good chance you've got first and goal. If we assume Demarcus Robinson is a lock for the roster and Tylan Wallace can lose his WR5 spot to one of these guys, then I'd probably give Polk the inside track for it just because he seems to be getting the most snaps early, but it's a slight edge. Bridges may have been quiet today, but hitting .500 is better than hitting .000, and his size gives him an inherent advantage since there are situational spots he can play a la Marlon Brown even if he never develops past a role player. If he can have another good game next week Webb seems like he could have a shot at it, but the fact he already seems to be a clear third place does not bode well for him.",38.0,ravens,t3_wuiclx,False,0.0, :19:,2022-08-21T23:08:26Z,ravens,0.00821821579143

* Like seeing Urban on rush duties. Special teams is his forte but he's better than people think on defense.
* Oweh is getting consistently double teamed. Not surprising given how thin things are across from him. Personally I see the silver lining that he already requires a double team, which won't be as viable when Houston and eventually Ojabo are there.
* Harrison is following up a good first game with a good second game. He's not Ray Lewis but I feel a lot better about ILB so far.
* Run defense has me concerned. It looked okay last week but it's looking rough today so far. Letting him go made sense given age and price, but BWill was a force against the run. There's going to be a transition.
* Really like seeing Faalele at RT again. Would be fantastic if he's ready to start sooner than later.
* James doesn't look as good at LT as last week. Not bad, this isn't Villanueva, but even a subpar Stanley will be an upgrade.
* Greg please stop designing screens for Pat. I fucking love Pat but I do not want to see him as a featured receiver on plays where you need YAC. He's a monster but you can't out-muscle physics, a 300 lbs. Fullback just isn't going to get away.

31724,178386,178386,ZombieFeedback,"Super early, super overreacting thoughts:

***Stock up***

* Isaiah Likely. Oh my god the hype is real. ...Well hopefully, one preseason game does not make a career, even in the good. But holy shit he looked legit. Big, fast, aggressive, and elusive. If he can fix his blocking he will be an absolute terror, especially next to Andrews. Even if he can't, split him out wide and let him play XXL WR a la prime Jimmy Graham. If he can even be half as good against starters as he was tonight, he'll kill it.
* Daniel Faalele. Like the saying goes, the only time you get noticed as an offensive lineman is when you screw up. Faalele spent most of the night handling RT duties, and nothing caught my attention, which I mean in the most complimentary way possible. I need to see him against stiffer competition, the real big test of him is how he handles NFL-level speed rushers with that giant frame. That said, I'd love to see him develop sooner than expected.
* Ju'Wuan James. Given his injury history, holding up well is priority #1 for James. I don't need him to excel, I just need him to hold down the fort and stay healthy. He took a big share of first-half snaps at LT and accomplished both of those goals. With Ronnie's status for week one still up in the air, having a depth tackle we can count on will be huge. James has a scary history of reliability, but tonight was a big first step.
* Steven Means and Daelin Hayes. With an extremely thin group of edge players on the Ravens this year, there is a gigantic opportunity for smaller names to latch on and have an impact, and both last year's fifth-rounder and career journeyman Steven Means made strong cases tonight, regularly harassing Willis and his contemporaries. Question will be if they keep it up once they're playing better competition. Given how thin the group is, they should definitely get the chance in the next two weeks.
* Makai Polk. Much like edge, the Ravens have a very thin group at WR. First-round sophomore Rashod Bateman is a clear-cut #1, but after that it gets fuzzy. Proche is allegedly turning heads in camp, but he was allegedly doing so last year too, so I need to see it to believe it. Duvernay is a stud on special teams, making first-team as a returner last year, but his ability as an NFL starting receiver is TBD, especially since you need to keep him fresh for those aforementioned returning duties he excels at, so there is going to be an upper limit on his snap count. (Basically the only players last decade who were all-pro returners *and* played 30% or more of their team's offensive snaps that season were Tyler Lockett and Tyreek Hill, that's a high bar for him to clear) There is a wide-open chance not only for UDFAs to not only make the team, but get legitimate snaps in the regular season, and undrafted rookie Makai Polk made the most of his chance tonight. He hasn't punched his ticket, but he made a strong case for himself.
* Shemar Bridges. Another undrafted rookie WR, Bridges had maybe the most impressive jump from ""Who the hell is this guy"" to ""Holy shit he might make the team"" tonight. 4 for 62, leading the team in receiving yards, and capping it with a fantastically high-pointed jump-ball TD. A giant receiver at 6'4"", Bridges already has a leg-up for the last spot because of how valuable that kind of height can be, and he put an exclamation point on it by using that height super effectively tonight.
* Travis Jones. Jones is a hyper athletic big man who never really got to show it in college because of an obscene snap count. (During his time at UConn, he played roughly 65% of defensive snaps. For comparison, only one or two Ravens in the front seven cracked 45% last year or the year before) I've been saying since the draft that if he gets into an NFL rotation and can have the ""normal"" amount of snaps, he'll kill it, and he looks to be taking that trajectory. Interior disruption has insane value.
* Geno Stone. Geno was flying all around the field tonight, making play after play. My only gripe is that most of it was against backups in the second half, but that just means he's due for a crack at earlier action next week. He certainly looked the part of an improved player.
* Malik Harrison. Malik had an up-and-down night, killing it in the first quarter but ending up on the receiving end of a pair of embarrassing stiff arms in the second, along with overrunning a tackle or two. I'm not sold, but I like what I saw enough to say trending up and deserving more snaps.
* Kyle Hamilton. This kid has so much range man. If we go nickel for our base set, with Williams playing centerfield FS, Hamilton playing SS, and Chuck playing a hybrid box role, I really don't know how any deep passing works on this defense. Marcus and Kyle cover so much ground it's insane.

***Stock down***

* Tylan Wallace. Wallace didn't play badly by any stretch, but he didn't particularly impress with his first-team snaps before getting knocked out with a knee injury. Harbaugh said it's a soft tissue thing which will only keep him out two weeks, but those two weeks are the only two he has left to stake his claim on a roster spot. The Ravens rarely cut draft picks, but with Likely eating one of the WR room's roster spots and UDFAs coming on strong, there is definitely a chance Wallace ends up on the outside looking in. Maybe a trade candidate a la Shaun Wade?
* Kevon Seymour. It's never a good day when you're a defender on the opposing offense's highlight reel.

* Polk is having a quietly good game. Curious how much is that him and Brown were college teammates.
* Faalele has been holding up well. I've been concerned he wouldn't have the feet to keep up with faster rushers in pass protection. I want to see him against tighter competition, but this is very nice to see for now.
* Badie has so much pop and electricity. He's going to be well behind Gus and JK but you have to get him some snaps in the regular season. He has huge potential, and with Gus and JK hitting free agency at the same time, you need to develop a guy you know for certain will be here.
* Worley played very well. The pick is the headline but he also had some great tackles.
* McCrary has burst. If he can fix his pass protection, he could be an excellent third down back with his hands. We have a lot of good looking RBs, and after last year, that's a good problem to have.
* Bridges has the WR5 position locked if he keeps this up. You already have speed with Duv and hands with Rashod. You don't have jumbo size though, and Bridges keeps making big catches with that frame.

* I want to see Means and Hayes against starters. Both are applying a ton of pressure here, let me see if it's just competition level.

* Return of veteran CBs will be big. They're trying but they're just not Marlo or Peters

* Hill has some burst. He looks faster than he used to. Would love to have another home grown RB

* Hamilton covers so much fucking ground man

* Likely either needs to learn how to block, or we need to play him wide a la vintage Jimmy Graham. Hands, speed, size, and physicality, he is insane, he gets on the field no matter what, but you cannot be a TE in a run first offense and commit holds like this on outside runs. If he can't block, he's a crazy enough athlete to still put out there, just as a giant WR. But let's hope he figures out blocking. Either way he is a monster and I will be extremely disappointed if we don't use two tight end formations extremely regularly. It's good for the run, and with weapons like him and Andrews it can kill in passing too.

* I really like Badie. His change of direction is a treat. The kind of runner who makes an inside iso look roomy.

* Bridges gave himself a giant leg up in the WR competition with those two catches. You can't understate the value size has, and a 6'4"" WR is something you can't coach. Even if he never develops beyond a situational role player, imagine a red zone package with him, two tight ends, Ricard, and Dobbins or Gus. There is no defending that, because you have the size and physicality to run, but a bunch of giant pass catchers who can make a routine catch out of a jump ball.

It's late in the third, you can see the exhaustion as he's played more than a full game against linemen who are far more rested, far more hydrated, far more energized. Next play, Pittsburgh gains about seven yards to set up third and short. He gets up, goes back out, makes a tackle on third down to force a punt, then goes back to collapsing in exhaustion on the sideline.

It's a shame how embarrassingly ugly his Ravens tenure and career ended, because that is like the *perfect* ""Play like a Raven"" moment.

31776,178543,178543,ZombieFeedback,">Look at the advanced stats

Okay, let's do that.

In 2021, Lamar Jackson ranked:

* Second in completed air yards per attempt at 4.5, same as current r/nfl favorite Joe Burrow, and 0.1 yards behind reigning champion Matt Stafford, suggesting that he was not only trying difficult deep shots just as much as this year's two Superbowl quarterbacks, but that he was just as successful as them in spite of a much weaker receiving corps. Take the most glass-half-full look at Hollywood you want, he still isn't in the same dimension as Cooper Kupp.

* 25th in YAC per completion, suggesting, as mentioned above, Brown/Watkins/Bateman was not even close to Chase/Boyd/Higgins(2nd), Kupp/Beckham/Woods(11th), Allen/Williams/Guyton(10th), you get the picture. Lamar was, as suggested above, completing difficult throws, and his receivers were doing nothing with them.

* 2nd in Air yards to the sticks, which measures how many yards past or behind the first-down marker a quarterback's pass is. Low AYTS means he's throwing it short and relying on a guy to get the first with YAC. (Hello Jared Goff and your tragic -2.2!) High AYTS means a guy is pushing the ball downfield, and first downs are happening because he's finding his targets, not because his targets are doing the work for him. Stafford, Allen, and Brady all sit in the top ten of AYTS, with Burrow and Rodgers at 11th and 12th, respectively. Turns out good quarterbacks like to get first downs, who knew?

I can go on here, but I think you get the idea. 2020 is a similar story, with Lamar's marks sitting around 0.1-0.2 yards away from guys like Mahomes, Rodgers, and Brady. 

To be fair to critics, not all of the advanced stats look good for Lamar; his on-target percentage and bad throw percentage are both middle-of-the-pack, his completion percentage above expectation(In other words how many passes he shouldn't be able to complete that he does) is on the low end of starters, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. To also be fair to Lamar, his WR1 was 5'8"" in cleats and dropped about 17 touchdowns in the Lions game alone, his WR2 was either a hobbled Sammy Watkins(Watkins in five games prior to his leg injury against Indy: On-pace for 993 yards. Watkins in six games after injuring his leg against Indy: On-pace for 515 yards), or a rookie fresh off of knee surgery, his offensive line was starting third-stringers are multiple positions for most of the year, and literally every RB on the roster died so he was basically playing RB1 in addition to being the quarterback. (Led the team in attempts per game and yards per game by a mile, tied for most attempts in spite of missing a month)

***tl;dr*** Yeah you can cherry pick a couple advanced stats where Lamar sat somewhere between 16 and 20 and argue that he's ""figured out."" You can also look at tape, roster makeup, and other advanced stats that add context and realize that judging him by those stats is stupid.",1.0,ravens,t3_vkrghx,False,0.0, :19:,2022-06-26T16:38:27Z,ravens,-0.0209003846463988

2. Jamal Lewis. 2000s all-decade rusher, 10k yard club, 2k season club, injuries plagued him, but when Jamal was healthy, he was a beast, hitting 1k in five of the six years he played in Baltimore. (And in a tougher, more defensive era with one fewer game, 1k meant a lot more)
3. Ray Rice. As horribly as things ended, prime Ray Rice was an absolute beast. Insanely elusive, inhuman balance, more power than a man that small should have, and great hands to boot.
4. Joe Flacco. Some may scoff at Joe's name being next to guys this good, but given the outsized importance of the QB and how crucial Joe's high-level play in the postseason was to our second Superbowl, he absolutely deserves to be in the top five.
5. TIE: Derrick Mason, Todd Heap. Heap was a victim of terrible quarterbacks, there is not a doubt in my mind that if you give him just an average quarterback instead of Chris Redman and Kyle Boller, he's an all-pro at least three times instead of just once. Mason played very well as a Raven, but some points have to be deducted given he wasn't drafted here and didn't spend the majority of his career here, and it wasn't a Favre-style situation where he arrived before ever establishing himself.

Lamar is probably going to end up jumping to #2 when it's all said and done, but I don't like putting current Ravens on the list.

31787,178563,178563,ZombieFeedback,"Hamilton and Williams are 100% locks given one is our first overall pick and the other is this year's marquee free agent. Of the remaining five, Stephens is probably also safe because of his versatility. He played everywhere in college. Free, strong, outside corner, inside in the slot, even if you don't expect him to start, his versatility is invaluable for a depth DB, especially if you feel comfortable about him at corner in more than just emergency depth situations.

Of the remaining four, I think a trade for Chuck to the Giants might be in the near future. I'm not thrilled about doing so because I really like Chuck, but if all reports out of camp are to be believed, Hamilton is closing the gap on the veteran at an extremely fast pace. With a brand new DC, Chuck and Kyle both started at the same place as far as understanding the scheme, and if our first-rounder who's just scratching his surface as a rookie is already tied or leading our six-year veteran who's in his prime, then I think you can make a compelling case that you're better off swapping that veteran somewhere else, either for picks or a player at a position of need. Meanwhile, the Giants have imported Wink and his notoriously complicated scheme, *and* have a big hole at safety, with the only real projected starter being 2020 second-rounder Xavier McKinney, and he's a FS naturally. Maybe Julian Love or fourth-round rookie Dane Belton rise to the challenge, but given the complexity of Wink's defense, having his signal-caller from Baltimore would go a long way to things running smoothly. Even if Giants green-dot man and Stanford alum Blake Martinez is up to the challenge, it's a player in his prime that you know fits the scheme like a glove, at a position of need, whose experience and expertise in the system can only be a good thing even if Blake stays in-charge. I've adored him as a Raven, but Chuck Clark the Giant makes perfect sense for everyone involved, including the guy who's smart enough to see the writing on the wall for his starting spot between Hamilton and Williams.

At that point you have six safeties(Hamilton, Stone, Jefferson, Williams, Washington, Stephens) which I think is fine; if you look at the last five years, we typically go into the season with five safeties, with the 2020 squad being the lone exception at four. Six is fine to bring into opening week, especially with the versatility Stephens has to effectively give you a corner and safety with a single roster spot.",1.0,ravens,t3_vdddjn,False,0.0, :19:,2022-06-16T16:27:20Z,ravens,0.0604816385303969

No worries, I'm always happy to explain and justify my positions! I used to do this shit for a living, I enjoy it lol

> Yeah I think what it came down to is Roman wanting to continue to cater to Lamar's strengths even in the face of adversity. Which I think is smart personally. The system should be built around the personnel, not the other way around. And Lamar has a big arm and can run like hell so that's what we did.

I can see that logic, but I completely disagree with it. Lamar's ace that nobody else has might be his ludicrous athletic skillset, but he has proven time and again that he doesn't need to rely on it, and that he has developed into a passer who is fully capable of winning with his arm alone when necessary in games like the Colts comeback. It isn't him at his best, because he *does* have that ace, so his peak will always make use of it, but when adverse circumstances force him to play differently, he has shown he is entirely capable of doing so.

He might not excel as much, but he will still excel if you have him run an up-tempo, spread-out offense that uses short passing to compensate for a decimated running game. The great quarterbacks have a wide enough comfort zone to adapt along with their scheme, look at how Brady went from a game manager to a west-coast field general to a spread-offense lightning bolt to a play-action home run hitter to a deep-ball gunslinger. Lamar isn't at that chameleon-like point yet where you can drop in anywhere and get greatness, but he is absolutely at a point where he can run a different style of offense if the talent around him necessitates it, and given he talks about idolizing Brady growing up, I've got no doubt he would jump at the chance to do that himself.

> And I think even with journeyman we largely made it work. I'm not sure a lot of fans realize but we were still a top 10 offense and 3rd in rushing which to Ravens fans might sound insane but it's true.

This is true, but it tells a very incomplete story. The Ravens were 18th in yards per play, 18th in points per drive, 17th in percentage of drives ending in points (In spite of having a kicker who's in range when he gets out of bed so every drive that gets past the fifty should end in at least a FG attempt), 17th in points per game, 26th in third down conversion rate, if you look at any metrics that dictate offensive efficiency and ability to consistently score points, the Ravens were somewhere between mediocre and flat out bad. For comparison's sake, during 2020, a good year but not a banner year by any means, they were 8th, 9th, 8th, 7th, and 4th, respectively. All of those are huge dropoffs, things were not fine last year despite that yardage rank.

The 2021 Ravens offense ranking top ten in total yards is a result of high volume - tied for fourth most drives in the league - rather than the offense actually being that good. It's the football equivalent of a point guard who scores 30 points a game, but does so shooting 25% from the field. The bulk number looks fine, but if you look at the per-possession value it's clear that there are a lot of problems.

As for the #3 rushing rank, that has nothing whatsoever to do with making it work with journeymen, and everything to do with Lamar being absolutely superhuman. Lamar finished with a clear lead on every single RB on the roster in yards, yards per attempt, yards per game, attempts per game, and a tie with Freeman in overall attempts, in spite of playing fewer games than any of them. If you subtract his rushing yards from the team in 2020 and 2019 and just look at the RB production, the rush yards drop from #1 in both years to #9 and #7, respectively. Still top ten. If you do the same thing in 2021, it drops from #3 to #24, in spite of Lamar missing over a month. Previous years, he was the cherry on top of Gus and JK and Ingram that took the ground game from elite to record-breaking. This year, he was effectively pulling double-duty as RB1 on top of playing quarterback. (If you want to say it's not fair to make that comparison because Lamar ate yards they would've taken, we can look at yards per play, where neither Freeman nor Murray cracked the top 40, sitting at #46 and #52, respectively. Their combined 4.4 YPC doesn't even crack the top ten) That #3 ranking is because Lamar is a once-in-a-generation type of player, not because we overcame our injuries. He's just that good.

> To your point though I think we saw more of a west coast style at play when Huntley was in last year because he doesn't have the arm Lamar has. And it worked some, but it also wasn't perfect and protection often times broke down almost instantly. 

Yes and no. True we did more short passing under Huntley, but a lot of that had to do with simplifying Huntley's reads and reducing the complexity he has to go through before dumping it off to the checkdown, because let's be honest, he's not anywhere near Lamar's level when it comes to reading the whole field, which is the whole ballgame when it comes to the WCO. A west-coast style scheme built for Lamar Jackson is orders of magnitude more potent, more efficient, and more fast-paced than a west-coast style scheme built for Tyler Huntley, because the two are on totally different levels in terms of ability.

> We're in agreement our line was bottom of the barrel last year so we were really damned if we do damned if we don't with our play scheme. Gonna try to forget 2021 forever and can't wait till this season and a fresh start. I think with our improved line will go a long way towards making everyone look better than last year.

I don't disagree, but I never said anything to the contrary?

31809,178603,178603,ZombieFeedback,"I would argue that for most of the year, we had the personnel to run a short passing west coast style scheme much more than we had the personnel to run Greg's traditional run heavy system that primarily uses deep shots after sucking the defense in with the run. Getting the ball quickly out of Lamar's hands to reduce the amount of time the patchwork offensive line had to hold up, rather than making heavy use of deeper passing that Greg's offenses have traditionally used, including this year where Lamar was third in intended air yards per attempt. I don't see the logic in focusing your scheme on deep shots when you know your QB has less than three seconds to throw.

Our offensive line sucked, so you have to find a way around that. Letting Andrews bully linebackers in short/intermediate coverage the same way Kelce does in Kansas City, while throwing underneath to Watkins and Marquise, all while the vertical threat of both receivers - and Andrews too, he did lead the team in yards per reception - forces the safeties out of the box, seems a much more effective way of getting the ball out of Lamar's hands ASAP to me than doing what we did; still basing our offense around running first, second, and third even though our RBs were literally learning the offense on the plane because they had just signed after everyone else went down, still taking far more deep shots than average even though our offensive line was primarily backups.

I'm not saying I think we would've had the greatest show on turf if we used more spread concepts, with all the injuries that offense was never going to light up the scoreboard, but if you want to say that we abandoned the plans to use more diverse passing concepts because of injuries, I would counter that if anything, the injuries we had made that style of offense make more sense, not less.

* Jaylon Ferguson, who is averaging 1.5 sacks per year and has seen his snap count decrease every single season
* Daelin Hayes, a fifth rounder who might do something but was not projected as a stud coming out of college and spent almost all of his rookie year rehabbing an ankle injury
* David Ojabo, who I am absolutely over the moon about once he's healthy, but who tore his Achilles about two and a half months ago and, much like Bowser, is not going to be 100% this year
* Justin Houston, who will be 34 by the end of the season and who someone else can still swoop in and pay away from us.

There's really not much there. Pass rush could be really good by the end of the year - maybe Biegel overplays his reputation, maybe Ojabo and/or Bowser recover in record time, maybe Ferguson finally figures things out, the future is unknowable - but going into camp, it looks rough.

Wide receiver is basically 100% reliant on every single player having a breakout year. Our longest tenured WR is a tie between Duvernay and Proche, both of whom are just in their third year. I think Bateman is going to explode in a big way this year, and I was very high on Tylenol Wallce coming into last year's draft so I think he can be a solid WR2, but even if those two work out, that still leaves you with no depth. Duvernay is lightning in a bottle, but he was a first-team all-pro as a returner. You can give him some snaps on offense, but only five first-team all-pro returners for kicks *or* punts in the last decade who played more than 30% of their team's offensive snaps were Tarik Cohen in 2018, Cordarrelle Patterson in 2016, Tyreek Hill in 2016, Tyler Lockett in 2015, and Jacoby in 2012. Tyreek and Lockett were the only ones north of 50%. If he is forced to be an every-down receiver due to injuries, you can kiss your field position advantage goodbye. Behind those three? Maybe Proche delivers on all his undelivered hype from last year, maybe Slade Bolden is the UDFA WR who finally maintains his hype past preseason, but you're one or two injuries away from starting WRs who are as overmatched as last year's corners were.

Greg Roman is, in my opinion, going into a make-or-break year. 2019 was four years ago, the league has caught up; over half the league uses motion on a majority of its snaps, running QBs have gone from something you only had to worry about with Cam and Russ to something you have to deal with in Baltimore, Buffalo, Philly, Arizona, Cleveland, Denver, Jacksonville, KC, Miami, Chicago, with San Fran and Tennessee joining the list once Willis and Lance take over. Options, heavy sets in a spread-out era, the things nobody knew how to defend because nobody saw them anywhere else are now staples of so many offenses that everyone knows to prepare for it because everyone has a division rival or two doing it now. Lamar might do it better, but that only gets you so far if a team knows it's coming. To be fair, that's not a unique problem to Greg; everyone's scheme gets analyzed, and what once worked no longer does. The difference between good and great coaches is whether they can adapt. Bill Walsh adapted his west-coast scheme as teams changed to counter it, and he's an all-time great. Buddy Ryan refused to tweak the 46, and his legacy is probably worse off now because of his head coaching tenure than it would've been if he had retired after the Superbowl. Bill Belichick routinely reinvents his entire scheme depending on his roster's talent, and that's a big part of why he's one of the best ever. Tony Sparano rode lightning-in-a-bottle with the wildcat to an 11-5 division title, then never sniffed a winning record again. Everyone has to adapt and overcome how the rest of the league is adjusting to their curveball, that's just life as an NFL coach, but it's an element of that life that Greg has historically struggled with. Even if you give him a mulligan for last year because of the injuries, a lot of the cracks starting to show here were cracks that happened in San Fran and Buffalo, and that is concerning. If the same problems surface again this year, it's fair to wonder if the team might be outgrowing him, and a young QB's championship window only stays open so long.

Running back I think is going to be fine, there is plenty of history in the last few decades of RBs tearing their ACLs and doing just fine. Frank Gore, Jamal Lewis, Edgerrin James, Adrian Peterson, Willis McGahee, Dalvin Cook, Nick Chubb, Jamaal Charles, bad cases like Saquon and Gurley happen, but with modern medicine, they're the exception, not the rule. That said, having both RBs whose knee integrity is still TBD is definitely less-than-great. I like Tyler Badie, and Mike Davis is solid, but even combined, they don't inspire anywhere near the confidence a healthy JK or a healthy Gus do. Again, I think it's going to be fine, and given when the injuries happened it's not surprising, but you'd like to be heading towards training camp with at least one of them ready to go.",2.0,ravens,t3_uyhhln,False,0.0, :19:,2022-05-26T21:03:53Z,ravens,0.0238137262945553

31835,178665,178665,ZombieFeedback,"> It is blatantly obvious that our QB is most comfortable throwing inside the numbers to guys like Andrews. Tell me why in the world would we play to Lamar's WEAKNESS?

Yeah that's not true anymore. It *was* true in his MVP year, but Lamar has grown and improved as an outside passer since then because Lamar likes being a well-rounded passer that can use the entire field. Last year in particular he made big strides in that department, with his passer rating on attempts outside the numbers(93.2) eclipsing his rating on attempts over the middle. (70.4) 

To be fair, a lot of that comes from Lamar's inside passing rating getting driven down from forcing the ball to Andrews even on the rare occasion he's not open; of his 13 picks last year, 7 were on throws to Mark. That said, **A.** even ignoring the diminished interior rating due to circumstances, Lamar's outside passer rating has continually improved year after year, both in the box score and on-tape, so putting him into a box as an interior passer who's not comfortable throwing outside and has that as a ""weakness"" is just not true, and if our quarterback is showing a clear focused effort to improve on something, we should probably support that, and **B.** Even if that's true, shouldn't that be *more* reason to get Lamar a big-time outside weapon since, going on your argument, he's not going to be able to make something out of nothing there? Unless you're proposing we basically ignore the wide game altogether?

> Stop playing copycat, we are NOT the Rams, Lamar is NOT Rodgers, and our team is NOT an air raid offense. Landry will not change that, nor will OBJ or Jones or any one receiver that has name recognition.

First of all, it's a copycat league man. Do you think it's a coincidence that after Lamar's MVP season, half the league started using motion more heavily to the point that half the league uses it on a majority of snaps? Or that the number of QBs with 500+ rushing yards has doubled and tripled, with more teams like Arizona, Philly, and pretty soon San Fran and Tennessee once Lance and Fields take over, building their teams around young QBs who feature their athleticism as a heavy part of their skillset? Cam and Russ were basically the only franchise QBs who used their legs as weapons in the 2010s, then Lamar wins MVP and now it's become commonplace. Everyone steals from each other in the NFL, it'd be foolish not to copy what someone else has proven works.

Second, adding an additional receiver doesn't strike me as trying to turn our offense into an air raid offense, it strikes me as trying to turn it into an offense that has more elements to it than it does right now, and let's be honest, it's pretty one-dimensional right now. The passing concepts we're putting to use aren't exactly world-class, and we've been bottom five in number of receivers used for the last three years. You can argue about what exactly causes that low ranking - is it Andrews being a better WR than most WRs? Roman's playcall preferences? The state of the talent on the roster? A torrid love affair with Pancake Pat? etc. - but even doubling our usage of receiver-heavy sets would still leave us bottom ten. I don't think that's trying to turn our offense into an air raid scheme, it's trying to diversify what we can do to make it harder for teams to scheme against us.

>Y'all are campaigning against Lamar and the team that he has won with.

""Another WR might not be a bad idea."" ""Why do you hate Lamar Jackson so much that you would say that?""

lol

> Stop pushing for a receiver that is going to push our home-grown guys down in the depth chart until they end up like Tim Patrick.

The funny thing is that despite making this big post disagreeing with you, I actually completely agree with this. I think Bateman is going to have a huge step forward with a fully healthy sophomore season, and I loved Tylenol Wallce in the draft and thought he was a steal so I think he's more than capable of being WR2, especially if he continues being as willing a blocker as he was at Oklahoma and irons out his technical flaws as a blocker. I also think you can make some magic happen with creative play designs for Duvernay too, although you can argue how many snaps you want to give your all-pro returner on offense. 

While they're unproven, I think that if given a chance, the WRs the Ravens have right now can get the job done, and I want to see them get that chance before we shell out any significant amount of money for a veteran who'll crowd them out. I don't want to see a veteran come in and steal snaps from young guys. 

That said, depth is a factor to consider; unless James Proche delivers on all the hype he failed to deliver on last year, you've basically got Bateman and Wallace and nothing else, If either of them gets hurt, you're in serious trouble, unless you want to take Duv off the spot he was a first-team all-pro last year so he can be an every-down WR. Last year, Sammy Watkins came in and filled the spot left vacant by Bateman's knee injury with aplomb; if you average his stats in the five games without Rashod, he was on-pace for a 993-yard season, in spite of being the third option behind Marquise and Andrews. That included some pretty crucial catches too, like the fourth-down catch to set up Tucker's game-winner. If he's not a Raven, I think you can make an argument that we're not 4-1 in those five, we're 3-2 or 2-3. Then in the Colts game, he gets knocked out, misses the next three games, and is not himself the rest of the year. If he is the only starting-caliber WR other than Marquise on the roster, but fortunately he is not, and Bateman's knee finished healing just in time to step in and take his place.

If we only have Marquise and one of those two last year, we're kind of fucked once whoever we have of the two gets hurt. Because we had an extra veteran though, we were able to absorb the injury until Bateman was back, and because we had Bateman ready in the wings, we were able to absorb the injury once Sammy got hurt. I'd rather spend the money elsewhere, and I don't want to take snaps away from our young guys, but I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to get a cheap one-year contract with an older veteran who'll mostly be an insurance policy in the inevitable scenario that an NFL player gets hurt.",16.0,ravens,t3_up6zzo,False,0.0, :19:,2022-05-14T04:08:58Z,ravens,-0.0201922945735231

2. Price. Money is going to get very tight with Lamar's contract coming up. Unless someone is a stud like Andrews or Humphrey, that 80/20 calculus is going to come into play. That math already ended poorly for DeShon when it was just him vs. Brandon Stephens, and then we got Marcus Williams for cheap *and* drafted the top safety in the draft.
3. New scheme potentially. Mike Macdonald spent six years as a Ravens defensive assistant, so fair to say he's probably not going to deviate too extremely from our bread and butter, but it is entirely possible that he wants a different style of safety for his starting FS. DeShon lays the wood better than almost any DB, but he was basically a strong safety playing free. You can make that work, but if you want a traditional safety combo, he doesn't fit that bill, he doesn't have the range or coverage ability to do so. If Macdonald wants a guy who's less Polamalu and more Reed, DeShon is not that guy. On that note,
4. Redundancy. Chuck Clark and DeShon have extremely similar skillsets physically, but Chuck is the green-dot signal caller for our defense. Only one of them was going to get to be the starting SS in 2022, and Chuck is a second coach on the field, so unless there was a substantial difference physically, DeShon's skillset just wasn't going to make enough of an impact to justify the money it'd take to keep him.",7.0,ravens,t3_unnx7l,False,0.0, :19:,2022-05-12T06:19:43Z,ravens,0.011173976424314

Correct. The reason in-question being a two-handed combo of teams overvaluing 40 times - look at John Ross' college tape compared to other players like Chris Godwin and try to tell me there is any reason other than breaking the 40 record that he went in the top ten - and safety typically being a low-dollar position teams don't like spending early-round capital on unless they think they have the next Reed or Dawkins.

> He is a weird shape, tall and slow.

First, he's roughly as fast as Ed Reed (4.59 vs. 4.57) and faster than Clyde Edwards-Helaire(4.60), James Robinson(4.64), Zack Moss(4.65), Mark Andrews(4.67), and TJ Hockenson(4.70). Is he lightning fast 4.3 speed? No. Would you want to match him one-on-one with Hollywood or Henry Ruggs? Probably not, but he's a safety, not a corner. Pure straightline speed isn't as crucial as awareness, positioning, and change-of-direction.

Also when has ""He is tall"" ever been a problem in the NFL for someone who's not a running back lol

> Ojabo, they got a quote-unqoute value pick there, but he might not play.

This is the closest I get to agreeing with one of these takes. I really like Ojabo and I think he'll be a steal once he finishes rehabbing his Achilles, but in the immediate, the only edge rushers other than Oweh on the roster after the draft were Jaylon Ferguson, who is averaging 1.5 sacks a year and has seen his snap count shrink every year, Daelin Hayes, who was an early victim of the injury plague and spent most of his rookie year rehabbing an ankle, and Tyus Bowser, who's rehabbing an Achilles of his own. Even if you assume nobody takes him with the UFA tender and add Justin Houston in, that means you're counting on significant snaps from a guy who'll be 34 by the end of the season. I think the value for Ojabo is significant enough that you take that gamble, especially if you think Ojabo and Bowser will be done rehabbing their injuries in time to be significant contributors in the second half, but this is a somewhat valid concern imo.

> Travis Jones, he is a guy that the analytics loved. His measurables were very good. But his tape was not.

Yeah, because he played an ungodly number of snaps. 1,603 snaps over 33 games, about 50 per game. For reference, Oweh and Calais were the only members of the Ravens front last year who cracked 40, and they were both 41. Put him into an NFL rotation where he can take a series off and sit around the 30-ish snaps most DTs play in a given game, and you'll probably see his tape improve. Context matters.

Don't get me wrong, it's definitely valid to say the Ravens could use another WR, and while I trust his sterling record when it comes to developing special teamers, it's absolutely fair to question Harbaugh drafting a punter as early as the fourth when pretty much every team is able to find a starting quality punter amongst UDFAs, but all of these criticisms feel like giant reaches lol",2.0,ravens,t3_uk177k,False,0.0, :19:,2022-05-07T04:23:07Z,ravens,0.034325424502799

You win and lose in the trenches, and right now, I think the Ravens have the potential for a legitimately outstanding OL if Ronnie is healthy: Stanley/Cleveland/Linderbaum/Zeitler/Moses.

First of all, this is a garbage take and I don't know how anyone who has watched Lamar the last three years comes to this conclusion. His big problem this year was not an inability to read a defense effectively, it was an offense where everyone but him and Andrews went down, plus the hero ball tendency that situation brings, compounded by not trusting your checkdown option because they weren't on the roster until week four.

Second, if that's the case, then shouldn't that be all the more reason to get him a dominant WR1 if we know he's not going to go through his reads effectively?

> That works best on short and mid range passes where tight ends are especially useful.

Wat

Lamar was #2 in air yards per attempt last year, 9th in 2020, and 10th in 2019

If you look at the nine years that Roman has been an NFL offensive coordinator, his offenses consistently have a higher-than-average yards per attempt and yards per completion

Greg Roman's offense doesn't do short and mid range west coast passing, it uses the run game to suck the defense in and then uses play-action to enable deep shots

Again, I think the ""Lamar is limited as a pocket passer and won't ever be a guy who goes through his reads"" argument is complete garbage, so I also think this notion is garbage too, but if we assume for the sake of argument it's true, that doesn't mean we're good as-is, that means that we've got an OC whose scheme is a complete mismatch for what our quarterback does well as a passer

I was extremely high on Tylan Wallace in the draft and I'm excited to see what he does without two first-rounders and a marquee free agent crowding the depth chart in front of him, so between that and Bateman I don't think WR is as dire a need as a lot of people do, and given they both played that hybrid WR/TE role with a lot of time split out wide and in the slot in college I think you can make the case that we're going to put Kolar and Likely to use to help solve the WR question, but it is absolutely a valid question to ask given the most trustworthy receiver currently on the roster is a sophomore who's only going to fit the bill with a big step forward that I personally expect but am not counting on",8.0,ravens,t3_ugdspn,False,0.0, :19:,2022-05-01T22:57:03Z,ravens,0.1819559542181069

Ravens got a first - and hopefully a longtime center from that first - for a player who was never going to sign a second contract since he wanted out, Marquise gets to go play with his college QB, Arizona gets a new WR to make Murray happy, Murray gets his old college teammate, the only person who loses here is Lamar because his good buddy left, and even then given the videos of him with Bateman the love he's shown the team and the city, I think he'll be able to handle it fine in the long-run, he's just upset because it just became official that he's gone.

32579,180235,180235,abourne,"**NFL teams can ice a kicker only once per attempt.**

In the NFL, a team is allowed to call only one timeout per “dead-ball period.” That means a coach can’t call two timeouts in between the same two plays.
 
The exact rule, emphasis added:

> Each team may be granted a charged team timeout during the same dead-ball period, but **a second charged team timeout by either team during the same dead-ball period is prohibited**. Such team timeouts may follow a Referee’s timeout or any automatic timeouts.
 
The most obvious time when this might come up is before a big field-goal attempt, if a coach has saved up more than one timeout and really wants to play mind games. But the rule also matters if a team wants to adjust its personnel presnap on offense or defense. The NFL doesn’t let you take more than one timeout at a time to do that.

I wouldn't have been mad if we had lost to the Chargers.  And agreed, not getting cocky for this Sunday.  However, my confidence has risen not by just beating the Chargers, but how the entire team played last Sunday, especially the newbies and rookies.

Key factor to me:

Time of Possession.

If you control time of possession, you control the game.  That's how we beat the Colts in OT -- as we dominated TOP the whole 4th quarter, and by winning the coin toss, their defense was pooped out.

Last two seasons, the Ravens had the best TOP record in the league.

Most games, we control TOP 2/3 of the game.  On Sunday against the Charges, the Ravens controlled ~38 minutes+.  Had it not been for the fluke tipped interception, we might have controlled TOP 75% of that game.

The known data points are as follows:

* The amount of alcohol sold pre-game entry through the time the vendors are closed (bear in mind, this is about 4 to 4.5-hour time period of sold, and consumed, alcohol volumes, units sold, etc.).

As noted in this thread, tailgates and pre-game are unmeasured (but may be factored in on conservative factors), but again, sizes are a portion of the stadium attendee population.  There's also reasonable methods to estimate these factors as well.

Lamar has had very little injury issues while Allen has had more. While Allen is more likely to get hurt with his playing style, I feel like Lamar would be more hurt from a lack of running ability but at this point it is unsure on whether this is on Lamar or the offense that the Raven put out.

We will see how it all pans out in the future but as of this moment Lamar has had the better career but they both are at the top of the younger QBs in the league with Mahomes.",14.0,nfl,t3_oanupi,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2021-06-30T00:34:15Z,ravens,0.1125856

36390,208472,208472,enaz92,"Luke-warm take: The Ravens are intentionally not putting an emphasis on the WR position for a myriad of reasons (lack of cap space, lack of FA that fit offense, future cost of WR contracts, etc.) and are instead going back to what has worked in the past, namely running the ball like it’s 1923. 

We drafted 2 TEs (Kolar and Likely), already have 2/3 very good TEs in Andrews, Boyle, and Ricard (lumping Pat in here), and decent depth on the OLine (knock on wood). WR doesn't matter if we can run the ball like we have in the past. 

Let's assume for a moment that we can't, but are still a top 15 running team. We would have to obviously rely more on throwing the ball, but then what is the difference between having 3-4 WR sets vs. 1-2 WR, 2-3 TE sets? All of our TEs have different abilities and are more than capable in the receiving aspect of the game. 

If the LBs can't sufficiently cover the TEs, the Safeties will have to drop down into the box which would leave them open to big plays down the field. Playing zone is another possibility, but Lamar picks apart zone 90% of the time. You're telling me that an opposing defense that is playing against the run also has the ability to cover 3-4 above average TEs, while also respecting the deep game (Bateman, Proche, and Duvernay), while also spying Lamar?

Eric DeCosta is leap years behind Ozzy insofar as drafting goes (this latest class nonwithstanding; I think it was a top five class and they haven't even stepped on the field yet).

Before you downvote me, look at his classes since he took over. From 2019, only Iman Marshall remains on the active roster (not going to fault him for Jaylon Furgeson, but still of the eight other players in that class, zero were everyday starters). The 2021 class had two players end up with New England before the season even began. With as banged up as the team ended, those picks could have brought in much needed depth...everywhere.

He tends to do well with first round picks; after that, it's bit players that tend to not pan out. And when he misses, in subsequent drafts he immediately tries to rectify the situation by picking at that position again. I still feel like he's a good GM (insofar as trades and player contracts goes, he's savvy and tends to help the team out, though he'll still get dinged by me for bringing in Earl Thomas over a less big-name but better production option like Honey Badger); and like I stated above, I have *extremely* high hopes for this latest class, but from 2019-2021, it's been a lot more bad than good.

1 non-first round pick made the all-rookie team from 2019-2021, and it was Proche....for punt returner.

I didn’t get into football until 2019 and watching Lamar made me fall in love with it. It gave me something to really look forward into watching every week when everything else in life felt like the same old dull routine. I’m sure some of you guys can relate. 

Given that it was my first year watching, and that I started watching after the game we lost to the browns, I had not seen the ravens lose a game… until the divisional game against the titans. The previous week I had been cheering for the titans. I didn’t know they used to have a rivalry with the ravens and they were playing the patriots. I also lived in Tennessee for about 3 years when I was young so that factored in. 

That game… is still my least favorite memory in my football watching life. That game SUCKED. I was sure we were going to the super bowl and I was crushed. After that I hated the titans. Of course we then watched them beat us in 2020 on our home field again. 

When we played them in the wild card I was pretty sure we were going to lose and I was so mad that we had to face them again. But that didn’t happen. We didn’t lose. And that moment when Marcus Peters got that pick and everyone celebrated on the titans logo… I think we’d need to get to a Super Bowl in order for anything to top that moment

However, if you find that you are treated poorly, there is a courtesy phone/text number that is put onscreen prior to the game starting. I could look it up and may later but work was a b*tch today and I’m moving on.

2. Aquarium is great and there are some phenomenal breweries ‘round town. Poe lore: Annabel Lee Tavern. Fort McHenry for your patriotic dose of anthem and you’ll be like “That’s why they shout OHHH!”. Prior to the game, Federal Hill has many awesome spots and you should definitely check out RavensWalk outside of the stadium.

3. Parking can get a bit pricey. The parking garage behind Mother’s Grille in Fed Hill is a pretty good spot. Slight walk but you’ve got plenty of company and you’re set up nicely for the pre-game/tailgate fun. Hotel would depend on planned activities.

Generally the Ravens have unique offensive and defensive strategies compared to the rest of the league.  We run the ball much more and much more effectively than most teams because we take advantage of Lamar's athleticism.  In the past we've been criticized for bad route schemes in the passing game, we'll see if that had improved with some coaching changes.

There's much research on the psychological effects of anticipation of events. Like a vacation you plan for months or years - the planning and anticipation of limitless possibilities results in a much stronger and sustained dopamine response leading up to it than the event itself.

Right now nearly anything is possible and all of the highly touted rookies and players coming back from injury could potentially ball out the season. At various points throughout the season, most of the limitless possibilities we envisioned during the preseason will be crushed by injuries or the reality of players' actual performance on the field (or even conduct off the field).

so because john harbaugh thinks someone who committed a heinous act is still a good person does not mean he is a hypocrite for not wanting to *employ* people (with the largest guaranteed contract in league history, no less) who have committed heinous acts--especially those that have been essentially unpunished and unremorseful.",76.0,nfl,t3_wdui8n,False,0.0,:Ravens: Ravens,2022-08-01T23:00:12Z,ravens,0.0855192665466392

Willie, other than a critical catch here and there did diddly squat for us except against the Steelers because their defensive gameplan was (and is) to triple Mark Andrews. In terms of raw talent, our WR room today is definitely better then it was in 2019. I love me some Hollywood but you can’t deny that Bateman is a more complete and well-rounded WR in comparison.

The 2019 offense was immensely effective in spite of being old hat because Greg Roman had an otherworldly talent at QB, who bailed his ass out time and again.
