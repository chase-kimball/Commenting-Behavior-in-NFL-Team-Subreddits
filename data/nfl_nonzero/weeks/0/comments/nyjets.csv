Is there a specific concession that MetLife is known for or is it all basically chicken tendies and fries (standard stadium food) I know most ballparks have signature dishes folk want to try. 

am I correct in saying that you can't take in a purse and everything should be in one of those clear bags.

8236,68533,68533,JaMollyAdams,"This is clearly a meme/joke, but it‚Äôs to point out something I‚Äôve been seeing on this sub a lot recently. The Jets are constantly in the top 5 of available cap space ‚Äì every season. It‚Äôs because we have such little talent on the roster. I‚Äôm tired of hearing that we don‚Äôt need to spend money on a big-time free agent because they‚Äôre ‚Äútoo expensive.‚Äù 

8 of the bottom 10 teams in salary cap space were playoff teams and 8 of the top 10 teams in salary cap space missed the playoffs. The top three spenders in free agency in 2021 increased their win totals by at least 3 wins!

What‚Äôs it going to take for you guys to realize that the salary cap in the NFL is a joke? The saints have been in ‚Äúsalary cap hell‚Äù for a decade and have been a continuous playoff team throughout that time. The Rams are -20 million in cap space and are super bowl champions. Obviously, these teams are much more talented than the Jets, but they have to start somewhere. We can‚Äôt continue to say ‚Äúoh we‚Äôre not a safety away from contention‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not a linebacker away...‚Äù We need to add talent to this team now and being frugal about free agency spending is not going to get us there.

Let‚Äôs go ahead and pay Marcus Williams/Tryann Mathieu 15-16m/year if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to take. Let‚Äôs go get Carlton Davis on a big contract ‚Äì let‚Äôs (slightly) overpay these FAs because we HAVE to. Who cares if he‚Äôs asking for 2-3 million more than they‚Äôre ‚Äúworth?‚Äù We should be rooting for our teams to be as talented as possible.

We need these types of playmakers to join/stay on the Jets, so we increase our win total and increase our team morale and ultimately increase the attractiveness of joining the Jets as a free agent in the future.

8268,68608,68608,JaMollyAdams,"**Ownership:**
lol, don't ask.


**GM:**
Joe Douglas was hired a few years ago to replace Mike McCagnan. So far he's been pretty conservative, traded away a bunch of dwindling/expensive players for some really good draft capital. His drafts have been okay at best, we will see if anything materializes of his earlier picks. I will say that his 2021 class looks better than his 2020. That may because 2020 he was drafting for Adam Gase. Needless to say, fans are getting a little impatient with him and the lack of success, but in my opinion, you have to give a GM a minimum of 5 years to turn a team around, especially one as bad as we were/are. I like Joe Douglas a lot. I just wish he was a bit more aggressive in free agency and trading for talent. But who knows, I'm just a fan.


**Head Coach (HC)**
We fired Adam Gase last year for obvious reasons and hired Robert Saleh who was the defensive coordinator (DC) in San Francisco the last few years. His defenses generally over-performed and he seemed to always bring out the best of even his most average players. In addition to this, Saleh has a huge reputation of getting fired up on the sideline when his team makes plays. So much so that he actually had a ""get-back-guy"" in SF that would literally pull Saleh back towards the sidlines when he would stray too far into the field. Passion. We love it. something Jets fans haven't seen since the first couple years with Rex.


**Offensive Coodridnator (OC)**
Robert Saleh brought over Mike LaFleur (Matt LaFluer's younger brother who is the HC in Green Bay) from SF as his offensive coordinator. Mike L. was the passing game coordinator while he was in SF, so he does not have any OC experience. But being the fact that he worked in Kyle Shanahan (HC of SF considered a good offensive mind) and is Matt's brother (lol?) people thought he would be a great OC. So far, the Jets have not been performing well at all on the offensive side of the ball this season (0 first quarter TDs up until last week). Some people are chalking that up to Mike not being capable of the job and some people are saying Zach Wilson (QB) has not been executing the play-calling properly. In my opining, the jury is still out on him. Mike White seemed to execute the game plan perfectly last week, so only time will tell if it's a LaFleur issue or a Zach Wilson issue.


**Defensive Coordinator**
Jeff Ulbrich was assistant HC and linebackers coach in ATL before Saleh hired him to be DC. Long story short, he's been doing great with the exception of a few games. The defense is definitely overperforming which is nice to hear. Can't really tell if this is due to Saleh or Ulbrich, but either way we will take it


**Quarterback**
We drafted Zach Wilson out of BYU with the second overall pick in this years draft. He was highly rated and only second behind Trevor Lawrence. He's seen as s gunslinging QB who can make crazy crazy plays out of the pocket. He's got some great confidence and is really ballsy. But that's a double edged sword. ZW was leading the league in INTs before he went out with his knee injury against NE two weeks ago. Some people blame Mike LaFleur's gameplan, some people blame ZW. He's super young and has time to grow and develop into the QB that we need him to be. But as of right now he's looking like a struggling rookie. He should be back for next week's game against Buffalo, but if Mike White plays well tonight against IND, there are going to be some questions around whether ZW should actually return as the starter.


**Running Back**
Rookie Michael Carter is absolutely killing it. He was drafted in the 4th round of this year's draft and is looking like a quality RB1 for many years to come. Ty Johnson is a veteran RB that mainly plays on passing down situations. Great player as well


**Wide Receivers**
I would say that we have a slightly better than average WR corp. Leading the pack in Corey Davis who was the #2 WR in Tennessee last year. We gave him a fat contract in free agency to come join us and so far he's looked like...well a #2 receiver. He's had some boneheaded plays and some terrible drops this seasons that arguable cost us a game or two. He's also been hurt, so that's eh. But overall when he's on, he's ON. After that we have Denzel Mims who was the second round pick in 2020 draft. Long story short around him nobody really knows why he's not getting a lot of playing time, but his role has increased the last few weeks and is starting to see some daylight especially with Corey David limited/hurt. Jamison Crowder is our veteran slot wide receiver. Nothing bad to say about him at all. Most sure-handed WR we have. Next is rookie Elijah Moore. He was a training camp sensation this off-season but has showed little throughout the regular season. He had his first TD only two weeks ago against NE in garbage time. So hoping to see LaFleur use him more. He super quick and borderline impossible to tackle out in open space. Next is Braxton Berrios slot WR - he's been on  the team for a few years, solid guy. Nothing crazy, not bad not great. Good WR to have on the team. Keelan Cole is probably the last notable WR on the team. He was also a free agency signing this past year. He's had a nice role position this year so far.


**Tight Ends**
lol, dont ask


**Offensive LIne**
LT - Mekhi Becton - 1st round pick 2020 draft. was an absolute beast last year. had pretty rough injury early this year. His main issue is staying healthy. lookin to have him back soon (week 10-11)
LG - Alijah Vera-Tucker (AVT) - Best guard in this year's draft. Jet's traded up for him. Had a slow start this year (Expected as a rookie) but has really blossomed so far
C - Conner McGovern - below average center; came from Denver 2 years ago. Has missed several key blocks this year, but you can't quite call him ""bad"" hoping he gets better as the line builds chemistry
RG - Greg Van Roten - Trash
RT - Morgan Moses - Playing fairly well this year. Honestly haven't heard his name too much, so I'm assuming that's good.


**Linebackers**
CJ Mosely - absolute stud in the defense. The defense is a mess without him, so that's a little concerning, but he is worth every penny that we paid his a few years ago in FA. The rest of the LB crew consists of Quincy Williams (Quinnen's older brother), Jamien Sherwood (rookie), and Jarrad Davis. Honestly, as a unit, very below average. CJ is really keeping the ship upright here.


**Defensive Line**
Carl Lawson was our biggest FA signing this past off season and was having an amazing training camp up until he tore his Achilles tendon. Huge blow to the defense. To fill his spot, we got Shaq Lawson and quite honestly he has performed a lot better than people thought he would. John Franklin Meyers (JFM) was an UDFA who was playing lights out and was recently rewarded with a nice long term deal a couple weeks ago. Since then though, he's been quiet, so we will see. Quinnen Williams has been an absolute monster at his position as well. He was our first round pick in 2019. Underperformed a bit in the begninning of his career but broke out last year and is continuing to do well this year. Will prob earn a long term deal in the next year or two. Bryce Huff is a rookie DE was playing well this year, and just went to IR due to injury. But the young guys are looking promising


**Secondary**
Marcus Maye - FS who has been balling out here since we drafted him in 2017. He really wants a new contract and Joe Douglas just franchise tagged him. He's pissed, but whatever he will get over it. Honestly probably leaving after this season. I dont see a deal getting done.
Ashtyn Davis - Undersize SS who hits hard. Nothing special. Hoping he grows into his role, but not looking too good rn.
CB1 - Bryce Hall is awesome. Second year corner out of UVA who fell in the draft because of his injury concerns, but has been playing lights out for us since he got here. Super lucky to have him
CB2 - Brandin Echols - Solid Solid cornerback. 
CB3 - Michael Carter II - Yes another Michael Carter and yes he's also a rookie. Another very promising young player in our secondary. Look to have him here for a long long time.


**Special Teams**
P- Brandon Mann - Okay punter
K - Matt Amendola - Solid kicker.

I don‚Äôt see Jenkins coming here, either. JD gave Fant 9 mil for next year and he drafted Cam Clark (who we seem to forget exists) plus we have Edoga on the roster as our swing.

24 years old and measures 5'10"" 198 lbs. Did not run the 40 at the combine, but ran a 4.59 at his pro day.

74.9 PFF grade in 2021, with a 78.9 run defense grade and a 68.0 coverage grade. 70.0 overall grade in 2020, so he has improved.

Lined up 334 times in the box for Tampa last year, with 265 snaps at free safety, and 191 snaps at slot CB.

I'm not a super intelligent football mind and I'm no scout at the pro level or anything, but the beauty of that one Mims play is that you don't need any advanced credentials to see that it was busted coverage and that there was nothing unique or special about the route Mims ran that lead to him being wide open for that 40 yard catch.

> Texans: Tom Savage started half of the season with rookie Deshaun starting the other half. The following season Deshaun took over and elevated them. This is probably the best example from this list and the least misleading. They found their QB and he elevated the roster.

> 49ers: Garoppolo got injured a few games in which lead to their poor 4-12 record. Garoppolo started all 16 games the following year which helped them achieve a much better record.

13455,96815,96815,MrTruxian,"It really all falls on Zack. If he struggles, all the talent in the world won‚Äôt make this offense productive. Assuming he has a serviceable year, keeping us in close games where we can stick to our run first philosophy, here are my takes.

1) Will Zach Wilson take a step forward? Most likely he will simply because of the greatly improved offensive roster. Does that mean he is performance will improve? I have absolutely no clue, but unless he plays worse than last year, his production should improve simply as a result of who‚Äôs he‚Äôs throwing to. 

2) Rookie RB‚Äôs are always a gamble, CEH was going in the first round his rookie year and that was way overvalued. We do know from our beat writers that the Jets see Hall as the primary bell cow over Carter so that‚Äôs a nod to him. He also fits the mold of previous Rookie RB success in terms of build, combine testing, and a wealth of experience as the primary back in college. That‚Äôs not to say Carter couldn‚Äôt continue to improve and ultimately win over the majority of touches. Shannahan type schemes usually go with the hot hand at RB so this is also subject to change week to week. I‚Äôd say Hall is worth it though.

3) Probably. If this offense works as it should, Michael Carter is at worst Nyheim Hines with huge upside in ppr as a pass catcher. If this offense struggles, and Hall is the clearly better back, then you could see him relegated to RB4 territory.

4) Corey Davis showed flashes of elite play last year but other times completely disappeared. He‚Äôs now competing with Garret Wilson and Elijah Moore for outside reps, and Conklin and Uzomah for redzone targets. Although, his combination of size, speed, and experience as a route runner makes him the primary target on shot plays off playoff action. I could see him taking a leap in year two of the jets system, even in a crowded receiving room. I wouldn‚Äôt draft him higher than you need to.

5) my guess: Elijah Moore, Corey Davis, Garrett Wilson. This will change in years to come with Garrett coming out on top but this system is notoriously difficult for young receivers to pick up. Davis also pretty much always be on the field as an outside guy which is another nod to him. 

6) Maybe. If one of those guys becomes Zack‚Äôs clear number one safety valve, there‚Äôs potential. This offense loves to use its tight ends, and both Conklin and Uzomah are talented pass catchers. If Zack has a great season I could see both these guys being productive.

13462,96824,96824,MrTruxian,"My thoughts on the AFC North Gauntlet:

Ravens: Regardless of the lack of receivers this is one of the most talented rosters in the league at key positions. Lamar is a threat to take over at any time and our young players will be seeing his combination of speed and agility for the first time ever, their incredible run game matches up well with our poor run defense, and Harbaugh is unlikely to come into a week 1 game unprepared. This is likely a loss.

However, their entire running back corp and a large part of their secondary will be shaking off injury rust, while either a rookie center or converted guard will be calling protections. There is a lot of room for poor execution and misfires, the jets rookies will just have to be able to take advantage of that, a tall order for their first game. 

Browns: Deshaun Watson won‚Äôt play but this is not a gimme. Outside of QB this Roster is arguably better than the Ravens, and people forget Brisset won games as the colts starter in a similar situation with a strong offensive line and a deep running back rotation. However I think the disfunction that‚Äôs to come with Watson‚Äôs situation will lead to a severe lack of team chemistry. If the Jets can put up 24+ points without letting the Browns control the clock this is a win. But as we know, the MLF offense can take a few weeks for rookies to get a handle of. 

Steelers: this offense is going to be bad unless KP can magically turn into Burrow and put up probowl number behind a god awful offensive line. I expect some breakout performances from some of our defensive players. With that being said, I legitimately think this defense good give us a shutout. They are deep, experienced, well coached, and have pro bowlers at almost every position and a few game breakers like Watt, Heyward, and Fitzpatrick. This is the type of game where a Coach like Tomlin can really take advantage of our young players. If the offense puts up 20+ points I expect a win, but that‚Äôs not easy.

Bengals: Zac Taylor is a fraud, Joe Burrow is a god. This offense may only be improved from last year, but It‚Äôs entirely on Burrow‚Äôs shoulders. I know we beat them last year, but I think the bengals will not take the jets for granted again. This game will be decided by the jets pass rush, JC, TH, TB will do their thing, we just need to get to Joe before they can make plays. I think having Uzomah may end up being huge for Saleh in getting some insight into the bengals play calling tendencies. I‚Äôm not big on the bengals defense so if the jets can compete in another shootout type game this winnable. 

I would not be surprised going 0-4 to start out. I think if we can beat Cleveland and get some momentum 2-2 or even 3-1 is more likely than 1-3.",10.0,nyjets,t3_vi22pz,False,0.0,:billruckert:,2022-06-22T10:57:37Z,nyjets,-0.0002506373195315

13494,96865,96865,MrTruxian,"My attempt based on what I think are scheme fits and also fit JD and Saleh's draft history of picking athletic versatile players that are well fit for the 49ers style offense and defense. 

  
4. Ikem Ekwonu  
10. Jameson Williams  
35: David Ojabo  
38: Perrion Winfrey  
69. Nik Bonitto  
111. Brandon Smith  
117. Jerome Ford  
146. Smoke Monday  
163. Bo Melton  
  
Ekwonu: KT and Hutch off the board here, I know this is polarizing but I like the pick and think this is what JD will do if the first three picks roll this way.   
  
Williams: I know the injury is a concern but apparently he has been progressing very well and I think a healthy Williams is in a different class than the other guys.   
  
Ojabo: I know it may seem silly to replace our injured weakside edge guy with another injured weakside edge guy but Ojabo being available at 35 is insane value for a would be top 15 pick. Man was productive at Michigan despite only playing football for a few years, and is arguably the most athletic lineman in this class. He just seems like a Saleh type of guy. These types of injuries are far less career defining then they were in years past, and Ojabo has really only scratched the surface. I see him as this year‚Äôs Odafe Oweh.   
  
Winfrey: We are thin at DT, Perrion Winfrey offers positional versatility and pass rush upside, again a very saleh type of guy.  
  
Bonitto: More pass rush???? Yes, this defense runs off its pass rush. Every defensive coordinator will say the defense starts in the trenches but the Saleh scheme legitimately requires more resources into a strong pass rush rotation than most. The 49ers defense has thrived by investing into pass rush year after year while relying on a well coached backfield that are good scheme fits but not necessarily high end talent. Bonitto is a smaller, highly-athletic, well polished pass rusher, who‚Äôs skilled enough to show the ability to overcome occasional strength and power issues in the run game. Also boasted an insane 30% pass rush win rate which is generally considered a good predictor of NFL success. Also offers some coverage ability. What‚Äôs not to like?  
  
Smith: Every year Penn State rolls out some linebacker with insane athletic ability which everyone undervalues for being a ‚Äúraw prospect.‚Äù This year it's Brandon Smith. Again this guy is such a Saleh type of prospect, rangy, athletic, and plays best in space. Outside of Mosley and Williams, our LB core is very shallow. I think Smith can perform the same role being asked of Sherwood and Nasirildeen while being a more natural position fit.   
  
Ford: I love Michael Carter, perhaps more than most, and that's exactly why we need to draft a solid rotational back for him. Regardless of how Wilson progresses, the offense is going to be run first, and Carter is not the type of back you give 20+ carries a game too. Ford offers a great change of pace, he‚Äôs big, powerful, productive in short yardage situations, and is progressing towards being a solid pass blocker. I think he gives you a lot of what Tevin Coleman offers, with better athletic upside. This way, Michael Carter can continue towards being the Alvin Kamara type back we know he can be, without having to bear a bell cow workload on his small frame. I also think Ford could be #1 type of guy if need be, giving us a lot of flexibility at a position that historically is extremely volatile.   
  
Monday: Big versatile athletic safeties. Saleh loves them, and at some point one of these guys is gonna stick. Smoke is a good scheme fit who can work into the defense, contribute to special teams day 1, and I think has potential to be a legitimate starter. Also, best name in the draft.  
  
Melton: Pencil this guy in, he checks every JD box; 9.25 RAS score, local guy, multiyear team captain, played under the jets coaching staff at the senior bowl,  has already visited the jets, was a great returner in college as an all purpose yards king who was productive in gadget plays with great YAC ability. He just seems like everything the jets are looking for in a late round prospect. I think he actually compares very well to Braxton Berrios with a much better athletic upside.   
  
I do not care that I didn't draft size in this WR class. We signed two athletic TE‚Äôs for that as well as Corey Davis. This offense needs receivers who can make plays in space after the catch, and who have the precise route running ability to get in sink with the timing of play action, motions, and screens.   
  
What do you guys think? I feel like I addressed the offense and defense well with the exception of leaving some holes in our defensive backfield, although I think a strong pass rush will greatly reduce the amount of blown plays we saw in coverage last year. I also considered drafting one of the many athletic mid-round guards/centers to replace McGovern but ended up going elsewhere with my picks.",4.0,nyjets,t3_u69hk7,False,0.0,:billruckert:,2022-04-22T17:37:26Z,nyjets,0.0003702405841094

14340,99954,99954,NannigarCire,"I'm surprised Tyreek went for such an *affordable* price. Wide receiver in their prime moving for a first, second and a few day three picks is surprising. Davante Adams is 30 years old, so I understand his price. Tyreek's 28, he still has 2-4 years of high quality play remaining. I'm not upset about the Jets missing out on him, I prefer not having to overlook the things he's done, but undeniably he's a very good player. 

In context of that, not being able to win the Amari Cooper sweepstakes is even more upsetting personally, since that would've only cost a day 3 pick and for a much cheaper high quality receiver, who is still half a year younger than Tyreek Hill and without the baggage. Hill is more schematically valuable and has a far higher ceiling than Cooper, but Cooper still would've had a significant enough impact for this team to be worth the cost.

But I'm trying to understand how once-a-decade these events sort of are. COVID crushed the trend for cap, while the economics outside the NFL has not seen that same crush at all for prices. The cap should've been around 218m for this year if the NFL's normal trend continued, instead it's squeezed down slightly to 208m, after a year where it was further squeezed down to 182m. I sort of wonder if this is part of the reason so many players are being traded.

Anyway, I think at this point the Jets are probably locking into Garrett Wilson if the players they were engaged in talks for (Cooper, Hill) give any indication. I also think it would be a good idea to bring in and sign John Ross while they wait for the draft, since he'll offer another speedster. Especially since his role will make him a wanted commodity for whatever team misses out on a rookie speedster (maybe net a day 3 pick for 2023/2024 if he's pushed out of the top 4 WRs in training camp), and the Jets have more than enough holes in the WR room to fill out.",1.0,nyjets,t3_tkrc1c,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-03-23T15:37:37Z,nyjets,0.000550477174081

With restructuring, Fant's currently at 9.6. Convert some of it to signing bonus, gauranteed payout into next year, you can probably clear like 4m-5m for this year.

14447,100072,100072,NannigarCire,"there are maybe like 5-8 players at any position in the NFL that are actually genuinely ""good"". As in, they are season to season realiable and high quality. They rarely ever hit market too regardless of their position. You might see 2-4 of these guys in FA aseason, and usually it's because they're just past the age line so no ones sure how much they have left. The point is, if youre trying to figure out which players you should buy on FA based on whether they're ""Good"" or not, you're doing it wrong imo. The only thing you need to figure out is if they schematically or strategically make sense. It doesn't matter if you think Laken Tomlinson is good or not. Tomlinson has experience playing in a similar offensive scheme and has performed decently in it. From there you can imagine what is the cost of a viable starter at that position and if Laken is worth it. You can do this for any player, at any position.

I think if i had to say how many ""Good"" players i see in FA right now, i'd go with about 3, all of which are only on market due to age. Bobby Wagner, Chandler Jones, and Stephon Gilmore.

I'm saying this because i notice a lot of conversation comes around who is ""good"" and who isn't. It doesn't really matter who is good. Teams aren't evaluating players to pick up based on if they're ""good"" or not, because there's very few players where the ""good"" moniker applies. You have to consider what picking up that player does for the position group, for the draft strategy, for the team strategy, for on-field strategy, for everything. That's probably going to be a lot more interesting of a conversation than ""they're are/aren't good"". Any of the aforementioned three players would be awesome pickups, just because on the chance they are still good, they are going to have wide impacts across all of those strategic team-building and on-field elements. 

Just imagine Bobby Wagner is still good and the Jets pick him up. Do you **need** to draft a LB? no. Can you rely less on your safety in the box? yes. can you have wagner man up with some RBs/TEs to provide better coverage? yes. do you need to worry about whether he can make a transition to the NFL and also play at a high quality like you do with a college player? no.

*actually on the ""Good"" players, there may be one more player who is actually good on the market- Brandon Scherff. Top 20 all last four years on PFF grades, and only one year outside the bottom 30 in pressures allowed in that span. Has two seasons in the top 10 for lowest pressures allowed. 3 out of last 4 seasons are top 10 in True Pass Set Pass Blocking efficiency on PFF, including a top 5 season in 2018.

Tangentially but related, I notice people seem to argue on players based on whether they are good or not. But that doesn't really matter, especially since no one really knows who IS and ISNT good exactly. Chark is a deep threat who can play split end and allow Moore and Davis to move around into the slot, without weakening the outside receiver. His schematic role is very valuable and offers versatility to the remaining players on offense. Him and Moore will both push safeties back, offering a bit more room to the underneath passing game and running backs. And as a deep threat he plays well to Zach Wislon's supposed biggest strength. He'd be a great bounce-back buy that doesn't stop the Jets from drafting a receiver in the first or second round, or not drafting one if they choose to.

Alternatively, Haason Reddick, Tomlinson, Christian Kirk, and Justin Reid would be a solid group. Kirk can duo as a slot and deep player, allowing more versatility amongst the top 3 starters.

14459,100092,100092,NannigarCire,"I agree on the blue chip players at non-premium although i have more so taken the idea that instead of just blue chip, depending on the position you need truly transcendent talent. Like, Center is normally not a very important position on the line to spend a high first on, the WAR distribution seems to argue there are extremely few centers crossing .25 WAR- which is low on their values, and Jason Kelce being the top at .46. And even more so the market on centers isn't difficult in either the draft or free agency. So, using Lindenbaum as an example, he's a player that does more than most centers are capable of doing because of his athleticism. So in a way, he has the chance of being the Aaron Donald of Centers. Jason Kelce might not even be a bad comp if his testing numbers come back well.

However, i'm reading the actual document now and realizing that there's a slight potential problem here. For one we have to trust the model on it's rankings, clearly not a given since this model is not 100% explaining variance (they're saying it explains only 50% of the variance in the text), but more importantly since it's using PFF grades, PFF grades for quarterbacks inherently contain offensive line data, because quarterbacks with worse offensive lines will inherently play worse. It's not isolating the players as they perform on the field, it's still taking the reaction of those players as everything occurs on the field into consideration. There's going to still be a problem of is it correctly evaluating these positions, which i think i'd say it may not be. It's got three key details in the text that's worth taking away though- Passing grades for QBs, receiving grades for Wide Receiver, and passing defense grades for cornerbacks make up the most valuable coefficients for team wins.

14514,100175,100175,NannigarCire,"Davis is pretty good though, but the 4TDs I think came from them working to stop Diggs and allowing Davis to try and beat them, which he did. Which is the benefit of having great players on offense, because Diggs isn't the gamebreaker either Hill or Kelce are- he's just a very good wide receiver. And he is able to dictate the defense to put more attention on his side, which opened up the field for Davis, and made everything easier for Allen. On top of making ridiculous catches himself and fixing Allen's accuracy issues when they appear. That sort of dynamic is far harder to gain on defense.

I understand that we might get a better return defense, but i don't agree fully. For one, we shouldn't be taking subpar offense talent over better defensive talent. But where they are ""equal"" (not really easy to measure) and a need exists, we should take the offensive player is what i would say. But I'd expect at least one special defensive talent to fall to the top of the second, and i would expect us to take them. Same for the 3rd. But i don't think it's a given that it would be a bigger impact even if more resources were invested. The passing offense was 27th in DVOA last year, Defense was 32nd overall (run and pass). If we improved our passing game to let's say, middle of the pack, we probably win more games than improving our Defense to middle of the pack. And on top of that, the long-term impact of getting a concrete offense has a lot of value, even beyond Zach Wilson. You know, getting our next potential QB into a solid offense so we aren't doing this Darnold->Wilson transition situation again, where every player around both of them sucks for almost 4 years is significant. It's much harder to create a long-term defense on the other hand.

So while we do have few offensive needs, we don't have any offensive strengths that matter. Just maybe the left side our of line if Becton is good.

It's not hard to find games of great offenses throwing away top defenses (save for, against the legendary ones).

14523,100198,100198,NannigarCire,"the proper way to address any position first requires evaluating its current value, its future value, and it's potential value. So-

Corey Davis: Currently, not good. Probably not going to be a focal point of a future Jets offense. He is 27 is unlikely to have a sudden leap as he is closer to the end of his career than the rise. The Jets can hope another year with improved supporting receivers takes stress off him but makes him a deeper option.

Elijah Moore: Currently, a startable option. Potential to take a leap next year and can be relied on as a potential starter even heading into 2023.

(assuming he gets signed) Braxton Berrios: Currently: Startable. Dynamic slot option who shows a lot of strong WR skills that have taken some time to develop. He's 26 so he may have 3 years of play, but there's a lack of certainty to his long-term value even if in the short term he may be very valuable.

Denzel Mims: Currently, bad. Horrible season. He should not be relied on as an option for 2023 but will likely remain on the roster for 2022 with the chance to bounce back. His bad season showed a large amount of mental lapses causing bad play, maybe another year removes those.

Rodney Adams: irrelevant

Tarik Black: irrelevant

knowing this, you can see a lot of problems. The Jets have only one starter that is currently rising, one player that may be cut by 2023 (Davis) and an ok option that they are hoping shows far more in 17 starting games, and beyond. They have zero players on the development side to look forward to.

Therefore, the Jets need to actually be aggressive in FA AND the draft. Depending on what FA's they get- it'll inform their draft strategy. If they get Michael Gallup, Odell Beckham, Davante Adams, Chris Godwin, or DJ Chark (maybe theres others i'm missing) then their draft strategy will be to fill in the back half potential of the roster. They'll likely sign another low-risk FA (maybe Isaiah Ford to backup Berrios, or John Ross to have a downfield threat on the roster) and then draft a receiver in both of the 3rd and late rounds. If they end up only getting a more mid-tier WR in FA, like Christian Kirk or Allen Robinson then they should still go for drafting another wide receiver high (1st or 2nd) and adding on another day 3 receiver into the back half of the roster. Along with picking up another mid-range FA deal, (similar to Keelan Cole's) preferably for someone like James Washington, who may be looking for a one year deal to prove himself. Treat the bigger FA as an uncertainty and bring in the lesser FA as insurance, with a high draft pick also in the wings. Those two strategies almost certify that you should not field more than 2 bad WRs at any point next year",1.0,nyjets,t3_sb1gsl,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-01-24T00:58:57Z,nyjets,-0.0230884936754949

If not then where does the line get drawn with these W-L posts??? Who is a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù? When is it just because ‚Äúthey win games‚Äù and other times ‚Äúthey get carried by their team?‚Äù 

Watson (tho we may hate him now) was easily a top 5 QB in the league and the Texans still sucked. There are so so so many examples of this in recent memory.

‚ÄúAt least Jimmy G made the Super Bowl‚Äù. ‚ÄúAt least Jared Goff made the Super Bowl‚Äù. 

Herbert is not immune to poor decisions and games sometimes, but I hate the ‚ÄúWins are a QB stat‚Äù with a burning passion. 

If you want to talk about not being ‚Äúclutch‚Äù then that‚Äôs a separate issue, but Herbert hasn‚Äôt been one to fall apart with the game on the line either so that‚Äôs not even a fair narrative for him.

QB is the most important position in football, but the other 21 combined outweigh it pretty heavily. 

There are so many other things to be said: Is Herbert too risky? Does he just not show up in some games? Does he throw passes that are ‚Äúcatchable‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt make it easy on his revivers?

16281,107106,107106,OrangElm,"Honestly, no. But oddly this time it‚Äôs because we are simply too deep at the positions that are relevant to fantasy.

I‚Äôm staying away from Breece. Many people are projecting this crazy workload on him, but as fans we also know that Carter is also pretty damn good and should still be getting work. This offense likely won‚Äôt be good enough to turn Breece into a top 15 RB if he‚Äôs splitting touches, even if he gets like 60% of the work. I‚Äôm staying away.

My expectations for Moore are lower after the G Wilson pick, but so is everyone else‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt hate him at WR29, and as a homer it‚Äôs a fun pick. However, I‚Äôm much more inclined to take Rashod Bateman in that range or hell even Olave later. Talent + opportunity. He‚Äôs talented, but as much as I love Moore this WR room has lowkey gotten too crowded to make me comfortable in a very high target share for him every game.

At TE I‚Äôd have taken Uzomah or Conklin late if they were here alone, but with both of them here together that‚Äôs a real tough sell. Overall I don‚Äôt like anyone on this team for fantasy this year.

You can check my other comments to see I clearly recognize that Zach was trying to take steps to improve that we‚Äôre not reflected in the stats. But he was never even remotely ‚Äúgood.‚Äù Even in his best games (titans) he was missing EASY throws and taking unnecessary risks. Even when he returned and played ‚Äúbetter‚Äù he turned into a worse version of Mac Jones and essentially only checked down, but STILL was making bad throws on screens and interceptable passes. Compare this to how I felt after darnold‚Äôs rookie year return and it‚Äôs night and day. 

I couldn‚Äôt care less about his stats, but for the large part they accurately reflect how terrible his season was. Bad line and weapons doesn‚Äôt make you forget how to throw a checkdown, or an accurate screen. Let‚Äôs take off the Jets glasses here. The amount of easy throws Zach whiffed on was insane. And compare him to Mike White/Flacco, we see how so many of the sacks were caused by Wilson himself and his happy feet leaving the pocket instead of stepping up. 

Look at Davis Mills last year and what he was able to do with that lineup. And who was Mac Jones throwing to? I‚Äôm sick of the excuses here. I‚Äôm not saying Zach didn‚Äôt need more help last season, but so many of the issues with him were beyond just a poor line and injured WRs. Zach played worse than bad. He was terrible. Literally one of the worst rookie QB seasons. I don‚Äôt understand how he played so poorly after his college performance.

Now none of this is to say I don‚Äôt think he can take a step this year. He can. But he also needs to.

But all that being said, his draft evaluations seem suspect. He seems prone to taking very athletic guys who may have injury question marks, especially if they are high character.

‚ÄúEarlier this week, we reported that Joe Douglas was all in on Deebo Samuel and ready to use the 10th pick of the draft to acquire the talented skill player from San Francisco. A league executive confirmed this to me on Sunday and also said if Douglas could pry DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks with the 10th pick, he would make that move.

On Tuesday evening (April 26), during the PFN Draft Insiders show with PFN Analyst Trey Wingo, I stated that after speaking with a league executive, I was told, ‚ÄúDeebo Samuel will be a Jet, and the tenth pick will belong to the 49ers‚Äù. Whether it actually gets done remains to be seen, but this is a situation worth keeping a very close eye on through the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft.

And now that I‚Äôve got your attention, I suggest all Jets fans sit down as they read the final piece of this story.

I am told Jets owner Woody Johnson will be very involved in this year‚Äôs draft. To what extent will Johnson be involved? I did not get specifics, but is any involvement in the draft from Woody Johnson good involvement?

Now, for those who may want to burn down my home, let me tell you this ‚Äî the source on Johnson‚Äôs involvement in this year‚Äôs draft is the same person who informed me just days before the 2019 NFL Draft that former Jets GM Mike Maccagnan would be fired soon afterward and told me two weeks in advance of last year‚Äôs draft that the 49ers‚Äô pick at the quarterback position would be Trey Lance over Mac Jones.‚Äù",8.0,nyjets,t3_ucri5t,False,0.0,:WSB:,2022-04-26T20:12:36Z,nyjets,-0.0494154283154084

Owners paying coaches to tank (hugh Jackson also tweeted something abt it with him) and the bullshit that truly is the Rooney rule. 

Teams clearly have their minds made up sometimes abt a coach hire, and it‚Äôs absurd to force them to interview minorities as if that would are a difference. It‚Äôs absurd to force them to interview anyone. Giants situation is one example, but the worse one is the Broncos where he talked about them showing up late to the interview and completely disheveled. I‚Äôve always thought it was a dumb rule.

The question in the league of racism is also tough. We look overall and see a lack of minority coaches. Something is going on there.

If we went out and got an alpha I‚Äôd be really happy. But who would it be? It‚Äôs all we are really missing in the WR corps. But Adam‚Äôs isn‚Äôt coming here. Godwin will likely miss a lot of next season. ARob looked pretty lost this season. I‚Äôm not sure I really see them happening. Mike Williams is an injury machine. Only real way I see is getting a stud is trading capital for one (maybe Ridley if JD is okay with the risk and he‚Äôs doing better mentally, but that‚Äôs also a stretch. Maybe MT, but he doesn‚Äôt seem like a JD type. Maybe Cooper but that contract kinda sucks and he is a disappearing act sometimes).

So then what? Drafting a WR works but at 4 it‚Äôs certainly a reach and at 10 it‚Äôs likely also a reach. There‚Äôs no Jamar in this class. I‚Äôd be happy with one in the second, but it‚Äôs also tough for them to make an immediate impact. Not every WR class is the crazy one that we got this year where the majority were immediate difference makers, let‚Äôs not let it skew our opinion on it. For every Moore there is a Mims :(

So now look at who we have. Moore was really good when healthy and was absolutely cooking people, and hopefully Davis will also be fully back next year. Is Davis an alpha? No. But he‚Äôs certainly a solid WR. I think I saw a stat that the top WRs on this team had something like 32 snaps played at the same time all season due to health reasons. Insane.

Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs only 60% then because redzone is harder. (.6)x2 = 1.2 and 1x(.925) is .925.

This last week is exactly what I expected coming into the season. A competent looking offense (good line play, good WR play, fine Rb play, fine QB play) and a terrible defense. We essentially invested everything this off-season into the offense outside of Lawson (who is now hurt anyway). I was surprised early on when our defense actually looked solid and our offense was putfid, but this week is exactly what I expected all season long.

If Wilson ups his play, this will honestly be a really solid offense. It‚Äôs been a while since we could have said that. There‚Äôs no real excuses being made anymore unlike the terrible team we out around Darnold.

If in this draft we can address our defense more then I clearly see the vision going forward. Unlike in the last where we were just plugging holes seemingly randomly, I can see the process this time. We were a team devoid of young talent, and it takes time to build.

Now we have a solid young offense, a hopefully developing rookie QB, and some young players on defense to keep as we rebuild that too. The process is there, but repairing this team the right way takes time.

Another thing though: The game can slow down but he still not be confident in his arm.

Maybe short term it would work better if he just ‚Äútrusted himself‚Äù and fell into his old habits of making these throws at unneeded times because they seemed to work, but long term he‚Äôs got to figure out to just make normal throws I guess.

I honestly don‚Äôt know what he needs to do. Should he trust himself and just do what‚Äôs comfortable to him? Or should he try to change up something that worked in college but was not really ideal?

It's also silly. 

Going by last years numbers, EVERYTIME you drop a draft position you lose 1-2M. So he could scare off ""big tax"" cities, but end up making much less for it.

* Injuries out of the ass on both sides of the ball for a roster that even if they had all their starters was going to struggle to even get to the wildcard. A 3-10 team who might have been 6-7 at best sounds about right.

* The backs ups playing all these positions are nowhere near as good as the people they are replacing. Not having guys like MC1, Moore, Maye, Lawson are fundamentally game changing absences. They are the type of players who can actually win match ups and have above average traits. Instead, we have players who are worse than average which means they constantly lose matchups and can't really contribute to the team. We started off with a stacked WR and RB room and are playing with scraps right now.

* The coaching staff and front office are doing what they can with this roster and injuries, but it's not like they aren't making mistakes as well which doesn't help. Both the offense and defense has been atrocious at different points in the season, and they seem to have weeks where no changes are made. I am sick of seeing the defense get gashed up the middle with no answer and screen passes that go for 20 yards on average. Why is finding an ok kicker such an adventure?

* I am not saying we need a pity party or it's the reason for all the losses, but what the actual fuck are these refs the last two weeks. They are fundamentally deciding not to be overall bad, but specically bad against the Jets. How many times do we have to see them ignore blatant holding to our DL, DPI against our WRs, and finding magical drive altering pentalties for the other team? If this team was a guy who just tripped on the sidewalk and stumbling, these refs are the guys coming in from out of nowhere to leg sweep them for good measure. We seem to always get the weakest ref teams and commentator teams and they just add insult to injury.

* Wilson needs to be more decisive and just think less. All I can see game going too fast for him, and if all he can accomplish for the rest of the season is straighting out his mechanics and footwork, especially on short throws, that would be an accomplishment and put him in a position to excel next season. What good trying to learn the mental parts of the game if you can't even get past step one. Nevermind ""was that the right read?"" when the problem is ""that throw never had a chance because it was off or late"".

I can't count how many times Wilson forced the ball to Davis even though he wasnt really that open. It didn't work out for Davis too much, but he at least was given the chance. 

It worked better with Moore, but what progress can you really make when the only balls that come your way are on the 2nd or 3rd read? I think giving Mims a few solid plays designed for him in the first read can show if he worth continuing to develop or trading him if he can't cut it.",5.0,nyjets,t3_re86ll,False,0.0,":PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya",2021-12-11T18:05:10Z,nyjets,0.184229344
