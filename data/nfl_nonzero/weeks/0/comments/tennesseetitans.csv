I think this defense can and should still be a top 10 unit, it’s just I thought they could be a top 5 unit before losing Landry. We have depth in the pass rush, losing Landry is better than losing Cunningham/Long Jr imo with how shallow our depth at ILB is until Rice is back. Same with safety, it’s bleak if we took a hit there.

The CBs may be green, but if they play up to potential, that could be more than enough to make up for the dampened pass rush. The potential is there for a top tier CB room and with how connected pass rush is to secondary play, it might just be exactly the cure for missing Landry.

How I view things, week 1-5 are a trial run for the pass rush. If Weaver/Ola are competent enough to replace Landry, we’ll know by the bye week. If it’s clear they are not, we can still find a pass rusher in free agency or by trade in October with the money freed up by Henry’s re-worked deal.

2219,18935,18935,Bieber_hole_69,"PFF has never graded Landry all that well. They’ve had him as an average to slightly above average EDGE basically his whole career. They had him at basically the same as far as grading last year IIRC, just basically accounting the major uptick in sacks to higher conversion of pressures to sacks, likely credited to a much upgraded pass rush the Titans had in 2021 with Autry and Simmons playing very well and a good defensive scheme with Bowen calling plays. He did have plenty of clean-up sacks last year, his athleticism is his best skill and that shows when he can catch up to a QB breaking the pocket when someone else was already in their face and couldn’t finish.

He doesn’t get a ton of pressure, so he is a guy that can have high variance in sack season-to-season depending on how much he can get home. When the pass rush around him was awful like in 2020, he had 5.5 sacks. When the pass rush around him was great like in 2021, he had 12 sacks. He depends on guys around him to give him the kind of looks where he can be on an island with the tackle/TE on the outside and beat him around the edge with speed and bend, he can be neutralized pretty easily if you can dedicate extra blockers to him as his rush move set is pretty one-trick pony. He also doesn’t rush and drops into coverage way more than most EDGE guys, and PFF values success in pass rush more than being a competent coverage guy.

Landry’s most valuable asset to the Titans was that he played basically every snap. He never came off the field and was a good run defender, so the Titans could rotate guys in the interior more often and give someone like Autry advantageous situations since they never had to spell Landry on the outside. You could put Landry in and not have to worry too much about that side of the defense, and a lot of the exotic looks the Titans like to do up front and in the secondary are possible because they have two guys like Landry and Dupree on the edges that play basically every snap and never have to come out for situational snaps.

I tend to agree with PFF more, even if I do think Landry is a better player than they give him credit for. In the Titans scheme and with what they like to do, he’s a pretty foundational piece. I think he was bound to have a regression season for sacks, just because he’s always going to be a high-variance sack guy, so I think really the Titans only need to replace 8 or so sacks now that he’s gone. That’s totally do-able with the depth they have and the other pieces in the front 7. The real lost opportunity with Landry gone is just that they have to shake up everything they want to do on defense at a base level. There isn’t anybody that can do what Landry does available, nobody can replace just the all-around quality he has and his ability to play 90% of the snaps every game. They have to rotate more and some of their situational packages have to be changed up, and the defense will be worse for it. 

It’s certainly not a death-knell like it would seem to lose a 12 sack pass rusher though. He’s not TJ Watt, they can get his pass rush production from guys already on the roster and with some extra scheming. He’s a complimentary pass rusher, and that can be worked around.",18.0,nfl,t3_x4b94n,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-09-02T15:37:54Z,tennesseetitans,0.019984536199364
2220,18936,18936,Bieber_hole_69,"I would blame it mostly on national bettor ignorance about the Titans, both willful and not.

Vegas has the Titans as a major regression team this year, I think O/U and spreads put them as a 8-9 team this year or thereabouts. I think the base assumption is that if you think the Titans go from the 1 seed in the AFC to out of the playoffs and maybe 3rd in the division depending on how you view the Jags would be a sharp enough decline to warrant Vrabel being fired.

Anyone who actually follows the Titans would know that isn’t close to being the case though. Vrabel could go 0-17 this year and still have a job in 2023. He’s about the most entrenched coach in the NFL at this point. Ownership loves and trusts him and the fans love him too.

Based on the sketchy history this Colts regime has with reporting injury timetables, it would not shock me if Leonard missed all of 2022.

You would think the Colts are perpetual Super Bowl contenders since 2017 the way Ballard is ranked as a top 10 GM in every single GM ranking I have seen. They build the same way most of the “smart” media members think they would build a team if they were a real GM, so they get heaps of praise regardless of actual results.

They’re like the Danny Ainge Celtics of 2014-2017. They’ve taken a bad roster down to the studs and rebuilt it the “right” way, not spending much in free agency, trading down instead of up, acquiring as much capital as possible and not using it on anything other than building the roster with home-grown talent and patience above all. They don’t take short-cuts, in a way they’re the anti-Rams.

Whether that works or not…who knows? It’s been five seasons of mixed results with one playoff win and no division titles, but if you looked at media coverage you would assume it’s been at least two division titles and one deep playoff run, which is something another team in the division has done in that same time period and receives much less media fanfare for actually having done. And that’s why Titans fans get a bit frustrated whenever the Colts are brought up as division favorites every season and Ballard is ranked as a better GM than Robinson every year.

RB coach is normally a dead end. The typical track to QB coach is to either play QB or work up from WR coach, I know the air raid guys start as WR coach a lot, Inside WR coach as well.

Some of this is also that there are less minority QBs, and especially minority journeyman backup QBs, who are often the guys that end up as QB coaches when they retire. Leftwich feels like the only example I can think of right now for a black journeyman QB retiring and getting right into coaching.

And of all the position coaches to go straight to HC without any time as an OC, QB coach is pretty much the only one with any shot.

He tore his ACL on October 18, 2020 and came back for Week 1 on September 12, 2021. I don't think he waited long after the tear to have surgery on it.

That's 11 months of recovery, and pretty typical for returning from an ACL tear. Maybe he needed longer personally to recover, and it's up to him to be the one to decide that since it's his body. The team gave him a pretty standard window to return and were slow with him during camp and pre-season.

Robert Woods tore his ACL November 13th, 2021 and seems to be on track for a standard ACL recovery timeline, which would be ready for Week 1, it not 100% yet.

I agree and don't think it's fair for anyone to say the Titans rushed him back or anything. He had a standard recovery time, and it's up to him to tell the team he needs longer.

2264,18995,18995,Bieber_hole_69,"Why would the Browns take Tannehill when they have Watson? They would be spending like $100 million against the cap with both those guys on the team. The Browns aren't giving up anything to get rid of Baker, they'll just cut him at that point. The only possibility of this trade would probably end up with the Titans being the team giving something up in return because Baker's deal is up this year, but Tannehill has more money left for 2023.

Without even checking the math, I don't think the Titans could take on any of Baker's money while paying against the cap what they would have to for Tannehill to trade him this year.

This is one of the very few lose-lose scenarios I could ever think of lol. The Titans would be trading a very expensive QB for a very expensive QB nobody wants at his price tag. And the Browns would be trading a very expensive backup QB they can't give away for a more expensive backup QB because Tannehill isn't as good as Watson.

Both guys are towards the ends of their contracts but have so much in guarantees for the upcoming season that trading or cutting them saves almost no money compared to the dead cap it would cause. Anything on the field notwithstanding, I just simply don't think the money would work for either team.

On the field though, this would be a disaster for the Titans. I don't think the Titans are a playoff team with Baker at QB, but they are with Tannehill at QB. They'd be getting worse at QB for no reason in 2022. And on the off-chance Baker stuns us all and is better than Tannehill could be, what are you going to do with him in 2023? His contract is up after this year, are you paying the big bucks to extend him if he's good? Letting him walk for a comp pick? If he was good in 2022 and you let him walk and he's still good in 2023 it's a disaster for the team, they let a good QB walk. More likely though, if Baker was good in 2022 the team would be forced into extending him and would give him big money only for the real Baker to come back in 2023 and bring the franchise down with him.

And on the Willis front, any thought of starting him this year or even letting him compete for the job is insane. He should and needs to be on the sideline in a headset on game days this season as a healthy scratch. The dude is not ready and won't be for a while. Willis starting for the Titans is a guaranteed 4 win season and probably ruins Willis as a player in the process. If Willis started this year, we'd be picking a different QB in the top 5 next year anyway.

This trade as a premise wouldn't even work in Madden, and I can't imagine anything other than you forgot the Browns signed Watson. The money doesn't work for either team. It makes the Titans worse. It makes the Browns disastrous situation with Baker's contract last another year because of swapping it with Tannehill's contract.

2287,19023,19023,Bieber_hole_69,"We all get blown away, rightfully so, by the games that AJ can just take over and win by himself. The 2nd Indy game last year, the 49ers game, and the Bengals playoff game (even if we didn't win it,) are as good of performances as you can get out of any WR. I was at two of those games, and I've never seen anything like it. I would have given AJ $30M per year on the spot after leaving Nissan Stadium those nights.

But then what nobody really factors in are the, including weeks he was out with injury, 12 games AJ had last year with less than 50 receiving yards. He disappeared more last year than he really showed up. The best of the best at WR dominate the majority of games.

For comparison, last year Davante Adams had 3 weeks the *entire season* with less than 50 yards. Does anybody, even the biggest AJ stans out there, think he will ever be that kind of player? For the Titans as a whole under Vrabel with our current offensive philosophy, will any receiver ever produce like that? If both those answers are no, then why would we ever pay any WR over 10% of the salary cap? And why would it be AJ of all receivers?

Losing that top level really hurts, and we don't win those four games that he had over 90 yards in without him, but maybe we win those 3 games we lost when he was injured instead if we get better health at WR?

His top 4 performances last year totaled 524 yards of his 869 for the entire season. 60% of his yards for the entire 17 game season came in 4 games.

Maybe it's better team building and long-term strategy to try spreading those 524 yards out into 65 yards/game over 8 games instead.

To replace AJ's entire season yardage over a 17 game season it's just a hair over 50 yards per game. I don't think it's unreasonable to think Woods/Burks/Hooper can be worth that much. Maybe we don't win the couple games a year we wouldn't have won without having AJ there to just take over the game and will us to victory. But maybe we also win some of the games he wouldn't have played due to injury or had to leave early with injury? All 5 of our losses last year came in games that AJ had under 50 yards. How many would be wins if we could have more consistency in the passing game?

It's not all that farfetched to say you can make up AJ Brown's production in the aggregate across the season with what we have on the team now.

Edit: I've also been going back through those 4 games last year that AJ missed due to injury. On the surface, that 1-3 record looks like a bright red warning sign about how this team will be without him. I've written here in the past about how I though AJ was the most important player on our team and that 1-3 record was a big story of my thinking then. 

Looking at those games though, one loss was to the Jets without Julio and AJ. We should have won that game regardless, and were in a position to win it if Firkser doesn't have pads of butter for hands.

And the other two, at New England and Pittsburgh were on the road against playoff teams. We should have won both of those games as well and the big story of why we lost was turnovers, turnovers, turnovers. In those games, the Titans fumbled a combined **10** goddamn times and lost 6 of them. 10 fucking fumbles is why we lost those games, not the fact that AJ wasn't on the field. We aren't winning any games where we average 5 fumbles if Randy Moss and Calvin Johnson are both lining up on the outside lol.",45.0,tennesseetitans,t3_uiw2r9,False,0.0,11,2022-05-05T09:04:38Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0001222151035638

I mean literally, Julio had the hammy problem since camp.

The IR stint just felt like the Titans had finally had enough and just wanted to get at least a playoff game out of him. They had been trying a week-to-week approach and then just basically told him to take a month off in November-December.

Julio will never play more than 10 games in a season again, and it would be a miracle if he could even play over 50% of the snaps in those games.

When a team like the Titans that is already thin at WR decides a roster spot and $9M in cap room is worth more than Julio to the team, it's clear what stage of his career he is in.

The worst part is that when he's on the field it's clear he can still play, so any team that signs him is going to get screwed by thinking they can actually depend on the potential since he's still pretty much the same player if you give him 5 weeks off at a time.

I was of the opinion they should give AJ whatever he wanted because he was worth it, but im not the one balancing the books and weighing his cost against Landry’s deal, Simmons’ deal, Hooker’s deal, Long Jr.’s deal, and Davis’ deal. The core of the team down the stretch was the defense and that’s still together, a potential top 5 unit that’s only gotten better if Farley can play like his potential.

We could have been the Packers in the same spot with a WR1 that refuses to sign the deal we give him and stuck with picks that couldn’t get a top tier WR tonight anyway.

2356,19104,19104,Bieber_hole_69,"He had the same OC in 2016 and 2017, albeit a terrible OC. He's OC in 2015 was also his QB coach in 2016, even though he wasn't calling plays in 2015. 2018 and 2019 were also different OCs, but the same system both years, the LaFleur offense and the Smith offense were both cut from the same cloth. He had continuity, it's not like he was getting thrown to the wolves in a dumpster fire franchise (although that may have been the case in 2015, the Titans were a disaster at that time, but have since been as consistent and steady a franchise as you can get outside of the top tier in the league.

The offense in 2016-17 was also catered specifically to not getting him hurt, and he still ended up getting hurt both of those seasons. If he can start all 17 games for the Falcons this year it's a miracle, and I say that as someone who desperately wanted Mariota to be what we all thought he could be. His stretch towards the end of 2016 was genuinely great, but at this point was clearly the peak for him. He's a back-up QB and played like a back-up/borderline starter for pretty much his entire career outside of a 6 or 7 game stretch in year 2, and when he should have been getting better and was actually getting a well designed offense around him, he only got worse.

I also think the success of his final two OCs in Tennessee, LaFleur and Smith, can also show that the weak point the whole time was actually Mariota. Tannehill coming in and immediately lighting it up to the tune of having among the most efficient 10 game stretches a QB has ever had should have made that clear. A team that made the AFC title game with Tannehill at QB was on pace to score 16.3 points per game (11.6 if you don't count the 43 points in a week 1 outlier game,) and pick in the top 5 of the draft. Tannehill comes in and the team averages 30.4 points per game the rest of the way. For the 2019 season that would be like going from the 32nd scoring offense in the league to the 2nd best. Hard to imagine any other situation in the league changing that drastically if it's a switch from one starting caliber QB to the other, that only happens if it's a back-up going to a starter.

It's hard to look back and remember just how dark it was after week 6 with Mariota in 2019, but the Titans were a team on the brink of starting a full rebuild at the end of the Mariota era and then suddenly are back-to-back division champs and have a .700 winning percentage in the regular season over the next 43 regular season games.

2360,19108,19108,Bieber_hole_69,"I mean yeah, those are all issues as well. I'm not a fan of Downing or how he called that playoff game either. But not turning the ball over is easier to address than the playcalling. A QB can avoid turning the ball over with a bad OC, but any OC can't make up for a QB that won't stop throwing INTs.

I just am of the opinion that taking care of the football and minimizing dumb turnovers is the single biggest issue the team has and the point that needs to be fixed more than any other. Having a QB with a 1.29 TD/INT ratio last season and a 1 for his postseason career (0.5 for the last two postseasons) isn't a formula to success and can't be worked around, playcalling isn't as big of an issue to me. Tannehill has not taken care of the ball well in the last 2 one-and-done playoff series, and I'll believe it when I see it that he can be the 2019 playoff Tannehill again. Art Smith didn't get a great playoff game out of him in 2020 either.

In the 6 losses the Titans had last year, they were -16 in turnovers cumulatively. No team, good playcalling or not, can overcome almost 3 turnovers per game, and that's the common factor in all the losses just like it is for most teams when they lose the turnover battle. When the Titans were negative in TOs last year they were 2-6, I'm sure most teams have splits like that but the common theme in almost every loss is that they can't win if they don't take care of the ball. When they won or tied the turnover battle last season they were 10-1. They can win with the playcalling now if they don't give the ball away.

Since Tannehill took over in 2019 the Titans are 27-6 when having a positive turnover differential and 5-11 when negative. The bigger issue is that the percentage of games when they are negative has increased each year since Tannehill took over from: 
2019 - 23% 
2020 -  29%
2021 - 44%

When you get 9 sacks and hold a really great offense to 16 points for 4 quarters, you just need to take care of the ball and you win 99% of the time. The Titans defense is good enough to carry them as long as the QB doesn't fuck it up, and Tannehill has fucked it up when it mattered most the last 2 years.

I would trade that TD pass for not throwing one of the three interceptions 100 times out of 100, they probably win the game that way.

I wouldn't start to get worried until he starts missing days at camp. Until then there isn't a rush to get anything done, missing off-season work isn't setting him or the team back and it's not like he isn't working out still.

It's probably in the interest of both sides to wait on getting this deal done at the last minute before camp. 

For the Titans, the roster is going to look a lot different after the draft and the last wave of free agency in May, the team will probably want to wait until the roster is pretty much finalized for camp when they start working on how they want to structure AJ's deal based on what money they have left and what money they need to operate during the season. They also have the Julio money coming in June that they can plan around now.

For AJ, being the last guy to sign a deal from that class will mean he probably gets the most money. Both he and his agent know this, there's no reason to rush and be the first in that class to sign at $21/AAV when the other 3 can now show that deal to their teams and get 22+/AAV.

Robinson just doesn't have a history of getting deals done before he needs to. They use all the team control they can to work out extensions and have shown they aren't afraid to use the franchise tag if they need to when they think the player is worth the tag number.

And this is just April, Lewan sat out June minicamp in 2018 when he was trying to get a new deal and not play on his 5th year option, exact same scenario as AJ is in now and a deal got done before actual camp started anyway. A vet like Lewan or AJ that's playing with a pretty identical team to last year doesn't really need all that much time in camp/off-season team programs either, if AJ missed even the majority of camp in the fall it's not the end of the world, he's played with Tannehill for 3 years, they don't need to get their reps in like that together anymore. It's just pretty rare to see any star player actually play out the last year of their contract, and this is how a new deal starts getting done.

Just because their is some kind of holdout doesn't mean this is an adversarial situation, this is just how contract negotiations go in the NFL. During Lewan's hold-out he made it clear he wanted to be at practice and this was just part of business that he had to participate in. I'm sure AJ is the same now, he probably wants to be with the team, but when an agent tells you this is how business is done, you do what they tell you, especially during the first contract negotiation of your career.

And it's pretty crazy to compare it to a normal job in any way. Could you tear an ACL at your office job and be out millions of dollars too? Does your skill at the office translate to making the office playoffs and your absence remind your boss just how much value you bring to the office? 

If every player that held out for a new contract during the last year of their deal didn't get a new deal done with the same team, like 99% of stars in the league wouldn't be playing where they are currently playing. Where there would have been a real issue was if AJ held out before last season and wanted a new deal with 2-years of team control left (4 realistically because he's worth two years of franchise tags,) that is the kind of situation that ends in a trade most of the time. I remember Ramsey hinting at doing that to the Jags after the 2018 season and he didn't last much longer in Jacksonville after that.

The Titans had one asset they valued over everything else in 2015, Marcus Mariota.

2390,19141,19141,Bieber_hole_69,"I think it's a potential vs. actual results thing that pushes Tannehill above McNair for me. Don't get me wrong, McNair is my favorite player ever and I haven't enjoyed watching a player more than I did watching him, but he just got stuck with a coach that didn't know how to use him in the wrong era of football. If he played today in pretty much any modern offense I think McNair could be one of the greatest QBs to ever play, he just had such an absurd level of skill and talent that is perfect for the NFL today. He was as successful as he could be under Fisher and in his era of football because he was too good to fail no matter what he had to overcome. McNair had all the talent in the world and Fisher refused to have an offense built around his skillset, instead opting to run George into the ground as much as possible. I have no idea how Fisher could watch his Alcorn State tape and see how unstoppable he was off-script when he had to make something happen and still refuse to update in any way around McNair. It's an absolute travesty that McNair didn't have a career good enough to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when you compare just how good he should have been compared to other QBs that are in the HoF. McNair had six 500-yard passing games in 1994 at Alcorn, I don't care about the level of competition in the SWAC, it's impressive to do that against air and it's beyond baffling that Fisher could have a player like that and not build everything around him. And yet he still won an MVP under Fisher in that offense somehow.

The league and football as a whole has just changed in such a way that it makes it all the more disappointing someone as good as McNair couldn't play today. Most D1 schools saw him as a DB, TE, or RB instead of as a QB because that vision of what he could do just didn't exist to anyone back then. And yet that MVP season McNair had was with worse passing stats than Tannehill has ever had in a season with the Titans. That pretty much sums up why I'd put Tannehill over McNair: I know McNair could be better than Tannehill, but I've actually seen Tannehill have the best three passing seasons the Titans have had with only 2011 Hasselbeck being close. Tannehill is the first QB the Titans have had that I can genuinely feel like has shown he can pass so well the team can keep up with the best offenses in the league. Availability is another thing, Steve was as gritty as they come for playing through all the injuries he did, but there were still multiple Titans seasons thrown off the rails or put into serious jeopardy because McNair missed games. Neil O'Donnell being competent as a backup was miraculous for saving the Titans season in 1999 when McNair was hurt.

Henry over George is just a feeling based on how good either guy could be at their best. Henry can genuinely take over a game and change everything in a single run unlike anything I've seen when he's on it. Henry takes over games in the way that George could do in college at OSU, just unbelievable. The biggest knock on Henry is that it took him so long to reach that level, he just wasn't close to that kind of guy until that stretch to end 2018. George had the better career, pending what Henry still has left.

I was honestly ready to crown AJ Brown the best Titans WR by the end of the 2019 regular season lol. AJ is just the kind of player the Titans never get and never have, the Titans just never manage to get those kind of special players like AJ, especially at WR given how bad this team has been at that position. AJ just has such an incredible quality with how he can just do anything when the ball is in his hands, he bends the game to his will anytime he gets the ball in a way that you can't coach. I just never felt that way about Mason even if he was a great player. AJ is already on of my favorite Titans ever, the feeling I get when he's got the ball in space is something I've only gotten from watching other teams. Even with CJ2K, watching him outrun everyone for a long TD run just isn't as exciting as seeing AJ make something special happen just because he's too good to let anyone stop him. Imo AJ is the single most important Titans player and has been since he became a feature part of the offense in 2019. You can manufacture enough of Henry's impact to make it work without him, but there just is not way to replace what AJ can do and how essentially it is to the offense. I just always think back to that TD against the Ravens in the 2020 regular season when he just asserted his will and refused to be stopped.

2393,19144,19144,Bieber_hole_69,"Oh trust me, I remember the 2008 divisional round vividly and have spent a significant amount of my life since that cursed game ranting and raving about how 2008 was the Titans year and the Ratbirds stole it from us. The 2019 divisional round has been the only moment since that 2008 season to give me any closure or satisfaction about it.

I was too young to remember the 2000 Titans, but that one seems much less painful in comparison to 2008 just because that Ravens team was an all-time buzzsaw. The Titans happened to run into the Greatest Show on Turf and the 2000 Ravens in back-to-back years and got unlucky. I can't help but wonder if that 2000 Titans team would be remembered in kind of a similar way to that 2000 Ravens team if they won that year instead given they also had an all-time great defense. They didn't have the star power of Ray Lewis, but Keith Bulluck and Jevon Kearse would have gotten the respect they deserved. Prior to this season, that 2000 Titans team was the best since the franchise moved to Nashville imo. It took hiring the best GM, hiring the best HC aquiring the best QB, drafting the best RB, and drafting the best WR in Titans history to finally build a team better than that 2000 team with the roster they have now.

But 2008 on the other hand, there was no Brady in the AFC, the Titans finally got the better of Manning in the division, the Titans had beat the Steelers badly late in the season, it was the year for a weird flukey team to have a clear shot at winning it all. The way they played forced that Titans team to minimize mistakes and turnovers, and somehow everything that went right in the regular season went totally wrong in the playoffs in a manner that shows clearly the limitations of that Jeff Fisher style of play. If any of the fumbles or missed FGs that became an issue out of nowhere just didn't happen, they win that game. If the Ravens didn't injure Chris Johnson on purpose like they very clearly did, the Titans probably win. If the refs correctly call the late delay of game against Flacco, the Titans probably win.

He was forced to take a paycut and make changes to his staff in exchange for more time to prove what he needed to prove after such a down 2020, and he proved more than anyone could have expected in 2021. Now he's got all the leverage and it seems like he's playing his hand for as much as he possibly can while the ball is in his court. Last year that partnership with him and UM was close to being done and now he can force them to beg and plead for him to stay just a year later.

I can't help but imagine Harbaugh will always keep that power struggle with Baalke in SF in the front of his mind for the rest of his career. He's going to do everything he can to insure his job security now that he's learned that winning can't do that for you on its own.

Imo Harbaugh definitely wants to go back to the NFL and will at some point, I think all those rumors are 100% true. The real calculation he has to make now is if he reached the ceiling of what can possibly be done at Michigan in modern cfb after last season. It's possible to win a Super Bowl with any team because of the parity and competitiveness of the NFL. It is very clearly not possible to win a national championship at any college anymore because of how modern cfb has developed. Brian Kelley seemed to recognize that clearly and moved on from Notre Dame after he came to the realization he had done all that could possibly be done at ND in modern CFB. The only program to win a national title in modern cfb comparable to Michigan is Ohio State in 2014, and the only way OSU could compete at the top level was to hire a coach that knew how to turn OSU into an SEC program, because that's the only way you can compete. Georgia showed Michigan very clearly how far they still need to go as a program to be at the level necessary to win it all, now it's just up to Harbaugh to decide if he's willing to adapt at UM or if he'd rather move back to the NFL where the game isn't rigged against the way he wants to play it.",10.0,nfl,t3_s8jods,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-01-20T08:37:26Z,tennesseetitans,0.0721900304259734

2415,19168,19168,Bieber_hole_69,"It's tough to see Tannehill get beaten up the amount that he does, but Burrow is on another level with how often he gets crushed every game. Burrow could have easily fallen into the David Carr panic from getting hit that much, but damn if he doesn't have uncoachable levels of toughness to just keep hanging in there and getting throws off while he knows he's going to be put in the dirt by an edge rusher before the ball even gets to his target.

Tannehill has the same thing, it never fails to amaze me when Tanne can manage to put enough on a deep shot while a defender is already wrapped around him. It's a real special part of their mental make-up, whether it be brave or stupid haha.

Of course with both of them it can turn into a negative in the wrong situations. Both of them take way more sacks than they should and take some huge hits that will add up one day. Being so unfazed by pressure barreling down in their faces also keeps Tannehill in particular have bad judgement in when to just throw the ball away and live to see the next down, he just doesn't know when to give up on the play.

It's really just a difference in instincts for a QB, someone like Mahomes feels pressure and can find where to move in and outside the pocket to extend the play while keeping his eyes downfield for off-schedule plays. This seems like the most sane and normal way to play, the immediate instinct for these QBs is trying not to get hit because it's not normal to be okay with getting drilled all the time. Whatever it is Tannehill and Burrow have though, self-preservation is somehow a switch turned off in their brain and pain is an afterthought to getting the pass off.

Unless the Bengals o-line drastically improves in the near future though, some of that is probably going to need some adjusting. It just is not sustainable or an offensive plan to let him keep getting hit like he has been, toughness can only get you through so many of them. It's a different type of this trait, but Andrew Luck had something similar with his refusal to slide or avoid contact when he ran the ball.

2416,19169,19169,Bieber_hole_69,"Man, I think Frank Reich isn't half bad as a coach even if he's a colt, but what man with a sane mind would be willing to tie their career to Carson Wentz like this? Reich and Ballard got basically a book of endless excuses when Luck retired and could bank on keeping their jobs for a while even if they weren't actually contending because they could spin it as just being a QB away and not their fault. They were content to use up most of their window while their best players were still on rookie deals to just spin the wheel of stopgap QB every year instead of actually solving the problem. But then when they finally decide to do something bold, it's a trade that the only positive outcome they could get depends entirely on Reich being able to fix the QB as broken as Wentz. What is it with Reich and only trying to bring in QBs he's coached before, is he not confident in his ability to develop a rookie? There's only so much the positive aspects of brining in a guy familiar with the system compared to the drawbacks that were the reason that QB was available in the first place. 

I understand Reich still has confidence in Wentz remaining from 2017, but I don't know how he could see Wentz get his old boss Pederson fired that quickly after he won a Super Bowl and say with any sincerity, ""Yeah, I want to be the guy who bets his job on him next. Sign me up for making the guy who threw a fit that the team took a backup high as insurance for his repeated injuries. Last year when he was making a show out of ignoring his coach's play calls and coaching because he was certain he knew better than them even when it was clear all of that was making him the worst QB in the league."" Did Reich even talk to Pederson about this before they made the trade? It's unfathomable to even consider putting everything in the hands of an uncatchable, selfish, pouty, ego-maniac like Wentz has shown himself to be.

I can only imagine what started going through Reich's mind when all the Covid vaccine stuff with Wentz happened. He wagered his career on Wentz being able to undo everything negative and before the season even starts he's so selfish he's not even willing to get a shot for competitive advantage. If he's not willing to get a fucking shot to eliminate the risk of QB1 being out for multiple games and derailing their season, is he really willing to put his ego aside and let Reich actually be the coach without constant pissing matches?

Looking back at our 2nd match-up with Indy, the only reason the Colts blew that game was because Wentz kept attempting passes. If Wentz spikes that ball on every pass attempt instead of having a meltdown, the Colts win that game. It seems pretty clear that there's no earthly reason why Reich would be throwing the ball that much regardless of how bad Wentz was doing, they needed to control the clock. There's every possibility Reich wasn't calling those passes though, Wentz thinking he knows better than everyone might have been killing the run plays and airing it out instead so he could control the game. Wentz has the worst of both worlds when it comes to the mental part of the game, he has absolutely terrible understanding and decision making while also being so confident in himself that he has zero hesitation in deciding that his way is the right choice even after those Wentz audible almost invariably lead to broken plays and disasters.",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_s1csz2,False,0.0,11,2022-01-11T08:43:05Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0466621027438273

2420,19174,19174,Bieber_hole_69,"That offensive performance against the Chiefs was something else, but I almost think a lot of that can be explained away by Spagnuolo just being the worst possible DC to play against this Bengals offense. Spags dialed up blitzes all game even when they were getting shredded by Chase when they left him in single coverage. It's truly baffling they didn't really do much to adjust to Chase taking the game over, but Spags is stubborn and I guess he was confident it would eventually start working.

The key against this Bengals offense is to pressure Burrow while only rushing 4. It's a necessity to have as many guys in coverage as possible, and dropping 7 will be pretty necessary frequently. The Bengals o-line is pretty bad in pass pro, they let Burrow get the shit kicked out of him every game seemingly. Burrow has about a fast a release and processing time as any QB out there, which that and his pocket presence/mobility are the thing keeping him alive behind that o-line.

2422,19176,19176,Bieber_hole_69,"Based on what Matt LaFleur and Arthur Smith have said about him, I think Vrabel spends significantly more time working on the offensive side of the ball than most would expect. It's probably shifted since Dean Pees left since he can't just rely on Pees to keep the defensive side running, but it seems like Vrabel was spending almost all of his time working on the offense in 2019 at least. He's had to cycle through 3 different OCs in 4 seasons now, but because of Vrabel and promoting from within there's never been any attempt to fix what isn't broken or change too much. Vrabel's one year as a defensive coordinator was lackluster, but I think his skillset as a coach is best used in a non-specialized role.

It's a cliche and overused, but Vrabel truly is a CEO coach. He understands the entirety of the game at an extremely high level and has his hands all over the team. Hell, he knows the rules so well he's already had one loophole closed by the league.

The biggest risk when hiring a head coach that doesn't call plays and isn't a genius of a single phase of the game is that they'll have to depend on having quality coordinators to have success. This leads to the trap of brain drain though, as if you have good coordinators they're going to get a head coaching job quickly. Vrabel has so far managed to maintain success while losing 3 coordinators for various reasons.

Edit: I gotta try to find the clip somewhere, but on Sean McVay's podcast with Peter Schrager they interviewed Arthur Smith for an episode during the off-season.

They told Mularkey as much as this before the game and that his job was not safe still and he did not react very well. He became even more upset with the FO after this leaked and it was reported that he was getting fired even though he still had a playoff game to coach.

After winning with a miraculous comeback in Kansas City the FO was pretty much caught with their hands tied. The team really did love Mularkey and after winning the playoff game the team made a show of how much they loved him and how they were playing so hard for him given they also had heard about his job status. They gave him the game ball and everything. They have to start changing their plans about firing him now, but Mularkey was not exactly in the mood to act nicely with the FO after all that had happened when they assumed he was going to lose.

Then they go out and get demolished by the Pats in the divisional round to let it known again that they aren't in the upper tier of the AFC. The FO still is trying to negotiate an agreement to get Mularkey back, but he clearly has the upper hand after all that had happened. The FO was content with keeping him if he agreed to change his extremely dated offensive scheme and fire OC Terry Robiskie. The FO also wanted to be involved in the decision to hire a new OC because they knew Mularkey would not ever willingly bring in an offensive scheme that moved beyond the year 1992.

Mularkey was loyal to his guy and refused to fire Robiskie. I think he wasn't willing to make any changes on the staff and wanted to bring the gang back since they made it to the playoffs and had a ""successful"" season. This is where they hit the impasse and neither side budged on this sticking point, so the FO finally decided they were just going to move on like they had always wanted to. Mularkey could also come away from it having not been fired in exact terms and instead parted ways mutually.

2437,19192,19192,Bieber_hole_69,"I think it probably has everything to do with the markets and how competitive the game is expected to be. Our opponent is the only thing that’s going to determine which day we play.

For 2019 Divisional round, for Vegas and most experts looking at the slate of games the Ravens were the clear safest team. At home against a 6-seed that squeaked into the playoffs and then won in the Wild Card round in less than convincing circumstances. I would assume Saturday night gets the lowest ratings of the weekend because it bumps up against the most opportunities for other entertainment viewers might have, so sticking the game expected to be worst is easy. 

For 2020, The Browns were a way different 6 seed than the Titans were the previous year. A regular season record good enough to win some other divisions and a huge win over the 2 seed the week before. And with the narrative surrounding the Browns breaking all of their playoff droughts, seeing them play the Chiefs is one of the dream games for the TV Execs so it was always locked into Sunday.

Honestly, I don’t really see any possible opponents we could have in the Divisional round that wouldn’t be in the lowest-tier for marketability. We have no rivals that made the playoffs other than the Steelers depending on how old you are and what you think of them. Vegas is the only real big market, but their market isn’t going to outweigh how unremarkable of a team with no stars they are to the general public. Cincy is a small market that doesn’t quite have top tier star power even if Burrow is getting close to it.

All the money they gave to Dion Lewis, though they did bring him in to be the feature back or at least split it evenly with Henry before DH took the job firmly by the end of 2018. A third round pick on Darrynton Evans as a guy that can fill the 3rd down and also take a few carries off Henry's plate. Neither worked out, with Evans being just bad injury luck that nobody could have predicted and Lewis just being a disastrous signing. After both those misses I guess they just said screw it, Henry can be RB1 and RB2 after he looked invincible last year.

Now though, it looks like they've filled that role with a guy that was out of football until November. For those few carries they need to take off Henry's workload every game we only really need the RB2 to be 50-60% of Henry. Foreman definitely fits that requirement and then some. They tried for so long to find a change of pace RB to pair with Henry, but what they always needed was someone that ran the same way as Henry. The o-line can work the same way, the playcalling can stay the same, the personnel packages can stay the same, Foreman just fits perfectly into the gameplan and the pairing works just as well as Murray-Henry did for the same reasons.

Henry is the exception to not paying or investing in running backs, but it's a mistake that the Titans tried to invest in another running back along with Henry for so long.

She had told him about me and that I might try to come by, so it wasn't a surprise and he was genuinely hoping I would make it sometime.

I finally made it down to see him in time just as he had finished eating and was getting ready to leave sometime in 2009. I got to meet him, shake his hand, talk to him for a bit, and got his autograph on a bar napkin. He was a really nice guy and seemed excited that I was a Titans fan because of him. I had dislocated my hip playing football the previous season and we talked about that, he was surprised I was still willing to play football after that haha. He's also a massive guy, every bit of the 6'3"" he was listed at while he was playing.

I still have that napkin he signed framed somewhere, I'm planning to hang it up next to the signed Jevon Kearse SI cover I found on Ebay a few years ago. It was a real highlight of my childhood to meet him, and he's a really cool guy for entertaining a kid like that. His jersey and McNair's jersey are the only two that I own now still. Sidenote, his restaurant sucked and closed down a few years ago, glad I did not meet him there.

2455,19211,19211,Bieber_hole_69,"You really need a GM that is exceptionally bad at drafting to stay that bad for so long. If you get enough high picks, you're bound to hit on some good players just by sheer luck. The Jags have drafted some great players with all of their high draft picks, they just can't manage to keep them satisfied enough to sign a second contract and they have to trade them for even more draft capital. Even the Jags won two playoff games during their absurd futility, for one season there was just too much talent on that team to suck.

You just have to have a GM as supremely horrible at drafting as Matt Millen to sustain being terrible. You have to make the worst possible pick in basically every draft for your 1st round selection. Even when the Jags manage to draft a great player that they can't keep for longer than 4 seasons, they can still trade them for a haul of picks that could maybe become good players too. Millen though, he managed to take guys that sucked so much they couldn't bring in a return that could be used for a rebuild. Roy Williams was the only guy that got a decent return, and even then that was such a disastrous trade for Dallas. Millen managed to get players that weren't worth anything outside of a few exceptions.

Obviously the broken clock was finally right when he took Calvin Johnson, but even that took the Raiders picking Russell 1st overall. If the Raiders had wised up for even a second and realized that drafting the guy who lied about watching the blank DVD of film you gave him at the combine was a bad idea and that they should take the guy who has the potential to be Randy Moss but bigger, Millen would have an even worse resume.

Most of the time the biggest issue for teams picking in the top 10 for several years in a row is that eventually they have to start giving out 2nd contracts to them and they don't have enough money for it. The 49ers having to trade DeForest Buckner is one of those instances, a team with all those picks will eventually have *too* much talent for their own good.

2458,19214,19214,Bieber_hole_69,"Colt seems like a perfect 3rd stringer or Covid practice squad QB for Kyler. Someone great to have on the sideline with a clipboard and headset on gamedays and in meetings on weekdays. It's perfect for the Cards and it's probably great for McCoy if he wants to get into coaching after he retires. His time with McVay in Washington also probably adds a lot as well, he's familiar with the cutting edge offenses that the whole league is trying to move towards. He's also got to be great to have for the defensive staff when game planning for the 49ers and Rams given his time with McVay and that Shanahan tree.

For you guys also I'd say that if McSorely doesn't show enough to warrant a look over McCoy while Kyler is injured that it might be time to look elsewhere for a QB or move him to the practice squad. He fits some of what Kyler can do skillset wise, but after having RGIII and Colt McCoy play over him now in his 3rd season I think he may not be worth it as a project QB to stash and take up a roster spot. Was a McSorely package even considered while McCoy was starting to get someone other than McCoy those QB run snaps instead? That's pretty damning if they'd rather let the 35 year-old that ran a 4.79 40-yard dash over a decade ago take the QB run snaps over a guy who's biggest asset is his legs in McSorely.

After this year and think McCoy has played himself into getting some contract offers to be a back-up if he wants them and wants a shot at playing. I think it would be perfect for both sides though if he stayed on with the Cards as QB3/PS QB. He's earned some time on a good team to end his career haha, I can't believe he was willing to sign with the Giants last year at age 34 if there were any other offers out there.

Similar thing with Minshew too, I think he's earned himself a look as a starter again somewhere, or at least as a QB2 with a chance to win the job. He won't get that in Arizona, and knowing him I am sure all he wants is an opportunity to be the starter somewhere.",2.0,nfl,t3_rwswl8,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-01-05T14:52:23Z,tennesseetitans,0.0484831475335068
2459,19215,19215,Bieber_hole_69,"I think it might be different if Meyer was still the HC and was told he would be kept for 2022 like Baalke. For the players and people around the organization I think getting Meyer out was priority #1 and they'll just live with everything else. Baalke isn't making the locker room hate him more and more every day like Meyer lol. I'm sure some guys that didn't want anything to do with playing for the Jags after this year if Meyer was still the coach also want to play it cool with the front office now. In a situation where players know there's going to be total turnover in staff and FO I'm sure they know there's a slim chance they'll be back for long with the new regime, but Baalke staying might be enough to show some hope for job security since he's been a part of building this roster under Caldwell and with Meyer. With Lawrence in particular, if he wanted Baalke gone I'm sure Shad Khan would choose his franchise QB over a GM that can be replaced way more easily. If Lawrence wanted to talk shit about Baalke, his job wouldn't really be at risk, but I guess there's not really a benefit to voicing anything if he doesn't have some serious issues with him.

Just thinking about this is interesting, it's pretty rare to see players actively showing discontent with a GM as far as I can remember. It's probably just as bad for job security to criticize a coach as it is a GM, I don't think a GM would keep around a player clashing with their HC just as they wouldn't keep a player they have issue with. I guess it might be like someone at an office job having a grudge with their direct manager but not having any serious issues with the VP above their manager. Harder to have material problems with someone you don't really interact with day-to-day and you can't see first-hand how they're working. Players can easily judge if they think a coach is good or not, they probably can't judge a GMs transactions as easily. 

I remember Ryan Grigson getting shit on by Colts players, but he was a special level of asshole that did all he could to fuck with players, fining players for stupid shit like Grigson did is the quickest way to make a locker room hate you no matter what job you have. Even then, I don't remember much of what Grigson go trashed for being about how the poorly built roster he made got Andrew Luck killed every drop back. Grigson could have built an o-line as good as what Ballard has done and he would have still been hated by the players if he kept up the kind of behavior that made McAfee retire.

I also wonder how much players would blame the GM for lack of success on the field or a bad roster, they might just see it as an issue of other players or coaches not performing up to par rather than a talent issue in the way fans might. Getting close with your teammates and seeing them work in practice all season might give a different view of their ability than just seeing them in games against outside competition. I can't remember hearing many players complain that the team just doesn't have talent, the GM picked them along with all their teammates, that probably gives a really positive skew to how a player sees the GMs talent evaluation skill. If their GM is building a shitty roster, you're one of those shitty players too if you're on his team and I'm sure most players have too much confidence to even consider that they're not a great signing/draft pick.

I guess maybe players just have to trust that their GM is doing a good job. If the team is shit and the GM gets fired, the players are probably gone with him so it won't make it any better for the players if the GM loses his job. The relationship players have with GMs is probably so limited and business-centered that it might just be pointless to start levying criticism.",67.0,nfl,t3_rwuui3,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-01-05T14:28:56Z,tennesseetitans,-0.031459936455759
2460,19216,19216,Bieber_hole_69,"I would think maybe the Cards could try looking for a QB that at least plays a bit similar to Kyler. Obviously nobody could play that close to Kyler, but something like what the Ravens have with Huntley behind Lamar.

Colt McCoy obviously knows the air raid backbone of Kliff's offense, but I just think it wouldn't be too hard to find someone that is familiar with the air raid while also sharing at least some of Kyler's playmaking ability. 

Imo Minshew might be perfect. Played and excelled under the Leach system for his year at Wazzou. He was at ECU after McNeil and Riley were gone, but having seen very little of ECU in 2016-17, I can't imagine Scottie Montgomery and staff changed up the offense that much from the air raid base that Minshew had signed on for when he transferred. And while not an athlete anywhere near Kyler's ability, Minshew can still move around well and make plays off schedule.

I'm still kind of surprised the Cards didn't make a trade for Minshew or outbid the Eagles. He seems like the perfect fit to be the back-up there, and with Kyler's injury history it seems important for them to invest in that role. Colt McCoy played admirably this year for being a 35 year old journeyman, but Minshew might not require as much of a change in the gameplan when Kyler is out.",3.0,nfl,t3_rwswl8,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-01-05T13:48:27Z,tennesseetitans,0.0529049042669

2464,19220,19220,Bieber_hole_69,"Jimmy G would pretty much have to take a pay cut and restructure his deal to get traded out of San Fran next year. He could take something similar, but not as extreme as the restructure Tannehill took when he was traded from Miami to Tennessee.

Turn the last year of his current contract into basically a one-year deal that's less money, 100% guaranteed, and has significant incentives. 49ers take a portion of the money and the team trading for him takes on the rest of the money as a signing bonus. 49ers still don't have to pay Lance a full QB salary yet so they can take on some of the money to facilitate it and get something in return for Jimmy G instead paying his full salary and letting him walk after the season so they can get more in return than the comp pick he might earn them.

It's pretty much a stop-gap with the possibility of being more for whatever team trades for him. They're only tied to him for 2022, if he still stinks it's not an issue in the future. If he's really good and the team wants to keep him, he can be franchise tagged if they want him to prove it again or they can negotiate before he hits the FA market.

For the Browns, I guess it's just a question of how much it's really worth it to swap Baker for Jimmy G? They're both off the books in 2022 if you want to move on. With a restructure Jimmy probably makes similar money to Baker in 2022. If you flip Baker as part of the corresponding moves you'd probably get more draft capital for Baker than you would have to spend on Jimmy G depending on how the money works for San Fran. Age and a weak draft class would push the market for Baker probably.

2465,19221,19221,Bieber_hole_69,"Only way I could see them moving on is if Joe Judge gets desperate enough that he tries to buy some time by drafting a QB in the top 5. They have two 1st rounders if they need to move up to get a premier guy in this lackluster QB draft with the Jags at 1 not needing QBs and wanting to stockpile picks instead.

They don't have the cap space to even think about getting a QB in free agency or via trade unless they really work some magic with their cap. They'd also just have to get rid of Jones to fit a different expensive QB on the roster, and I don't know what the market for Jones looks like unless they sweeten a deal with somebody. They also have to make the 5th year option decision on Jones this off-season, I would guess they'd have to trade him before the deadline for that decision so whoever they send him to isn't locked into anything. The Panthers picking up Darnold's option after trading him might spook some teams out of doing anything that ties them to Jones if they trade for him.

I just can't see any new GM letting Judge alter the future of the team that drastically though. Unless the GM is a stooge for Judge, they're going to just force Judge to play it out next year with Jones and then when they both almost assuredly strike out again next season have the flexibility to move on from both and start fresh in 2023 with the new GM's pick at HC and QB.

With how hamstrung they are with the cap, how bad the roster is, how bad Judge is, and whatever you think of Jones, it's not an attractive job for any GM.

Can't shit on the fans because it's impossible to give any reason why their frustration isn't warranted after the awful results. Can't shit on the GM since he's been given assurance that he's coming back and Bevell probably wants to at least interview for the permanent HC job and to save face since this is the third straight job he's had that has ended in fiasco.

I do feel pretty bad for Bevell, he's had to work clean up as interim HC in two straight seasons now for two coaches that were both fucking disasters and complete assholes to the press. Both jobs probably seemed like they would be low-key when he took them, both are smaller media markets/fan bases and might have seemed perfect for him to sink back into obscurity after being public enemy #1 for a time in Seattle. Both coaches he got hired to work under were on pretty secure, long-term deals and had power within the organization because they were hot commodities and came from winning backgrounds. There's no way he thought either job could be such a shitshow that quickly, he probably thought at minimum both of those coaches would have 4 or 5 seasons before the hot seat would even be considered let alone getting canned mid-season.

He's had to take over two lockers rooms that hated their head coach's guts by the time they got fired. Maybe that's a positive factor though, it's gotta be easier to ingratiate yourself with the players as an interim when you are taking over for a guy that players are elated to be done seeing at work every day.

Honestly, I would guess that Bevell would much prefer the Jags fans being apathetic and not caring enough to even go to this final game. Baalke staying on is the only stability he's had since Seattle given how quickly it turned for Patricia after Bevell took that OC job in 2019.

They very easily could have packed it in after Henry went down and ended up getting passed in the division by the Colts when they started to surge. Being able to keep it together and string together the two wins against LA and NO after Henry's injury is maybe the defining part of the team's season, it allowed for the cushion to keep the season from going totally off the rails when the flukey turnover and bad weather slump happened in November.

The new IR rules from COVID really saved the Titans season in a lot of ways, who knows if they would have been confident enough in Henry to hold out for him being able to return to use their only designation to return from IR slot if this were still the old IR rules. The sheer amount of injuries probably would have forced the Titans to shut down Julio for the season when both he and AJ Brown were out because they would need the roster spot for a replacement WR. Jackrabbit might have been IR'd when the injuries in the secondary piled up and he was out for a few weeks. This situation the Titans have found themselves in is maybe the first time something this extreme has happened because the old IR rules would have pretty much made it impossible, this amount of injuries during the season is now survivable if the key players that get hurt can somehow manage to not go down with season-enders.

It would have made a world of difference in 2019 for the Titans if they could have brought Malcolm Butler back for the playoffs from IR once his broken wrist was healed enough to play through. Instead they used their only return from IR designation on Ryan Succop coming back from injury too early because the team was so desperate to keep the kicking game from holding the them back. It backfired completely and cost the team Succop, the IR designation, and they still had the worst kicking season in modern NFL history. Meanwhile they had to IR Butler for an injury he could return from to free up a roster spot they needed just to field enough players in the secondary during a must-win stretch to even make the playoffs.

I don't think Robinson getting more carries changes the outcome of this game either, but it at least keeps the Lawrence from throwing it 40 times and forcing a few of those interceptions.",8.0,nfl,t3_rfin72,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2021-12-13T09:55:53Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0042943202018737

2480,19257,19257,Bieber_hole_69,"What a great get-right game, exactly the way to respond after the back-to-back losses and playing against an inferior opponent. 

In a lot of ways this game put to rest the worst of my fears after the last two games, it's all about turnovers. I still felt just as good about this team going into the bye as I did during the win streak because they weren't playing awful football against Houston or NE, they just played such sloppy football. If you go -9 in TO differential over two games, you aren't going to win much no matter how well you play otherwise. I think it's also been a bit understated the circumstances in those two losses as well, getting two teams coming off long rest in back-to-back games is a really unlucky schedule quirk that sets up any team for failure. Compound that with bad weather in both games, and it's even easier to explain those games away. It they were even -1 or -2 in TO differential those two weeks, they probably win one or both of those games.

Coming out of the bye week, they played close to mistake-free football. No turnovers, 4 takeaways, +64 in penalty yards, and almost +14 minutes in ToP. They let a poorly coached and undisciplined team give the game away, and they didn't leave any opportunities to give it back.

Getting under 300 yards in total offense isn't ideal, but that Jags defense is still pretty good and has a DC that has shown he belongs in Joe Cullen. Everyone remembers what that Jags defense did to the Bills, they're pretty talented and can still wreck games every few weeks. They want to play physical upfront, and they did. The sacks are the most worrying issue coming out of this game, the pass protection is still just so inconsistent. Seeing Julio back is great of course, and I'm glad the gameplan wasn't centered around him, it's good to give him a week back where he can get some touches while also getting acclimated after a month off. I'll also take the RB performances just because the ball security was much improved, that mattered most to me.

To me AJ Brown is almost as big of a loss to this team, if not just as big of a loss, as Henry. AJB just unlocks this offense and everything they want to do in the passing game. Julio is Julio of course, but this offense is never going to run through him. When you think about what this Titans offense since 2019 has done best, what the go-to play is when they need yards would be, it's something over the middle to AJ Brown off play-action. Henry or not, that's what this offense has consistently been the best at. 11 personnel with a bunch trips set on one side, max-protection, play-action pass with AJ Brown running a glance route. 12 personnel, max-protection, play-action pass with yankee concept and AJ Brown running the intermediate crosser. Taking those plays out of the offense really cuts at the identity of this offense in a similar way to losing 30 Henry carries a game, it's what the ceiling of the offense is built on while Henry is the floor.

What can you even say about this defense when you have Buster fucking Skrine starting a game and it turns out incredibly well? In the off-season and early in the season I was very high on the potential of this defense. I thought it would take some time to mesh, especially with the amount of turnover in the back-end, but I thought as the season went on this would become a completely different defense. I never could have dreamed they would be this good though, and while still down starters! I thought this could be a defense that would be good enough to not fuck up what the offense was doing, which was the case last season, but I never thought they'd be carrying the team like this at any point. Getting Long, Dupree, Jenkins, and Cunningham in the mix soon, and this can be a defense that's winning us playoff games, not just shutouts against the Jags.

Through 11 games we're right where we were last year, 9-4. I feel so much better about this team than I did last year's team at 9-4 though. Last year they were as good as they were going to be in October, they peaked at a time when it didn't really matter.

I've assumed since last year that Evans would be gone next year, but he's played pretty well in a few recent games.

It actually ended up being the difference maker for the Titans to win that game, it was one of the games Mariota missed with nerve damage and both starting tackles missed with injury. So having to start Blaine Gabbert playing behind the 3rd and 4th tackles limited what the Titans could do throwing the ball on offense to exclusively plays where Gabbert gets the ball out of his hands within 2 seconds, anything more and it was guaranteed to end in disaster. The biggest highlight for Gabbert that game was actually [illegally threw two forward passes on the same play](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/9/19/17874680/blaine-gabbert-2-incomplete-passes-tennessee-titans-review) and then believably explained it as a 200 IQ move in the post-game press conference.

Vrabel knew the team would need to manufacture whatever big plays they possibly could given how limited the offense would be, and it just so happened they were playing the Texans, a team he was DC for the prior year. 

For whatever reason Bill O'Brien and the Texans did not think to change up as much as they could for a game against the guy that knows the most about what they do and how they do it in the league that was not on their own sideline. From his time coaching there Vrabel knew the Texans had a pre-snap look for punt returns where they would show their normal punt return personnel, but then bring their outside defenders down to the edge of the O-Line to leave the gunners on the outside uncovered. Most teams not expecting to see this would move their gunners inside and switch into punt safe as a response, giving the Texans a match-up advantage on the edge. Or if the punt unit just left their gunners out wide, suddenly there are 10 punt rushers lined up against 8 blockers. It's a win-win for the Texans the few times they would dial it up. 

In prep for that game Vrabel installed that fake punt and gave Byard as the personal protector the all-clear to audible into a pass to the completely uncovered gunners if the Texans ever ran that look. Somehow the Texans still chose to show that look, and the Titans took advantage of it.",7.0,nfl,t3_rbr6vt,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2021-12-08T10:31:22Z,tennesseetitans,0.0175259155722288

2487,19264,19264,Bieber_hole_69,"They've used it pretty often as one of their sub-packages for mostly short yardage situations.I think it started in 2019 with Arthur Smith and I can't remember LaFleur ever running it in 2018.

Henry threw the TD pass to Corey Davis out of it in the 2019 Divisional Round, one of two TD passes Henry has ever thrown out of it. Most of the time it's just a direct snap dive to Henry, so not much fancy stuff going on except for when they pull out the pass or a counter, reverse, or fake-reverse.

The Henry wildcat dive was pretty much the Titans' go-to playcall when they were goal-to-go and *needed* a TD. It won them a game against the Texans in 2020 when Henry scored the game winning TD in OT on it. In those goal-to-go situations, I can't really ever think of a time it didn't work. That one Henry TD pass made it way, way, way more successful going forward since teams finally had to respect the pass and couldn't put 9 or 10 guys in the box. Downing got cute and started calling wildcat stuff on 2nd and 10 from their own 35 early in the season, but he stopped it pretty quickly.

They've never done it before, but I've always thought they might have a play for Tannehill as a WR buried somewhere for when they might really need it. Currently he just does the normal QB wildcat assignment of going out wide and standing still to avoid the play.

Earlier this season before he tore his ACL, Downing was using Cam Batson as the wildcat QB sometimes too, which brought in a horizontal element that the Henry wildcat stuff never had

Once Mariota was on the bench in 2019 they actually did some pretty cool stuff using him as a kind of wildcat look with him as the sub-QB. He threw a pass in the Pats Wild Card game from it to get that on film, and then split out like a standard wildcat QB to clear out a direct snap to Henry, who then threw the pass instead and totally caught Baltimore off guard.

The Titans probably do use wildcat more than any other team in the NFL, but even then it's mostly as a short yardage match-up formation for power runs. The biggest positive the Titans probably get from the wildcat stuff is keeping it on film so teams have to spend time on it in practice, or they can add in a different wrinkle for almost a trick-play.",7.0,nfl,t3_rb7buy,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2021-12-07T13:45:55Z,tennesseetitans,0.0400596381623006

Don't go to Hattie B's unless you just like the whole tourist vibe. My choice would be Red's 615 for hot chicken. It's literally a concrete brick shack that you walk up to (no indoor seating) but imo it's the best in town. Try the hot chicken crunch wrap.

 Grab your food there and walk across the street to centennial park to eat. Lots of picnic tables and stuff.

You'll probably see this huge Greek looking building, that's the Parthenon. It's a to scale replica of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. Tickets are cheap to get in and there is a museum underneath all about Tennessee and Nashville Definitely worth the stop.

If you want to do the whole Broadway experience, go after the game and it will be packed so lots of people but good environment. It's not everyone's cup of tea but it's kind of the standard for out of towner's here.

Also if you get a chance go see some live music.(not big artists) Doesn't matter if you don't know the band, doesn't matter if you haven't planned. We have TONS of local venues that have amazing talent playing every single night. Tickets are usually less than $20 for local venues like basement east, marathon music works etc. Support local artists, you'll meet some great people at these shows and who knows you may see the next big thing. If you are into smoky low lit jazz clubs, Rudy's is GREAT. Definitely get tickets in advance seating is limited but the drink menu is phenomenal and they have great Cajun food too.

Five daughters bakery has great donuts, cocos Italian is superb, and princes hot chicken is the OG (or Bolton's depending on who is telling the story)

Also if you're looking to kill time the game terminal is a HUGE arcade. All of the arcade machines are free to play, they also have a ton of pinball machines that are pay to play but if you go in there and get $20 worth of tokens you'll be good for hours.

NWI lead off the first player availability of the new league year.

Honestly NWI is a huge part of this team. He was our most consistent reciever last year, Busts his ass on special teams, and blocks well in the run game. I agree that he leaves alot to be desired in the passing game. But at this point he is our best shot at WR1 ok opening day.

4739,33292,33292,ColorblindSquid,"Our defense as a whole has improved mightily from the 2020 season where we were historically bad in both 3rd down defense and pass rush.

&#x200B;

DL

\#96 DE Denico Autry IMO the best free agent signing of the offseason. He can play both inside and outside. Has great power and length. Makes everyone around him better. He is the engine of the front 4

\#98 Jeffery Simmons aka Big Jeff. A young and blossoming start that took a gigantic leap forward this year. Is most likely the best player on the entire defense and a top 3 player on the team. He effects the entire LOS. Sheds blocks well and has the power to completely pancake guys. Stops the run very effectively and is a monster on goalline and short yardage plays. This year he has added a plethora of pass rushing tools to his arsenal making him a much more dangerous player. Consistently pushes and collapses pockets. Makes great plays with his hand to knock down balls at the LOS. Complete Pro Bowl Snub. 

\#58 OLB Harold Landry III aka Honor Landry, Greg Landry. A consistent beast that is always on the field and always around the ball. He is currently in a contract year and leads the titans with 12 sacks. Has elite speed/bend to get around the Tackles and get to the QB. A home grown talent having developed from a titans 2rd round pick back in 2018. A priority to sign/tag this offseason

\#48 OLB Bud Dupree The biggest FA signing on the Defense this offseason, Bud is one of the most impactful players on the field. Coming off of knee injury last year he is recently coming into his own. Was in and out of the lineup to start the year due to rehabbing his knee. The defense is night and day with him in the lineup. Has great power and plays the run very well.

&#x200B;

LBs

\#41 Zach Cunnigham. Spending his first few years in the league with division rivals the Houston Texans, Titan fans got to know cunningham well. An elite down hill tackler that has great sideline to sideline ability. Recently added to the Titans roster from waivers 3 weeks ago, cunningham has made an immediate impact playing both the run and pass well. He is under contract until 2024 so look for him to be a part of this titans defense for a long time.

\#51 David Long jr A 6th round pick in 2019, David Long has blossomed into the Titans best all around LB. He flys around the field and has a knack for being around and finding the football. David Long and Cunningham will be the LB duo of the future for this team.

\#55 Jayon Brown. Set to be a free agent at the end of last season, he decided to return to the titans for one more year. He is our best coverage LB, If he isn't on the field for 1st and 2nd down, he will be for 3rd down. Very Athletic with great coverage skills. Set to be a free agent after this season.

\#54 Rashaan Evans The former 1st round pick from Alabama hasn't done much to impress titans fans in his 4 years here. He plays the inside run well but doesn't have the sideline to sideline ability of Cunningham nor is he a factor in the pass game. You will either see him making a fantastic downhill tackle to stop the runner at the LOS or you will see him running in circles trying to play coverage. Has played his best football this year especially when you pair him with cunningham. That being said he is still the worst LB of the 4. He is in a contract year and I would not expect the titans to resign him.

&#x200B;

DBs

\#20 CB Jackrabbit Jenkins aka Janoris Jenkins, Rabbit. Part of the large turnover of the defense, Jenkins came to the titans this offseason. He is a solid veteran presence that relies mostly on his game IQ to make plays. Not as athletic as younger corners but still able to hold his own against most receivers in the league. Over the past few weeks has been playing his best football of the season.

\#26 CB Kristian Fulton aka Fulton Prison. The 2nd year player from LSU has taken a huge step and is starting to live up to his draft hype. After sitting out most of last year with an injury or playing in the slot, Fulton was moved to the outside this season and hasn't looked back. Fulton can hang with some of the best recievers and flashes greatness. Still a young talent who needs refining, but is on his way to becoming a top 10 CB.

\#24 CB Elijah Molden. The most impactful rookie from this years draft class, Molden is our slot specialist. He hits hard and always finds a way to get the football. Molden still gets beat due to his inexperience, but plays good fundamental football and makes tackles in open space.

\#3 CB Caleb Farley **INJURED** Farley was the Titan's first round pick of the 2021 draft. Arguably a top 5 talent, he fell all the way to the Titans due to injury concern. Is a very raw talent who will need alot of coaching, but has all pro potential. Suffered a season ending ACL injury in mid october.

\#31 FS Kevin Byard *Pro Bowl* former All-Pro aka The Mayor of Mufreesboro. A complete ballhawk who has an argument for the best Safety in the league. Byard is the Leader of the secondary and one of the leaders of this team. Byard is always making the play when others aren't and he always finds a way to get an interception. Byard is a homegrown talent going to college up the round at MTSU. He was a third round draft pick in 2016 and has done nothing but impress since being here. Is a Lynch Pin for this defense and is truly great.

\#37 SS Amani Hooker He took over the Strong Safety position this year and has been very impressive. Has good coverage skills and plays the run well. You will also see him come on safety blitzes. Byard and Hooker rank among the best safety duos in the entire league.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ill go ahead and fit special teams and coaches into this comment as well.

&#x200B;

\#14 Randy Bullock aka Phat Randy, Big Bones Bullock Coming in as a fill in kicker Bullock has really impressed titan fans and coaches in his effectiveness. He doesn't have the biggest leg, but is accurate when in range and is a reliable kicker. Has had some bad misses this year, but overall he deserves his spot on this roster.

&#x200B;

\#6 Brett Kern aka MVPunter  The greatest player in fanchise history and frankly leauge history. I mean what is not to like about this guy. He kicks a damn good football and is singlehandedly carrying us to a superbowl. On a more serious note the former all-pro pro bowl punter is one of the best in the league. He is currently the longest tenured Titan playing with the this franchise since 2009. He has truly seen some dark days for this franchise. But when you need a clutch punt, he is always there. One of his greatest punts was 2 years ago in the playoffs against the patriots. Pinned Brady within his own 5 yard line that setup up the ensuing game clinching pick-6, Brady's last pass as a patriot.

&#x200B;

\#80 WR/PR/KR Chester Rodgers. Your average return man. Has made some boneheaded plays this year but has also made some big plays. Is much more dangerous as a PR.

\#81 WR/Gunner Racey McMath. This rookie has made big contributions as a gunner on Punt teams. When Kern needs someone deep to stop the punt from becoming a touchback you can trust Racey will be there to either down the ball or make the tackle.

&#x200B;

Coaches

&#x200B;

HC Mike Vrabel. The 4th year Head Coach has done nothing but impress since the day he arrived. He preaches fundamental physical football and the team takes on that identity. A Very probable Coach of the Year candidate, what he has done with a depleted roster is nothing less than impressive. A true leader of men and I personally hope he sticks around for a long, long time. Also would cut his penis off for a superbowl.

OC Todd Downing He has had some ups and downs this year, but it is hard to judge his entire season due to the amount of injuries that have happened on the offensive side of the ball. I don't see the Titans moving away from downing in the offseason.

DC Shane Bowen A young defensive mind, he was elevated to run Mike Vrabel's Defense and he has run it WELL. The defensive turnaround this year from historically bad is very impressive and I would not be surprised if another team poached him as a Head Coaching Candidate.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This year the Tennessee Titans have fielded the most number of active players in NFL History at 89. This is due to injury and covid. 89 individual players have suited up and played a game as a titan this year. I will not be running through every one of these, but I will highlight the big names and the important role players. If you ever just want names you can check the current depth chart here : [https://www.tennesseetitans.com/team/depth-chart](https://www.tennesseetitans.com/team/depth-chart)

&#x200B;

Offense:

QB: #17 Ryan Tannehill aka Tannewheels, Tannethrill, Mr Finger Roll. He was originally drafted by the Dolphins but came over in 2019. He overtook Marcus Mariota as QB midway through the season and the franchise hasn't looked back since. While is isn't flashy like Mahomes or Rodgers he is very good at his job and is efficient. 

&#x200B;

RBs

 \#22 Derrick Henry aka tractorcito, The King, DH2k, MVP, Stiff arm GOD. **Currently injured**. Actual god among men on the football field. One of only 8 rushers in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season. The undisputed best player on our team and a top 5 player in the nfl. Had foot surgery on November 1st to repair his 5th metatarsal from a Jone's Fracture. Is healed and set to return to action within the next few weeks

\#7 D'onta Foreman aka Henry jr. FA pickup after Henry went down. Has done his best to impersonate the King. has 3 100 yard games out of his last 5. A very solid fill in and backup to henry.

\#28 Jeremy McNichols. 3rd down and passing back. We use him for protection and screen passes. Decent YAC ability.

\#41 Khari Blasingame. Technically a FB. Used to pave the way for the King and does a fantastic job. He is a big part of why our run game is top 5

&#x200B;

WRs

\#11 A.J Brown aka Arthur Juan Brown. AJ1k. The best WR on our team and a complete game changer for our offense. Has had trouble staying healthy, but when he plays he changes our offense into a much more dynamic unit. Tannehill's Favorite Target

\#15 Nick Westbrook-Ikhine. Coming into this season as WR#6 he has been thrust into a starting role with injuries mounting on the outside. He is mainly a possesion reciever, lacks YAC ability but has good hands. Look for him to sit down in soft zones and provide tannehill with easy targets. He also contributes a lot on special teams

\#2 Julio Jones Hard to say that he has been much more than a disappointment this season. Was our big FA acquisition on the offensive side of the ball. The future HOF has yet to build great rapport with Tannehill due to how injured he has been. Hard to count on him to bounce back but all it takes is one good game and the church of Julio will rise from the ashes

&#x200B;

OL

\#77 LT Taylor Lewan aka Dad. The most outspoken and flamboyant personality on the team. The pro bowl LT tore his ACL last season and was working back from injury for the early part of this season. Has missed some games due to injury but overall our best lineman as of late. He relies on his athleticism to make plays and protect the backside of tannehill. A great runblocker as well, look for him to tell Vrabel to ""run left"".

\#76 LG Roger Saffold When available he is the best run blocker on the offensive line. Has a lingering shoulder issue, but tries to tough it out most games. 

\#60 C Ben Jones The glue of the Offensive line and the real brains behind that unit. Does an excellent job calling protections and making sure everyone is on the same page. Talks barefoot pregame walks on the field in any weather.

\#64  RG Nate Davis A young up and coming guard who is a mauler in the run game. Can be very streaky at times but is playing solid as of late. He is usually out in front making way for the King on big inside runs.

\#72 RT David Quessenberry  The weakest link in the OL. He can hold his own in runblocking but pass protection is poor and gets beat alot. Has had solid games, but is mainly playing due to the titan's inability to address the RT position. 

\#75 T/G Dillon Radunz  The tians 2nd round pick in 2021, he has underwhelmed so far. He started at LT against san Francisco and held his own with a solid performance. Is definitely in the plans for the future of this team he is just Raw and needs further development to blossom into a full time starter.

&#x200B;

TE

\#87 Geoff Swaim Not the greatest TE in the league, but can make some plays. Look for him to contribute as a blocker and catch short passes or as a redzone threat. 

\#86 Anthony Firkser Taking a step back from his very efficient 2020 campaign, Firkser can't seem to break through the be a consistent productive player. His blocking is worse than Swaim, but is a much better reciever. Titans mainly use him as a pass catching tight end

4780,33344,33344,ColorblindSquid,"our ability to get pressure consistently with 4 is what is saving our defense. I think Denico Autry has been far an away our best addition this offseason. It is also very telling that Greg Mabin was starting and playing every single snap while Borders played none. Maybe that is to match the raw speed of the chiefs receivers. Also cruikshank shutting down kelce was NOT something that I had on my bingo card for this week.

&#x200B;

offensively the first half was what we have been waiting for this season, and that is STILL with julio not being 100%. The cheifs sold out to stop the run, so Tannehill carved them up overtop.  It was pretty concerning though that we were shutout in the second half. I know we were really just milking the clock, but I wouldn't have minded another TD just to solidify our win. 

&#x200B;

Special teams was actually not a detriment today. Kern hitting two of the best punts I've seen just reminds me of how much of an asset he is. 2 punts inside the 5? With both of them being 100% on him (not the gunners making a play). Return game was nothing special but at least they weren't kicking it short on purpose like last week.

4789,33359,33359,ColorblindSquid,"Goddamn this team just doesn't die. That factor alone makes Titans Football exciting. I saw last night that we have the most 4th quarter comebacks since 2018 of any team. IMO that comes from the top. Give him shit all you want about his defensive scheme but Mike Vrabel KNOWS how to be a head coach. And he's a damn good one at that. 

Our defense was SITUATIONALLY great, but overall not very good. In the times where we NEEDED a stop, we got it. But I'm still worried. It seems like on at least half of the plays, especially in the secondary, there was a lot of confusion. It might've been simply stemming from all the new guys thrown in there but it still wasn't a good look. We wouldn't get lined up fast enough, and when we would drop into zone it always seemed like noone knew who they should cover. Our secondary worries the hell out of me.

On the flip side...  Do we have a pass rush??? It seems like on the majority of plays we were pushing the pocket and making Allen make quick decisions on his throws. IMO the only reason they were able to throw as much was simply because Allen is playing really good football right now and is making very nice, decisive throws. A worse QB gets dominated last night.

 A very very solid game from our front 7. Denico Autry had a stellar game, Honor was all over the place, Dupree had a couple of really nice plays (blowing up the screen with a tip on a pivitol drive), Tart had a couple of really good pocket pushing moments, bledsoe with the tipped ball, and who could forget Big Jeff having one of his best games. 

Out LB's played decent enough overall. Long was playing VERY well sideline to sideline. I remember his closing speed on a screen play, that was a GREAT hustle play. And dare I say that Evans even had some shining moments? If Evans plays well, this team can go places. Is he finally putting it together? Now there definitely were some plays that he was a non-factor. But the play where Allen rolled to his left and was trying to push it into the end zone, he played that perfectly. Stood his ground and kept square while forcing the QB out of bounds. 

KB played great yet again, really glad to see him return to form. I didn't notice hooker all that much, but sometimes as a DB that is a good thing. Especially since he was in coverage most of the night. Allen might not have tested him. 

Offense turned it ON in the second half. I don't think there was a drive where we DIDNT score. We are going to have to start faster though if we want to be able to run the ball. We got bailed out last night when our defense help them to 2 FGs instead of 2 TDs. The game was still one score so we could use Henry more. Speaking of Henry...

WHAT A MAN. An underrated part of his performance was how little touches he got. Only 20 (iirc) rushes. And he's still had insane production. That's huge for his longevity.

O-line played their best game of the year last night. No sacks, great in the run game. Still some improvement needs to be made, and I still worry about our tackle situation. I hope Lewan is alright, that was a very scary scene and we will need him down the stretch.

WR's not named AJ brown couldn't get separation last night. There were plenty of times where Tannehill just had to throw the ball away because noone was open. That is worrisome, BUT the bills secondary is legit so might be a wash. NWI had a stellar game as well. On one of the last drives he was making CLUTCH catches and running even better routes. He was sitting down in the dead spaces of the zones and was making it really easy for Tannehill. AJ returned to form and had a great game as well. Glad to see downing call his number on those slant routes. Julio pulling his hammy again sucks, and cam batson is out now with ACL. Maybe we will see the rise of Mason Kinsey in his place?

Tannehill didn't have his best game. The interception was horribly underthrown and he threw it away alot. But I put the throwaways more on the receivers. Gonna need alot more from 17 next game. 

To me the most worrisome thing though? Special teams. How TERRIBLE were they last night. Honestly the only bright spots were our Kickers! Randy was great and Townsend had some BOOMING punts. (Especially his 2nd(?) When it hooked at the last second forcing the returner to catch it over his head, turning him away. That was an A+ punt) but man. From opening kickoff our return game and coverage were pitiful. I don't know if you noticed but they never once kicked a touchback on us. Their kicker would take two steps and boot it, landing the ball within the 5 yard line. Because they don't respect our return game. Rightfully so, batson was lucky to get back to the 20 most times. Marcus Johnson did a great job in his stead though especially on the last one we received where he took it out to about the 35. Coverage was awful too. It seemed like their returners would have an automatic 30 yards for kickoffs and 15-20 for punts. And not to mention the return that we got bailed out on by a penalty. Overall piss poor performance by special teams. Having McMath on IR may be a bigger deal than we know.

 Highly suspect coaching job by Auckerman too. The throwback to the Homerun Throwback was nice... If we executed correctly. Our coverage guys have to do a better job blocking on that play to allow Jackson to get in position to take the lateral, otherwise we see what happens. 

And finally, the fans. What an AMAZING atmosphere. After hearing all weekend how Bills Mafia would take over Nissan Stadium, it was VERY NICE to see and HEAR the Flame heads come out to support our boys in the biggest game of the year (so far). Can't wait till the cheifs come to town so we can send em packing back to KC.

What position group historically falls off in production after years of hard work? RBs. Yes I agree Henry is built different. Yes I think he can run for 2k this year. But do any of us really expect him to hit 2k next year? How about the year after that? How many more years do we have with this current core? Lewan, Ben Jones, saffold, hell tannehill is getting older. Again right NOW they still look fine (tannehill aging like fine wine) but do we REALISTICALLY believe that this offense will continue to be as good when our HOF RB and HOF WR are older and have more lagging injuries. All of this to mention what about contracts? AJ is gonna be paid like a top 5 receiver. Honor should be handed a handsome contract. Jayon was ready to leave last year. Big Jeff? Yeah that's gonna be a Big contract. Nate davis? Gonna be paid. All of these guys are on super cheap deals compared to their production. NOW is when you go out and win championships. I get not selling your soul for a Superbowl. I get not pulling a saints and loading up on FAs just to end up empty handed. I GET THAT. BUT DAMMIT I WANT A SUPERBOWL IN NASHVILLE.

If you listen to the post game presser vrabs was asked about them and what I took was him basically saying "" COULD they have played? Yes. But did we NEED them? No."". He mentioned Dupree being out there Technically available to play but they elected to rest him and just have him there in case of an emergency. I think vrabs took this same approach with Julio in the second half. We are definitely going to need Julio, AJ, and Dupree healthy going forward, and the way the game was going it would be risky to play them. All 3 big name players are coming off of injuries, and yesterday was a very very physical game between 2 rivals. Vrabs knew the colts were a bad team and he believed in the guys on this roster  to fill in in the absence of some of these bigger names. This game was never close (even if the score sheet said it was) and so there isn't any reason to risk injury when out depth pieces can get the job done.

7836,50132,50132,DrJupeman,"Hi, yes, me.  This is my third year as a season ticket member.  I bought my tickets about this time of year in 2019.  I live in New Jersey (at time of purchase and now!)  

They rejected me initially but I was not going to take no for an answer.  Honestly, I was devastated when they turned me down and was prepared to escalate to Mom if I had to.  Two things drove my fire over these tickets:  1) I have been a diehard fan of the team since 1978 and finally got to a position, financially, where I could be a ticket member and attend games.  2) I was ***so pissed*** at each of the home games I was attending on an ad hoc basis that I became committed to do my little part to tilt the balance back to the home team in Nashville!  Seriously, the away fans at games pisses me off A LOT.

I was very polite with the ticket rep and basically said both of the above to him.  I was a bit over the top and challenged the organization to give me a team trivia test, I took pictures of all my jerseys and paraphernalia dating back to the Luv ya Blue Oilers to prove my fandom, and I was eventually escalated up in the organization to a guy that agreed to give me a chance.  The organization did not give me any special agreement or contract, but I did give them my word that I would not sell the tickets at-large and if there ever was a reason I could not personally attend that the tickets would only be used by my kids or another vetted Titans fan.  I expect and hope that they are monitoring my ticket transfers.  Some here my recall I gave away tickets two years ago here on this sub-reddit through a small mini contest.

So the moral of the story is:  it can be done, it just takes some commitment, patience, and perhaps some promises that you are not going to resell.  The organization is trying to protect against brokers, primarily, but they also are fed up (as we all should be!) with the season ticket members that treat their seats as a profit center rather than a fan experience.

I am now on a first name/face recognition basis with my current ticket rep and she is beyond wonderful and has gone out of her way to meet up with me before games and offer small gestures of appreciation from time to time (nice supply of Oilers hat pins, etc).

When the team left Houston and came to Tennessee all the history and records, etc., came with the team.  For example, the franchise leader in receiving is Ernest Givins, Oilers wide receiver from ‘86-‘94.  This is important because there are a lot of crybabies in Houston that fondly remember the Oilers of yore, who had some great players, including legendary Hall of Famer, Earl Campbell.  These pathetic tortured souls insist the Texans are the rightful heir to the Oilers history, name, and colors.  This is patently false.  Tannehill, our QB, reminded them of this yesterday when he sported an Oilers shirt in Houston while warming up pre-game.  You can go online and buy all kinds of Oilers paraphernalia in the Titans online store, etc.  You can see the lineage of the team in our colors today:  the light blue (Columbia blue) and red (scarlet) are the old Oilers’ colors.

7868,50182,50182,DrJupeman,"Totally for what it is worth:

I'm a season ticket holder who lives in New Jersey.  I had to jump through some hoops/escalate in the organization to be allowed to buy my PSLs several years ago.  The Titans have a ""4 hour rule"" (must live within 4 hour drive of Nashville) on buying PSLs in an attempt to limit resellers.

I think one major problem is normal citizen PSL ticket holders selling their tickets rather than going to games.  These folks may not be making their living on ticket sales, like the types that the organization is trying to eliminate, but are just normal people effectively being resellers.  In one my trips to a game I was at an AirBnB where my host had the same season ticket holder gift that I had (nice coasters...).  So I mentioned that to my host and he simply admitted he was a ticket holder since the team came to Nashville but never goes to games and simply sells them all online.  THIS GUY IS THE PROBLEM.

Related, when I was in town this season for a game I noted that the Rangers were playing the Preds.  I'm a Rangers fan so I thought, ""Cool, I will go watch the 'Gers take on the Preds.""  I go to buy tickets, they are available and guess what?  No can do!  One needed a credit card with a zip code in the area...  Now, this would royally make me upset as a Titans fan who lives out of town, so there needs to be some other way to buy tickets if you are a real fan of the local area team (kudos to the Preds for trying to keep me away, though!  I smiled/loved it!).  It is not an easy solution, but I do think the Titans organization should keep working on the idea.

Overall the ratio of Titans fans to out of town fans has notably improved this season.  Part of that is simply more Titans fans (e.g., out of town count may be the same).

Not true. There's many scenarios with small variations where one bubble team or another could knock us out of the playoffs, but the one I chose was where the Ravens were the bubble team, in which case Ravens could get in and Titans could be out. (Luckily, it's a long shot.)

A Dolphins playoffs scenario (with Titans out again) looks like this: Titans lose out, Colts, Dolphins, Bills, Chargers win out, Patriots beat Jaguars. Ravens would be out and irrelevant in this scenario, true.

10287,68111,68111,JGspot,"IANAL, but this guy is: Aron Solomon. He did a Q&A when the Flores suit was first announced and when asked about the Giants situation (which is very similar to ours), he said this:  


""\[The Giants\] will have 100 percent violated both the spirit and the letter of the “Rooney Rule.” But I say this with my legal hat on: so what?  
The Rooney Rule has been a joke since it came into effect in 2003. It has no teeth. This is what I was writing in the piece before this came out with Brian Flores: a court needs to put teeth in the Rooney Rule and say, “Listen, we’re not just telling you anymore that you have to have two black or other visible minority candidates for a head-coaching job. We’re going to hit the franchises and the league where it hurts.”

The only thing the National Football League understands is money. So let’s talk to them about money. That’s what this is going to be all about as well. Given the fact that Flores is never going to work in the NFL again, the amount of damages he and his lawyer are going to claim — put your seat belt on when you see it. This was a guy who was making $3 million a year in his first head coaching job. Had he continued to do well, he’s probably somewhere between $7-10 million a year in expected income. Play that out over a certain number of years, plus punitive damages? He’s not going into this thing asking for $600.""

&#x200B;

The whole Q&A has some good insight, although some of it is outdated like Flores not working again. You can read it here: [https://www.boston.com/sports/analysis/2022/02/02/qa-legal-analyst-aron-solomon-brian-flores-nfl-lawsuit-rooney-rule/](https://www.boston.com/sports/analysis/2022/02/02/qa-legal-analyst-aron-solomon-brian-flores-nfl-lawsuit-rooney-rule/)

&#x200B;

Here's what I will add on: the Titans situation is different because Mularkey was interim HC and we interviewed three coaches of color for the job that year, but it isn't different enough that I believe we escape a finding that we violated the Rooney Rule. Additionally I don't see true change happening until there is some owners of color in the league. I also think that stuff like Josh McCown hurts the league overall, like, in a league where 70% of the players are black a mediocre at best white qb got serious head coaching consideration without having a single second of any coaching experience above the high school level. Meanwhile Eric Bienemy is still an offensive coordinator. That's a systemic problem.

&#x200B;

Overall, the question isn't going to be whether the titans violated the rule or not (they did), The question is going to be whether the court believes that is a Titans issue or an NFL issue or both. Likely outcome would be some money paid by the Titans to Horton and then an overhaul of the Rooney Rule to be more specific on number of coaches of color in the league (like the system Aron suggests).",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_tygpvn,False,0.0,:TRac:,2022-04-07T14:01:28Z,tennesseetitans,0.0211553182789801

Pre-note: any comments made come strictly from a legal standpoint. Personal opinion is ""fuck the NFL, bout time the league got challenged on this shit"" but that's not how the law works. IANAL but am graduating law school in 3 months.

&#x200B;

The texts from BB are a seeming dagger for the giants, although I will say given the context of Coughlin's pre and post giants records compared to those of Crennell and Lovie Smith that hiring seems to be totally fair and was strange to try and use as an evidentiary tool.

&#x200B;

The dolphins stuff brings a ton of questions about the running of the organization, although some of the issues seem to be less race-based and more just shady behind the scenes stuff. The claims that Flores was a bad collaborator though definitely did not help.

&#x200B;

The broncos meeting looks real rough. As do the stories of the other successful black coaches in the league and their lack of opportunity and the whole concussion issue. Real gross stuff there.

&#x200B;

According to Twitter, other coaches have evidence against teams so incredibly smart both to make this a class action so they can join and also to pre-emptively file against the other teams unless those other coaches have issues with them.

&#x200B;

Some of the statistics are really damning, specifically the extra year of opportunity given to hired black head coaches in comparison to their white counterparts, although I don't know if the persistent reliance on the 70% player number is as correlating to the NFL coaching pipeline without giving some form of detail as to the amount of players that have actually pursued coaching positions, the amount of college coaches that are former players, the amount of players overall that immediately would be hired to NFL teams without any coaching experience, etc.

&#x200B;

The owner stuff is interesting but needs more data if available on the number of black potential owners that have attempted to buy teams in some capacity. Could be an issue where, thanks to the growth of popularity and inflation as well as the country-wide race wealth gap, the number of potential black owners is small enough to be seen as an anomaly.

&#x200B;

The one true thing that I could see being the downfall of the suit is evidence the NFL has that Flores doesn't have access to. The complaint states that it is not a complete list of potential plaintiffs because they don't have the evidence the NFL has about people who have been interviewed and stuff like that. The NFL should be forced to turn over any evidence necessary for the process of the lawsuit though, so it will be interesting to see how they present things and what they present (although Flores having quotes from league spokespeople talking about how the league has failed in their diversity efforts followed up by the NFL's statement saying Flores' claims are ""meritless"" both gives insight into the league's mindset as well as shows hilariously accurate and cutting foresight from Flores' lawyers as to how the case will go. Like how are you gonna say the claims are meritless when you not only haven't had time to read through and investigate them but also your own commissioner admits partial fault in this exact area? lol).

&#x200B;

TL;DR: from a legal perspective flores presents a great argument for more regulation and oversight into the league and certain teams with some really strong arguments and other questionable arguments, and it shall be interesting to see how the league responds in court and what evidence they provide",3.0,nfl,t3_si55nh,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-02-01T17:39:28Z,tennesseetitans,0.0290250351931978

2) I might have been harsh on him but I'm still not happy with downing's overall performance.

But he's still designing just the dumbest, most white flag third down (and sometimes second down) runs and screens I've ever seen. Still on thin ice in my book.

The positives:
1) This team can fight like no other in this league and you have to love that. They win when everything seems to be against them, and last night everything definitely was. 
2) AJ brown is my favorite titan now. He balled out in primetime when we needed him most and looked giddy doing it. Gotta love it.
3) tannehill looked great. What a surprise: he plays better with his best passing asset on the field. Definitely been a Tanny doubter recently and definitely was wrong there.
4) we used Julio in just the right way so he hopefully doesn't reinjure himself but sets up the decoy the way you want.

you're right. The Cardinals should absolutely be the number 1 team in the league. However, Tennessee is not so far behind that it is wild for them to be ranked #1.

1) no specific medical information is being discussed here. Yea we know that the vaccine rate went down but we do not actually know which players are or are not vaccinated until they say something. We can surely speculate but we were not told anything

Notice how none of those covered entities are involved in this tweet.

3) just a fun fact: the p in HIPAA stands for portability, not privacy

4) you can ask people their health information at any point. You cannot, however, go to a player's doctor or vaccine administrator and ask them for proof of the player's vaccine without the player's authorization to do so.

AJ & Julio are still an amazing WR duo and JRob knows we need a good #3 WR and TE, and will get that done. OL is very deep this draft and if we keep Foreman we’ll have a 2 headed monster at RB. Let’s not forget this offense was averaging almost 30 points in 2020 and was off to the same start this year before all the injuries happened. Tannehill will be our starter next year, but I really think we need to draft a QB to sit behind him like the Chiefs did with Mahomes. Obviously Downing needs to go, or we at least need to make a Schwartz type hiring offensively to have someone shadow him. I think if we make the necessary changes, which aren’t anything too crazy, we go back to being a top 10 offense.

I assume we’ll resign Landry and Cunningham. Those were 2 of some of our best defensive players and our front 7 is what makes our defense elite.

Next year completely rides on how well Tannehill can play in the playoffs. I don’t think it’s a long shot to say we’ll be in the 1-3 seed range again, and one of the favorites to come out of the AFC. We did it this year with a depleted roster and an offseason to improve will only do us better. Also, losses like Saturday only motivate your guys to do even better the next year.

I know we’re keeping Tannehill and it’s dumb to think we’d throw tons of capital at an aging Rodgers or Wilson, but you can’t tell me they wouldn’t vastly improve this offense. I’ve never seen a veteran QB like Tannehill be so consistently awful at making pre snap reads and getting rid of the ball. Go watch Mahomes, or Burrow, or Allen, and you’ll see despite their young age, they’re able to diagnose where the blitz is coming from and what the coverage is. Tannehill can’t do that and he’s about to be 34 years old. I mean the guy threw a screen TOWARDS the corner blitz and didn’t think once that maybe he should change the play call. Downing can’t predict what formation the defense will come out in, it’s Tannehills job to recognize the pre snap blitz, or that AJ is 1 on 1, and audible out of the damn call.

Assuming we keep Vrabel & JRob for the long run, I don’t think we’ll ever truly be out of contention. Think like the Packers or Patriots. Maybe a slump season here and there, but generally always in the mix.

Our core is sadly a little old. Tannehill and Julio probably only have 2 or so good years left, if that, till we gotta go looking for replacements. AJ and Henry should be good for the next 5 or so, with Henry slowing down towards the tail end of that. AJ will be around the longest for sure. 

All of our defensive stars are still young imo so I think our defense will continue to be a dominate force, as long as we make good trades and signings every now and then.

* Well for starters he knows the game/rules like the back of his hand. He has outsmarted coaches numerous times (Belicheck in the playoffs as an example) and is constantly correcting refs on their calls. He’s actually one of the only coaches apart of that ref committee thing. He also has our players understanding the rulebook well obviously cause we don’t commit many penalties from what i’ve noticed.

* He’s a very liked coach as well. A lot of coaches, while maybe good, have stories and stories of drama or players coming out and saying they don’t like playing for them. You’ve never heard anything like that about Vrabel. If anything, he’s attracted multiple big name players and created a great locker room here in Tennessee.

* He used to be a player, so he fully understands how it feels to be hurt but wanna play, when you mess up on a play, etc etc. He’s very hands on and the players respect him even more knowing he won multiple rings and was a pretty decent player his whole career.

* He’s also shown to not be stubborn with his coordinators. Something a lot of coaches struggle with is hiring friends and crying like a baby when they’re let go cause of failure to produce. Mularkey had that problem. 

* Despite us being statistically the most injured team in NFL history, we’ve still managed a 10-5 record under a decently hard schedule, won 6 straight games against playoff teams when healthy, and are still in contention for the 1 seed and more than likely have the division won two years in a row. Other teams, like the 49ers of last year, the Ravens this year, Browns, etc have completely collapsed due to injuries. Vrabel has maintained a good team despite the bad luck.

All in all, sure he’s had some things to complain about like him wanting to run the defense, which is just a rumor so who knows what really happened.

I think Tannehill is gone after this year, so you'll have a rookie or second year qb come in with a solid supporting cast around them if you keep AJ and draft another solid WR this year. 

It's been shown the last few seasons that to win the superbowl you need a qb on a rookie contract and a talented roster around them (chiefs), or a highly productive veteran qb that you've mortgaged draft picks to get (rams). 

Barring injury not paying AJ now is a huge mistake that will get Jon Robinson fired. He doesn't hit on enough draft picks to allow the ones he does hit on to walk.

 This forces Cleveland to trade assets away for a team to take his contract, or they have to cut him and take the dead cap hit. Baker gets paid either way as his option is guaranteed money. If cut, Baker not only gets the opportunity to get healthy, he gets to choose his next opportunity rather than being forced to play in a situation where he's doomed to fail.

3. Easterby releases the info and more ladies come forward and make Watson too toxic to trade.
4. Since there is no past history of misconduct (unless he's convicted) he'll get a 6-8 game suspension of which the Texans don't have to pay him for.
5. Watson has his name is ruined and his marketability is dead, Texans still have him under contract and will probably have a top 10 pick next year.

We won’t be able to get pressure with 4 as reliably without Landry, which is a huge blow to the defense. So many things are predicated on getting pressure with 4 on defense that I’m really worried about it. Hopefully Weaver and/or Ola will be able to be 75% of what Landry was, but his versatility with rushing and dropping into coverage meant a lot for the defense. If you give away what the OLB will be doing by subbing in a better pass rusher or coverage LB, you lose unpredictability and front multiplicity.


 This was a huge point of emphasis for Vrabel talking improving the defense - front multiplicity. 


If you can make the QB take just an extra half second to see what Landry is doing (rush or coverage) as opposed to knowing the intention of the player depending upon the down and distance, that increases the time to pass by just enough to make a difference in a lot of plays.

Ola Adeniyi got hurt and wasn’t much of a factor from what I saw. Farley looked decent. Looks like he needs the reps to get up to speed. He’s missed basically two years now. NaQuan Jones looked good too.


QB: Malik looks the part of the raw rookie with talent. A couple of great runs, showing elusiveness, but bails from the pocket too early sometimes. Great pass to McMath but it could have been more accurate so the receiver doesn’t go out of bounds there. He also took a sack before the end of the first half when he should have thrown it away. Expected rookie mistake there. Woodside was consistently under pressure and didn’t look good overall considering he’s been our backup for years. 

The rest of the offense: Much more to say about the RB’s than WR’s here. After the early fumble Chestnut looked good, but I don’t see us keeping him. We already have Henry, Hilliard and Haskins, who also looked good. 

Disappointed that I didn’t see production from Burks and Phillips, but Godwin showed out and McMath continues to make his case for this roster.

When they both played, it was obvious that Manning had a superior understanding of the game, acting as a coach on the field. He was able to diagnose everything the defense did and adjust to the play that would take advantage of the weakness in the defense. Then he was able to execute the throws with insane efficiency, carrying the offense forward himself. 

There was no other QB in the league that could completely dissect you’re entire defense, recognize it from the line of scrimmage, even with motions and disguises, and audible into a play that took advantage of it.

Brady and Belichick eventually developed a similar understanding between each other due to the number of years they spent as well as Peyton’s example, but they got there too.

Sometimes you’ll see a seam route or something in the middle of the field if the defense gives it to you, but then teams run up and spike the ball. 

Outside of the situational need to play fast, it’s often better to control time of possession and methodically make your way upfield, forcing the opposing defense to play longer while your defense gets to rest.

16303,110766,110766,PitTitan,"There have been A LOT of Tannehill takes in the Titans subreddit since the Bengals game but it's not fair to label everyone bashing Tannehill as ""having no opinion prior to that game"" or ""not watching the Titans all year"".


I defended Tannehill all year despite his stat regression because he was playing with practice squad guys at almost every skill position. It was clear throughout most of the season that he was dealing with receivers that could not get open to save their life and little to no playmaking capability out of the majority of players around him. He still carried this team to the playoffs despite all of that and he deserves credit for doing so. I still stand by all of that.


I've also been one of the ones saying it's time to start working to move on from him after the playoff loss. This is the third straight year that he has been largely responsible for our playoff exit and this one has been the most egregious. Even in our playoff wins he has been adequate at best and quiet to below average at worst. The Bengals game, along with his postseason body of work over the last 3 years, has solidified that he is simply a different QB in the postseason and you are unlikely to win a Championship with that kind of shift in play from the most important position at the most important times. At 33 he is who he is and if you can't manage to scrape out a win with your defense doing what it did against the Bengals you're just not going to be able to do it. A game manager wins that game. Tannehill actively lost it.


I don't think it's realistic to get Rodgers or Wilson but I do think we need to face the reality that we've hit our ceiling with Tannehill and we need to start working towards accumulating the resources to move up in the draft next year or the year after to go get his replacement.

It's weird because he is a big part of the reason we've reached the playoffs the last 3 years and also a big part of why we lost in the playoffs the last 3 years. Ultimately, at 33, he is who he is and I think we've hit the ceiling on what this team can be with Tannehill. I also don't think it's realistic to move on from him until next year or the year after.

17702,116177,116177,ReAlignTitan,"My two cents about the media:

My favorite basketball team, Milwaukee Bucks, won their world championship last season. They are a small market team, (also played another small market team in the finals) and for a few years so close to make a run and something would happen and it would come up short. 

They finally pull off the upset and I can say the whole time celebrating, I didn’t give a shit what the media said because I was celebrating. They had stories downplaying their win, league fans found an excuse to move on. Nothing can take away their win.

For years, we have a been downplayed by the media. This Titans team doesn’t win sexy games. They find a way to come together and win even when they are behind. That’s credit to Jrob and Vrabel. This is a team sport and media wants a narrative on a person that wins game or chokes. Power rankings are worthless, someone tweeting a negative fact about titans, nothing matters except what’s on the field. We could be “the worst 1 seed” but if we win it all, does it matter? 

Tomorrow, I am excited to see the boys get a win. I’m not nervous because the media has hyped up Bengals, they are a good team too and got hot at the right time too. Remember, this team plays better when they think they are the underdogs. Anyway, fuck the media narratives because I know this team doesn’t care about them.

21306,134038,134038,SomewhatMarigold,"I've got a question for American Titans fans about 'we'/'they' language when it comes to teams.

I'm from the UK. I don't really follow any of the local sports, but I *think* it's common in football/soccer over here for people to talk about their teams in terms of 'we'--not just in a general, 'If we win this next game we'll be top of the table' kind of way, but also quite specifically, referring to the actual players on the pitch, 'We had a few good chances but just couldn't get it in the net'. (Damn, I follow football so little I can't even come up with authentic-sounding football chat--but hopefully it'll be clear what I mean).

I have limited interaction with people who are *really* into American sports--my wife's decidedly not a fan, and her family a more casual fans--but I can't really remember this sort of inclusive 'we' language from Americans I've talked to. It's usually 'they': 'They need to win the next two games to secure their place in the playoffs', 'They looked fantastic on offense', etc.

In the podcasts I listen to it's almost always 'they', even from pods ran by unapologetic fans, but this might just be a sort of semi-professional detachment. The one exception is Transatlantic Titans, which is ran by a bunch of English guys, most if not all big football/soccer fans, who use the same 'we' language you'd get over here to refer to the Titans.

So, American football fans--would you ever say 'we' to describe the Titans? Is this the same for, say, the teams of the colleges you went to? What about the national soccer team or other national teams?",2.0,tennesseetitans,t3_qsfkc7,False,0.0,:Titans:,2021-11-12T11:28:19Z,tennesseetitans,4.583711098110191e-07

It's been a long time coming, with Zach's weird takes and general obnoxiousness which have caused me to stop listening to most of their recent episodes, and there's been barely any actual analysis since Mike Herndon left. But I guess I'm a creature of habit and get through a lot of Titans-related podcasts, and I've given most of their recent episodes at least a chance.

Not too worried about the back-up offensive line--last year showed that we can drop mid-level guys in and still be pretty good, so I think we'll be fine.

Sargent, Ficken, and Barkley have got to have more or less won their position on the roster.

Monty Rice looked amazing. Weaver didn't have the impact he had last week but he still kind of looked productive, if that makes sense, and I hope he can develop into a great player. 

While it would have been great to have Farley come out and somehow look elite straight away, I think this was the best we could hope for; and hopefully the experience will be part of the process for him to work hard and regain his skills and conditioning after a long time away from the game.

My family and I were watching this game in Portland, TN. I was about 9 at the time. The Titans beat the Jags twice this year and was meeting them for a third time to go to the Super Bowl.

The game was in Jacksonville so of course, they were doing flyovers of the city and showing snapshots of the beach. My mom nudged my Dad and said, “you know, they have an Air Force base down there…you should apply and see what happens”. My dad somewhat shrugged it off. After the game, we were extremely excited and watched the post game interview with Jeff Fisher calling Jacksonville, “our second home.”  

Shortly after my dad applied for a job, he had multiplied interviews and before we knew it, we moved to Jacksonville Beach just months later. 

I’ve now lived here for 22 years, met my wife, have a good core group of friends, and fully involved in the local community. I surprise people all the time when I tell them I’m a Titans fan. 

It’s safe to say, I’m the most Jacksonvillian Titans fan there is. I will do my duty and rep Jacksonville as the Titans second home, as long as I can. With every DUVAL I hear, I yell a TITAN UP to remind them who their daddy is.

If the Bills win, they go on to face the Jaguars, who they were not beating.  Jags go to the super bowl.  Tom Coughlin doesn't get fired because he's got an AFC Championship and maybe a super bowl ring.  Which means he's not the Giants head coach and therefore doesn't stop 19-0 in 2007.  

This also means that Tom Brady doesn't tear his ACL week 1 of 2008 because he's playing TNF instead of Sunday afternoon. Which means that Matt Cassel isn't a thing and the Chiefs don't sign him to a long term deal following 2008.  Which means that they take the best QB on the board, Mark Sanchez.

Basically I use the line/polygon lasso to cut out the things I want to recolor (helmet, pants, arm band, shoulder stripes) and copy them to a new layer. I then go to adjustments and select black and white. From the B&W menu I take the color (red in this case) and bring up the white value until it closely matched the natural whites in the picture.



Once it's white I use the wand to select the outside of said layer and right click to select inverse, create a new layer and paint bucket in the color I want to change it to and then change the layer visibility from the layers tab, scrolling down from normal to multiply.



That's pretty much it. It's not perfect but Idk how theses things are supposed to be done, I've just messed with Photoshop long enough to brute force a thing or too.

A issue offensive coordinators had with him is he is to much of a nice guy. So even if he didn't like a play they implemented he would lie and try to get used to the play that never meshed with him.

The bad is his body. While he will scratch and claw for everything his body can't handle it. The Jags broke his Leg and he lost more than the ability to walk that day. He wasn't the same quarterback at all after that. 

Then he had a nerve injury and he lost alot of his throwing power. He couldn't feel anything in his hand for months, and could barely hold on to the football to throw it on a slant. 

But he isn't a aggressive kinda guy he hesitates to throw the ball into windows, and decides not to make the throw often. He isn't a guy who throws 50/50 balls either.

All and all he's a great place holder that will move the stars for anyone if has the power to.

32174,170705,170705,Wright606,"Ban all kicking except punts. Onside kicks replaced by 4th and 15 at your own 10. If your offense turns the ball over on downs inside your opponent's 25 yard line scores you 1 point. It's worth 3 if you do that inside the 10. The goal posts are removed entirely. Each half, the coin toss winner starts the ball at their 30 yard line. 

Also the second playoff tiebreaker (after head to head if applicable) is net points on the season. 

Defensive touchdowns are worth eight instead of six. Punt return touchdowns too. 

If a lateral hits the ground without touching a receiving player first, it cannot be a turnover. If the other side falls on it, it's like downing a punt. This applies to defensive laterals too, so every INT becomes a game of rugby. 

All protections for QBs are removed. Running into the punter is removed, but roughing still exists because they're so vulnerable while midair. Late hits on the sideline are legal as long as they aren't unreasonably late (like by the Gatorade jug) or after the whistle. 

You can no longer delay the game by sitting on ballcarriers for excessive time. This is already technically illegal but I would enforce it. 

The instant a receiver has possession and two feet, they have possession. If they drop it after that, it's a fumble. 

If a fumble goes out of bounds, the last team to touch the ball gets possession. Fumbles out the back (or side) of the end zone are now a 10 yard penalty from the LOS, not a touchback. 

Only 8 out of 32 teams make the playoffs. Playogf byes are outlawed and the extra week generated by this allocates a 2nd bye week to every team. Regualr bye weeks are standardized and rotating so,no one gets week 5 or week 13 or whatever. Primetime games are also standardized so small markets get an equal number. Games are played 7 days a week, with an emphasis on prime time on week days. All conferences and divisions are abolished. You still play your old division rivals twice a season, until 2032.

33376,173910,173910,_COWBOY_DAN,"Although I do think we just blew our best chance at making a deep post season run by losing yesterday, I think the path forward is fairly clear.

We have to hope we can stumble our way into the playoffs and hope that AJ and Henry can play at a high enough level to elevate our offense.  That's pretty much it.  This team is what it is at this point.  We can play great defense, but we can't reliably even hang on to the ball on offense anymore.

I really like Tanny, but he is exactly the type of QB you want if you decide to build your team around your RB and playaction.  He executes at hitting the open guy in stride and hitting the deep throws on PA shots.  Unfortunately, when you lose that threat, he's just not and never has been the type of guy to elevate the offense.  Combine that with the fact that we have a severe lack of weapons and you get a recipe for disaster.

Julio is going to go down as one of the biggest missteps and I'll die on the hill that we should have gone hardcore on retaining Jonnu.  I realize his stats aren't beautiful in New England, but he was a ginormous piece of why this offense worked in the first place.  Not having a decent TE in a situation where our pass protection sucks and our WRs are practice squad level...it almost doubles the impact.

We remarkably got through all the injuries to get to this point, but it feels like too much to overcome at this point.  But this is the NFL.

33554,174158,174158,_COWBOY_DAN,"> Everyone keeps saying this but the math isn’t there. Jonnu had the same targets over the end of the season as he did the first games Lewan played. They fell off for 2-3 games and then went right back. 

Looking at purely targets doesn't really tell the story especially on a TE to me.  There's a reason he was leading the league in TE TDs before Lewan went out.  He could be lined up literally anywhere at any time and losing your star LT caused his entire gameplan going forward to be completely hamstrung.  He did what he was asked to do at an extremely high level.  His numbers dropped off because there wasn't much you could do with the guy other than line him over tackle, let him bump a guy, and then work to the next level.

> Jonnu disappeared pure and simple. He brought us 400 yards and 8 tds last year. **Half of those touchdowns came during offensive blowouts like I said before.** He was great but he wasn’t earth shattering irreplaceable special like everyone’s acting now that he’s gone to the pats.

I mean...he's one of the primary reasons we were blowing people out.  He is an absolute matchup nightmare especially in the redzone.  When Lewan went out, we lost 3 out of the next 4 until we got the offense back on track.  


> Also let’s keep in mind Firk came into the league as a FB/TE hybrid. I think his blocking will be fine.

It's possible, but so far he's been nothing but a glorified slot receiver.  Like I said, I love Firkser.  I think he's clutch and knows how to get open.  It's a complete mystery as to whether he can block.  I think it's just going to be TE by committee this year which does hurt our deception capability, but we do have a lot of other great targets that can help free Firkser up as well as keep Tanny from getting pressured so heavily.",3.0,tennesseetitans,t3_o23rwk,False,0.0,:KeithBulluck:,2021-06-17T16:46:47Z,tennesseetitans,0.0406978137664079

He was absolutely shredding defenses (as much as you can in a run heavy offense with 2 stud WRs) and we completely retooled his usage after Lewan was injured. 

I think the most frustrating part is that it is really tough to build a TE into a complete player.

Before AAS took over, I had almost lost all hope of this organization rekindling not only their success on the field, but also any type of positive relationship with their fans and former players. 

I'm frustrated with the team and how close we are to finally getting a Super Bowl yet we seem so far away, but it's fun to be a fan of this team again. 

This subreddit is still fairly small, but I remember coming here in the offseason back in the dark years, and there literally wouldn't be a post for days. That's not an exaggeration. When the season rolled around, there was cautious optimism in the preseason. We'd win the first game of the season and then be on top of the world for all of one week.  Then the losing would start. All the users here were just bruised, battered, and expecting the next loss all while wondering when Kenny Britt would get arrested again.

Neely got us through it. There were days after getting slaughtered by 45 points, I'd wake up and log on just to see what hilariously depressing bullshit Neely had come up with.  Making fun of the team and what it meant to be a Titans fan was the only ""fun"" we had for literal years. 

And I think that's what hurt me most about Neely being taken from us.

This dude not only climbed the ranks in Titan fandom to get a job working alongside extremely well known Titans players, he carried our depressed asses through some horrible, horrible football times. And just when this team finally, FINALLY makes a legitimate run at a Super Bowl, he's gone. Just like that.

No chance he gets to play Lt unless we had no one else to play LT and if that happened Jonnu would have still been helping because that’s the offense we run. Tight end heavy blocking schemes, so my point remains true.


If we drafted a player on a team which had a few obvious holes going into what should be our biggest Super Bowl run in Titans history, there's the root of the issue.  One way or another, JRob dropped the ball on the pick.  We're not going to see eye-to-eye on this, but that's how I see it.  I think JRob is the best GM we've ever had, but this past off-season was nothing short of a giant disappointment and we still managed to win the division.

> Like I said I love Jonnu, I have a jersey, but he’s a luxury we can’t afford at this point. That money has to go to defense no doubt, 100%.

This is probably where we differ the most.  I think we should definitely invest some money into a pass rusher and some mid-level guys, but elite offenses still get teams to the big game year-in and year-out.  If we can get our defense up to even the 16-20 range consistently and continue to maintain/improve our offense, this is a team that absolutely can win the Super Bowl.  Not saying losing Jonnu would send our offense to the cellar, but I do think it impacts us greatly.  

I have no desire to watch this team fight and scrap its way back to a borderline top 12-15 defense with a mediocre at best offense that we've watched for almost the entirety of the Titans existence.

33607,174241,174241,_COWBOY_DAN,"> However Wilson playing wouldn’t have effected Jonnu but way to throw that in there for a free jab at the ex titan.

If your first round tackle can come in and play even remotely effective, Jonnu isn't going to be out there having to play as an extra tackle every single play.  A first round pick that can't even get on the field when we're on our 3rd string tackle absolutely hampers the offense across the board.  I don't care if it's right tackle vs left tackle, he should have been able to step in and play at some point.  

Not sure what the point of defending Wilson is at this point, but that's not the point of this thread.  

Of the three big names being discussed (Corey Davis, Jonnu Smith, and Jayon Brown), Jonnu is absolutely the most vital to keep in my opinion.  Much like Delanie was limited by his situation in San Francisco, Jonnu was in the same boat last year.  It's rare to find a guy that can block as well as Jonnu, move all over the offense (including RB), break tackles (3rd in the league in 2019 at TE with less than half the touches of the two guys ahead of him), and also be capable of running over 20 MPH.  

Do we *have* to keep him? Of course not.  We don't have to keep anyone.  Do I want to do everything I can to keep an elite offense and then try to add a couple names to get us to a mediocre defense (essentially the deep-run playoff recipe)?

It’s within walking distance (literally across a river) from Nashvilles most profitable industry: Broadway tourism. While building a monstrosity in Santa Clara might not benefit the surrounding area, a new stadium in the center of our downtown does in fact bring in tax dollars. If you don’t think having 150k people show up for a 3 day events 10-15 times a year(not even counting NFL games mind you), pay $70 a person for hotel tax, spend hundreds on alcohol at 15% tax, let alone the taxes those entities pay, I don’t know what to tell you.

34576,178634,178634,acompletemoron,"This is the classic knee jerk reaction. I get what you’re saying, but it’s not taking into account 90% of what’s at play here. 

First off, Nissan stadium is not in great shape. The renovations needed to bring it up to standards would cost marginally less than an entirely new stadium. The Adams family isn’t Jerry Jones, they literally could go broke and still not be able to fund an entirely new stadium. The alternative would be to move the team to a different city, have THEM pay for it, and then we’re shit out of luck, just like Houston when we took the Oilers, the Rams, Oakland etc. 

Second, y’all underestimate how much money Nashville makes off our tourism industry. We don’t just play 8 games of football in the stadium and call it a year, Nissan gets used continuously for concerts, events etc. The plan is to make the new stadium a dome, which would further increase the events we can host year round 5 minutes walking to our tourism hotbed. On top of all the country music and other events we already host, we’ll be able to host Super Bowls, college playoffs, SEC tournaments etc. Each of these events generates millions of dollars of revenue on Broadway. All of that in turn generates millions in tax revenue. 

This isn’t just chucking 500m into some billionaires pockets, there’s a lot more that goes into this. It’s not an unreasonable expectation to have the city pay a portion of a stadium that the city will OWN, and the public will use frequently and generate revenue from.

And as an aside, most of the money is coming from increases on taxes aimed at tourism. So all of you visitors are paying most of it! Thanks for the stadium!",51.0,nfl,t3_w2tbkz,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-07-19T12:16:34Z,tennesseetitans,0.0289752410592361

The Tennessee Titans are charging into the NFL playoffs with a chance to win their conference for the first time in 14 years.

And as excitement grows around the Nashville's football team, a new vision for the fan experience -- at Titans games and concerts at Nissan Stadium -- is taking shape. Plans now underway envision up to $600 million in upgrades at the 23-year-old stadium over three seasons. Around it, a new neighborhood and entertainment district will spring up with new transit connections and parks.

""Every corner"" of the 1990s-era stadium is in play, said Titans President Burke Nihill.

""I think if either the city or the Titans were pushing for something more basic we would’ve been done with this a long time ago. But we’re pushing for something that’s exceptional,"" Nihill said. ""Our highest priority is to win the Super Bowl, but this is the top priority behind that.""

A new lease

Metro officials are obligated to deliver the team a ""first-class"" stadium, according to the original 22-year-old lease agreement.

But a budget deficit and pandemic continued to delay major deferred maintenance projects in recent years.

Now, an elaborate deal is expected to be finalized in the coming months to finance the new stadium and district without relying on general taxpayer funds. A new lease will spell out funding streams for more regular ongoing renovations.

A 130-acre stretch of urban riverside will become a new tax district, redirecting lucrative future sales tax payments into stadium maintenance and upgrades.

“It’s going to be important to present to the community a stadium-solve which allows us to not only keep the team and to have a Super Bowl, but that has no burden on the general taxpayer,” Cooper said. “A lot of the work that’s been going on is then creating Nashville’s next great neighborhood around the stadium.”

Metro Sports Authority, the stadium's landlord, could issue $300 million in bonds to be repaid with local and state taxes from the district. The Titans will finance another $300 million along with other private investors developing in the district.

Nashville's popularity positions it for plenty of free-flowing capital. The region is named the best U.S. investment area in 2022 by PwC, one of the world's leading accounting firms, and the Urban Land Institute.

Mayor John Cooper is seeking to seize on the moment with an elaborate private-public development strategy to guide billions of dollars to fill out hundreds of acres of underutilized industrial riverfront on the downtown banks of the Cumberland River.

""There's a whole lot of (investors with) capital that would like to come to Nashville and be part of the next great chapter of our city,"" Cooper said. ""It's quite something to be an international icon of investment.""

At some point in the next few months, a new lease between the Titans and Metro Sports Authority is expected to be finalized.

District design plans to be released include:

A large reserve for parks and connected walking paths.

An ""activated riverfront"" with boat docks, waterside dining and canoe launches.

Plenty of social media-friendly experiences.

A variety of stadium lounge experiences.

Technology and infrastructure upgrades throughout the stadium.

A concessions overhaul with convenient, tech-savvy vendors and a range of sit-down options.

Options to more easily repurpose the stadium for concerts and other events.

A roof is not included in plans and would cost an additional $400 million.

""We're trying to create a sense of place,"" Nihill said. ""This isn't just a simple stadium deal, this is something where we're trying to take a current stadium lease that is antiquated and doesn't work for the city or the team -- we're trying to find a really elegant solution that delivers a great result for the citizens of Nashville in terms of building to world-class standards.""

City of the future

A new wide boulevard, or ""transit spine,"" will run through the Nissan Stadium district, connecting it to other new major development areas around the river, according to plans now in the works.

River North, the Riverside and downtown's Second and First avenues will develop and expand sprawling sections of downtown on the long-neglected east bank.

Already, rapid development is transforming much of East Nashville's neighborhoods with dense residential and shopping districts.

Oracle Corp. is building a second U.S. campus on a 65-acre stretch of the east bank criss-crossed with green space and water features at River North.

The company promised to front cash for Metro officials to erect a pedestrian bridge connecting the east bank with downtown.

An 18-acre private development is already moving forward two blocks north of the stadium at 111 N. 1st St.

Developer RMR Group is seeking rezoning permissions to redevelop the former truck servicing yard. They hope to build a ""dynamic mixed-use neighborhood,"" company officials said.

""We continue to work with our project team to finalize a master plan for the 18+ acre site that will include a broad mix of uses and building types oriented around a central green space,"" said RMR Group Vice President Jesse Abair. ""Our proposal for a people-centric, live-work-play development would provide a critical link between downtown and east Nashville.""

The future of downtown Nashville will continue to revolve around its landmarks including the stadium, Music City Center and museums, officials said.

A bevy of new events are lining up for the stadium as leaders seek to maximize its use.

""We would not be in the World Cup conversation. We wouldn't have hosted the NFL Draft or have the NHL Stadium Series if it wasn't for the stadium,"" Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. CEO Butch Spyridon said. ""The list goes on and on.

""When you take us compared to other cities, there's a sizzle that comes with Nashville because of the entertainment industry. It keeps building and reinforcing that there's something special going on. You can't buy that kind of aura.""

However, our offense really didn’t get going. The big win came from our D setting us up in incredible position after 2 back to back turnovers that set us up for a big lead. AJB had more than a couple dropped passes that could have given us a surge to score. Julio was in and had some sexy action, but again his chemistry isn’t quite there with Tanne yet. Hoping that moving forward as he continues to get healthy they will start to gel, and AJB/JJ can be swapped out as WR1 in Tannes eyes nearly every drive. 

AP did exactly what we needed him to do, and I’m expecting it was a little rust he had to knockoff. He was high running, but good god he still looked like an athlete. I think he’ll be fine in our short on 3rd/goal line drives. Foreman looked great, and as it’s been said already his break away where he tripped would 100% have been a Henry highlight reel touchdown.

His max this year is 59yds. His average y/p and net y/p are the lowest since 2016 and 2015, respectively. For a 16game average, he's on pace for 18 punts inside the 20.

---|---|----|----
2021 | Caleb Farley | Christian Darrisaw | too soon to tell, leaning no
2020 | Isaiah Wilson | doesn't matter (Noah Igbinoghene) | yes
2019 | Jeffrey Simmons | Noah Fant | hell no
2018 | Rashaan Evans| Isaiah Wynn | yes
2017 | Adoree' Jackson | O.J. Howard | no
2017 | Corey Davis | Jamal Adams | yes
2016 | Jack Conklin | Leonard Floyd | no
2015 | Marcus Mariota | Dante Fowler | no
2014 | Taylor Lewan | Odell Beckham Jr. | intriguing, but no
2013 | Chance Warmack | D.J. Fluker | yes 
2012 | Kendall Wright | Chandler Jones | yes

Jones instead of Kendall Wright is obviously a huge upgrade. Fluker over Warmack is too, though it probably wouldn't move the needle much. 4 years ago you'd probably say yes on Lewan for OBJ, but now it's a no. Mariota didn't work out but rolling with Mettenberger for Fowler wouldn't be any better. Keep Conk over Floyd, pretty easy. Adams over Davis is easy with hindsight too, even with how much of a meme Jamal Adams is now. Jackson for Howard is basically a wash, but Adoree played good for us the first couple years. Wynn is a good but unspectacular upgrade over Evans. Big Jeff and Wilson would be kept and kicked unceremoniously to the curb, respectively, and finally we have last year where Farley barely played and is far too soon to tell. I think the answer is no, since at this point Jones would probably have moved on to other pastures, Adams would have forced his way off the team, and we'd lose Big Jeff on a rookie contract which is crazy good value.",1.0,nfl,t3_ucmgh1,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-04-26T17:52:03Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0290703662999513

My personal thought here, which will probably not be popular, is adding 2 years into both Lewan and Byards contracts and covert their salaries this year to signing bonuses.  That clears up the right amount of cap to resign Jones (2yr/10m), Landry(4yr/69mil), TE1 possibly (Use Briley Moore/Tommy Hudson/Ryan Izzo for depth), veteran CB help if available, and cap space for draft (can keep quess/NWI/Ficken/Tart on RFA deals).

43486,248116,248116,mcclurc,"AJ is going to want top 15 receiver pay.  I don't think we extend until after this year if at all.  He's a great talent but health really is becoming a big concern for that amount of investment.

With the 21~ in space, I see 3 guys cut next year: Saff, Jenkins, and Darrington Evans.  Roughly gives us 32 in space.  Resigning ERFA and RFA players to Round of Tenders leaves 27mil (that's Quess, Ficken, NWI, Roberson and Tart)

I think you need to sign Ben Jones here to a 2 yr/8-10mil deal.  He's still a mauler and you can draft to have him replaced.  Down to 22mil.

Next, Ola Adeyini.  I definitely believe he earned another 2-3 year deal, as a rotational piece maybe 3/9.  Down to 19.

Here's where it gets tricky.  If you want to sign Landry, and still get replacements for MLB (losing Brown and Evans) and a decent cb/ol depth, I don't think you can do more that 4/55.  Do a 20mil sign on bonus and back load the contract, essentially guaranteed 4 years.

I could see this go one way or another.  Landry is having a great year but it's only been one stellar year with 3 meh years.  He's obviously better as part of a unit and not a stand alone.  Plus by giving him 55 you're sinking 150 million into 2 OLB essentially.  That's a lot of investment, especially with Weaver coming back and/or resigning Ola.  It will be interesting to see what Jon does here, because you still have to retain Simmons as well (I'll guess 5/90 for Simmons).  It can really go either way and they might give the money you would need for just him to long/brown/ola and keep the core of linebackers over the one.",3.0,tennesseetitans,t3_r9g6wi,False,0.0,:HighLife:,2021-12-05T09:53:34Z,tennesseetitans,0.0013060249652023

So... *yes*? I think his problems are fixable in that they're all things that can be taught and learned, as opposed to if he physically just didn't have the ability. But I think that's also true of the majority of bad QBs in the league.

My real answer is that it's just too early to have any idea. He has real potential, which is what he was drafted for. We've seen enough Woodside to know that Woodside doesn't really have the potential to be a legit starting QB. That doesn't mean that Willis will end up being a better QB than Woodside in the long run. It just means that he can. I think he probably will, but we won't know for a while yet.

He got flushed from the pocket, had ample time to throw it away, and instead thought he might be able to... I don't even know.

> It’s not a good sign to be missing so much time when you’re so young, I know injuries can be freaky but it’s hard for the Titans to pay top 5 money (again, he was reportedly asking for record setting guarantees from the Titans) to a player when he can’t stay healthy for the last 2 seasons when he’s only been there for 3.

The first comma should likely be converted to a semicolon or simply a period. I might consider the word *fluky* instead of *freaky* just given other common definitions. There should be a comma before *but* because there's an independent clause both before and after it. The parenthetical is a full sentence, so you can capitalize it and put a period just before the close parenth if you like. I might consider altering the final phrase to *when he hasn't stayed healthy the last two seasons and has only been there for three*. 

> The 2021 Titans had one of the worst pass blocking offensive line in the league.

*line* should be *lines*.

44793,257112,257112,neimsy,"Yep. Hard to disagree with that order.

The Steelers have looked like the worst team in their division most of the year. They've done little to make most people think they aren't the worst in the AFC playoffs. The Raiders have some playmakers and (unlike the Steelers) are fun to watch, but based on what we've seen all season, I don't think you can reasonably put them above any AFC playoff team besides Pgh.

Belichick is always a concerning matchup. That team has completely surpassed expectations this year. He can never be counted out, and if they had similar talent on their teams, I'd far rather play a team led by Zac Taylor than by Bill. But they don't have similar talent. Burrow and Chase are well on-pace to go down as an all-time great QB-WR duo. Boyd and Higgins have also been really good, as has Mixon. And that defense has been super solid as well.

They say that to be the best, you have to beat the best. It's not completely true, but making it to the SB is likely going to require beating the Chiefs again in addition to beating another very good team.

So (at least with how scheduling works in today's NFL), you would need to have won your division in the previous season and another team in your division would have had to've gotten a Wild Card berth. And even then, you'd likely need (as we've had) your two games against that division WC team happen in the first ten weeks without having seen much of your other two division opponents yet. And you likely need your bye to be after Wk 10.

So while it's very cool that we've won all our games against last year's playoff teams, I think a lot of the ""only team to have done this through week 10 thing"" has to do with scheduling.

I'd love to agree. But I cannot imagine that Shane Bowen is a better DC than Byard or Hooker is a safety; Jayon is an ILB; or Simmons, Dupree, or Autry is a front-7 player.

46829,271457,271457,rante0415,"In the last two seasons, Henry has a TD% of 8.68%. However, the league average last year was 4.8%. If you adjust his TD% to 5%, still above LA, he goes from rushing for 57 TDs in his last 18 games to only 32.85. I'll be generous and give him 33.

Now, let's adjust his rushing rating. It goes from 116.5 to only 104.3 by just adjusting his TD% to normally above average. Later on, I will adjust it further to take yards into account.

Next, we have to account for him rushing more than league average. He has 657 rushing attempts over 18 games. The LA is 35.5/game, which equals 639, around a 2.7% reduction.  Henry also has a flukey 9.01 Y/A, which can be adjusted to 8 (still above LA) based on the league average of 7.5. So we can estimate that over a 16 game season, his adjusted yardage is (6397.5)/18*16= 4544 yards.

Now, I will adjust his rushing attempts again based on these 16 game stats 4544 yards 639 attempts 426 completions (also adjusted) After this, his rushin avg bottoms out at 96.66, which lands him squarely between Jordan Howard and Matt Brieda last year.

His final 16 game adjusted stats: 4544 yards / 639 ATT / 426 CMP / 66.7% CMP (same) / 33 TD / 8 Y/A / 96.7 RATE

What does this tell us? It tells us that Henry’s perceived success in the league is largely inflated by unsustainable, wildly outlier stats in his 18 games as perceived elite talent.

you guys definitely have a scary offense, but our defense is a lot better than it was last year, especially the pass rush. will be interesting to see what happens.

Our LB corp are studs, including David Long and Zach Cunningham (acquired from the Texans). pass rush has been good. there are no stars, but Dupree and Landry are both well above average. we run a lot of stunts and confusing pressure sequences, although we rarely blitz. 

Secondary is a bit dicey. Fulton has shown #1 potential, but does get exposed sometimes. Jackrabbit Jenkins (#2) is solid but old. Molden (rookie slot corner) makes up for his lack of athleticism with great instincts.  Byard and Hooker, our safeties, play very smart and are great tacklers.

It's not a ""rebuild"" draft, but it is imperative to begin replenishing with younger talent in order to continue a competitive product on the field in the near future. 

We have not been hitting on draft picks for a number of years now and the core of the team is now beginning to age. Byard, Lewan, Tannehill, Henry, Ben Jones... These are names I think we all associate with the ""Tennessee Titans"" identity right now. But there is not a solid core of youth coming in behind them. You had a veteran like Rodger Saffold just depart in free agency. You're still looking to fill your starting RT and LG positions (let alone your LT who has maybe 2-3 more years, at most, of peak performance on him). You don't know what you have in Caleb Farley yet. You're relying on Robert Woods (30) to provide production at WR. 

Point is, you don't have guys like Corey Davis, Adore Jackson, Isaiah Wilson, Dane Cruikshank, DeAndre Walker, etc., etc., etc. here on this team to replenish and replace talent that is aging (or, in AJ's case, pricing) itself out. I just don't think you can look past the older players I mentioned above and see who the future of this team is beyond Simmons and *maybe* Hooker? Who are our studs under 25?

AJ Brown is considered one of the top tier wide receivers in the league, with his star on the rise. The truth is he is the first Tennessee draft pick to pan out like this in...

50814,294910,294910,titanate83,"Great opening salvo. My thoughts:

>McMath doing textbook bad gunning technique (run to the outside shoulder man) leading to Wilkins getting called for a late hit.

Is this what happened? I couldn't really follow the play, don't have DVR so couldn't rewind it, and they only gave one look at it in the game. My initial reaction was to question Vrabel for replacing McNichols at the last minute and put a guy out there on special teams that you've not seen play in a game yet and there he was making a mistake. But McMath messing up on special teams sounds just as likely to me 😂

• I had actually observed during the game how humorously bad our secondary must be to be getting beat regularly by an aged, white wide receiver - an old white guy running past our DBs. I really think (hope) this game was a one-off because I don't think we are routinely THAT BAD on the back end of our defense.

• Maybe I'm foolish but I'm still not scared of Davis Mills or the Houston Texans. I'll credit you as being the one that warned us when that day comes, but honestly, until that team actually wins 7 games and has a quarterback that isn't getting sacked 65 times in a season and looks like he has all the tools to be a capable NFL QB, I'm not worried about Houston. From an organizational standpoint, they are such a cluster-f, they're not even on my radar. Organizationally, they are so bad, they are more than a good QB away from being respectable.

>Kind of to go with the last 3 points, but Tannehill spreading the ball around and not being overly reliant on AJB is so big.

Now THIS is the kind of thing that gets me worried. You saw this as a positive point, but in a game where they were able to get it to Julio with success and frequency, it is concerning to not see AJB on the stat sheet. If he's not getting his numbers at this point, in this type of a game where we need his star power to manifest itself, to me it's more an indication of some health issue holding him back than of a defense shutting him down or the gameplan being to spread the ball around. But maybe that's just the worrier in me.

>Foreman looked fantastic as well, especially in the first half. He has a burst now that I didn’t see early in his time here but now it’s there. Crazy that this man was not on a team until we signed him. Also, crazy that he wasn’t on our team specifically backing up DH and taking some of the load off of him early in the season...

Vrabel is no doubt the reason why this team is the #1 seed and I wouldn't want anyone else coaching this team; he is always prepared. I give him all the credit in the world. My favorite Titans coach of all time. But that doesn't mean he is beyond questioning. We're fans and it's what we get to do 😂 and this has always been my sticking point with him. His roster decisions are questionable to me sometimes. I don't understand how Foreman was not only not on *a* roster to start this season, but how was he not on *our* roster to start this season? Dude played in games for this team last year. The coaching staff should have already had a good idea of what he was capable of giving this team. It's just... his emergence as being a dependable, reliable back in Henry's absence (even if they are platooning him with another back) really makes one wonder how they didn't already know he could do this, what he was capable of? Especially when he's not *really* doing anything this season that he wasn't already doing in limited action last year. What was this team doing going into the regular season with a RB room of Henry, Evans, and McNichols? If McNichols was bad enough to need to be replaced last minute in Week 18, how was he good enough to be on your roster for 17 weeks before that? I know things aren't static, and even people/players change and their habits, routines, performance can change, but there are just things about the RB position, the way it played out this year, that it feels like the coaching staff could have known in advance. 

As much as I complain about roster management with this coaching staff, though, there's no arguing that they've had to juggle 90 players and still pulled the #1 seed, so I try to keep my armchair GMing to myself.

>Only 2 snaps for Rashaan Evans. I know one was on the goal line and we even got a patented Evans stop.

I'm not sure why this is registered as a ""good point"". I seriously want Evans to pan out for this team. I haven't studied his game performances this season, but if he's that big of a dud that him only getting 2 snaps in an important game is seen as a bright spot, I think that's awfully alarming. We should be getting (and hoping for) high productivity and consistency from our top draft picks. I'm actually a bit distressed if Evans needs to see the field less. I thought Evans and Jayon were a really good LB duo a year (or two?) ago... What has happened to them?

Even the worst teams are prepared to lineup against the top teams and play close for 60 minutes. This was demonstrated so many times this year.

But early in the season, around Week 3 or 4, I saw a stat that something like 90% of Henry's rushing yards were yards after contact. The takeaway from that, for me, is that he is getting hit AT or BEHIND the line of scrimmage on almost every play.

I pray, now that the offensive line is back to returning all 5 starters and has some additional time to heal up, all of that is in the past and we start seeing them blowing guys off the ball.

50825,294929,294929,titanate83,"My take:

- I want to echo the sentiment someone voiced about the defense looking Super Bowl caliber. I mentioned that to my brother yesterday during the game. To me, it's not CONSISTENTLY there yet -- there are plays where they are still out of position or get beat -- but when they do execute, they look like a Super Bowl level defense. Also, I think Zach Cunningham makes a difference for this team. (ALSO, extrapolating out here, I think it's possible he makes Jayon expendable; I like Jayon and wish he would stay here, but I don't get the impression Vrabel is sold on him for some reason)

- The Dolphins looked REALLY outmatched and over rated yesterday. Their opening possession was beginning to look like they could be real dangerous but I said to myself ""watch what happens when they are past their scripted first possession and see how they do"" and of course that's exactly what it was... They looked hot in their scripted plays, but once they got outside of them, their offense had no rhythm, it didn't even look like it had rhyme or reason to it.

- I was bout to be PISSED if they injured Kern this close to the playoffs. Most of us Titans fans understand VERY WELL what a weapon our punter is for us. It's no joke, our record is surprisingly bad without him in the lineup.

- Foreman looks like he could extend Henry's career, for real

- I don't get what Miami fans were bitching about so much with the officiating yesterday. Those are some REALLY sour grapes. I consider myself fairly even in assessing officiating -- I admit when we get some ridiculous and favorable calls and I try not to make much of it when calls go against us. Outside of the one play that could have been called a fumble by Foreman (was originally ruled down by contact on the field), and a potential DPI that didn't get called their way (against Parker on a 3rd or 4th and long?) I couldn't see what else perturbed Miami fans so badly yesterday. I thought the game was called fairly evenly with relatively few penalties called. For the most part, I thought the refs did a great job of letting the play on the field dictate the outcome instead of ruling the game consistently on technicalities and micromanaging the game.

- Losing to Houston, in Houston, in the final week of the season to lose the #1 seed sounds like a very Us thing to do... I hope we keep the pedal to the metal.

- I still don't think we've played our best football yet... We've played good football a lot this year, and have occasionally played complimentary football in all 3 phases (Buffalo, Miami), but I still don't think we've seen this team's full potential in the 2022 season.

51700,298736,298736,trick96,"#VII. Schedule and Predictions

I really don’t like doing schedule predictions, especially before preseason is over. I will not be doing score predictions. So here goes:

**Week 1 – vs New York Giants:** This is a must win for the Titans if they want to have a good season, but the Giants will likely be much improved from last season and I feel like the Titans will find a way to lose a very weird week 1 game. **L, 0-1**

**Week 2 - @ Buffalo Bills (MNF):** Bills will be looking to stop their 2-loss streak to the Titans, both of which were also on primetime. Bills look scary good. **L, 0-2**

**Week 3 – vs Las Vegas Raiders:** Look it’s the only team that had a worse 2020 first round draft than the Titans. Great team though. **W, 1-2**

**Week 4 - @ Indianapolis Colts:** Colts should be better this season than last season thanks to one simple trick of throwing away Carson Wentz. **L, 1-3**

**Week 5 – Washington Commanders:** This is another one that can be filed under must win to have a good season. Should be a great defensive game. **W, 2-3**

**Week 6 – Bye Week**

**Week 7 – Indianapolis Colts:** Much like last year, the two Titans/Colts games will be over early in the year. If one team can win both these games, it should have a massive effect on the outcome of the season. Luckily for this game, the Titans will be coming off a bye week and will be at home. The Titans under Mike Vrabel are [undefeated in the regular season with extra time to prepare](https://new.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rv2wva/why_is_the_potential_of_having_a_bye_week_so/) with an average score of 29.6 – 10.9. **W, 3-3**

**Week 8 - @ Houston Texans** The Titans will extend their winning streak to 3 with a win here. *W, 4-3**

**Week 9 – @ Kansas City Chiefs (SNF):** The Titans are 2-0 against Patrick Mahomes in the regular season. The Titans will be 5+ point underdogs in this game but manage to win. **W, 5-3**

**Week 10 – vs Denver Broncos:** Russell Wilson is way overrated. **W, 6-3**

**Week 11 - @ Green Bay Packers (TNF):** I have never been more confident in predicting a loss. Titans 5 game winning streak ends. **L, 6-4**

**Week 12 – vs Cincinnati Bengals:** This game is circled on the calendar and Mike Vrabel is undefeated the week after TNF games. **W, 7-4**

**Week 13 - @ Philadelphia Eagles:** If AJ Brown is still healthy, he is going to shit on the Titans. **L, 7-5**

**Week 14 – vs Jacksonville Jaguars:** Very late first game with the Jaguars. I will not predict a loss to the Jaguars until I see Trevor Lawrence be a good QB. **W, 8-5**

**Week 15 - @ Los Angeles Chargers:** Herbie gud. **L, 8-6**

**Week 16 – Houston Texans:** Titans sweep the Texans as revenge for not sweeping them last year. **W, 9-6**

**Week 17 – vs Dallas Cowboys (TNF):** An outdoor night game in December? Yeah, Derrick Henry will be going nuts. **W, 10-6**

**Week 18 - @ Jacksonville Jaguars:** Mike Vrabel is undefeated coming off of TNF + I will not predict a loss to the Jaguars until I see Trevor Lawrence be a good QB. **W, 11-6**

#Overall: 11-6 (5-1 Division), 1st AFC South

The Titans will be AFC South champions for the 3rd year in a row. 1st place because there is not way geriatric ass Matt Ryan is winning 11 games with the Colts, their hype this off-season is insane to me. Also I would like to say it’s bullshit the Titans have to play 2 TNF games.",22.0,nfl,t3_wb2hlf,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-07-29T06:39:39Z,tennesseetitans,0.0013019335213229
51701,298737,298737,trick96,"**DL:** Jeffery Simmons is the best DT in the AFC and Denico Autry just had the best year of his long career. Big Jeff still has room to grow his game, as he still needs to be more consistent game to game. Titans have good nose tackles as well, but depth is a concern for this group. **Elite.**

**OLB:** Bud Dupree had a down year last year, but much like Taylor Lewan, I expect him to be better another year removed from his ACL injury. Harold Landry has a big contract to live up to, but it’s important to note that he does so much more for this team than just rush the passer, so to judge him solely on his pass rushing ability is disingenuous. He is a great, complete edge player who rarely comes off the field. Good depth here with a 2nd year player many are excited about in Rashad Weaver, who flashed in the preseason last year but had his season cut short due to injury.  **Good.**

**ILB:** David Long Jr is borderline elite. You probably don’t know much about him if you’re not a Titans fan, but you should. He is a complete 3-down linebacker, he’s great against the run and the pass. He flies to the football with and makes plays. His breakout season was shortened due to having a hamstring injury in the middle of it, so that didn’t help his name recognition, but regardless I can’t wait to watch him play this year. Meanwhile Zach Cunningham is one of the best run defenders in the league and competent in pass coverage. This duo is very quietly one of the best in the league.   Depth is a major concern for this group, Monty Rice is the primary backup for both of these guys but he started camp on PUP after an Achilles injury last season. I’m not sure there’s another NFL level LB on the roster behind those three players. **Elite.**

**CB:** This is the most interesting group on defense, mostly because it’s the only group with a new starter and that starter happens to be an interesting case. Caleb Farley was viewed as an elite talent coming out, with potential to be a top 10 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. However, he had surgery on an injured back and due to concerns with that he fell all the way to the 20’s where the Titans picked him up. He missed a lot of training camp due to a separate injury then missed the first few games of the season and ended up only playing in 3 games last season due to tearing his ACL. So now the Titans have a lot of their eggs in the basket of a highly talented player that has had a back surgery and an ACL reconstruction in the last 20 months. Farley participated in minicamp and will not begin training camp on PUP so he will be ready to go. Farley is an absolute wildcard for this defense, but good news for Farley is that he has a ton of good players around him to make things easier. Other than Farley, there’s Kristian Fulton who had a breakout season in 2021 and Elijah Molden in the slot who will look to improve upon his good rookie season. Decent depth here with an early 2nd round pick in McCreary, Chris Jackson who played a lot last year, and Greg Mabin who famously played 100% of the snaps against the Chiefs last season in a game where the Titans held Patrick Mahomes to only 3 points, the lowest amount of points he’s ever score in his life.  **Above Average with potential to be good or average/below average.**

**S:** Amani Hooker had a fantastic breakout season last year. He’s only the 2nd best safety on the team but he had one of the best seasons last year of any safety in the league in 2021. Meanwhile Kevin Byard remains absolutely elite in every way. One thing the Titans love about these guys is they are elite run defenders and are a big reason our rush defense was so good last season. Depth is a major concern here as well. This safety duo is absolutely insane.  **Best In The League.**

**Overall Defense:** I truly believe the Titans defense is one of the most slept on things in the entire NFL. They were fantastic last year, and this year the only significant changes are: replacing Jackrabbit Jenkins with Caleb Farley, having Zach Cunningham for the entire season, and hopefully less injuries. I mean the Titans didn’t even lose a defensive coach (that they didn’t fire). Amani Hooker, David Long Jr, and Kristian Fulton are all budding stars that nobody is talking about, they all had breakout seasons last year. This defense could possibly carry this team to the playoffs this season. I can’t believe how young of a defense it is. Denico Autry is the only player over 30, having just turned 32 and coming off the best year of his career. Bud Dupree is 29. Then Kevin Byard at 28. Cunningham at 27. Then every single other player on the starting defense is either on their rookie contract or have yet to play a snap of their 2nd contract (Harold Landry). If you want to know more about the defensive scheme the Titans run, [here is the /u/NoFlagsFilm breakdown on Shane Bowen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F41eoZu-qF8). Overall, here is how I see this defense: It will be one of the best, if not the best rush defense in the league this year without a doubt. It comes down to one player to decide just how good this defense will be in 2022. If Caleb Farley is bad, this defense will still be good. If Caleb Farley is just competent, this defense will be elite. And if Caleb Farley is good, this defense will be damn near the best defense in the league, if not THE best. **Elite with potential to be the best in the league or just good depending almost entirely on one unproven player with ridiculously high potential.**

**Special Teams:** Worth pointing out that K Caleb Shudak got the 2nd most guaranteed money of all the Titans UDFA’s, so the Titans clearly wanted to have a real battle for the kicker spot. However, Shudak was injured in minicamp and will begin camp on PUP, so the competition is likely over before it starts unless Shudak can get healthy soon. Kicker could be an issue for the Titans, but Randy Bulluck was solid for them last season though he has limited range. Punter Brett Kern (who has been with the team since 2009) took a pay cut to remain with the team this offseason, last season was the first season I’ve ever seen where he looked human punting the ball. If the Titans want to be the run first, defensive team they’re designed to be they really want Brett Kern to recapture his former glory. UDFA P Ryan Stonehouse is a dark horse to take Kerns job. **Below Average.**",12.0,nfl,t3_wb2hlf,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-07-29T06:39:18Z,tennesseetitans,4.4926172132660894e-08
51702,298738,298738,trick96,"###VI. Roster Evaluation

**Position groups:**

I will give a brief description of how I see each group as well as give a grade for each group. My grading scale is Bad = bottom 5 in the league, below average = 27-19, average = 18-14 above average = 13-9, good = 8-6, elite = top 5.

**QB:** I addressed Tannehill and Willis already. The other QB, Logan Woodside, has been with the team for years now. The Titans have tried to replace him several times with players like Trevor Siemian, DeShone Kizer, and most recently Matt Barkley but nobody has seemed to be able to take his spot. Most believe he will be the number 2 QB this season. Next season either Willis will be the #2 QB (most likely) or Tannehill will be released and Willis will start. **Average with above average potential**

**Backfield:** Many believe that 2021 was the beginning of the end for Derrick Henry since he had a “major” injury. I want to push back on that. First of all, obviously he played in the playoffs so he’s had an entire offseason to get back to his former self. Second, it really wasn’t a “major” injury, it was really just an injury he couldn’t continue playing on. Any other common injury is much more significant, I would argue even a hamstring injury would have been more concerning for his future. [Here’s a study on NBA players that says the majority of NBA players who have a Jones fracture return to prior level of performance and elite athletes demonstrate no decrease in performance on their return to play](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26627111/). Now if you want to argue that the end is near for King Henry because of his age, then sure I can’t argue that other than by saying Henry is a freak of nature and I hope you’re wrong. I just want to be clear that his 2021 injury will not be the reason his career declines, even if he does have a down year this season. Tory Carter is an awesome fullback to watch, he just abuses people. **King**

**TE:** This TE group, while still not great, is miles better than what it was last season. If the offense as a whole is any better in 2022, I would bet every cent I have it’s mainly because of this group, specifically because of Austin Hooper. We have a competent receiving/blocking TE in Austin Hooper, an okay blocking TE in Geoff Swaim, and pure athletic rookie with Jonnu Smith type potential in Chig Okonkwo.  **Below Average with average potential**

**WR:** This group relies heavily on two types of players you never want to have to rely on: a rookie and a player coming off a torn ACL. The good news is that both players are very talented. There isn’t a lot of depth behind them though, and I would still expect the Titans to add one more piece to this room (my guess would be Will Fuller). I believe Kyle Phillips will play right away in the slot and be solid. **Below Average with potential to be average or bad**

**OL:** Taylor Lewan at LT  had a tough year last year coming off of a torn ACL but he got better as the season went on and most players are better in their 2nd year from a torn ACL than their first. Ben Jones played like a top 10 center last year, so those are the two spots the Titans should feel really good about. Nate Davis at RG took a bit of a step back last season, but he has shown before that he can be a good player and is at least a solid option. RT is likely to be Dillon Radunz, a 2021 2nd round pick who did not play much last season. He did start one game at LT and held up relatively well against Nick Bosa ([/u/NoFlagsFilm Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZuEQBvZI90)), so he certainly has potential. I have no idea who is going to start at LG, but I would very much like the Titans to sign Ereck Flowers and plug him in there. I truly believe that alone would take this line from bad to at least average.  **Bad with below average potential because of LG and RT being total question marks.**

**Overall offense:** Here is the quick argument I can make for this offense: if Robert Woods, Treylon Burks, Austin Hooper, Derrick Henry, and of course Ryan Tannehill can all stay healthy this year then this offense will likely be better in 2022. How is that possible? In 2021 AJ Brown and Julio Jones combined to go 94/1304/6. I don’t think anybody would argue that if Burks and Woods stay healthy, they will out produce that. Not to mention how much of a big deal having a competent TE is.  **Below Average.**",28.0,nfl,t3_wb2hlf,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-07-29T06:38:54Z,tennesseetitans,5.397584822682713e-06

51722,298758,298758,trick96,"#VII. Schedule and Predictions

I really don’t like doing schedule predictions, especially before preseason is over. I will not be doing score predictions. So here goes:

**Week 1 – vs New York Giants:** This is a must win for the Titans if they want to have a good season, but the Giants will likely be much improved from last season. **W, 1-0**

**Week 2 - @ Buffalo Bills (MNF):** Bills will be looking to stop their 2-loss streak to the Titans, both of which were also on primetime. Bills look scary good. **L, 1-1**

**Week 3 – vs Las Vegas Raiders:** Look it’s the only team that had a worse 2020 first round draft than the Titans. Great team though. **W, 2-1**

**Week 4 - @ Indianapolis Colts:** Colts should be better this season than last season thanks to one simple trick of throwing away Carson Wentz. **L, 2-2**

**Week 5 – Washington Commanders:** This is another one that can be filed under must win to have a good season. Should be a great defensive game. **W, 3-2**

**Week 6 – Bye Week**

**Week 7 – Indianapolis Colts:** Much like last year, the two Titans/Colts games will be over early in the year. If one team can win both these games, it should have a massive effect on the outcome of the season. Luckily for this game, the Titans will be coming off a bye week and will be at home. The Titans under Mike Vrabel are [undefeated in the regular season with extra time to prepare](https://new.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rv2wva/why_is_the_potential_of_having_a_bye_week_so/) with an average score of 29.6 – 10.9. **W, 4-2**

**Week 8 - @ Houston Texans** The Titans will extend their winning streak to 3 with a win here. **5-2**

**Week 9 – @ Kansas City Chiefs (SNF):** The Titans are 2-0 against Patrick Mahomes in the regular season. The Titans will be 5+ point underdogs in this game but manage to win. **W, 6-2**

**Week 10 – vs Denver Broncos:** The 5 game winning streak ends here when Russell Wilson and the Broncos come to town. **L, 6-3**

**Week 11 - @ Green Bay Packers (TNF):** I have never been more confident in predicting a loss. **L, 6-4**

**Week 12 – vs Cincinnati Bengals:** This game is circled on the calendar and Mike Vrabel is undefeated the week after TNF games. **W, 7-4**

**Week 13 - @ Philadelphia Eagles:** If AJ Brown is still healthy, he is going to shit on the Titans. **L, 7-5**

**Week 14 – vs Jacksonville Jaguars:** Very late first game with the Jaguars. I will not predict a loss to the Jaguars until I see Trevor Lawrence be a good QB. **W, 8-5**

**Week 15 - @ Los Angeles Chargers:** Herbie gud. **L, 8-6**

**Week 16 – Houston Texans:** Titans sweep the Texans as revenge for not sweeping them last year. **W, 9-6**

**Week 17 – vs Dallas Cowboys (TNF):** An outdoor night game in December? Yeah, Derrick Henry will be going nuts. **W, 10-6**

**Week 18 - @ Jacksonville Jaguars:** Mike Vrabel is undefeated coming off of TNF + I will not predict a loss to the Jaguars until I see Trevor Lawrence be a good QB. **W, 11-6**

#Overall: 11-6 (5-1 Division), 1st AFC South

The Titans will be AFC South champions for the 3rd year in a row. Also I would like to say it’s bullshit the Titans have to play 2 TNF games.",13.0,tennesseetitans,t3_w9dbhn,False,0.0,:6::5:,2022-07-27T07:25:07Z,tennesseetitans,0.0014002534350256
51723,298759,298759,trick96,"**DL:** Jeffery Simmons is the best DT in the AFC and Denico Autry just had the best year of his long career. Big Jeff still has room to grow his game, as he still needs to be more consistent game to game. Titans have good nose tackles as well, but depth is a concern for this group. **Elite.**

**OLB:** Bud Dupree had a down year last year, but much like Taylor Lewan, I expect him to be better another year removed from his ACL injury. Harold Landry has a big contract to live up to, but it’s important to note that he does so much more for this team than just rush the passer, so to judge him solely on his pass rushing ability is disingenuous. He is a great, complete edge player who rarely comes off the field. Good depth here with a 2nd year player many are excited about in Rashad Weaver, who flashed in the preseason last year but had his season cut short due to injury.  **Good.**

**ILB:** David Long Jr is borderline elite. You probably don’t know much about him if you’re not a Titans fan, but you should. He is a complete 3-down linebacker, he’s great against the run and the pass. He flies to the football with and makes plays. His breakout season was shortened due to having a hamstring injury in the middle of it, so that didn’t help his name recognition, but regardless I can’t wait to watch him play this year. Meanwhile Zach Cunningham is one of the best run defenders in the league and competent in pass coverage. This duo is very quietly one of the best in the league.  **Elite.**

**CB:** This is the most interesting group on defense, mostly because it’s the only group with a new starter and that starter happens to be an interesting case. Caleb Farley was viewed as an elite talent coming out, with potential to be a top 10 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. However, he had surgery on an injured back and due to concerns with that he fell all the way to the 20’s where the Titans picked him up. He missed a lot of training camp due to a separate injury then missed the first few games of the season and ended up only playing in 3 games last season due to tearing his ACL. So now the Titans have a lot of their eggs in the basket of a highly talented player that has had a back surgery and ACL surgery in the last year and a half. Farley participated in minicamp and will not begin training camp on PUP so he will be ready to go. Farley is an absolute wildcard for this defense, but good news for Farley is that he has a ton of good players around him to make things easier. Other than Farley, there’s Kristian Fulton who had a breakout season in 2021 and Elijah Molden in the slot who will look to improve upon his good rookie season. **Above Average with potential to be good or average/below average.**

**S:** Amani Hooker had a fantastic breakout season last year. He’s only the 2nd best safety on the team but he had one of the best seasons last year of any safety in the league in 2021. Meanwhile Kevin Byard remains absolutely elite in every way. This safety duo is absolutely insane.  **Best In The League.**

**Overall Defense:** I truly believe the Titans defense is one of the most slept on things in the entire NFL. They were fantastic last year, and this year the only significant changes are: replacing Jackrabbit Jenkins with Caleb Farley, having Zach Cunningham for the entire season, and hopefully less injuries. I mean the Titans didn’t even lose a defensive coach (that they didn’t fire). Amani Hooker, David Long Jr, and Kristian Fulton are all budding stars that nobody is talking about, they all had breakout seasons last year. This defense could possibly carry this team to the playoffs this season. I can’t believe how young of a defense it is. Denico Autry is the only player over 30, having just turned 32 and coming off the best year of his career. Bud Dupree is 29. Then Kevin Byard at 28. Cunningham at 27. Then every single other player on the starting defense is either on their rookie contract or have yet to play a snap of their 2nd contract (Harold Landry). If you want to know more about the defensive scheme the Titans run, [here is the /u/NoFlagsFilm breakdown on Shane Bowen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F41eoZu-qF8). Overall, here is how I see this defense: It comes down to one player to decide just how good this defense will be in 2022. If Caleb Farley is bad, this defense will still be good. If Caleb Farley is just competent, this defense will be elite. And if Caleb Farley is good, this defense will be damn near the best defense in the league, if not THE best. **Elite with potential to be the best in the league or just good depending almost entirely on one unproven player with ridiculously high potential.**

**Special Teams:** Worth pointing out that K Caleb Shudak got the 2nd most guaranteed money of all the Titans UDFA’s, so the Titans clearly wanted to have a real battle for the kicker spot. However, Shudak was injured in minicamp and will begin camp on PUP, so the competition is likely over before it starts unless Shudak can get healthy soon. Kicker could be an issue for the Titans, but Randy Bulluck was solid for them last season though he has limited range. Punter Brett Kern (who has been with the team since 2009) took a pay cut to remain with the team this offseason, last season was the first season I’ve ever seen where he looked human punting the ball. If the Titans want to be the run first, defensive team they’re designed to be they really want Brett Kern to recapture his former glory. **Below Average.**",8.0,tennesseetitans,t3_w9dbhn,False,0.0,:6::5:,2022-07-27T07:24:57Z,tennesseetitans,3.985542577392136e-06
51724,298760,298760,trick96,"###VI. Roster Evaluation

**Position groups:**

I will give a brief description of how I see each group as well as give a grade for each group. My grading scale is Bad = bottom 5 in the league, below average = 27-19, average = 18-14 above average = 13-9, good = 8-6, elite = top 5.

**QB:** I addressed Tannehill and Willis already. The other QB, Logan Woodside, has been with the team for years now. The Titans have tried to replace him several times with players like Trevor Siemian, DeShone Kizer, and most recently Matt Barkley but nobody has seemed to be able to take his spot. Most believe he will be the number 2 QB this season. Next season either Willis will be the #2 QB (most likely) or Tannehill will be released and Willis will start. **Average with above average potential**

**Backfield:** Many believe that 2021 was the beginning of the end for Derrick Henry since he had a “major” injury. I want to push back on that. First of all, obviously he played in the playoffs so he’s had an entire offseason to get back to his former self. Second, it really wasn’t a “major” injury, it was really just an injury he couldn’t continue playing on. Any other common injury is much more significant, I would argue even a hamstring injury would have been more concerning for his future. [Here’s a study on NBA players that says the majority of NBA players who have a Jones fracture return to prior level of performance and elite athletes demonstrate no decrease in performance on their return to play](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26627111/). Now if you want to argue that the end is near for King Henry because of his age, then sure I can’t argue that other than by saying Henry is a freak of nature and I hope you’re wrong. I just want to be clear that his 2021 injury will not be the reason his career declines, even if he does have a down year this season. Tory Carter is an awesome fullback to watch, he just abuses people. **King**

**TE:** This TE group, while still not great, is miles better than what it was last season. If the offense as a whole is any better in 2022, I would bet every cent I have it’s mainly because of this group, specifically because of Austin Hooper. We have a competent receiving/blocking TE in Austin Hooper, an okay blocking TE in Geoff Swaim, and pure athletic rookie with Jonnu Smith type potential in Chig Okonkwo.  **Below Average with average potential**

**WR:** This group relies heavily on two types of players you never want to have to rely on: a rookie and a player coming off a torn ACL. The good news is that both players are very talented. There isn’t a lot of depth behind them though, and I would still expect the Titans to add one more piece to this room (my guess would be Will Fuller). I believe Kyle Phillips will play right away in the slot and be solid. **Below Average with potential to be average or bad**

**OL:** Taylor Lewan at LT  had a tough year last year coming off of a torn ACL but he got better as the season went on and most players are better in their 2nd year from a torn ACL than their first. Ben Jones played like a top 10 center last year, so those are the two spots the Titans should feel really good about. Nate Davis at RG took a bit of a step back last season, but he has shown before that he can be a good player and is at least a solid option. RT is likely to be Dillon Radunz, a 2021 2nd round pick who did not play much last season. He did start one game at LT and held up relatively well against Nick Bosa ([/u/NoFlagsFilm Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZuEQBvZI90)), so he certainly has potential. I have no idea who is going to start at LG, but I would very much like the Titans to sign Ereck Flowers and plug him in there. I truly believe that alone would take this line from bad to at least average.  **Bad with below average potential because of LG and RT being total question marks.**

**Overall offense:** Here is the quick argument I can make for this offense: if Robert Woods, Treylon Burks, Austin Hooper, Derrick Henry, and of course Ryan Tannehill can all stay healthy this year then this offense will likely be better in 2022. How is that possible? In 2021 AJ Brown and Julio Jones combined to go 94/1304/6. I don’t think anybody would argue that if Burks and Woods stay healthy, they will out produce that. Not to mention how much of a big deal having a competent TE is.  **Below Average.**",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_w9dbhn,False,0.0,:6::5:,2022-07-27T07:22:40Z,tennesseetitans,5.397584822682713e-06
