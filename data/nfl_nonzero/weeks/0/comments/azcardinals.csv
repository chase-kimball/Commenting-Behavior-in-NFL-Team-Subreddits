2870,23761,23761,Cannolidog,Golden is only better if all you care about is sack numbers. Golden is a worse run defender overall and was able to generate 0.5 more sacks on the season in part because of all the attention Chandler Jones drew after week 1 making it easier for him. Even then Jones was more disruptive in the pass rush because of the penalties he’d be able to draw. When he wasn’t getting sacks he was drawing holding penalties on the o-line that couldn’t deal with him. His tackle for loss numbers and pressures are still generally in line statistically with his 2018 and 2019 seasons. Cardinals fans are underrating Chandler Jones because they don’t want to acknowledge the likely outcome that our defense got quite a bit worse.

„ALL football fans in Germany ask themselves this question! Who is playing the first regular NFL game in Munich? According to BILD information, the National Football League is planning a real mega bang for the first game: Kansas City Chiefs vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers! Nothing is official yet. But soon the NFL wants to announce the teams. The names of the two mega teams are increasingly being mentioned in connection with Munich.

One thing is clear: The Chiefs have a close connection to FC Bayern, in whose Allianz Arena the first game will take place. According to BILD information, the Chiefs have pushed NFL internally to play in Munich and get ""home rights"". Accordingly, they would be willing to forego a home game at the legendary Arrowhead Stadium, the loudest stadium in the world. Like the Chiefs, the Buccaneers have secured the NFL marketing rights for Germany. So both teams are very interested in playing here. Chiefs vs. Buccaneers — that would be the Super Bowl of 2021. Last year, Tampa Bay won with quarterback legend Tom Brady, who just finished his great career. Football fans can look forward to Chiefs quarterback superstar Patrick Mahomes.“",47.0,nfl,t3_sym5zn,False,0.0,:Cardinals: Cardinals,2022-02-22T06:26:13Z,azcardinals,0.0038744718594666

  You see, this is the narrative I don't like. Kyler would have played like shit in that game no matter what. His problem isn't the playoffs, his problem is adversity. The entire team around him crumbled apart. It had been happening for 3 or 4 games prior to that game. But it really imploded in that game. He had about 0.3 seconds before he was sacked every play and had to find one of our completely covered recievers in that time. There was ZERO Kyler could have done to fix it. The only thing he could have done that he didn't do was save face by being a cheerleader on the sidelines I guess. But bottom line that game was trash and we all know it WAS NOT KYLER that caused it even though this whole situation has turned against him. 

  He is the best thing that has come out of the draft for this team in a long time. If he goes somewhere else with a decent line, recievers, and coach he will ball out. PAY THE LITTLE GUY. He isn't going to get any cheaper and even if it seems like an overpayment we will not find anyone better for any cheaper in a couple years.",1.0,azcardinals,t3_u4xqw5,False,0.0,:Primary1: Kyler Murray,2022-04-16T21:13:47Z,azcardinals,0.0012282894237557

I'm dense??? You're making your own fan theories that just make no sense lmfao. Why would he delete everything to make a point to the organization then immediately back track? Your logic is terrible. Doesn't create leverage or anything

>He wants a massive contract before his rookie deal is up, and he wants it despite having zero playoff wins with a team that has been well built. Look how well signing first round QBs to early, massive deals worked out for the Cowboys, Eagles and Rams with Prescott, Wentz, and Goff, only one is on their original team still and he's constantly coming up short in the playoffs. Kyler hasn't earned a massive deal yet, that's everyone's issue.

&#x200B;

dude, he's played 3 seasons lmao. He's shown enough to the point where he's worth whatever he wants, because did you see our team before he showed up? Dude is genuinely a star. You're looking at this from the side of the cardinals and not the actual player himself and thats just silly. Get a steve keim jersey.

&#x200B;

>yeah because him being immature through social media and demanding an early payout despite having nothing to truly back it up, paired with his on field and locker room lack of leadership really screams a mature leader to me. If you notice you're in the vast majority of how Kyler is perceived, maybe you should put down your bias and look around instead of trying to confirm everything you believe with one-sided information.

Everybody who has spoken about kyler says he's an amazing leader and probably the hardest worker on the team. You arent in the huddle, the sidelines, or anything. Once again, you are listening to the  media and not the people literally the closest to him, because it fits your narrative better. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>The Cardinals have really no reason to trade him yet unless a big offer comes in and they don't believe he's a franchise starter, but you're talking about a franchise that took back to back first round QBs, dropping the first one after a single season. They seem to be pretty emotionless with their decisions, there's absolutely a chance that Kyler gets traded, especially if he refuses to play the rest of the season without a contract.

""Steve Wilks (ARI): This one is really iffy all the way around. The team went 8-8 the year before, then 3-13 under Wilks.

The GM at the time cited that the team was blown out too many times, but the roster was also just plain not good... it's possible Keim fired him to save himself. With the benefit of hindsight this might be justifiable, but based on the information at the time... Probably ""glass-cliffed""""

If you're a foodie and you have a decent budget for your trip you can go to Scottsdale and check out some nice restaurants. 

I've never been but a lot of people enjoy our wildlife parks/aquariums. 

If you like nature, tourists often come and go on hikes around the valley. Please bring lots of water and let someone know where you'll be going if you choose to do this.

We have Escape Rooms here that are kinda fun if you enjoy puzzles and team work, I dont know if they have those in Germany.

Also depending on your budget and if you like basketball, you can catch a home game of the best team in the NBA. 

If you do a little looking around on Facebook, you might find some events around the valley like specialty food trucks, or a exotic car meet up, and other random stuff.

This is all stuff you could do down here in the Valley, like I said I don't know what your plans are or how long you're gonna be here but going up North to Sedona is a popular tourist location to, it's very beautiful for hikes and nature related activities.

Zimmer, a defensive minded head coach who was fired for years of mediocrity and stubbornness. Not a winner. 

Jim Harbaugh, a “winner”, who benefited from an entirely new scheme taking NFL defenses by surprise. Teams finally adjusted and surprise, his teams were terrible and he couldn’t adjust. 

Leftwich, unproven and has rode of the coat tails of Bruce Arians his entire coaching career, and his one season without him posted the 4 worst offensive DVOA of all time after McCoy was fired. 

Kellen Moore, entirely unproven, not a “winner” by any means. Supposed offensive mastermind that has continuously disappointed in Dallas.

18931,162845,162845,buddaaaa,"In my opinion, the run with Bruce Arians early in Keim’s tenure rivals that of the Warner years. He only had one losing season in Arizona (when Palmer tore his ACL, iirc) out of 5 years, and went 10-6, 11-5, and 13-3 in his first 3 years. Cardinals were one of the only teams ever to miss the playoffs at 10-6 in 2013. They didn’t make the Super Bowl because of the Carolina collapse, but I think those teams were just objectively better than the ones during Warner’s years in Arizona.

Now, there’s a whole different discussion about Keim’s influence on those teams. He became GM the same year Arians started and the only impactful draft pick he made for those teams was Tyrann Mathieu (which I’d argue is a special/lucky case). He did trade for Palmer which is a crazy steal looking back, but yeah, the main core of those teams (Patrick Peterson, Calais Campbell, Larry Fitzgerald) were all Rod Graves players, not Keim.

Once the juice of those guys ran out is when you had Arians leave and the Wilks era was ushered in and the Cardinals completely shat the bed. I think Kyler and Kliff’s scheme have helped keep the Cardinals’ head above water, but if you take a look at the roster it’s just a bunch of “who?”

18935,162867,162867,buddaaaa,"I don’t think your analysis says anything i disagree with, but it also doesn’t say anything we didn’t already know.

The chart was posted in response to a tweet about the Jags spending the most guaranteed money ever in FA this year, snarkily implying that them being big spenders doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to get better, which isn’t necessarily a premise I disagree with.

What I don’t like, however, is that the vagueness of the chart is going to lead people to infer that spending lots of money is bad or the contrapositive that it’s good to spend little money in FA. (Just look at the other comments in this thread, or reason why it was posted here to see what I mean)

For example, if a team were to have a couple of amazing drafts in a row, like the Seahawks of the early ‘10s, I think there’s a very good argument for that team to be big spenders in free agency. It’s a great way to maximize team-friendly deals.

It's easy for Mahomes to have confidence and maturity when he knows he's working with Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill  and the million other weapons they have. Would those other quarterbacks be as ""mature"" if they were getting torn a new asshole by Aaron Donald 2x a year while they have to try to hold the ball to throw at AJ Green or Christian Kirk who can't even catch?

Regression has hit the Cardinals pretty hard here in the home stretch (they were unstably good on third/fourth down and TO ratio, to name a couple).

Makes it even more frustrating that they went Isaiah Simmons in the first round in 2020 when they had their pick of the litter at WR (most Cardinals fans wanted Ceedee). Simmons is turning out to be a decent player but frankly the position he plays is so much less impactful than another alpha at WR would’ve been.

Lowest price on SeatGeek is $338 for that section and also near 50 yard line. 

Face value is antiquated for football tickets. It doesn’t count pre-season because they go way under face value and practically free.  It obviously doesn’t account for supply and demand which depends on the popular teams and even playoff implications…or popular storylines like Brady’s possible last visit to the stadium. 

So yeah you could wait till before the game to see if there are any cheap tickets left if you want the cheapest deal. 

Also as I’ve always complained before Cardinals fans are always looking for the best price whereas diehard fans (typically opponents) pay for whatever they can. Tickets were going for as low as $70 in that section (I think third row) and I couldn’t even convince Cardinals fans to go when it was against the Texans during a great season.  So unfortunately the stadium really does rely on opponents to fill to the stadium and that’s not right. 

So many comments like “it’s too expensive” or “I rather watch it on TV” but no one understands this is the NFL and we’re spoiled to have a great stadium and and up and up team.

Go be a fan of baseball or NHL if you want face value.

Edit:
Also someone called me out last season or two season ago when I posted about cheap tickets and someone said “If it’s so cheap then why don’t you buy me a ticket.”  So I bought two redditors tickets for a Reddit thank you post or picture (and to put money where my mouth is).

Most views are great EXCEPT for end zone. Even a slight angle at end zone is good. End zone stinks because the angle is weird and when they pass the 30 yard line you’re stuck watching the Jumbotron.  There’s just wayyyy too many blind spots in the end zone. Unless you like watching field goals…lol. Even standing in the end zone in the standing areas…you’ll easily see why end zone stinks.

The players typically try to work for what's best for themselves.  As fans it's hard to root for both however it's typically the front office who looks out for the longevity of the team...usually.  I don't see some teams doing that but I do think that Bidwill and Keim are trying to piece together a Super Bowl winning team unlike past ownership.  You can't just pay everyone otherwise it hurts the team for this season and the season's to come.  

What Kyler is asking for (I blame it on his agent) is unprecedented and ridiculous.  He's going to cause us to overpay when he's still not proven for an entire season yet.  Of course he's asking for what he's asking now...there's no other QB's there, he's worried about this season's schedule, and he put himself in a place to negotiate well.  The strength of schedule doesn't look too good for us this season and Kyler knows that if he can't preform.  

Keim also knows that though.  Murray is unproven for an entire season.  However Murray is also making demands to build a better team around him.

That OL has changed for whatever reason and either other team’s defense are playing Kyler different or we’re not protecting in sync. I like to think we’re not protecting in sync only because of all the penalties that we’ve been having.   

With that Kyler Murray has definitely been over throwing a lot of the passes since he has to throw it at a higher angle because he’s not getting the protection. It seems like the defense has figured out his passing lanes as well.

So while Kyler may be part to blame… The team and the coaches need to adjust faster to how other teams are playing the Arizona Cardinals.
