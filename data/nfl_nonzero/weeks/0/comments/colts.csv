I like Jimmy G but the Colts want someone who will be ready for OTAs.  So not him.  Jameis has said the only 2 teams that have contacted him are the Saints and the Colts.  Not a fan of that.  At this point, I want Watson to choose ATL so that the Saints go back to Jameis, and the Colts are dealt Matt Ryan.

By the end of the second Rams game he had once again gotten himself hurt (because of reckless play, mind you) and couldn't finish the game.  People talk about poor o-line play but film study shows that plenty of the sacks he took were because he was missing wide open players underneath in favor of looking downfield for a non-existant home run ball.  I was seeing very few routine timing routes and his accuracy was all over the place-- I judged Carson to be completely ineffective at elevating the talent around him.  He was very underwhelming.

I don’t want to look it up. I know I’ve got the world at my fingertip. Google is a great tool. Anyone with a remote sense of a moral compass would take issue with excusing sexual assault.

Edit: since making that initial post, I have learned about text messages between Deshaun and at least one of the women as well as the large amount of women accusing him. THAT was the purpose of my initial post.

From their website

""[Premature birth](https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/preterm-labor-and-premature-baby.aspx) (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and its complications are the #1 cause of death of babies in the United States. Babies who survive premature birth often have[ long-term health problems](https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/long-term-health-effects-of-premature-birth.aspx), including [cerebral palsy](https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/cerebral-palsy.aspx), intellectual disabilities, [chronic lung disease](https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/common-conditions-treated-in-the-nicu.aspx), blindness and [hearing loss](https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/hearing-loss-and-your-baby.aspx). In the United States, about 380,000 babies are born prematurely each year. The preterm birth rate (the percent of babies born before 37 weeks each year) is 9.8 percent in the United States. This means 1 in 10 babies is born too soon. The U.S. preterm birth rate is among the worst of high-resource nations.
The March of Dimes Prematurity Campaign aims to reduce premature birth in the United States and to give every baby a fair chance for a healthy [full-term](https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/what-is-full-term.aspx) birth. Yet this fair chance is not reality for all babies. The preterm birth rate rose to 9.8 percent in 2016, up 2 percent from 9.6 in 2015, marking the second consecutive increase after steady declines over the previous 7 years. The March of Dimes [Premature Birth Report Card](https://www.marchofdimes.org/mission/reportcard.aspx) reveals racial/ethnic and geographic disparities signifying that babies have a higher chance of a premature birth based simply on race/ethnicity and zip code.  
In 2017, the March of Dimes convened the [Prematurity Campaign Collaborative](https://www.marchofdimes.org/professionals/prematurity-collaborative.aspx) to address the persistent health inequities and rising rate of preterm birth in the United States. Through the Collaborative, hundreds of organizations and experts work together on the shared challenge to “Achieve Equity and Demonstrated Improvements in Preterm Birth.” If you’d like to join the Collaborative or receive its newsletter, send an email to collaborative@marchofdimes.org. 
[Prematurity Campaign activities](https://www.marchofdimes.org/mission/march-of-dimes-prematurity-campaign.aspx) fall in five main areas:
1.    Research and discovery
2.    Care innovation and community engagement
3.    Advocacy
4.    Education
5.    Family-centered newborn intensive care units (NICUs)
Prematurity Campaign activities are based on the latest data and scientific evidence. State prematurity profiles and other prematurity data are available on [Peristats](https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/Peristats.aspx). March of Dimes annual Premature Birth Report Cards, issued every November since 2008, assign letter grades to the nation, 50 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico based on the latest available data on preterm birth rates. Report Cards highlight priority areas for action with county and racial/ethnic disparities data and a disparity ratio. Report Cards have elevated the issue of prematurity among thought leaders, policy-makers and the public.""",1.0,colts,t3_rje53a,False,0.0,:ty: ty,2021-12-25T08:02:28Z,colts,0.0005903398126246

• Venturi is concerned about the depth at WR, and just the unit we have in general. He isn’t sold at all on our WR’s yet. He also said that Ogletree “will be pressing the door here” on Mo Allie Cox if he continues his drops.

Take it with a grain of salt, but from what I'm seeing... 

 

- They have one blue chip WR still available on the board!!!!!! I would not be shocked if we trade up for him. This WR is the only blue chip prospect visible on the board(WRs. TE. RB, QB, OT positions are visible).

- There are 2 WRs with red flags. No other red flag for a position visible on the board.

- There are a ton of WRs that are designated as ""gold"" - 3 of them regular WRs, if I'm not mistaken 4 designated as slots. 

- There are 3 visible TEs with ""gold"" designation - 2 of them Y TE, 1 of them F. 

- RBs(!!!!!!!!) There are 5 ""gold"" RBs left on the board!!!! Do not be shocked if we draft a RB withone of the day 3 picks... possibly even early day 3. 

- 2 OTs designated as gold, but they are very low on the board - I would guess, we are not picking one on day 2.

- There is ONE QB designated as ""gold""... if the blue chip WR is not on the board, or we can't trade up for him... be prepared... he's also highlighted with dark theme... seems like the leading player at each position is highlighted with dark theme. 

- There are several other categories that I cannot make out... one is under the gold category but almost noone is in it - it's possible it's another type of red flag category - for example - first one might be off-field red flags, other one might be medical red flags. Almost noone is in it - there is one QB in it and 3 OTs visible. 

- There are a TON of players in the ""black"" category. And then then a ton of players in the following category that is illegible(cannot read the designation).

- Kenny Moore - 32 5/8""
- Pierre Desir - 33""
- Xavier Rhodes - 33 3/4""
- Brandon Facyson - 32 5/8""

The only ones with arms under 32"" were TJ Carrie, who is just a hair under - 31 7/8"" and Nate Hairston - 31"" . This has been a threshold for the Seahawks for a while now and Ballard has tried for a while now to implement some elements of the Legion of Boom defenses the Seahawks had over the last 10-12 years. Gus Bradley was one of the originators of it, so I would expect this to continue to be a measurement the Colts heavily rely on.  

So... when looking at prospects, I would strongly lean towards ones with long arms(over 32""). According to that list:

Sign several young OLinemen(Tevi, Davenport) who have underperformed in the past with other teams and hope one of them gets better under new coaching and with new scheme. Seems like a lot of OL players need some time to figure it out and this sounds like a reasonable strategy. This is how we got our starting RG Mark Glowinski. He was pretty bad for Seattle for several years in the beginning of his career, but found his stride with our OLine. 

Tevi was one of the players he got to compete for the starting spot in case Fisher wasn't ready for week 1 or for the backup spot in case Fisher returned... Tevi along with another camp body in Will Holden were pretty bad in camp and Tevi lost his presumed starting spot by the time he got injured, but Julien Davenport emerged as a solid option in the absence of Fisher and won the competition for the LT spot. So in a weird way the strategy worked out exactly as intended - put 3 players in competition for the spot and hope one of them emerges. Well, one did emerge. He won't be a pro-bowler or something, but he seems good enough to be our swing tackle and take some starts whenever Fisher is not available.

Furthermore, this is the price of a top 10-12 QB nowadays. Look at what Carr, Kyler, and Dak got. Most would agree none of these guys are All Pro level QBs but are franchise QBs, and those are few and far between - so you have to pay for what the market dictates, and at this point it’s in the 40-50mil range. And I’d say Russ is a tier above those 3.

Our own QB Ryan signed a similar record breaking deal for 5/150 and that wasn’t long ago. And I’m sure everyone here remembers when we made Luck the highest paid NFL player ever… and that was for what? 25mil? QB prices are going to rise linearly until there’s some sort of CBA cap.

13714,104034,104034,OladipoForThree,"#IX. Offensive and Defensive Schemes
  
The Colts figure to run a run-first offense due to the strength of that group. Last year, in games where Carson Wentz threw over 30 passes, the Colts only won once. While I believe Matt Ryan to be more adept at managing and controlling games than Wentz, I still believe the Colts will focus on running over 35 times per game between Taylor, Hines, and Lindsay. The overall weakness of the WR core cements this fact, as Pittman is the only proven guy. The Colts frequently run 3 TE sets, more than any other team in the league. Granson, Jelani Woods, and Mo Alie-Cox should make for some killer run blocking. Sadly, Jack Doyle - one of the best run blocking TEs in the league - recently retired, and the Colts have a tall task in replacing him.

Defensively, they will most likely run Bradley's famous Cover-3 mainly instead of Eberflus' Cover-2. ""There's probably some similarities now – effort-based defense,"" Bradley, who praised the work Eberflus and the previous defensive coaching staff did, said. ""A team that plays with great effort. Great effort, great enthusiasm. I think enthusiasm is important on the field to create energy."" (From a Colts.com article on the addition of Bradley) Bradley was notoriously anti-blitz in Las Vegas, however he has stated he will blitz whenever the situation calls for it. In fact, when the Raiders did blitz, they were one of the most successful teams doing it according to PFF. The Colts are loaded with defensive talent: Yannick and Buckner on the line, Leonard with the LBs, and the Pro Bowl CB duo of Kenny Moore and Stephon Gilmore, so Bradley has plenty to work with to keep his defense flexible. More is stated about Bradley’s defense in the Coaching Additions section.",7.0,nfl,t3_vytyn2,False,0.0,:Colts: Colts,2022-07-14T06:59:47Z,colts,0.0099013041476474

I’m told there’s a recording of an interview with the adult son of 1 of 12 women the NFL interviewed in the Deshaun Watson case —stating his mom initially was complimentary of Watson in their conversations after the massage, but later switched her account and tone after 1/4

[Cont.] negative allegations surfaced about Watson. The son intimated his mother intended to reward his silence, per league source. There's a feeling that the NFL was initially cagey about details they learned from the woman’s son—after only mentioning they interviewed him 2/4

[Cont.] in their report. The son’s recording was later reviewed by Watson’s side revealing the aforementioned details —presumably illuminating why this particular accuser was not included with the 5 women the NFL ultimately focused on at the hearing. 3/4

15619,115420,115420,RelentlessRogue,"* Stafford: 17 interceptions,	2.8 INT-TD ratio
* Murray: 10 interceptions,	2.1 INT-TD ratio
* Wentz: 7 interceptions, 1.4 INT-TD ratio.

Looking at sacks & fumbles as well: 

* Wentz: 32 sacks, 8 fumbles
* Stafford: 30 sacks, 5 fumbles
* Murray: 31 sacks, 15 fumbles

So collectively, Wentz combined for 15 turnovers, to Stafford's 22, and Kyler's 23. And he took virtually the same number of sacks. 

Also, here's a list of every Colts offensive player to miss multiple games last season: 

* LT Eric Fisher only played in 15 games
* C Ryan Kelley only played in 14 games
* LG Quinten Nelson only played 13 games
* RT Braden Smith only played in 11 games
* WR TY Hilton only played in 10 games
* WR Paris Campbell only played in 6 games.

In fact, the only Colts offensive players to appear in all 17 games last season were: 

* QB Carson Wentz
* RB Jonathan Taylor
* RB Nyheim Hines
* WR Michael Pittman Jr.
* WR Ashton Dulin
* TE Jack Doyle
* TE Mo Alie-Cox
* TE Kylen Granson
* OT Matt Pryor

You can blame 2021 on Wentz all you want (Irsay sure seems content to do so) but the fact of the matter is, the offensive line was injury-prone as hell, our passing game was constantly being changed because of injuries, and we were one of the run-heaviest teams in the league last year. Wentz wasn't perfect, but he sure as hell wasn't as bad as the media portrays him. 

That was the same reason Philadelphia was such a train-wreck in 2020: Major injuries to almost every starter on the offensive line and in the WR room. Sure, you can make the ""great quarterbacks elevate the guys around them"" argument, but that requires consistency, something Wentz had none of in 2020 and minimal of in 2021.",-1.0,colts,t3_x7bjnl,False,1.0,COLTS,2022-09-06T14:24:16Z,colts,0.035684399986267

15628,115454,115454,RelentlessRogue,"So let me get this straight; this offseason the Browns have: 

1. Signed Jacoby Brissett, Joshua Dobbs, and Josh Rosen in Free Agency, none of whom they apparently trust to lead the team for 18 weeks.
2. Traded for DeShaun Watson, and gave him an insane amount of money
3. Traded away Baker Mayfield, and are going to pay him $10 million to beat them Week 1.

With all that said, the Browns are out: 

* Three first-round picks, one third-round pick, and two fourth-round picks that they sent to the Texans for Watson
* $230 million guaranteed to Watson over 5 years. 
* $4.5 million they guaranteed to their backup, Jacoby Brissett
* $10 million they're still paying Baker, after trading him, AFTER picking up his 5th year option. 
* Plus WHATEVER the 49ers can get out of them for Jimmy G. And don't forget that Cleveland will have to pay some, if not all, of his $24.2 million base salary

In total, over $240 million in guaranteed money, plus three first-round and three additional picks, PLUS whatever they need to trade to San Fran to acquire Jimmy G...

...all for the most controversial QB in the history of the NFL, who for all we know may never play another snap in his life, a conditional fourth rounder from Carolina, a 6th round pick from the Texans, the quickest collapse of a franchise in modern sports history, AND any respect the previously worst team in professional sports might have gained in the last 4 years. 

Every single person who signed off on that trade should be fired and banned from the league for gross incompetency, the ownership should be severely punished, and Watson should be suspended for at least as many games as Josh Gordon collectively has been, if not more.

>If our free agency is being held up by other teams, then trading Wentz was a mistake.  


What I mean by that is, we haven't made a single move in free agency (probably because nobody wants to play for a team without a starting QB), and it seems to be because Ballard is waiting to see where the other QBs fall before making moves. The problem is, anyone who thought we were serious contenders for Watson, Wilson, or Rogers, is delusional. No premier QB wants to go to a run-first team with a bottom-10 WR room and an O-line missing a left tackle. 

So now here we are, with no quarterback, no options aside from side-grades or flat out downgrades from Wentz, and a mountain of cap space and nobody to spend it on.

Second thing I do: I call Washington and cancel the damn trade. We're not finding a better QB than Wentz this year and I'd rather have him than nobody and a tank season. 

Third thing I'd do: Restructure Wentz's contract. Sure, we don't wanna pay him $28 million, but lowering his cap hit and adding a no-trade clause for the next say, 2-3 seasons, should solve our self-induced QB issues for a couple of years. 

Fourth thing I'd do: Toss a bag at Terron Armstead; let's solidify our line with the best available FA. While I'm shopping at the Big n Tall Linemen store, I'll sign Pryor as a swing tackle and get Chris Reed back to hold down RG. 

Fifth thing I'd do: Sign Juju Smith-Schuster to a 3 year deal, $10 mil/year average. Pray to the football gods that the Jags haven't completely fucked the receiver market and get a 1B to go along with our 1A Pittman. 

Sixth thing: Go get Casey Hayward to lock down the opposite outside corner spot from Rock. Give Rodgers another year as a solid backup and another vet to learn from. 

Seventh: Lock down some solid rotational players on defense. Bring back Zaire Franklin to be our 3rd LB; bring back Lewis, Muhammad, Stallworth, and Woods to be the 2nd string D-line. Make damn sure Odum doesn't go anywhere, either. 

Eighth: I'm damn near out of cap space, so I start doing GM bulllshit and restructuring contracts.  Stewart, Buckner, Moore, Kelly, hell, even Leonard and Smith, I'm calling them up and seeing what extra space they'll make for us. 

Ninth: More Cap Space! Perfect. I'll sign TY Hilton to a cheap 'I swear this is my last year' reunion tour, as is tradition. I'll go sign Corey Clement to be our 3rd RB, he's a Wisconsin guy and a former Eagle, what more could we ask for there? I'll also go get the Packer that nobody expected us to get: ISU alum Big Bob Tonyan. He'll be cheap coming off the ACL anyways, and god knows the Packers have no cap space. Hell, just for fun, I'll go out and get a veteran pass rusher too. Who'd you all prefer, should I go get Justin Houston for a 2nd round here in Indy? 

Tenth: Draft Day comes. I take a project LT in the second round to develop behind Armstead; in the third round, I grab David Bell, who's stock plummets because he ran a 4.6 at the combine. Don't worry, he'll be a 650 yard receiver as a rookie. In the 4th round I'll take an edge rusher nobody's ever heard of; 5th round, a safety. 6th round will be a sneaky good linebacker, and in the 7th I'll take an interior lineman.

2019 Wentz make it work with garbage recievers because the Eagles line was amazing and they had a great 1-2 run game with Sanders and Howard, along with Ertz and Goddert both at 100%. 

Considering Washington has Logan Thomas, Terry McLaren, Antonio Gibson, and a passable line, they should be just fine.

I don't know if anyone better then Fisher is realistic since we probably don't shell out 20 mil plus for Armstead. I'm good with signing him, bringing back Glow/Reed to play guard ([although Alex Cappa is intriguing as well](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/tampa-bay-buccaneers/alex-cappa-25193/#:~:text=Alex%20Cappa%20signed%20a%204,average%20annual%20salary%20of%20%24842%2C176)), and drafting a prospect in the 3rd/4th round that needs a year.

Tight End is the lowest need of the 5 positions I listed; especially if Doyle runs it back. Re-signing Mo is gonna be important, and if either of them walk, we need to bring in a veteran presence at the position. I'm a big advocate of getting Zach Ertz, he has a relation with Frank and Wentz both and he's a high character guy. 

Currently our only Edge rushers are Kwitty, Dayo, Ben Banogu, and RJ Macintosh. We absolutely need some veteran depth & mentorship at the position. To a lesser extent, we also need DT depth, but Edge takes priority.

Ballard met with Wentz this morning for an hour and had ""a good conversation"".

Ballard pointed out that we had a lot more opportunities to win than just weeks 17 and 18. He pointed out the 2 OT losses, the Buccaneers running all over us in the 4th quarter to seal the game, and two red zone turnovers against the Rams. He very  heavily insinuated  that it was not solely Carson's fault the Colts didn't make playoffs. 

He wants to see how Wentz handles the valid criticism and cuts through the invalid criticism that's out there. Ballard also commented on how QB is both the hardest position to play in pro sports, and the most criticized. Leads me to believe that he may hedge his bets somehow, but I don't think the Colts are ruling out that Carson can build off last season and eliminate the mistakes he's being fairly criticized for, missing check downs as an example.

He declined to comment on the reports that there are players advocating for/against Wentz, which seemed to be pretty targeted towards the fact that both Pittman and JT seem to want him back.

Ballard is leaving his options on the table, for sure. I won't dispute that. But he gave the same level of endorsement towards the draft prospects and trade/free agent quarterbacks that he did to Carson; he was entirely non-committal.

>8. As bad as the Jaguars loss was for Carson Wentz and the Colts – and it was horrible - is that really reason enough to give up on him after one year? During the 12-game stretch from Week 4 to Week 16, Wentz completed 64 percent of his passes, had 22 TDs and 5 INTs, the Colts went 9-3, and Wentz’s 99.8 passer rating was 3rd-highest in the league (behind only Aaron Rodgers and Joe Burrow). He was one of the best QBs in the NFL for over 70 percent of the season. If the Colts do move on from Wentz, there’s no way it’s just for football reasons. Obviously, the consistency wasn’t there, but it’s hard to imagine Frank Reich looking at those numbers and thinking, “Nope, I can’t work with that, get rid of him.” No, there has to be something else factoring into the Colts’ reported decision to move on from Wentz and replace him with... what exactly?

Of course we saw that with Andrew but it was crossing my mind that really the same thing happened again with Phil. 

It will of course be interesting to see how the next two years go with Matt and what he ultimately decides or his health and performance provide in terms of longevity. Many already seem to be planning for him leaving in two years but that is very much yet to be determined. Regardless, Ballard has to decide how to approach this so that he isn't once again caught flat footed if it turns out we are in the market again soon. I expect that he will be looking for value in this and next year's draft and should someone fall to him he would pull the trigger. Saw this with Eason and Ehlinger. I wonder what we may have learned from those attempts. I think certainly we had to have taken something away from the Eason experience. 

If we aren't able to find a gem for cheap (seems unlikely), I just cant see us continuing to build and then when the time comes, leveraging multiple picks and assets to get to the top of the draft for an unknown rookie quantity ala San Fran. Ballard seems too in love with the draft to burn that many picks for a guy he isn't sure can play at a high level.

Hilton was absolutely not WR2. He hardly showed up. They drafted a young stud, have Campbell coming back from injury, and have talent that has developed another year. I’d say the WR room has improved. If (and it is a big if) Campbell can stay healthy, I think he will be on a level that nobody is expecting. He is incredibly talented. 

Julian Blackmon is a young safety who was playing lights out before he was injured last year. Incredible talent and probably one of the players I am most excited to see this year. Also the defensive scheme we expect to see from the new DC will allow Gilmore to play in a safety type role at times as well. The retirement wasn’t a huge loss, and they also added McLeod from the eagles who is still a very solid piece at safety. I see this as an overall improvement. 

To add on to all of this, Ngakoue may be on his fifth team but he has put up better numbers on all of those teams than we’ve seen from any EDGE guy in recent memory. He will be an upgrade. There is also the expectation that we see improvement from the 2 early round EDGE guys that were drafted last year. Paye started to look the part at the end of last season and I expect he will continue to develop into the first round level talent he was drafted to be. If there is more pressure from the outside, that reduces pressure on the secondary and should make the loss of Rock Ya-Sin much less impactful. 

Matt Ryan may be old, but I absolutely believe the dude can still play. One of the most important things about the passing offense Reich runs, that I wouldn’t expect casual colts fans or fans of other teams to realize, is that it is VERY much timing based. Carson Wentz was horrible at this. Like.. catastrophically bad. I think this is an area where Matt Ryan’s game is the strongest and I think he will compliment the system incredibly well. Though the WR room isn’t top in the league by any stretch, a quick and accurate quarterback, who isn’t afraid to hit a check down, should be able to make these guys shine. 

I will admit, I’m as big of a homer as they come. My rose colored classes are colts blue and I am convinced we are Super Bowl bound every single year. But. I also know football and I genuinely think that despite a lot of pieces being moved around, the colts have had a net improvement this off-season, and a pretty significant one.",44.0,colts,t3_w2irb7,False,0.0,Edgerrin James,2022-07-18T23:07:59Z,colts,0.0272937328029617

Second- Ballard has to do something to keep his job. I’m not saying he’s on the hot seat but it’s clear that if he brings in another mid-level vet qb that leads to us missing the playoffs he will be. That could potentially be the final nail. If you bring in a guy like Jimmy G and we miss the playoffs again, I think either the coach or the GM is gone. And I don’t think Jimmy G/Cousins/Minshew/Trubisky have shown you a single thing to give you the confidence to take that risk. You can’t gamble your career on another middle of the pack guy. Or at least I wouldn’t. So, assuming he wants to keep this job, he has basically two options. Find a young guy that can be developed into something better than Wentz within the next 1-3 years. Or. Yolo on a guy like Carr. If we bring in a young guy, maybe move up to draft one, he will have to trust his scouts and his gut that they’ve got the right guy. If he shows promise by the end of the season, that’s enough to keep fans happy and optimistic. If he doesn’t, he’s in trouble, but probably not gone since you can’t always make a decision on a rookie after year one. If he yolo’s on Carr and it works out, his job is safe for a while. If not, he’s gone since.. well… Yolo. IMO, What gives you the highest chance of keeping your job safe is bringing in a guy like Carr. He’s the safest bet. Regardless of what it costs. Either he risks it on a rookie in an especially subpar draft class or he mortgages the future on Carr. We already know that Carr checks most of the boxes. Unless he is SURE about a jimmy g type player, it seems to me that the lowest risk move, from a Ballard career standpoint alone, is going all out for Carr. If you’re risking it all no matter what you decide, wouldn’t you take the most likely path to a home run? Giving up a haul for Carr seems much more likely to work than literally anything else. We have the cap to put solid weapons out there for him. If we have the cap and the rest of the pieces in place then it’s worth the next couple early round picks.

He ran the entire offense from the line, Which is an incredible thing to do, getting 10 other guys on exactly the same page just by yelling random words and phrases out. And without the opposition deciphering, no less. His arm talent was exceptional. His mental ability was off the charts. He studied and retained film like nobody else which is what allowed him to call the plays at the line so well. The defense would give him a look, he’d audible, the defense would audible, and it wouldn’t even matter because his first audible was a counter attack for what he already knew the defense was going to audible to. To make a weak comparison, Peyton manning was an incredible chef. Cooking is an art. He was a true artist on the field. The best there ever was. Baking is a science. Tom Brady is a scientist. He’s mechanically perfect. Literally a machine. Tom Brady is a baker. They’re both incredible at what they do/did just in completely different ways. But manning was just.. more fun to watch.

I realize the deficiencies on defense, but they gave the offense a chance in every game and were rarely the reason we lost ever. Having a competent QB (Wentz is not) would get this team to the playoffs.
  
> If Wentz can fix the decision making and trust his first instinct is the right one
  
He'll be 30 next season. This isn't a first or second-year QB. He is who he is. We ALL said when the trade was made that if there's anyone who can resurrect his career it's Reich. I think Reich got about 95% of what he can out of Wentz. Don't bank on this seemingly simple change to happen. His poor decision-making is engrained in who he is as a player.
  
> Keeping Malik Hooker would have been nice
  
He's not the player he was his rookie year and he's not even starting anywhere now.
  
>  Keeping Denico another year probably would have helped us too
  
One year was never an option for us. He'll be 33 when his contract with the Titans was up. Sucks that we lost him, but I don't think he'll be worth his contract at 33.
  
I accept the reality that Wentz will most likely be our starter next year. But if Rodgers/Wilson is traded to the AFC and Ballard doesn't basically throw the kitchen sink to get them, then this fanbase should be irate.",28.0,colts,t3_soi30r,False,0.0,Daayyyoooooooo,2022-02-09T11:36:13Z,colts,-0.0426167962374825

Honestly our defense isn't the problem of our team and hasn't been since 2017. People are just using it as the scapegoat to Wentz under performing. 

Would love to see more 5 man blitz packages either sending Kenny or Darius to the QB. 

The game and our defense is evolving to the point where we are base 4-3 nickel and have Kenny in the box when there's no slot. Which is okay since our LB room is pretty top heavy with decent but not good depth. 

If we get Darius playing more impact getting pressure on the QB either on the outside of kwity or between defo should be better for us. That way he can get more TFLs and pressures like we all know he can. 

I love our CBs. Maybe take another zone cb in the draft. Not signing Hooker was a mistake. Definitely get another safety opposite of Blackmon. Willis is good depth but has shown he can't start. 

We need to instill a fear within the org that if you don't produce your second year you're getting replaced. Kwity needs to break out next year. He looked promising his rookie year but we've wasted too much time trusting Turay and Lewis would pan out. Odeyingbo needs to be treated as a second year as well.

Regardless of whether you want to hear it, it doesn't matter whether you or anyone else thinks it was a bad joke, in poor taste, too soon, or whatever. It was a joke. A joke is a joke. Some jokes are good, some are bad, some are funny, some aren't. That's all subjective. Chris Rock was hired to tell jokes, because he's a comic. For you or anyone to assume he wouldn't tell jokes at the expense of the guests is just silly, first off. The joke shouldn't even be a topic of discussion. The ONLY thing that should be discussed is how much of a loose canon Will Smith is. That's it.

You alleging it was a shitty thing to do and you don't know anyone who wouldn't agree is complete bullshit. It was a joke. Do you actually think Chris Rock has a personal vendetta against Jada Smith or people who are balding and intentionally made a joke directed at her with malicious intent? No! That's not what comics do ffs. How is this not understood by now?

Regarding Rich Eisen, it's his show so he can talk about what he wants, but jfc, drop the holier than thou bullshit over a *joke*.",0.0,colts,t3_tss5vm,False,0.0,:colts:,2022-03-31T11:34:11Z,colts,-0.030553716795648

And I think it was adlibbed if I had to guess. Like he saw her, and as we all know she's battling, what, alopecia."" Then he's confronted by one of the other guys on the set saying, ""Now we don't all know that."" Then Rich concedes that point and retorts with, ""Bottom line is, ok, it is well known for a bunch of people, and, you know, he takes a shot at her...""

That's the classic ""well I didn't think it was funny and it was a cheapshot"" argument. That's victim blaming in this specific scenario. Chris Rock is a comedian and the victim. Period. Part of his comedy is to rip on people. The GI Jane joke was, as he said, a nice one in the grand scheme of his comedy. It was a joke. Regardless of anyone's personal thoughts on the matter, it was a joke. Jokes are not to be taken seriously. Rich Eisen clearly doesn't understand this and his complete failure to understand the basic tenets of comedy. That mindset is how assholes like Will Smith wind up on stage slapping one of the greatest comics of all time.

So when Rich begins the discussion running through his thoughts on how awful the joke was and how he was taking shots at Jada Smith for her condition, he completely undermined everything else he said about the subject. It doesn't matter if Rich ultimately believes Will Smith's actions are inexcusable or not, despite it being an objective truth, when he inherently believes Chris Rock did anything wrong.

This is the point people don't seem to understand and why so many comedians are irate about what happened and how Will Smith essentially got away with it.

2. He's not going to prison. There will be no criminal prosecution, unless he fails to adhere to the terms of a potential settlement.

Having said all that, people really do need to chill the fuck out on this. Yes, I agree, 22 people coming forward with their story is suspicious. However, as you've alluded to, no one knows what actually happened. There are motivating factors on both sides for someone to falsify statements and to try to protect themselves or seek a pay day. And then there's also the possibility that he may have had encounters with them, and they consented at the time, and now they're trying to take advantage of him and by joining in seeking a pay day. Again, no one knows. These are all possibilities but yet people refuse to think logically and rationally about this and want to jump on the side that fits their narrative. With incidents like the Jussie Smollett trial just recently coming to and end you'd think people would be more cautious but apparently not.

32231,234208,234208,voyagerx420,"The simple fact is quarterback is priority. Doesn't mean it gets done first, but most of the teams' time should be spent on sorting out that situation.

Outside of the top tier quarterbacks that were available/potentially available, such as Rodgers and Wilson, no one is worth the ridiculous asking prices teams may be asking for certain QBs. Additionally, despite most people talking themselves into thinking other QBs who may be now available who really aren't worth anything and would be a Wentz 2.0 experience (cough Mariota, Mayfield, Jimmy G), there's just not much out there.

Ballard said he wants to do what's best for the team in the short and long term. Signing Mariota may fit that bill as he could potentially be signed for cheap and has starting experience, but I think we know his ceiling, which isn't the highest. From what I've heard, he's a great teammate and has proven he's willing to do what's best for the team, so I think he'd be a culture fit. He also intrigues me just from a scheme perspective. He'd be much more dynamic in Reich's offense than any of these other QBs since he has decent wheels. But holy hell is that an uninspiring idea. He'd be cheap enough the Colts could pay their own and bargain shop for free agents. 

Jimmy Garoppolo has the best resume as far as wins and experience, but his injury history and inconsistency is noteworthy. 

Baker Mayfield I think would be a waste of time. There are so many red flags with him, even more so than Wentz, that I just don't see how any Colts fan talked themselves into thinking he's a good idea.

My personal favorite of the quarterbacks who may still be available is Matt Ryan. He'd be the best fit culturally, his experience is great, he's won an MVP and been to a Super Bowl, and he's very intelligent and willing to do the right thing to make the team better. I see him as a slightly younger version of Philip Rivers. If they could get 3-4 years out of Ryan and look to find the next franchise QB in the meantime and/or find him in the first year or two of Ryan's tenure so he can learn from a consummate pro, that'd be ideal.
