3024,18318,18318,Astro63,"###**Steelers Schemes**

**Offensive Scheme** (u/mitchmatch26)

The Steelers’ offensive scheme is a bit up in the air at this point, with the promotion of QB coach Matt Canada. Canada seems to run an offensive style similar to that of a lot of new OC’s making the hotlist. Simple playbook, run the same play out of a million different formations, run route concepts instead of just basing it off the physical talents of your receivers, and PLAY ACTION. That last note is a bit of a [sore subject](https://twitter.com/FO_ASchatz/status/1258832673071673344?s=20) for the Steelers. It’s almost like they have avoided play action for the last five years, but even when they’ve done it they’ve stunk at it so it seems like a catch-22. Most of this is speculation with some context, but let’s look at Canada’s tendencies as an OC and what he has said about his offensive philosophy. 

In the past, Canada has emphasized the idea of route concepts, rather than just route running. Think of when you play madden and see that single high safety and CBs are pressed, you send Julio deep. Coverage beaters. So instead of just saying “hey Diontae you’re great at RAC and separation, let's run a boatload of drags” Canada wants to run an offense that attacks the defense. This is a huge change from the offense of Randy Fichtner as it seems he just ran an offense based on what the Steelers didn’t have that year. No solid RB1 with Lev holding out in 2018? Pass every down. No OL depth or top-tier RB in 2020? Let's run quick passes and drag routes that eliminate the need for an OL or running game since short passes are just an extension of the running game. None of these things are bad in a vacuum, but they get tired and figured out very quickly at the pro level. Canada seems to do the exact opposite, wanting the QB to see where the defense lines up, then run maybe some option routes based around that as a counter. 

The next two big things are a huge implication, in my opinion as they can cater to and help Ben. Leading off with his usage of the pistol formation seems smart as it’s the core of this discussion. Pistol is halfway between full-on shotgun and under-center offensive styles, and it seems like Canada believes pistol and under-center playbooks are largely the same. For any Steelers fans who blame the offensive scheme on Ben’s lack of mobility last season, the pistol may be the saving grace for you. It limits the need for mobility, but according to Canada functions the same as the under-center offense, meaning we can run more from a “shotgun lite” stance, and still get the results that under center would yield. Canada’s offense hasn’t, in the past, relied on boots and other play-action movements out of the pistol, however, so we may be a little more one-dimensional there. 

WIndow dressing seems to be a core theme of many offensive coordinators of this era, and Canada is no different. Jet sweeps, man in motion, unique personnel packages all point to Canada being just like many of the young OCs in the league today. Heck, you can even see some of this seep through in the Steelers [2020 scripted plays](https://steelersdepot.com/2021/05/study-steelers-2020-pre-snap-motion-rates/).

As a personal note, I just want to thank all of the writers at Football Outsiders, Steelers Depot……….and even PFF for their write-ups that helped me on all of this scheme stuff that sometimes goes over my head. I tried to link everything I could find that I’ve read about Canada since he was hired. -- u/mitchmatch26

**Defensive Scheme** (u/Astro63)

With Mike Tomlin and Keith Butler still in town, Pittsburgh remains loyal to their base 3-4 Cover 3 scheme which has proven to be very effective in recent history. However, as has been a trend over the past few seasons, Pittsburgh continues to embrace sub-packages and constantly adds different wrinkles that make it such a modern-day success. The coaches have continued to harp on the importance of situational football and getting the right guys on the field for the right matchups, and their tendencies reflect that. The **2-4-5 defense** remains the most commonly deployed unit and should be a staple of 2021.

Up front, the trio of Cam Heyward, Stephon Tuitt, and Tyson Alualu remains in place and grants them a lot of versatility in alignment. Alualu emerged as an extremely reliable 1T Nose who is always on the field for early downs. While this is his primary role, his capabilities as a pass rusher allow him to rotate in and out with the others even on third downs, and he ultimately played about 40-60% of snaps per game. Cam and Tuitt, who play about 75-90% of snaps per game, can line up and find success anywhere from 1T to 3T to even 5T in certain packages, which presents numerous different looks and blitz opportunities to throw at opponents.

Off the edge, TJ Watt and Bud Dupree were typically rolled up to the LOS where they would switch between a stand-up position and hand-in-the-dirt, and I expect more of the same even with a new starter across from Watt. Pittsburgh plays sides with their OLBs, where Watt lines up across the RT and Highsmith/Ingram will line up across the LT, but the responsibilities are the same on each side. Both players are also responsible for dropping back into coverage on certain plays, but that rate has decreased in recent seasons. DC Keith Butler continues to blitz at a maniacal rate, where the goal is to spot the double-teams and send overloads towards individual matchups. The breadth of individual talent upfront forces teams to avoid over-committing blockers to one player, so blitzes will come from every which way.

Devin Bush returns to his three-down MIKE role and he will be joined by Robert Spillane in the BUCK role. These are typically complimentary positions where Bush has the freedom to be rangier whereas Spillane will play more downhill. Pittsburgh has toyed with the $B role in recent years with players such as Mark Barron and Marcus Allen, and I expect that to continue in some capacity this season depending on matchups.

The secondary could see the largest schematic overhaul with some new players in new roles, but I expect the same [Cover 3 and Cover 1 archetype](https://twitter.com/ryanweisman12/status/1334294905238142982?s=20) to remain. The Front Office has placed an emphasis on scheme-versatile DBs in recent years, which allows them to run both man and zone concepts depending on matchups. Alignment-wise, Pittsburgh has their outside CBs stick to their sides and play primarily off-man coverage while Minkah provides roaming support from his single-high FS spot. SS Terrell Edmunds usually shadows TEs but last season he spent some more time in two-high sets than in years prior, which is a development worth keeping an eye on. The biggest change will be replacing Mike Hilton, who manned the Nickel CB spot, and how that could impact the boundary spots as well. Joe Haden will return to his RCB spot, but it remains to be seen whether Cam Sutton mans the LCB spot or the Nickel. Pittsburgh has been experimenting with a ‘Big Nickel’ role for Antoine Brooks Jr. or Arthur Maulet, but the defense could also return to Sutton in the slot and either James Pierre or Justin Layne taking the LCB spot. Once the personnel is settled, expect Pittsburgh to continue to allow their CBs to play aggressively on the boundaries given the range of security over the top presented by Minkah.",6.0,nfl,t3_ovrn3t,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2021-08-01T07:59:05Z,steelers,0.0123184184399109

**Schedule notes from u/Astro63:**

Typically I feel super optimistic about the Steelers at this point in the year (last year I predicted 13-3), but this year I am feeling much more reserved. Pittsburgh faces what might be the most daunting schedule in the entire league, starting with a brutal week 1 opener against Buffalo who crushed us last season. The end of the season also does us no favors with quite the gauntlet of TEN, @KC, CLE, and @BAL to end the season, all of which were playoff teams last season. The BYE comes at a reasonable time and we also have a mini-bye before the aforementioned gauntlet due to a TNF game vs Minnesota, but the schedule is filled with tough games throughout. With that said, I have the utmost faith in Mike Tomlin to guide us to a winning record, especially with an extremely talented defense at his disposal. Pittsburgh was in much worse shape offensively in 2019 when Big Ben was lost for the season yet somehow ended up at 8-8, so I’ll trust the veteran QB to do just enough to break 0.500 in spite of the tough schedule.

As an aside, it seems that r/Steelers is most optimistic that we’ll beat Detroit (3.83), Cincinnati at Home (3.67), and Chicago on MNF (3.53). On the other hand, r/Steelers is most pessimistic regarding Kansas City (1.39), Buffalo (1.90), Green Bay (2.22), and Baltimore Away (2.22).

**Schedule notes from u/mitchmatch26:**

To be completely honest, most years when I look at the schedule I see about 10-11 wins. As long as Ben, the defense, and the staff are the same there isn’t a world where at least 10 wins seems implausible. Obviously, every team wins a game or two they shouldn’t, and loses a game or two they shouldn’t, but such is life in the National Football League. Like Astro said above, the Steelers have the toughest preseason SOS, which to me means absolutely nothing. Couldn’t care less. Sure we play the Ravens and Browns twice. SURE, we play Green Bay and Kansas City in their stadiums. SUUUUREEEE, the Steelers are historically bad going to the west coast. AND SURRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEE we lose to the occasional backup QB we shouldn’t^^ryan finley.. But the Seahawks...in Pittsburgh? In PrimeTime? We got this. 

In all seriousness, the last 6 weeks of the schedule are brutal, no matter how you slice it. Going to Minny, KC, and Baltimore is a slog but I think if they can steal one of those three games it will be okay, two would be great. My thinking is that the Ravens will likely be resting starters in Week 18, which *should* give us a win, but if they aren’t then it’s a toss-up between that game and Minny as to which one we are going to steal.",17.0,nfl,t3_ovrn3t,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2021-08-01T07:58:54Z,steelers,-0.0181207201048552

Najee Harris is the bonafide starter since the day he got drafted. He has been getting lots of comparisons to Le’Veon Bell from Steelers fans, and I hope they’re accurate. As far as the backups go, we have yet to see much from McFarland. He seems like a good one-cut type back who can catch and is a good scheme fit for Matt Canada’s new offense. Snell ya later is a good bruiser type who can fill in for Najee in some more short-yardage situations if need be, as he is a hard runner. This is a good RB room, I just sometimes wonder if what it cost to get is worth it. 

**FB:** *Derek Watt*

Hopefully this year we actually see Derek play some football. Underutilized and infrequently active last season, many of us thought we signed him just to sweeten the pot for TJ's extension. New OC Matt Canada has shown to get very creative with his fullback usage in the college ranks, so that could mean big things to come for Derek.

**WR:** *JuJu Smith Schuster*, *Diontae Johnson*, *Chase Claypool*, James Washington, Ray-Ray McCloud

Much like last year, JuJu is the veteran of this extremely young WR room. He just re-signed for one year to stick around and hopefully earn himself a good long-term deal. Regarding the rest of the group, I think the thing to work on is just continuing development. Fix drops, refine that route tree a little more, slip an extra few tackles. The basics. Oh and this section was brought to you by TikTok, dance your asses off kids. 

**TE:** *Eric Ebron*, Pat Friermuth (R), Zack Gentry

What is there to say about Eric Ebron that hasn’t been said by fans of disappointing teams that wear blue? Brick hands, redzone threat, brick hands, mediocre blocking, brick hands. Hopefully Friermuth can develop well and end up being yet another white TE that yinzers can erratically compare to Heath Miller even if the two play nothing alike. 

(Sorry Colts fans I know you aren’t the Lions, I just thought the joke was funny.)

**OT:** *Chuks Okorafor*, *Zach Banner*, Joe Haeg, Dan Moore Jr. (R)

OL is absolutely the biggest question this year for most Steelers fans. No DeCastro, Villanueva, or Pouncey this year for the first time since 2014. Zach Banner and Chuks have been on the team for a few years, so they are familiar faces. ZB is coming back from his week one ACL injury in (trigger warning for Niners fans) >!MetLife Stadium!<. Chuks was mediocre at best last year in his starting role at RT, but hopefully the move to LT (which typically has less emphasis placed in the run game) will help him.

**IOL:** *[KEVIN DOTSON](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/264537103184953344/866708844340445194/E6qadxrVoAE_Hgq.png)*, *Kendrick Green (R)*, *Trai Turner*, BJ Finney, Rashaad Coward, JC Hassenauer

Honestly, I’m not so worried about the interior of the line as much as I am about the tackles. Kevin Dotson is literally a greek god sent from the heavens so he holds down 2 positions worth of play. Kendrick Green has had nothing but glowing reports since he stepped foot in the building, and Chargers fans were mad at Trai Turner for his availability when their team is the one who punctured their own player's lungs “on accident”. Hopefully he is more like Carolina Trai when he’s with an organization that isn’t running the preliminary experiments from Get Out on their players. Plus we got BJ Finney back which is great because he can fill in for all three interior positions as needed. 

**DL:** *Cameron Heyward*, *Tyson Alualu*, *Stephon Tuitt*, Isaiah Buggs, Chris Wormley, Carlos Davis

Nothing to say here. Cam is goated. Tuitt is nasty and apparently the team's best barbecuer. Tyson “literally Deandre Jordan” Alualu is back, sorry Jags fans. A great plug in the middle when needed, the DL is just as solid as can be. The only thing to ask is that when the three big guys need a rest, the backups do their parts. 

**OLB:** *TJ Watt*, *Alex Highsmith*, Melvin Ingram, Quincy Roche ®

Kind of the same as the DL, the OLB room is solid, especially after the Ingram signing. Let TJ be the Herculean god that he is, Highsmith can take some “easy” reps with TJ getting put in a chokehold on every play, and Ingram spells whoever needs it that play? Sounds great to me. 

**ILB:** *Devin Bush*, *Robert Spillane*, Marcus Allen, Buddy Johnson (R), Ulysses GIlbert III

I, for one, am extremely saddened by Vince Williams’ retirement. However, Bush and Spillane will make a great duo with similar complementary skill sets as DB and Bince had. The rest of the guys have a chance to develop, learn, and hopefully can carve themselves out a role in a sub-package. 

**CB:** *Joe Haden*, *Cameron Sutton*, James Pierre, Justin Layne

With the loss of Steven Nelson on the outside, our CB2 position is open for battle. It seems like the primary competition is between Sutton and Pierre with Layne on the outside. Honestly, Sutton is a really good coverage corner and should do well in this larger role. Pierre is exciting as he has shot up the depth chart after signing as a rookie UDFA last summer. 

**NICK:** *Antoine Brooks Jr.*, Arthur Maulet

Brooks Jr. is a swiss army knife of sorts and actually was drafted as a safety last season. With Mike Hilton thinking orange and black is more appealing than gold and black this summer, hopefully Antoine Brooks Jr. can show us just how versatile he is. Maulet is competing at camp as we speak, so he will likely just be getting a special teams and emergency use role. If neither claims the role, I wouldn’t be surprised if Sutton ends up back here. 

**SAF:** *MInkah Fitzpatrick*, *Terrell Edmunds*, Tre Norwood (R), Miles Killebrew

I don’t really know how to address the safety position this year. On one hand, Minkah shuts down his third of the field and is probably the best free safety in football, inarguably top 3. On the other hand, we didn’t pick up Terrell Edmunds' 5th year option this year. But then Teryl Austin has sung Edmunds’ praises during camp so far about his career progression. It’s confusing, but I trust they have a plan and a valid reason for what they’re doing. 

**ST:** *K Chris Boswell*, *P: Pressley Harvin III (R)*, *LS: Kameron Canaday*

Thankfully, Chris Boswell’s woes seem to truly be a blip on the radar. He’s been one of the most accurate and consistent kickers in the league ever since we grabbed him. Glad he’s back. The real news regarding specialists is in our new THICC BOI. Pressley Harvin III could press me hard any day with those thighs. Steelers fans are very happy with this pick and to get rid of Jordan Berry, even though Berry looked much improved in 2020 compared to 2019.",16.0,nfl,t3_ovrn3t,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2021-08-01T07:58:12Z,steelers,0.0122218718617433
3028,18322,18322,Astro63,"###**Training Camp Battles** (u/mitchmatch26)

*“Two dogs, one bone.” - Mike Tomlin*

**Backup QB:** *Mason Rudolph vs. Dwayne Haskins vs. Joshua Dobbs*

Starting off camp battles with the most important position in sports seems right. With Ben being the bonafide QB1, this is really about which two will make the 53 with the other getting stuck on the practice squad. It seems obvious that Mason is the QB2 up to this point, but if Haskins shows out in camp who knows? To me, this battle is about seeing what Haskins can do in a more controlled environment where he isn’t *the guy* with all that pressure and focus on him. 

I only recently found out that PS players were even allowed on the sidelines during gameday. So with that being said, my bet is on Haskins getting the QB3 job and Dobbs being named to the PS which allows him to still be on the sidelines with Ben on gameday, something that Ben has [expressed appreciation](https://steelersdepot.com/2020/10/roethlisberger-credits-dobbs-for-suggesting-washingtons-double-move-td/) for in the past.

**Backup RB:** *Benny Snell vs. Kalen Ballage vs. Jaylen Samuels*

RB2 is up for grabs this year in Pittsburgh. With the first-round addition of Najee Harris, it’s clear who will be taking the majority of snaps at RB, however, that does not preclude us from finding out who will spell Najee. Not listed above is Anthony McFarland, who I believe is actually going to fill in as more of a pass-catching back, so his snaps may not affect the others. The real competition is likely between Benny Snell Football and Kalen Ballage, with JaySam on the outside looking in. Snell is a hard runner who knows the system and is likely a known quantity by now, same for Ballage. The issue with JaySam is he’s a versatile, jack-of-all-trades type. He runs a little too stiff, isn’t super fast, doesn’t have good enough hands to be a receiving threat. 

**Center & Right Guard:** *Trai Turner vs. BJ Finney vs. Kendrick Green vs. JC Hassenauer*

It’s weird, being a Steelers fan and writing about uncertainty on the offensive line. The 2010s were about as consistent for us on the OL as our mid-round WR drafting. Replacing Pouncey, DeCastro, Feiler, and AV looks like a tall order. I want to split this battle up to Turner vs Finney and Green vs Hassenauer. 

The center battle between Green vs Hassenauer likely is Green’s to lose as Hassenauer has not really impressed in his limited snaps. Overall, it seems like the team is excited about Green and he fits this nasty attitude that new OL coach Adrian Klemm is going for. 

Trai Turner vs Finney is a little more interesting, as Finney has already been a Steeler before, but not with Klemm as his coach. Finney shuffled around all three interior spots in his first stint with the Steelers, and honestly I see that for him again here. Trai Turner likely takes the RG spot, with Finney backing up both guards and Hassenauer potentially taking the extra OL spot on gameday.

**Outside Linebacker:** *Alex Highsmith vs. Melvin Ingram* 

The late summer addition of Melvin Ingram is an extremely welcomed one. After Bud went down last season, Alex Highsmith filled in extremely admirably for a rookie and showed a lot of promise. If he or TJ needed a play off, however….. the tone shifted. Cassius Marsh took way too many snaps and I’m sure lots of fan bases can attest to just how not good he is. Signing Melvin Ingram *hopefully* eliminates the need to use a guy like Marsh again, especially down the stretch. Camp will be interesting to see if one of these two guys solidifies the starting spot, or if we see more of a rotational approach to the OLB spot. Obviously, TJ will be taking snaps whenever he deems necessary, but for the non-deity players on the team they have to carve out their roles. 

**Slot & Outside Corner:** *Cam Sutton vs. James Pierre vs. Tre Norwood vs. Antoine Brooks Jr. vs. Arthur Maulet vs. Shakur Brown*

With the losses of Steven Nelson and Mike Hilton, two of the previous top three CB spots are open for the taking. The DB room is deep with young talent but no one truly knows who will emerge above the rest to claim the starting roles, nor do we know just how good they’ll be. From the early indications coming out of training camp, it seems the coaches are testing two approaches.

The first approach is keeping Cam Sutton on the boundary and then trying a ‘Big Nickel’ role which is being contested between Antoine Brooks and Arthur Maulet. Brooks was a tried-and-true safety prospect in last year’s draft but it seems like the coaches think he’ll be a surprise fit in the nickel. Arthur Maulet is more of a true slot player but he spent many snaps in a high safety role as well for the Jets.

If either of those players fails to capture the starting role, I expect the other approach to come to fruition in which Cam Sutton remains in the slot and either James Pierre or Justin Layne starts outside. James Pierre has been gaining a lot of hype after slowly (and surprisingly) making his way into the lineup late last season, and the hype has continued directly from the coaches. Justin Layne, a former third-round pick, basically got jumped by Pierre last year but has all the tools to be an outside corner if he can put it together.

Beyond those four players, Tre Norwood is described as a swiss-army knife of sorts who is starting out at safety but could eventually make his way into the nickel. Also, keep an eye out for UDFA Shakur Brown who played a lot in a true slot corner role while at MSU and was a surprise undrafted player due to a tough pro day. Undrafted DBs making their way into larger roles is far from unheard of in Pittsburgh, and Brown seems most likely to continue the trend.

**Punter:** *Pressley Harvin III vs. Jordan Berry*

Pressley Harvin III, for the uninitiated, is one [THICC BOI](https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Harvin-1000x600.jpg). We are glad to have him and I believe using a draft pick on a specialist likely indicates what the outcome of this battle will be. Pressley has a mortar of a leg and can flip the field at ease; a capability Pittsburgh has lacked for a while. Jordan Berry was much improved in a lot of areas last year, however, so I don’t believe that this camp battle is totally sealed.",29.0,nfl,t3_ovrn3t,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2021-08-01T07:58:01Z,steelers,0.0030228148997564

This summer, the Steelers will be headlining the Hall of Fame game alongside the Dallas Cowboys in Canton. Both teams have the most appearances in the game, tied at six appearances each. The Hall of Fame game kicks off Hall of Fame weekend, and this year the Steelers will have FIVE members of their organization formally enshrined. Is this number skewed because it’s two separate classes combined? Maybe. Did I combine them because it sounds cooler? Maybe. Maybe not. 2020’s class of Troy Polamalu, Bill Cowher, and Donnie Shell will be joined by 2021’s class of Alan Faneca, and Bill Nunn. It seems like Alan Faneca should’ve been in a long time ago, as it took until his fifth year of eligibility despite his 8 All-Pro team selections. Either way, I’m super happy for the man as he’s deserved it for a long time. 

Bill Nunn, for those of you who are not aware of who he is, was a member of the Steelers front office (mostly as a scout) since **1967**. He was still working for the organization in a part-time role up to 2014 when he passed at the age of 89. During his time with the team, he was involved in the drafting and acquisition of **THIRTEEN** hall of fame players. Bill will be the first black contributor inducted into the Hall of Fame this year, an achievement long overdue.

On a less happy note, the Steelers training camp will not be held in Latrobe this year, with it instead being held at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh. It is still open to the public, but from what I have heard, Latrobe is an experience all on its own. This will be the 2nd year in a row of not being at Latrobe, a tradition the team has had since 1967.

4545,32964,32964,CCPalmeri5,"The Steelers played horrible the first 3 quarters, horrible being an understatement.  It was really a miracle that they had a chance to win the game to begin with. 

Putting the complete blame on Claypool is unreasonable.  In fact, he made plenty of great plays throughout the game, particularly in the 4th quarter where he caught the deep ball down the sideline and the the fourth down ball before his celebration.  Not to mention he caught 8 of his 9 targets.  You could actually make an argument he was our best receiver that game.

That said, Claypool needs to mature a bit.  The mishaps he had in this game like the taunting call have been a reoccurring theme throughout the season, but haven’t really been brought to light because they weren’t all that significant.  In fact, I’m fairly certain he leads his position in unsportsmanlike conduct penalties.  Mental errors like he had in this game against the Vikings are unacceptable.  I’m all for if he wants to talk trash, in fact I love it when he talks to trash opposing team’s crowd, it gets me hyped.  However, when it costs the team like it did in this game, it’s just unacceptable and he needs to realize that.  A shame really because he made so many jaw dropping plays near the end of that game that no one will talk about because he had a mental lapse.

All in all, Claypool is an unbelievable talent.  He has all the physical tools to be one of the best receivers in the league, but he needs to be smarter and more mature.

5050,34544,34544,CaptainFatFuck7,"I volunteer as Tribute!!

1. I agree that Tomlin is a great coach and gets too much blame. The only problem I have with Tomlin is how flat we are in the playoffs and games against inferior opponents.

2. I think Ben coming back was a bad move. If we lose Juju, Alualu, Bud, Vince, and Hilton then what was the point of restructuring Bens contract for more cap space? I’m one of the fans ready for a rebuild and rock with Rudolph with this upcoming season and see what we have in him.

3. I think there is absolutely no shot we are 2021 contenders and I think any Steeler fan that thinks we have a chance is just setting themselves up for disappointment and heartbreak. We haven’t made the SB and have been underperforming in the the playoffs the last 10 years. What makes this season different? With Hilton, Bud, and Alualu gone, our defense has gotten worse. And Ben is not going to magically go back to his prime years and is probably going to regress even more this year which is common for a QB that is 39 years old. Our offensive line is terrible and imagine Ben’s corpse take crushing hits like he did early in his career.

4. I’m fine with Offensive line and a RB(Javonte Williams) but lately I’ve been starting to lean towards taking Zaven Collins. With Bince gone we have no real starter next to Bush(Spillane is solid depth, not a solid starter). We also have zero depth at that position.

Sure the Oline was bad but what were you expecting?? You think its so easy to play Oline than do it yourself and stop complaining. DJ said it perfectly a couple of weeks ago

>I be gettin’ tired of people talkin’ about the line. If it’s so easy — from a person speaking that’s not on the team that’s a regular fan — why don’t you come out here and do it for us? Show me, you feel me, that you can do it better than me. They're doing the best they can

Chase:

>Chase Claypool is a bum

give him a break. he's a second rounder in his second year. Sure he had some questionable moments. He's 23 and still learning

Johnson has massively improved this year especially with his drops. 

>but at times he just stops \[...\] his routes

Don't tell me you wouldn't do the same when you know the ball isn't coming to your side. He's not the only one who does that.  


When you don't have the cap space how would you suggest improving the Dline in the running game??  


Tuitt was out this year mostly of a personal issue. Often I do think people in this sub think football players aren't people but robots. Hating Harvin for his punts while his dad was dying

For gods sake stop the Devin Bush hate. He was coming off a major injury. Something like that takes time. So basically it was his second season and like I said earlier those guys are still learning

Because of the protests and the police brutality on African-Americans, for week one literally the whole team did a vote (including Al) that they would all put a name of an African-American that got brutally murdered by the police. Al decided to cross the name out and put the name of an army veteran on his helmet. 

He could’ve done that anytime but he decided to do it when all this stuff was happening in America? I just found it super selfish and almost like he wanted that attention by the media knowing it would make headlines. Again, Mike Tomlin had to take the fall and lie and say that he knew that Al was doing that even though the truth is that he didn’t know.

They just extended pushed back thier SB window by a year or so but added a couple years to it imo. If Chiefs Nation can be a bit more humble the 2nd time around they will be a really easy franchise to root for for years.

Hopefully for the Chiefs, the Orlando Brown Jr situation is handled soon. Im not sure what to think about it but it's definitely not looking great.

RB can be viewed as a luxury pick in todays NFL as a 1st round pick because of the shortened career of the position group on average.... BUT running backs drafted in the 1st round have the highest boom/bust rate of any position not including punter or kicker, meaning its a more surefire pro-bowl talent than any other position drafted in the 1st round

Just because we cant expect Najee to be an elite talent or even earn a 2nd contract that isnt a franchise tag beyond his roomie deal because he was 24 on draft day at a position that has a shorter shelf life, doesnt mean he doesn't help as a long term piece to a young OL and a young QB who need to have the pressure taken off of them to allow the offense to operate and give the WRs a bit of freedom while the defense is stacking the box against the run.

Player development should never stop even in a down season. Abandoning the run would have crippled the development of the team as a whole, even on the defensive side seeing as they had enough trouble staying off the field as it was with a pro-bowl rookie RB taking 350 touches on the season.

Spread out the defense and limit the amount of carries between the tackles for McCaffrey seeing as he spent most of last season injured. They should want him as fresh as possible for when Pickett takes the field.

They would have to dial back the designed runs for a young franchise player like Pickett and tell him to play a bit more conservative but he also is a strong runner and young mobile QBs can use that ability to develop as a passer.

I think he could be a steady starter for them for a long time in that division with domed stadiums and nice weather.

The injury part is interesting. We drafted Senquez Golson in the second round and he never even played in a preseason game because he had season-ending injuries every year before the preseason. Would you consider him a bust? I personally don't. It's hard to predict injuries in the NFL so I think it can just be chalked up to unfortunate luck. 

We drafted Terrell Edmunds a couple of years ago in the first. No one thought he was going first round (he actually was in the bathroom when he heard he was drafted). He was at the draft only because his brother was expected to go high. Is he a bust? He's an ok starter that is lacking in some things. It's hard for me to put the bust label on him.

Mistakes were so limited on both sides of the ball, looks good in depth.

Rookies were looking pretty good, specifically impressive playing from Buddy Johnson and PH3.

Dobbs and Haskins showed that they wanted the QB2 position, Rudolph not so much.

RB looks great, Samuels hasn't shown anything impressive, but Ballage and Mcfarland has shown to be good plausible back ups, didn't see enough of Najee but he looked good from his few couple snaps.

Pressly Harvin III deserves more recognition from ""forcing"" a muffed punt, forcing 3 punts inside the 20 including a beautiful punt that drops at the 1 yard line.

Offense looks different, definitely more short plays but a lot more creativity. Not sure if it'll work with Ben (lol) but shows some of Canada's creativity.

Claypool shows that he's good, that's good

13654,84537,84537,GateIsnATE,"I did a few PFF mock drafts and I am going to try out 3 scenarios

* Steelers trading back in the first round
* Steelers trading out of the first round
* Steelers keeping pick 24 which presumably seems to be to pick Harris

To make this easier, I'm going to keep it 5 rounds

Which scenario would you like best and what picks do you not like? 

Let me know, this is just what I would do in the scenarios.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First - Steelers trading back in the first round

TRADE: 

* Chiefs: pick 31 and pick 63
* Steelers: Pick 24 and 2023 4th round (could swap with 2022 third)

ROUND 1, PICK 31 - Teven Jenkins/Samuel Cosmi OT 

I put Samuel Cosmi as the slash because it became apparent that Chiefs fans are hoping that if the Chiefs were to trade up, they would take Teven Jenkins which makes sense. (pff had chiefs taking cosmi) 

ROUND 2, PICK 55 - Javonte Williams RB

Fills the need at a higher skill player in the RB position, this is my dream first 2 picks personally. I like his elusiveness and he shows he can be a receiving threat.

ROUND 2, PICK 61 - Quinn Meinerz C

Not really a lot to explain here, really need a Center and he is the best available

ROUND 3, PICK 87 - Jamin Davis LB/ Kelvin Joseph CB/ Kendrick Green G

These were 3 players that ended up being available at the spot and I think the Steelers need to use this pick at defense with David and Joseph available. In the order from left to right whoever is available in reality, the Steelers should select.

ROUND 4, PICK 128 - Tommy Tremble TE

HUGE need for us that I think people don't look at, our only real options are Ebron, who isn't the most reliable, and Gentry who is a better blocker. Tremble being available here would be amazing, but in reality, if he were to be available in the late 3rd/early 4th, the Steelers should trade up to get him.

ROUND 4, PICK 140 - Aaron Banks G

Since the Kendrick Green scenario is saying that he'll be the third option and assuming he's not selected there, Aaron Banks could help our line depth and be a good option behind Dotson (hopefully Steelers try him out) and Decastro.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Second - Steelers trading out of the first round

TRADE:

FALCONS: PICK 35, PICK 68, AND 2022 3RD ROUND

STEELERS: PICK 24 AND 2022 FOURTH ROUND

For anyone wondering, falcons take  **Gregory Rousseau** with the 24th pick

ROUND 2, PICK 35 - Walker Little T

I think it's important to always use our first pick on a lineman, best available to really help our OL.

ROUND 2, PICK 55 - Landon Dickerson C

Williams was available but Landon Dickerson at this spot would be a better option to give our OL the best potential coming in next season.

ROUND 3, PICK 68 - Jabril Cox LB

He could be a good rotation between Bush and Vince, he has good starter potential and helps our defense look a little better in depth.

ROUND 3, PICK 87 - Michael Carter RB

Carter has shown to be a threat in the passing game and has decent speed, Steelers could go back and forth between him and Snell in the first couple of games, whoever shows to be better can take snaps more often as the season continues.

ROUND 4, PICK 128 - Tommy Tremble TE

If Tommy is there again, you can't pass up on him. Helps our depth in TE.

ROUND 4, PICK 140 - Kendrick Green/ Brady Christensen OT

If they are both there, Green would be the play to help the depth in the Guard position but I doubt he'll be there Christensen would be a good piece to help our Tackle position and possibly fight for the spot between him and Banner

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Third - Steelers stay in their spot and take Harris

&#x200B;

ROUND 1, PICK 24 - Najee Harris RB

Steelers seem to be high on him, but I'm optimistic. I like him but I am not sure if he's worth the first round pick with how many holes we have.

ROUND 2, PICK 55 - Landon Dickerson/Quinn Meinerz C

Center is a bad spot in the Steelers and Landon/Quinn could help fill the underwhelming hole.

ROUND 3, PICK 87 - Jamin Davis LB/ Kelvin Joseph CB/ Kendrick Green G

Exact same scenario as if the Steelers were to trade back in the first round

ROUND 4, PICK 128 - Tommy Tremble TE

Again if Tommy is available, it's a must take for me.

ROUND 4, PICK 140 - Tay Gowan CB

Assuming we get Jamin Davis, our CB depth isn't the strongest and Gowan could help the position be better in terms of depth and maybe fight for the third CB spot with Pierre",12.0,steelers,t3_mw5drc,False,0.0,:sc:90:sc: TJ Watt,2021-04-22T10:21:32Z,steelers,0.0065787471838791

13656,84539,84539,GateIsnATE,"USC and ND are schools that always seem to produce some ""great"" quality receiving players that appear usually later (2nd/3rd round) in the draft. 

Examples:

ND WR Chase Claypool (2020, 49th overall)

ND TE Cole Kmet (2020, 43rd overall)

USC WR Michael Pittman Jr. (2020, 34th overall)

ND WR Miles Boykin (2019, 93rd overall) \*if you told me I get Miles Boykin or Marquise Brown from the Ravens, I would take Boykin\*

ND WR Equanimeous St. Brown (2018, 207th overall) \*pretty good return for a receiver taken in the late 6th

ND TE Durham Smythe (2018, 123rd overall) \*good 2/3 TE option for the Dolphins

USC RB Ronald Jones (2018, 38th overall) \*this is maybe the worst pick in terms of value from either of these schools and I can't really label this as a ""bust""

USC WR JUJU Smith-Schuster (2017, 62nd overall) \*I don't have to explain this one

No WR,TE,RB drafted from ND from this year

&#x200B;

So basically what I'm saying is all of these picks seem to have worked out really well and none of them has shown to be ""busts""

Here are some receiving options coming in for this draft

 **Amon-Ra St. Brown** WR from USC that is projected to go Late 3rd/Early 4th

 **Tommy Tremble** TE from ND that is projected to go maybe anywhere from the late 2nd to maybe the fourth round

&#x200B;

16681,101282,101282,ItsYourBoyD,"Not really, DK isn’t dynamic as a route runner and typically wins with sheer athleticism.

Career stats:

Rushing:
DJ: 12 Attempts for 109 yards 
DK: 3 attempts for 17 yards

Receiving:
DJ: 254 receptions for 2764 yards and 20 TDs
DK: 216 receptions for 3170 yards and 29 TDs

Both have 1 pro bowl. DJ also contributed as a KR/PR for 2 years while DK has a total of maybe 20 ST snaps in his career.

If you look at the numbers, Metcalf is the better player. Both had a season with their QBs being injured (DJ’s played more games with a backup/third string QB though) but it’s most definitely not a stretch to compare these two. Also DK really only has Lockett to compete for in terms of touches, and maybe Carson. We’ve had Juju, Claypool, as well as both Najee and Muth last season being contributors in the passing game, something Carson really wasn’t in Seattle, and Dissly only was for a stretch of games.

16682,101283,101283,ItsYourBoyD,"The main argument I hear from those type of people is that the team should have “at least won one more championship, if not two”

If you REALLY sit back and think about the roster construction of this team:

2008 Super Bowl

2010 you go back to the Super Bowl and lose which sucks but at the end of the day is forgivable. We were the best team in the conference.

Then from 2010 till ~2016 this team had just a fucking awful defence. Ross Cockrell. Antwon Blake. Jarvis Jones. Sharknado/Sean Davis. Anthony Chickillo. Most of those guys left the team and went on to be backups/ST contributors, or out of the league as a whole meanwhile they were our starters. This same time the offense was being very well constructed to the point where we were just amazing, but the team just wasn’t complete.

Finally we get a complete team and go 13-3 just to lose arguably our biggest defensive piece in Shazier and the defense just completely fell apart. Can’t blame the coach for a career ending injury. Give up 7 scores to a Bortles led Jags team. It’s like if the Rams this season lost Donald in like week 12. I doubt they go to the Super Bowl or win without him.

Only other year I feel that we really fielded a roster competitive enough for Super Bowl aspirations was 2019, but Ben goes down with a season ender and we still managed to go .500 with a CFL QB. 

Tomlin might not win as many championships as some may like (this is due to NE clouding peoples judgment on what success looks like) but he most definitely gets the most out of what’s put out on the field, and THATS what you have to take away from a record like he has with no losing seasons. That’s just insanely difficult to achieve.

16685,101289,101289,ItsYourBoyD,"I’m torn with Davis so to be honest with you, I don’t really know.

He’s a physical freak. He’s a mountain of a man with tremendous speed for his size. He’s great against the run, eats blocks, can play 0, 1, 2 and possibly even 3 tech as he also possesses a decent pass rush ability that he can work on culminating with his size and athleticism. From what I’ve seen though, he’s definitely not a 3 down type player and would most likely spend a majority of his time 0/1 tech. You have Adams who signed and Alualu, so it’s something you’re good with this season, and can look to FA or next years draft for a pure block eating run stuffer.

I think regardless, if a QB you want is there, you take him, no questions asked. It’s far and away the most important. I’d probably look at something like: QB>any big drops (Sauce Gardner, Kyle Hamilton, Hutchinson, Evan Neal, guys who 99% won’t be there, but if they fell would be too good to pass up) >Davis>WR>CB>OL

16686,101291,101291,ItsYourBoyD,"I think it’s a great time to draft a QB. The defense looks very good.  A front 3 of Tuitt - Alualu - Heyward, in front of Watt - Jack - Bush - Highsmith, with decent depth in the secondary which can still be addressed if needed in the 2nd or 3rd round. Drafting defense would be taking a strength and making it stronger. When this group is healthy, it’s one of the best in all of football.

Offensively, it seems like Dan Moore can be a long term answer at LT, they resigned Chuks at RT and heavily addressed IOL in FA. You essentially improved on what we had last year and have solidified the day 1 starters. It can get better but it’s not as pressing of a need. It’s not an area you’d rule out completely, but I doubt they go Oline in the first. 

RB isn’t a round 1 type need. Neither is TE. WR could be - although again, that’s something that you can find in the second or later and I’m confident in our ability to develop the position. Another position you can’t really rule out. I think looking at this team, the pick has to be on offense, because that’s where you need the injection of talent. Our offense was putrid. 

I think the question is: are any of the QBs available THEIR guy. Do you basically see Corral, Willis or Pickett as the future of the franchise? The QB is the most important position on the field. If the answer is yes, you take them. You also give them the opportunity to win the starting job and if Mitch wins it, they get a clipboard year and Mitch can back them up next season. 

If the answer is no, I still think you take a QB, but a day 3 flyer to add depth and competition to the room where you might also be pleasantly surprised (a la Brady). Next season (2023-2024) the only guy we’ll have under contract would be Mitch so you’ll need bodies and I’d rather have a day 3 rookie type contract than a Mason Rudolph who will command more. It’s getting to crunch time in paying guys out, after this season: Tuitt, Bush, Sutton, Boswell, Minkah, D. Watt, Diontae and Alualu are all due (these are the main names - there are others) so you need to think of replacements and paydays to keep the bones of the team in tact as well. Rookie contracts help.

We’re not in a GB situation where you have rodgers and are in win now mode and should spend a first to do that. We can field a competitive roster this season that also gets a long term answer to stay competitive.

TLDR: The bones of this team are in place. Defense would just be making a strength stronger - which isn’t bad. I think the pick needs to be on offense, and with the investment in FA on Oline, the Najee pick and the ‘muth at TE, that basically leaves you with IOL (less likely), WR and QB. If they believe one of them is their guy, you do anything to get him. If not, I’d still take a day 3 flyer on a guy like Zappe if he’s there who could give competition and be around for another 3 years and cheap.",20.0,steelers,t3_tnif9u,False,0.0,:SOTN1::SOTN2::SOTN3::SOTN4: Shut Out The Noise,2022-03-25T05:31:44Z,steelers,0.0116436779173509

Rodgers - the same thing. It seems to be the general consensus on the sub that while it would’ve been great to see either of them in a steeler uniform, we didn’t want to give up that much to get them.

That being said, I don’t really want to see Mason as the starter…  

This is a guy who was literally benched when he was thrusted into the starting job for a fringe CFL guy who runs a podcast now… we’ve seen his body of work. He won’t magically transform into a bro bowl calibre QB when he isn’t even starting calibre. While yes, he dealt with injuries when he was the starter, look at the 49ers game where he was benched due to performance reasons, then look at the Lions game this year. Not just the stat line - the tape. He’s awful. We had the 31st ranked passing offense when he was the starter in 2019, and that was behind a respectable offensive line. Also, the guy we have behind him in Haskins is probably worse. 

We know they’re adding to the room, but unless they get an actual starter like Jameis or go draft a guy, adding someone like Trubisky to this room isn’t going to make it that much better. We can’t go signing back up QBs to be the starter and expect them to play better than a future hall of famer. Ben was criminally underrated last year. Lost a bunch of weapons, played behind turnstiles with 0 mobility and no arm strength yet he still led the league in comeback drives.

In the AFC right now, who can we honestly say Mason is better than? Davis Mills… that might honestly be it. If the Watson saga ends and he suits up for the Texans, we have the worst QB in the conference. Our offense last year was abysmal. On top of that, we are probably going to lose our RG, WR1, WR4, WR5, RB2 and TE2… we also might lose our RT, and we haven’t even gotten to the defensive side of the ball. This offense is only going to get worse before it gets any better, which is saying something when they were historically bad last year. 

My issue is, this defense is too good to actually “tank” (which we won’t do regardless and shouldn’t) so we probably won’t draft in the top 10… meaning why not draft a guy this year at 20? We lost out on the North by 1 game to the AFC representative in the superbowl.

18297,114172,114172,Kenthor,"Might as well make my starting line-up predictions while I am at it. 

Offense  
QB – Rudolph and Haskins (and possibly some cheap vet FA) fight it out for the starting job.  Dobbs surprises everyone and wins back-up regardless of starter to be used in short-yard/wildcat shenanigans.  
LT – Moore   
LG – Dotson wins starting role, LeGlue backup  
C – Linderbaum Day 1 starter.  Hassenauer proved last year he is a good back-up  
RG – Green moves to his natural position, 4th round Hayes as backup  
RT- Banner is cut and becomes a full-time comedian.  Okorafor and Van Demark (5th round) battle out for the starting job.  Unfortunately Okorafor is still our RT.   
WR – If Rudolph wins starting role, Washington once again becomes one of his favourite targets.   Diontae goes full AB and has to be traded mid-season because of the distraction.  Claypool learns how to run under a ball without jumping and Ju Ju resigned in the slot.   
TE – Freiermuth TE#1, Gentry used a lot in 2TE sets.  Even a splash of 3TE with Rader.   
FB – Watt, likely underutilized like last year  
RB – Harris still feature back.  Snell and McFarland back-ups.  Ballage cut realizing signing him was a mistake.  


Defense:  
DE – Heyward with Loudermilk backing up  
NT – Travis Jones Day 1 starter, Otito Ogbonnia wins back-up spot.  Mondeaux launched into outer-space never to be seen again.   
DE – Wormley returns as a starter, Taco backing up.  Unfortunately Tuitt retires.  
Edge – TJ and Highsmith, Tuska back-up  
ILB – Bush has a bounce back year as everyone realizes that not being able to play 3/4 with a proper NT was the problem all along.  Asamoah wins other starting role with Spillane backing up.  Schobert is cut.   
CB1 – J.C. Jackson signs (one can dream) which uses up the bulk of our free cap  
CB2 – Witherspoon comes back  
Nickle – Norwood has proven he is a great nickleback and on 3rd downs  
Dime – No one burns James Pierre 10 times in a game and gets away with it",1.0,steelers,t3_t246zv,False,0.0,:PIT1::PIT2: Pittsburgh Steelers,2022-02-26T17:22:05Z,steelers,0.0344009454615886

Mike Ditka instead of Tony Gonzalez.  That would give you two physical freaks at the TE position that not only could catch and run blowing the top off your secondary, but they could drop their shoulder and absolutely punish someone trying to tackle them.

So what defense are you running?  After that the question is what to do about the D-line.  Obviously Mean Joe Greene and LC Greenwood are locks for the D-line, after that, who are you going to have? Keisel? Heyward? Hampton? Stautner? Dwight White? Harrison sliding down in a 4-3? Or someone I might not have named?  

Then your next decision has to come at LB, obviously Ham, Lambert, and Watt are locks, but who else are you adding?  Joey Porter? James Harrison as a LB? Shazier (as short as his career was)? Chad Brown? I'm not including Kevin Greene because Pittsburgh was a short term stop for him.

CB can be a bit tricky, I mean you have Shell and Woodson on the outsides, but who do you play as your slot CB?  JT Thomas? Ike Taylor? McFadden?

As for Safety, obviously Blount and Polamalu have to be your starters with Fitzpatrick or Ryan Clark as a backup.

The secondary of a team like that would make most receiving corps give up along with a good number of RBs just because catching a pass would get a receiver absolutely punished.

I do think we have something in Adams. He played really good ball this season and think he can contribute going forward.

- TJ. Running out of things to say about 90. DPOY almost feels disrespectful at this point and MVP is more deserving. Tipped pass to leading to the TD. He will win DPOY and it’s about damn time. That is one hell of a player who had one hell of a year. 

- Cam. Forced fumble to  TJ’s. TD. Big hits. Big heart. Found the fountain of youth this year and played like a young man. Captain cam shows up and he sure did tonight. 

- Montravius Adams. Talk about a silver lining coming out of the year. This man balled out tonight and really he has since we poached him. Solid game from the big man. 

- Juju. What can you say about him? He didn’t have to do this tonight. He’s on a one year deal and had everything to lose tonight. He gutted it out and gave it what he had. 

- Washington. Haven’t had him on here a lot this year but he had a good game. Big TD, big catches. He has a solid night. 

- Harvin. Happy to see him bounce back. I know he’s struggled this year but he really bounced back tonight and I’m super pumped for him. Good booms tonight. 

 Bad-

- Haden. Well… if this was the end of Haden’s time in Pittsburgh, it sure didn’t look good. Saw 2 big throws given up, one of which was a TD. Looked absolutely cooked tonight which a shame for his first playoff game. 

- Najee. Hurts me but he didn’t play a good game. The fumble was forgiving but he just was not hitting holes. Not sure if his elbow had him uncomfortable but he was too hesitant and danced too much. That, and in 1q he lost a 1 on 1 to a safety. Come on. 

- Punt coverage. Big time failure. Some massive returns given up tonight. I understand hill is dynamic but in a game where field positioning is so crucial we absolutely failed. 

- Diontae. Drops. False start. Stopped on the third down. Poor night and there’s no way to cut it. He really had a down half of the year which a shame. We’ll dive into it more in an off-season review but I hope we keep him regardless. But that’s for the future to figure out- he played bad tonight. 

- Spillane. Yeah. Idk. Keith says he should be a starter in this league. Uhmmm

So this is it. Gonna try to keep my emotions in check about Ben but what a ride it has been. We weren’t supposed to here. A true tip of the cap to Tomlin for getting us here, like it or not. Sure am gonna miss 7 but I’ll save that for when he makes the official announcement. Love yinz.

21167,141605,141605,Ooziez,"Bad-

- Harvin. No idea what we do at punter next year but he has struggled mightily. If we go into camp with he and Waitman, I see a hard time seeing Harvin win that job. For a team that struggles like we do, lousy punts and field position is the very last thing we need. 

- OL. After a dominant performance last week, and a tougher opponent this week, this line flopped. People will lay it on Snell but he had nothing to work with at all. No push. No drive. Just blown up all day. 

- Run defense. Took a bit but Baltimore finally figured out that all you have to do is run the ball on us and you have an easy out. Year long issue, nothing new here. 

- 3 points off of 3 turnovers. 4, if you want to include the failed fake punt. That’s bad. Leads me to my next point…

- Canada. Lord. Where to begin. An absolute dud of a game from him. First and second down runs against the best run defense in the league? Sure, why not. Who cares that they don’t have a secondary. We will not attack it. Just an atrocious game plan from Canada. You can give the personnel excuse all day long but he has been absolutely awful. 

Good-

- Ray Ray. He gets a lot of shit but he came up BIG here. Give the man some love holy shitttttt

- Najee. This motherfuckers arm looked done and he came back and put this fucking team on his shoulders. Our fucking rookie ladies and gentlemen. The future looks amazing with 22. What a ball player 

- Sutton. Big time pick in the end zone is what we all saw but he, and all the other DB’s, really did a solid job tackling today in the flat. We’ve seen them miss a lot of these this year but the whole unit looked sharp today. 

- Cam. Big cam. Just willing the defense to dominance here. His best year of football he has played. Just an absolute man out there. Plugging gaps, sacking QB’s, doing his thing. 

- TJ. Don’t know what to say that hasn’t been said. DPOY almost feels insulting at this point and MVP is more deserving. Truly watching a future HOF’er in his prime just destroying people. 

- Gentry / Muth. Big Zach came to play today. His progress has been insanely impressive and he had a good showing today. Nothing splashy but he got open, showed good hands, and good blocks. And man Muth… that YAC is just dirty. 

- Claypool. Running back or receiver, chase answered the bell today and did his damn job. Hell of a game for 11. 

- Ben. The fucking GOAT. What a drive. Debate a wall holy shit 7

- Edmunds. Thought Rel represented himself today. Of course the pick was his splash play but his coverage and run defense looked pretty good to me. Happy for him. He’s a guy I hope we can sign back to the squad. 

- Boswell. You money making machine. What a kicker. What a man. WHAT AN ANIMAL

Ben… you are a legend. A first ballot hall of famer. This thing isn’t over baby LETS FUCKING GO.

1) no emotion- i dont get the point you are trying to make here. Do you think if he were to yell and hit a player in the back of the head like bruce arians did it would make him a better coach? or would you rather him keep a cool head like Bill belichick?

2) speaks in platitudes- again i don’t get what this has to do with Tomlin being a bad coach or “too comfortable”, it just seems like you are grasping at straws here but you will probably consider that statement a platitude and dismiss it

3) regular player behavior issues - Tomlin should be commended for the brown and bell years considering how much of a headache they proved to be for other organizations but if you want a more recent example look at chase claypool. after the vikings game where claypool had a lack of urgency for getting the ball back jn the hands of the ref he has shown 0 issues of focusing on his play. while claypool has not been in that situation since the vikings game a lot of reports since that incident have eluded to claypool getting the message for coach T

4) rosters crumbling and underperforming - what were your honest expectations for this season? the seasons when we had our best shot at winning the 7th superbowl i wouldn’t blame tomlin, we had poor defensive play due to shazier going down and other injures in the playoffs. if you want to blame tomlin for failing to assemble a better defense in those years thats one thing but you choose the most asinine points to argue tomlin is too comfortable and is a bad coach",5.0,steelers,t3_s6oaxz,False,0.0,:sc::c3::c9::sc: FITZPATTY,2022-01-17T23:06:50Z,steelers,-0.0484750777944478

tj watt is always trying to cause a fumble thats why you see him chipping at the ball/arms during the play, and through the whistle. Clearly watts style of play is effective as he has about 20 since entering the league. I think calling watt dirty for that would be like calling marlon humphery dirty because of how physical he can be playing the corner position. I don’t think either players are dirty they are both just good at what they do.

Secondary especially. They've passed on better cover guys for the surer tackler numerous times, it's why people are often blindsided by where our secondary picks land and on who. If you're not capable of attacking the LOS as a corner, you're not gonna have a chance at making the roster.


Our receivers? How many can be described as tough at the catch and willing blockers? If Tomlin is asking the two position groups who are typically the most averse to contact ( outside specialist roles) to a higher standard of physicality, you can bet that is something also being stressed to the other groups.


Defensive woes mainly stem from two things in my mind: dearth of injuries and retirements post draft, and the gaping void that is our MLBs right now. You can't have bad MLB play in the NFL and also have a good defense. 

Bush is afraid to test his knee in real ways, not just in sideline to sideline stuff, but in shedding blocks. Schobert is just another guy better suited as a depth piece.

So for instance, if there is a 40% chance of rain in your town, it does not mean that 40% will get rain and that 60% will stay dry. It means that in any particular area covered by the percentage, you have a 40% chance of getting rain.

Basically, in the example above, it means that your neighborhood has a 40% chance of rain and your friend’s neighborhood has a 40% chance and their friend’s neighborhood has a 40%.

Since each neighborhood has its own 40% chance, all, some, or none of them could get rain because they all get their own separate “rolls” against the chance. With how probability works, the entire town could get rain or the entire town might not see a drop.",4.0,nfl,t3_vao9l3,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2022-06-12T12:23:51Z,steelers,0.049376903292181

You are not an draft scout for the Steelers. Your evaluation seems to be based on his school instead of his traits and tape. 

2. That point is meaningless because you don't know the draft product(it could be worse or guys don't declare), and you don't know where we'll be picking next year. We could **still** be wasting a year TJ/Minkah with no succession plan in place.

3. Giving Mason/Mitch their best chance of success and giving the team their best chance of success are not the same thing. If they think Willis has a higher future upside, and believe they can get him there then you pack Mason's bag. This is a sunk cost fallacy.

The key to their running game is the threat of Lamar running, something that is not sustainable, as I already said.

28148,190873,190873,TheGrat1,">$19m a year seems like a random number

It is around what Michael Thomas is making and nearly 10% of the salary cap. Considering most teams are going to want a franchise QB to go along with that receiver, and the going rate for them is 40+ million, that is tying up 28%+ of your entire team's cap in two players and that is on the lower end of contracts for elite players at their positions (19 and 40 million respectively) as it stands today. Paying WRs QB money is crappy team building and these teams paying it better hope the cap explodes. We already saw the Cowboys have to trade Amari Cooper for peanuts and his average salary is only 1 million over my threshold.

TL;DR: The WR market is overvalued right now and only an explosion of the salary cap or a wholesale correction like we saw in the RB market will fix that. Until then smart GMs are not going to be caught up in it, even if they have a cheap QB room like the Steelers currently have.

You might take a loss the next week against a better team but you always knew your starter was coming back in a week or maybe a couple weeks and could still make the playoffs. The playoffs are one and done so if your top 3 guys on offense are out you probably ain’t gonna win. But Ben always came back and kept us in the running in the regular season.

I never met a football player before let alone a Steeler let alone my favorite player.

After a few hours of waiting, Im finally there, and I put my jersey down and he says ""hi what name should I put on it"" 

You know The Christmas Story? Where Ralphie meets Santa and goes blank and can't make words? That was me. I went
""Your name"".

He looked at me like I was an idiot and asked again, and I said ""I don't want my name I want your name""

Again he looked at me like I was an idiot, and his entourage was also like ""wtf"".
My girlfriend finally stepped in and fixed it, and that's how I got the jersey signed.

Team A can afford $10M in 2022 but Team B is up against the cap and they're only offering $7M in 2022 and wants to push the rest of the money back. The agent should accept Team A's offer. 

Obviously that's a simplistic scenario, and there's other factors involved. What if Team B is a playoff caliber team and Team A isn't? Maybe the agent decides it's worth going to Team B. Just want to give people some room to make their own decisions. But yeah it's going to be off since we can't distinguish guaranteed money.

We could just scrap it altogether, and say that any 4 year contract worth $40M means a $10M cap hit (in terms of seeing if a GM can even afford this), but that's not realistic either since many teams will be up against the cap and looking for ways to fit players in.

100% of economists will tell you you're wrong. This isn't up for debate. It's a mathematical fact that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. With draft picks being the currency in this context, it's a mathematical fact that a 5th round pick this year is worth more than a 5th round pick next year. 

> Value to the team is all that matters, not value to the GM and Head Coach.

As a fan, that might be the case for you. Your job isn't on the line. You can afford to have the team suck for a couple years and hopefully cash in on draft picks two years from now. Again, 100% of coaches and front office execs will tell you you're wrong. Sorry to be blunt but that's an indisputable fact. There is inherent risk in trading current assets for future ones. Their jobs and reputations are on the line if the team sucks, so they want to use all the resources they can to win now. 

Now, DeCosta and Harbaugh obviously feel as though their job security is strong enough that the risk of not having that pick is worth it. As you said, Wade might have been worthless to them so they felt like getting anything in return is a win.

Basically, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because if you have it today you can invest it and it can earn a day’s worth of interest. 

In the NFL context, the draft picks are currency and having a 5th round pick you can use immediately vs a 5th round pick you can use two years from now is a vast difference. Think of how much can change in two years. Wade could develop into a pro bowler and you’d look like an idiot trading him for a 5th. More importantly, Harbaugh and DeCosta could get fired in that time (very unlikely I know but still) and they just gave the 5th round pick to their replacement. A general rule of thumb for the NFL is that for every year ahead that the pick is scheduled, it’s discounted one round.

I mean, this is wrong too. Women aren't inherently better are nursing (with the exception of literally nursing a baby obviously) and men aren't inherently better at engineering. Those vast differences are based on the perception of those fields and the social pressures to stay in your lane.

The more you artificially limit the talent pool by acting on your own prejudices (ie, why would I hire a male nurse?) the more you limit the overall talent of your organization. No one's saying that Sean McVay shouldn't be coaching, but creating opportunities for the male nurses and the female engineers encourage the next round of youth to pursue those career paths.

Speaking of QB, who will start and will they play well enough to consistently move the chains and be productive in the red zone?

Can Matt Canada finally install his offense and will the players to execute it at a high level?

Will Dotson, Claypool and Muth take the next steps forward and upward as players and leaders?

On defense, how well will they perform with Tuitt gone, Bush needing a big rebound and Jack being new in our system?

How well will our CBS hold up in the AFC?

41254,291710,291710,meganutsdeathpunch,"Cardinals GM Steve Keim: “As a young scout from Pennsylvania, I always admired Kevin for a number of reasons. He’s obviously a great talent evaluator but he may be an even better person. When I would see him on school visits or at all-star games, he would always take time to talk to the younger guys who looked up to him. That’s what I’ll probably remember most. For all of the success he’s had, there is no ego and he treats everyone the right way!”

Saints GM Mickey Loomis: “I’ve known Kevin for a long time. I’ve served on a number of committees with him, and he’s one of the great general managers that this league’s had. And yet, he’s one of these guys that’s never sought the spotlight, he’s always behind the scenes, obviously he likes it that way. He’s just one of these unsung guys in our league that doesn’t get the accolades he probably deserves. He’s had, what, 15, 16 straight years of winning records, and obviously that’s a tribute to the entire organization, and he leads that football operation and has done a fantastic job. I always appreciate his intelligence, his point of view. He’s one of the guys that people seek out for his opinions, they listen when he speaks, and he’s got a great perspective and an unselfish perspective. … My guess is, I don’t know this, he probably sees himself as a spoke in the wheel and just wants to do the best job he can to help the entire building. … And he’s really been instrumental in a lot of things we do at the combine, the way pro days are run. He’s got a lot of influence on things behind the scenes. He’s never sought credit for any of it. But he deserves credit.”

49ers GM John Lynch: “Kevin Colbert is class personified. Great at his job and is equally great as a guy. He operates with integrity, works his tail off and is excellent in his job. I found it so cool that he worked in league committee meetings at Indy as a co-chair of the GMAC [General Manager Advisory Committee] as if he wasn’t retiring.”

Titans GM Jon Robinson: “Kevin is such a great example for every person in the NFL personnel profession. Hard-working, genuine, competitive, intelligent—all while being accepting of young scouts, helping us along the way. Congrats on an outstanding career and thank you for the lessons in the personnel business. Even when you didn’t know we were watching, we were, just trying to learn how to do it the right way from one of the best!”

Eagles GM Howie Roseman: “When Kevin’s number pops up on your phone or you call Kevin, it’s like, What’s he doing? Always got a story, always got such great perspective, such a great dude, and he’s obviously had tremendous success, winning two world championships. He’s a Hall of Fame GM. No one with more integrity. … The COVID year, during the draft, everyone’s at their house, and we all were on this GM email, because we do this charity thing. I wore a suit and tie the first night of the draft, and nobody else did—like no one else did. And so they were all busting my balls on it. And Kevin calls me, and he’s like, ‘Hey Howie, I was wearing a suit, too, I just didn’t have a first-round pick, so no one saw me!’ He’d traded it for Minkah [Fitzpatrick]. That’s who he was. Great guy. Hall of Fame executive.”

Seahawks GM John Schneider: “I first met Kevin in 1993, as we were both working in pro scouting for rivals—the Packers and the Lions. Kevin was always so, so kind to me, and I considered him, and still do, an older brother. In a highly competitive business, he treated me and everyone so kindly. A man of faith, awesome family man and obviously a great evaluator team builder/evaluator, we all have looked up to Kevin for such a long time. I wish him the best in retirement and can’t wait to continue to pick his brain for information. Kevin, I can’t believe how fast the past 29 years have gone. God bless you and your family. We’ll all miss you dearly.”

Rams GM Les Snead: “When you hear people say, ‘football man,’ Kevin is the gold standard. When you hear people say, ‘good man,’ Kevin is the gold standard. We were watching pro days in our draft meetings this year and Kevin was front and center where he always is on the pro day circuit. I don’t shed a tear often. But seeing Kevin and realizing this is the end of his impactful run, I definitely shed a silent tear.” 

Chargers GM Tom Telesco: “Kevin’s track record of success speaks for itself. But just as impressive has been his impact on young scouts, GMs and league initiatives to better our game. His influence in the NFL will be felt long after he retires.” ",36.0,steelers,t3_ugvklo,False,0.0,:sb::b9::b2::sb: DEEBO,2022-05-02T13:01:32Z,steelers,0.0004301563782267
41255,291711,291711,meganutsdeathpunch,"Browns GM Andrew Berry: “He’s one of the most adept team builders that our sport has ever seen, and yet you would never know it because of his humility. He has excellent people skills, a kind demeanor and true empathy. Our sport has been better with him at the helm of one of the most iconic franchises.”

Texans GM Nick Caserio: “It’s a view from afar of respect, appreciation and admiration for his consistency and the way he did his job. He was as immersed as any executive in the process. I can’t tell you how many times I ran into him, Thursday-night games, Saturdays; I mean, he was always there. He’s a true-blue football evaluator that puts a premium on scouting players. He had a very soft-spoken, humble approach, but the way they built their teams over the number of years he was there speaks not only to him as a person, it speaks to his relationship and rapport with Mike [Tomlin]. We were fortunate to compete against them on a fairly regular basis, and we always knew the type of people and types of players they built that program on. The one thing that they’ve been able to do over the years is maintain their level of success and performance, regardless of the level of player they lose. It speaks to how well they scout players, how well they evaluate players, what they look for in players. And really that starts at the top with Kevin and Mike, and just the mutual respect they had for each other was apparent, in the spring especially. They were together so often at pro days, so they were working in tandem, in unison. And I think that’s why they’ve had as much success as they’ve had, because they view things through a similar lens. … At pro days, he would record everything, he would time everything. He would time 10s, he would time 20s, he’d be right in the mix gathering information when the scouts get together in the middle. He was always willing to listen and help.”

Ravens GM Eric DeCosta: “Kevin’s one of the all-timers. An elite scout who was able to seamlessly navigate all the different nuances of the GM position with an unmatched consistency. I hate that he’s made our job in Baltimore so difficult over the years, but I have great admiration for his career.”

Jets GM Joe Douglas: “Everyone respects and loves Kevin; it doesn’t matter what team you’re with. The coolest thing about the Ravens-Steelers rivalry is that it’s twice, and sometimes three times a year, where you want to just destroy each other. But after that, there’s just so much respect. I know just sitting in those draft rooms in Baltimore and we’re talking about, Who are the guys that are gonna rise to the challenge in Heinz Field when Renegade is blaring in the fourth quarter and all those fricking yellow towels are waving in the stands? Who’s going to rise to the occasion and who’s going to melt? Those conversations ultimately made Baltimore better. That’s the culture that the Steelers have built and Kevin’s put together. … He’s a special guy, salt of the earth, consistent. He’s just a good person, and he’d give you a shirt off his back. You always respect him because he puts the work in. He’s at the school sitting next to you. He’s got time for you, whether you’re a director of college scouting or you’re a personnel assistant. … He’s just an awesome, awesome person.”

Panthers GM Scott Fitterer: “He’s just a gentleman. He’s humble. He’s hard-working. He’s a scout at heart. He’s what I would think most GMs would aspire to be. He’s got just such a good presence about him. He’s so approachable. He’s a lot like Ted Thompson. Everybody respects him. You can’t find anyone to say a bad word about him. Just an unbelievable person. … The first time I met him, I think it was the Whistle Stop at the combine, like 20 years ago. I think he was with the Lions at the time. And I can say he’s the same guy now as he was 20 years ago, the first time I met with him. … He hasn’t changed a bit.

41256,291712,291712,meganutsdeathpunch,"“Usually, this is a quick sign-off spot for the column—but you’ll have to excuse me here, because I’m going to let this one breathe a bit and finish up our postdraft piece by honoring Steelers GM Kevin Colbert, who just finished up his 23rd and final draft in Pittsburgh.Colbert’s record speaks for itself. Since returning to his hometown as director of football operations in 2000, to replace Tom Donahoe, Pittsburgh has gone 226-143-3. The Steelers have won the consistently tough AFC North in 10 of Colbert’s 22 years, with six trips to the conference title game, three AFC championships and two Super Bowl titles. And taking over a team coming off consecutive losing seasons, he’s had just one sub-.500 season since (way back in ’03).

Now, here’s where you’d usually get the stock line … As good a football executive as he is, he’s an even better dude. In this case, it’s not lip service. I can tell you from my own dealings with Colbert that it’s true, and that fact can be backed up with what just about anyone in the NFL will tell you about him.Wanna see? Well, on Saturday, I shot texts out to peers across the NFL to ask for their own tributes, mostly because I thought he’d enjoy reading them. Happy retirement, Kevin.”

Colts GM Chris Ballard: “Kevin is one of the real special men in this league. His contributions to the Steelers’ organization and to the game of football have been truly special. I have such great respect for him not only as one of the best general managers in NFL history but also as a man. Anytime I needed advice or guidance, he was there to help, and I feel very fortunate to consider Kevin a friend. If you look at the entirety of his career, I don’t think there is any question that he should be enshrined in the Hall of Fame. Kevin is so humble he won’t agree with this, but he has done the job as good as anyone who has ever sat in the GM chair.”

Bills GM Brandon Beane: “Kevin is the most humble, hardworking GM that you could ask for. All the success and the steadiness of that organization, Kevin is the foundation of it. Sometimes when guys have success, you see maybe they don’t grind as hard, maybe they didn’t go in the weeds as much—like, I’ve got it figured out. Kevin, all the way through the end, was still grinding his way through the fall. And he doesn’t just go to the big schools; he’s out on Tuesday night at MAC games. First of all, he loves it. Second of all, there are people who enjoy parts of this process, but there are hard parts, and Kevin, whenever I saw him, his work level never slowed down. … I’ve gotten to know Kevin well because we’re one of the teams in BLESTO, as well, so we have meetings together—in May, we go, and we’re hanging out, and you get to know people even better. And he led that group, he’s been a senior statesman, and BLESTO at times looked like it was gonna fold just because some teams were going independent or to NFS, and if Kevin wasn’t leading that, I’m not sure BLESTO wouldn’t have folded.”",47.0,steelers,t3_ugvklo,False,0.0,:sb::b9::b2::sb: DEEBO,2022-05-02T13:00:00Z,steelers,0.0077708675574173
41257,291716,291716,meganutsdeathpunch,"Cardinals GM Steve Keim: “As a young scout from Pennsylvania, I always admired Kevin for a number of reasons. He’s obviously a great talent evaluator but he may be an even better person. When I would see him on school visits or at all-star games, he would always take time to talk to the younger guys who looked up to him. That’s what I’ll probably remember most. For all of the success he’s had, there is no ego and he treats everyone the right way!”


Saints GM Mickey Loomis: “I’ve known Kevin for a long time. I’ve served on a number of committees with him, and he’s one of the great general managers that this league’s had. And yet, he’s one of these guys that’s never sought the spotlight, he’s always behind the scenes, obviously he likes it that way. He’s just one of these unsung guys in our league that doesn’t get the accolades he probably deserves. He’s had, what, 15, 16 straight years of winning records, and obviously that’s a tribute to the entire organization, and he leads that football operation and has done a fantastic job. I always appreciate his intelligence, his point of view. He’s one of the guys that people seek out for his opinions, they listen when he speaks, and he’s got a great perspective and an unselfish perspective. … My guess is, I don’t know this, he probably sees himself as a spoke in the wheel and just wants to do the best job he can to help the entire building. … And he’s really been instrumental in a lot of things we do at the combine, the way pro days are run. He’s got a lot of influence on things behind the scenes. He’s never sought credit for any of it. But he deserves credit.”


49ers GM John Lynch: “Kevin Colbert is class personified. Great at his job and is equally great as a guy. He operates with integrity, works his tail off and is excellent in his job. I found it so cool that he worked in league committee meetings at Indy as a co-chair of the GMAC [General Manager Advisory Committee] as if he wasn’t retiring.”


Titans GM Jon Robinson: “Kevin is such a great example for every person in the NFL personnel profession. Hard-working, genuine, competitive, intelligent—all while being accepting of young scouts, helping us along the way. Congrats on an outstanding career and thank you for the lessons in the personnel business. Even when you didn’t know we were watching, we were, just trying to learn how to do it the right way from one of the best!”


Eagles GM Howie Roseman: “When Kevin’s number pops up on your phone or you call Kevin, it’s like, What’s he doing? Always got a story, always got such great perspective, such a great dude, and he’s obviously had tremendous success, winning two world championships. He’s a Hall of Fame GM. No one with more integrity. … The COVID year, during the draft, everyone’s at their house, and we all were on this GM email, because we do this charity thing. I wore a suit and tie the first night of the draft, and nobody else did—like no one else did. And so they were all busting my balls on it. And Kevin calls me, and he’s like, ‘Hey Howie, I was wearing a suit, too, I just didn’t have a first-round pick, so no one saw me!’ He’d traded it for Minkah [Fitzpatrick]. That’s who he was. Great guy. Hall of Fame executive.”


Seahawks GM John Schneider: “I first met Kevin in 1993, as we were both working in pro scouting for rivals—the Packers and the Lions. Kevin was always so, so kind to me, and I considered him, and still do, an older brother. In a highly competitive business, he treated me and everyone so kindly. A man of faith, awesome family man and obviously a great evaluator team builder/evaluator, we all have looked up to Kevin for such a long time. I wish him the best in retirement and can’t wait to continue to pick his brain for information. Kevin, I can’t believe how fast the past 29 years have gone. God bless you and your family. We’ll all miss you dearly.”


Rams GM Les Snead: “When you hear people say, ‘football man,’ Kevin is the gold standard. When you hear people say, ‘good man,’ Kevin is the gold standard. We were watching pro days in our draft meetings this year and Kevin was front and center where he always is on the pro day circuit. I don’t shed a tear often. But seeing Kevin and realizing this is the end of his impactful run, I definitely shed a silent tear.”
Chargers GM Tom Telesco: “Kevin’s track record of success speaks for itself. But just as impressive has been his impact on young scouts, GMs and league initiatives to better our game. His influence in the NFL will be felt long after he retires.” ",1.0,steelers,t3_ugvasq,False,0.0,:sb::b9::b2::sb: DEEBO,2022-05-02T12:53:09Z,steelers,0.0004301563782267
41258,291717,291717,meganutsdeathpunch,"Browns GM Andrew Berry: “He’s one of the most adept team builders that our sport has ever seen, and yet you would never know it because of his humility. He has excellent people skills, a kind demeanor and true empathy. Our sport has been better with him at the helm of one of the most iconic franchises.”


Texans GM Nick Caserio: “It’s a view from afar of respect, appreciation and admiration for his consistency and the way he did his job. He was as immersed as any executive in the process. I can’t tell you how many times I ran into him, Thursday-night games, Saturdays; I mean, he was always there. He’s a true-blue football evaluator that puts a premium on scouting players. He had a very soft-spoken, humble approach, but the way they built their teams over the number of years he was there speaks not only to him as a person, it speaks to his relationship and rapport with Mike [Tomlin]. We were fortunate to compete against them on a fairly regular basis, and we always knew the type of people and types of players they built that program on. The one thing that they’ve been able to do over the years is maintain their level of success and performance, regardless of the level of player they lose. It speaks to how well they scout players, how well they evaluate players, what they look for in players. And really that starts at the top with Kevin and Mike, and just the mutual respect they had for each other was apparent, in the spring especially. They were together so often at pro days, so they were working in tandem, in unison. And I think that’s why they’ve had as much success as they’ve had, because they view things through a similar lens. … At pro days, he would record everything, he would time everything. He would time 10s, he would time 20s, he’d be right in the mix gathering information when the scouts get together in the middle. He was always willing to listen and help.”


Ravens GM Eric DeCosta: “Kevin’s one of the all-timers. An elite scout who was able to seamlessly navigate all the different nuances of the GM position with an unmatched consistency. I hate that he’s made our job in Baltimore so difficult over the years, but I have great admiration for his career.”


Jets GM Joe Douglas: “Everyone respects and loves Kevin; it doesn’t matter what team you’re with. The coolest thing about the Ravens-Steelers rivalry is that it’s twice, and sometimes three times a year, where you want to just destroy each other. But after that, there’s just so much respect. I know just sitting in those draft rooms in Baltimore and we’re talking about, Who are the guys that are gonna rise to the challenge in Heinz Field when Renegade is blaring in the fourth quarter and all those fricking yellow towels are waving in the stands? Who’s going to rise to the occasion and who’s going to melt? Those conversations ultimately made Baltimore better. That’s the culture that the Steelers have built and Kevin’s put together. … He’s a special guy, salt of the earth, consistent. He’s just a good person, and he’d give you a shirt off his back. You always respect him because he puts the work in. He’s at the school sitting next to you. He’s got time for you, whether you’re a director of college scouting or you’re a personnel assistant. … He’s just an awesome, awesome person.”

Panthers GM Scott Fitterer: “He’s just a gentleman. He’s humble. He’s hard-working. He’s a scout at heart. He’s what I would think most GMs would aspire to be. He’s got just such a good presence about him. He’s so approachable. He’s a lot like Ted Thompson. Everybody respects him. You can’t find anyone to say a bad word about him. Just an unbelievable person. … The first time I met him, I think it was the Whistle Stop at the combine, like 20 years ago. I think he was with the Lions at the time. And I can say he’s the same guy now as he was 20 years ago, the first time I met with him. … He hasn’t changed a bit.

41259,291718,291718,meganutsdeathpunch,"“Usually, this is a quick sign-off spot for the column—but you’ll have to excuse me here, because I’m going to let this one breathe a bit and finish up our postdraft piece by honoring Steelers GM Kevin Colbert, who just finished up his 23rd and final draft in Pittsburgh.
Colbert’s record speaks for itself. Since returning to his hometown as director of football operations in 2000, to replace Tom Donahoe, Pittsburgh has gone 226-143-3. The Steelers have won the consistently tough AFC North in 10 of Colbert’s 22 years, with six trips to the conference title game, three AFC championships and two Super Bowl titles. And taking over a team coming off consecutive losing seasons, he’s had just one sub-.500 season since (way back in ’03).

Now, here’s where you’d usually get the stock line … As good a football executive as he is, he’s an even better dude. In this case, it’s not lip service. I can tell you from my own dealings with Colbert that it’s true, and that fact can be backed up with what just about anyone in the NFL will tell you about him.
Wanna see? Well, on Saturday, I shot texts out to peers across the NFL to ask for their own tributes, mostly because I thought he’d enjoy reading them. Happy retirement, Kevin.”

As mentioned over and over in this thread, fixing O-Line and getting a bridge QB over moving up to draft a QB is the best option.

Our offense wasn't creating sustained drives often enough, keeping our defense on the field more than they needed to be (they got gassed).

KC receivers have stepped up down the stretch, likely out of necessity, as, at least to me, the way that Hill and Kelce were being held in check at the beginning of the season, they had to figure out a way to be dynamic.  Enter Robinson, Hardman, D Williams, and to a lesser degree Pringle stepping up later in the season.

McKinnon exploited our weak run defense (I think unexpectedly), creating a need to contain him more effectively, which lead to more open receivers for KC.

They are atop the AFC, no doubt, and they are a good Offense, but this year, they've been all over the place with regards to comparing to previous years.

I'm hoping we seriously address the O-Line, and to some degree the D-Line this coming off-season.  We need some updated depth and cohesiveness on both fronts there.

As for the QB situation, I'm not saying that Haskins is our savior, but he is mobile and younger, which can help a little with the O-Line issues.  Another vet to think about is Garoppolo.

The Steelers are the one team that have truly and consistently figured out Lamar. [“Lamar Jackson has a passer rating of 66.7 with 622 yards,  4 touchdowns and 6 interceptions in 3 games starting versus the Steelers in his career.”](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/starter-lamar-jackson-win-loss-record-against-steelers-when-starting)

The one win he does have was when we were without Ben and starting either Duck Hodges or Mason Rudolph. And even in that game he threw 1 TD to 3 Picks (and this was during his MVP season I might add), and to finish it off he has never had a passer rating above 70. We also consistently are able to sack him far more then most NFL Teams. 

Now onto the notion that Ben carried the Steelers. First off we have the obvious example of the 2019 season, where he carried a depleted roster to 8-8 without Ben. With Duck Hodges, a random undrafted guy, and Mason Rudolph, an undeveloped third rounder who really wasnt good. Second is the fact that [Tomlin is 18-15-1 without Ben as the starter](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-march-31-x8205). This is far better then the Packers, who have [a 6-12-1 record without Rodgers since 2008 when he became starter](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/packers-record-without-aaron-rodgers-since-2008), and the [Falcons who have an 0-3 record since 2008 without Ryan](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/falcons-record-without-matt-ryan-since-2008). 

So, in conclusion, the Steelers for the most part have Lamar’s number barring a drastic change, and Ben and Tomlin equally made each other. You need an equal balance of both to truly make a run, which is why we see 6-10 team turn sometimes turn around with a coaching change, and why we don’t see Belichek dominating teams like he used to without the core he once had.

But I also think Tomlin and Colbert were spoiled to some extent by the fact that Mike Munchak seemed to have a gift for turning no-names into solid players and even pro bowlers in some cases (Villanueva, Foster, Hubbard, Feiler, Finney, etc).

I would've done WHATEVER it took to get Munchak back. Obviously if he doesn't wanna be here then they can't. If he wasn't interested though, then go find someone that's proven something in this league before. Doug Morrone was a name thrown around that intrigued me.

After that? Invest in the damn unit! 

What should they have done? Something!

**2021 Free Agency**

Free agency was totally jacked up in the off-season before last. The covid year really screwed them with the cap so I give them a pass for not doing much there. Seeing **Matt Feiler** walk did hurt though. I personally would've taken the $ given to JuJu and seen if that would be enough to keep Feiler here.

I know this is when my argument is going to start to lose some people because they love the guys we go. I do too. But I still hate a RB in round 1, ESPECIALLY when your OL totally sucks. 

**2021 Draft**

Hindsight is often 20/20 but I was ALL-IN on **Creed Humphrey**. So much that I wanted him at pick 24. He was there in the 2nd and obviously was a homerun for KC but I'd have been pumped to grab him in the 1st round. They could've thrown out probably a pick like a 4th to move up a few spots for Darrisaw too. Or, I also would've loved a move down and taken **Teven Jenkins** to add some nasty to the unit.

I'm good with the value they got in Friermuth in the 2nd. **Quinn Meinerz** was another guy I liked that was sitting there in the 3rd but I can't really argue one OL for another. I wasn't a big fan of Moore but it was a deep tackle class so he was an ok swing in the 4th round. It just felt like this team needed premium talent to plug in NOW, not projects that you can sit behind a vet. Moore and Green weren't ready at all. 

**2022 Free Agency**

THIS is where the team could've really made a move. Especially if they knew they were taking a QB early. Ben is off the books. So many Yinzers still haven't fully grasped how HUGE that is when it comes to roster building. Armstead and Scherff aren't their style.. but they could've made a move there if they wanted to. 

I loved the Daniels signing. So far it hasn't worked out. Hopefully he turns it around. **Morgan Moses** was a guy I liked over Chuks. He's older but I think a vet presence in the room would have been nice. He's also a better run blocker. If we're going to be a run-first team (and you better be after spending a 1st on Najee) then I think a guy like Moses makes more sense. There were rumors about **Ryan Jensen** being available. I'm not sure if those were ever true but he would've been a great signing for the same reasons as Moses (and with more upside).

**2022 Draft**

This is where I had to just accept what they thought. I wasn't (and still am not) convinced that Kenny Pickett is a good enough QB that you can win a Superbowl with. I'm just not sure he's physically gifted enough. 

I wanted them to give Mitch a year. Improve the trenches. And try to model yourself after what the Titans have done recently behind Derrick Henry. If they LOVED Kenny though, and thought he's the MAN then I can't argue with taking a swing that late in the round. But, if that's the way they knew they were going then why not be more aggressive in free agency??

Personally, I'd have taken **Tyler Smith** or **Tyler Linderbaum** at that spot. I know hindsight is 20/20 but you KNOW you all would've lost your collective minds if the team had come away with Linderbaum/Pickens/Willis in the first 3 rounds. I personally would've wanted Smith/Travis Jones/Willis.

We can agree to disagree. I know lots of people love Najee, Pat, Kenny, and Pickens.. I do too. I think they were all solid picks (maybe with the exception of Najee) but I also think it's just not great roster building to go outside-in.",9.0,steelers,t3_wuvf5q,False,0.0,:sh::h2::h3::sh: Joe Haden,2022-08-22T10:58:01Z,steelers,-0.011244590260987

Ridder's mental side of the game is miles ahead of Willis'. He can actually read a defense and his decision making is much better. 

He's more experienced.

Ridder's biggest flaw in my mind is his accuracy (which Willis also struggles with) but when you watch him sail passes it's usually because his feet are a mess. That, in my opinion, can be fixed with good coaching. And if he does? We've got a guy that checks A LOT of boxes.

His play dropped off for sure. But the Steelers' OL also QUICKLY fell apart not long after he left. I'm not sure he would've continued playing at a pro bowl level in Pittsburgh either.

**Staff:** Go HARD after Mike Munchak. 

Then, I'd call Brian Flores and see if he has any interest in backfilling Teryl Austin's position as a general defensive assistant and/or DB's coach. It's obviously a big step down for him but many owners aren't going to touch him right now. The Rooney family have always been trailblazers in that regard though. 

**Re-Sign:** Terrell Edmunds, Akhello Witherspoon, Miles Killebrew, Ray-Ray McCloud, Arthur Maulet, Taco Charlton, Montravius Adams, Chuks Okorafor, Robert Spillane

*Edmunds and Witherspoon are the two guys I really prioritize. Edmunds is a solid all-around player that rarely misses a game. His work on tight ends is underrated and continuity on the back-end is a good thing. This team also desperately needs CB help with Haden leaving and Witherspoon showed me enough to take a gamble on signing him to a 2-3 year deal and hoping he breaks out*

**Let walk:** JuJu, Ebron, Trai Turner, James Washington

*I love JuJu. The guy is tough as nails and I love how he loves the game. But, I also feel like he's a bit of a luxury signing. He's an awesome complementary piece but I'm not sure he's a WR1 and he'll likely get paid like one. The other 3 I'm not losing a wink of sleep over letting go.*

**Cut:** Zach Banner, Joe Schobert

*These are both no brainers when you looks at the cap savings. If Schobert were interested in a pay-cut I'd have some interest in seeing if he improves with a better DL in front of him*

**Extend** Minkah, Diontae Johnson

*Minkah's a no brainer mega-deal. Johnson not so much, but I think he has the tools to grow still, and a deal now could look like a discount in a couple years.*

**Free Agency Targets:** 

Marcus Mariota, Tyrod Taylor

Marlon Mack, James Conner, Gio Bernard, D'Ernest Johnson

Ryan Jensen, Connor Williams, Trenton Brown, Cam Robinson

Jarran Reed, Johnathan Hankins

Jayon Brown, Anthony Walker Jr 

*I'd bring in a mobile bridge QB to compete with Mason. Mariota is the guy I like. I think he has some upside to maybe be more than just a bridge if he stays healthy. And I want some mobility in the room so Canada doesn't have anymore excuses. Also, go find a REAL backup for Najee. Let's not kill the kid. It's too easy/cheap to find legit RB's in free agency.*

*I want to re-build the OL and get some attitude there. Jensen would be a great fit. I'd like to add a starter at either center or guard but I'm open to any position on the OL. That's where I'd focus to spend a little bit. On the defense just fill in some depth spots.*

**Draft:**

I'm not going to post a full mock or anything but I'm interested in OL, DL, and CB. I'd love to grab someone like Trevor Penning in round 1... It fills a huge need at tackle and also brings some more attitude into the room. Moore, Dotson, Jensen, Green, Penning may not be the most polished group but I'd like their demeanor with Munchak's coaching. Linderbaum would be a great plug and play pick as well if you went elsewhere in free agency. 

It's a deep class at cornerback too. They could probably find a future starter on day 2. I'm not ruling out the position in round 1 if a stud falls though. As a UC grad, I'd be so pumped to see Sauce Gardner in the black and gold.

A lot rides on Tuitt also. If you're still unsure about him at all then DL becomes a big priority too (although, I like the depth they have with Wormley, Loudermilk, and Adams).

**2023 Off-Season**

I'm waiting on my QB. At that point they hopefully have more picks (since they've already traded away a few in 2022) and I also like the class better with Stroud and Young. I also like the free agent class better that COULD include Rodgers, Cousins, Stafford, Carr, Murray, Lock, Minshew.

I believe particularly, in *September football*, people make a commitment to stopping the run. It's easier to make that commitment in September when everybody feels good and you have all the horses in the stable. I think over the course of the long haul, you see who's good at it week in and week out. It's usually tough sledding early in the football season, and that's been my experience. That was my intent when I was a defensive play caller. In order to be a good defense, it starts there; making people somewhat one-dimensional, making people struggle if they're running the football.

45939,332777,332777,terrybradshawsballs,"22. Pittsburgh Steelers  
Biggest strength: It's hard to find many better duos along the defensive front than T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward. Over the past three seasons, both Watt and Heyward rank among the top three players at their respective positions in both quarterback pressures and run stops. Their ability to make impact plays regardless of the situation is at the center of Pittsburgh's defensive success over that three-year stretch.  

Biggest weakness: The Steelers' offensive line has deteriorated from a unit that five-plus years ago was one of the best in the league under offensive line coach Mike Munchak. Now it profiles closer to the bottom of the league. This group was aided in pass protection by Ben Roethlisberger's 2.2-second average time to throw over the past two seasons (fastest in the NFL), making how it fares in what should be a different-looking 2022 offense something worth monitoring.  

X factor for 2022: The two-year, $8 million contract Ahkello Witherspoon signed to remain in Pittsburgh this offseason doesn't scream No. 1 outside cornerback, but that's what the Steelers are counting on him to be when looking at the rest of their roster. From Week 13 through the end of the season, Witherspoon allowed a passer rating of just 20.2 on throws into his coverage. His play has been hot and cold throughout his five-year career, but the Steelers will be hoping he carries over that momentum into 2022.",2.0,steelers,t3_vnitvh,False,0.0,:sh::h3::h2::sh: Harris,2022-06-29T11:10:03Z,steelers,0.0599936405749399
