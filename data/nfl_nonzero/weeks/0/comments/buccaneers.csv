- I can't wait for the Cowboys to make the playoffs on the back of Dak only to fire Mike McCarthy for Sean Payton.

- I haven't seen someone waste a career like the Cowboys are wasting Dak's since the Cowboys hired Mike McCarthy instead of Kellen Moore.  

- Amari Cooper. 

- I'm not surprised Jerry Jones puts extra salt on everything, he is a fan of the Cowboys after all. 

- If I had to choose between being a Cowboys, Eagles, Commanders, or Giants fan, I would choose Cowboys, buy a bunch of merch, burn it, and become Formula 1 Fan.

We will be trying out a new policy on Sunday where we allow highlights and injury report posts during the game. All other new posts will still be removed 1 hour before the game through 1 hour after the game. In order to post a new post for highlights or an injury report, you will need to either type ""[Highlight]"" or ""[Injury Report]"" at the beginning of the title of the post. These posts will also need to be links, and not self posts. 

Additionally, in all primetime games this year, we will be going ""Flair-only"" mode. This is to prevent trolls commenting in the game thread. If I see a regular user commenting that does not have a flair, I will try my best to assign a default flair.

We ask that you continue to be patient with us as we work on making the gameday experience the best we can.

736,5710,5710,A--A-RON,"It was brought up on Saturday that some users may not be a fan of the locking of the sub during games. I wanted to have a civil conversation about this because at the end of the day...

1. This was put in place to help the community stay organized on game days, and prevent trolling. 
2. This sub's moderators have never taken the stance ""It is our way or get lost"". Every decision made is for the community. Therefore if there is a rule or procedure that the community as a whole has a problem with, it should be discussed in a civil manor and is up for negotiation. 

How it Currently is: One hour before games, through one hour after the game, New posts are not allowed on r/buccaneers. Users can freely comment in the game thread. 

My concern as the head automod config mod on r/buccaneers: I am concerned that if we remove this policy, not only will be bombarded with trolls but the quality of posts during games will be poor. 

My proposal: If the community would like this policy removed, my counter proposal is that we only allow posts during games that are tagged [Injury Report] and [Highlights], all other posts will be removed. That means if you try posting ""lol fire Todd Bowles"" it would be removed. If you post ""[Highlight] Mike Evans catches a 89 YARD touchdown over Latimore"" and include a quality video(not a recoding from your tv) it would go through. 

Again, This policy was never made so that the mods can flex any power you may think we are hungry for. I think it is safe to say we have a great community here, and I would hope the majority of the users here realize that us mods are only here for you. We don't get paid, we don't get perks. 

As always, I open the floor for civil and productive conversation.

I do not understand the hate for possibly taking the best available running back in the draft at 33. 

When Lenny got hurt before, we had Rojo, now we don't. I have not seen enough from Keshawn Vaugn to be confident and if Lenny was out for an extended period of time, I think our offense would be screwed. 

We already missed out on the top EDGE rushing talent, and arguably the best Defensive Back talent... so why not stack the deck and give Brady another weapon out of the backfield?

If we are truly in win now mode, why take a rotational Defensive lineman/EDGE rusher when we can take the best running back in the draft Breece Hall?

**No,** I don't think we take two players from my favorite college program. It is early in my research phase, so I tried to pick some players I have watched play before. Also, Kenny Pickett fell all the way to 2nd round. 


1st - 27. Kenneth Walker III RB, Michigan State - I opted to pick Walker here even though I know it would not be a fan favorite pick. This would lock us in with a stud running back and free up some cap to use elsewhere in FA. 

-

2nd - 60. Tyler Smith IOL, Tulsa - Beefy IOL/G, after yesterday, we need some depth. 

-

3rd - 91. Ed Ingram IOL, LSU 131. - See above.

-

4th - 131. Josh Williams - Fayetteville State CB, NCAA - Smaller school, underrated, and we could use some CB depth. 

-

5th - 169. Jalen Nailor WR, Michigan State - This was a homer pick for me. Nailor could be really good, at times he even reminds me of Chris Godwin. I do not think Tyler Johnson is the answer for us at WR3 so it would not hurt to draft someone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89YiWToAr5I

If this is the case, Arians never told AB he was done for good, just did not want him standing around, probably causing confusion whether he was going back in or not.

In short because AB never said shit when it happened and then uses it to make the bucs organization look bad when it's convenient. I'm not saying we shouldn't have this conversation but to blame the bucs for VJ's passing is ridiculous. AB is a fraction the man VJ was and what he meant to this franchise. Also if anyone should be blamed for CTE lets look at the nfl as a whole instead of the bucs. Rest in peace #83 Vincent Jackson.

1538,11761,11761,AlchemicalHydra,"I hated Brady until he decided to risk his legacy by leaving the pats. It just so happens he picked my team. When he joined the team he pretty much immediately went from ""Tom 'I hate you' Brady"" to ""Tom 'six time superbowl champion' Brady"". I didnt even know how many superbowls he had at the time.

I mostly hated him because he always won and I was tired of seeing the superbowl basically become a contest of who can beat the patriots. 

In terms of ownership. I don't feel like we own Tom or ever will. But I also don't long for that feeling. I think owning a player is a fallacy and innevitably leads to disappointment. The pats fans that were upset about Tom leaving or betraying them are the whiniest bitches. That is such a stupid idea to think you own someone. And anyone who fell for that shit deserves all the heart break. All of it. These players are people and have right to manifest their own destiny. Many patriots fans and some coaches seem to struggle to understand that.

I think in general it's better for players to stay with the team that drafted them in terms of legacy building. But that's a personal choice of what a player values most. But Tom is the exception that proves that rule. His legacy at New England was completed 2 times over. 

Maybe you could argue Tom owes something to NE for drafting him and giving him a shot. Well the dude paid back that debt back with the first superbowl. 

On a side note I was fine with Brady joining even if we lost every game because for once the bucs were getting talked about. It felt/feels good. 

In terms of the Brady spotlight. I relate to Devin White. I'm not speaking for him but there was a headline about Brady beating 3 mvp qb's and Devin commented ""i guess we beat 3 mvp qb's"" or something. He's not taking any credit from Brady and if you watch him interact with/talk with Brady he understand how important he was to our superbowl win. But Devin also knows how important Devin was.

But cheering for you and seeing you do what you love most made me learn about this wonderful game to the point that I seriously believed I knew more than the referees! We always had a special champions playlist for every drive on our way to the game. As a family, we always prayed for you, celebrated and supported you in every game, cheered every win and suffered with every loss.  
  
I’m so proud of you, and of everything you have had to overcome physically and emotionally over the years. I am in awe of your dedication, and of everything you have achieved. You love what you do, and you leave behind a legacy that is a beautiful example for future generations.  
  
You are the most dedicated, focused and mentally tough person I have ever met. You never once complained over the years about all the bruises and aches and pains. You just kept focusing on your goal to go out there and be the best leader there was to all your teammates.  
  
I know how excited you are about the next chapter of your life. Watching you work so hard in your football career and seeing the dedication you are now putting into all your new endeavors is incredibly inspiring. There is nothing you can’t achieve. I have always been here for you, you know that, and I’m as excited as you are for what the future holds!

As you mention all natural turf grass fields are not alike.   It's really easy to shittily maintain a natural field.   It's easy for a guy to fuck something up too.   It takes a lot of work, knowledge, and in some cases luck for a field to be in good shape every week.  For a properly installed Field Turf field it's pretty much always going to be the same.  Not saying teams shouldn't put in that effort, but some weeks regardless of the intention the field will be in bad shape, and it will contribute to injury.

That said, I think at the NFL level it's the best place for natural grass in most cases.  In a high school or college setting, turf probably prevents more injuries due to those schools not being able to maintain a natural field as well.  There's certainly some areas of the country and some schools who can do it, but my high school field was a death trap.  If they could have afforded it, turf would have been much better (it would have been astro-turf back then)  In the NFL in some places it's just a matter of money, like in Carolina.   But domes are a problem, and north can be a problem, GB does it, but weather still causes issues, as a heated field can only do so much.   

Honestly, I think putting more money into improving artificial turf is actually the answer.

I know everyone thinks of Welker and Edelman as the scrappy 'non-traditional' receivers who have had success with Brady, so why can't Scottie be the next guy?   The answer is he's probably not the caliber of those guys.   And best case, to use another guy Brady has played with who fits the same... um... profile, he's probably closer to Danny Amondala than those two.   

It's OK... if we let Scottie go, he's still got a career out there, but we do have others on the roster who make more sense right now.

He was actually pretty good in KC, relatively, but for someone who had watched him since the 80's it was clear he was not anywhere near the top of his game.  Add to that, that they really made the right decision moving on with just some shitty QB they picked up from a shitty team, I can see the point of view.

We've seen other high-end HOFr's move and in the case of Favre it was a publicity disaster with not great payoff.   Manning was pretty amazing in Denver, but it did feel weird, and that last season, oh man, he was done.  Brady at this point is well beyond what is a reasonable age for a QB to play at a high level.   But he's playing better than anyone.   

I also think he managed the switch better, as he really did adjust his public persona.   Montana seemed like he was on a ride, Manning was a robot that plays football, and Favre, well, he decided to start sending dick pics.   Brady becomes a Buc, but somehow at the same time redefines what that should be.   There are dozens of case studies to be done on his transition here from a leadership and marketing perspective, because it has been insane how successful it has been.  There have been tons of talented and successful people who have failed because they didn't do what he has done as well, outside the NFL.

So while I can understand the perspective, the thing everyone has to do with Brady is realize this guy is an anomaly.  He's ridiculously smart, ridiculously talented, and ridiculously savvy, and finally he's stupid charismatic, sure people hate him, but once he has an opening he can turn that around quick.

But in order to be above average there has to be no more than 14 guys above them.   We know that Brady, Rodgers, Stafford are certainly in the top 10 QB's.   I'd also say Prescott is probably there.   We love to hate guys like Cousins, Murray and Wentz, but while they're not our favorites they're at least statistically, last season, above average.   Makes it really tough to say that 10 or 11 teams in the AFC have proven above average QBs.

The top 5 quarterbacks are weighted to the NFC, because it's hard to argue Brady, Rodgers or Stafford out of it.

In 2025 it could be Mahomes, Herbert, Allen, Burrow and likely some other dude, flip a coin on whether he's on a roster now and another to see if he's in the NFC or AFC.

Honestly, I just don't think he's a solid #1 at this point, and I don't think he can run those long routes and complete them when Kupp is covered.

Honestly in this version of the NFL I think you want a 1A and 1B.   Robinson is a #2.   He went to a good situation though, so we'll see what pans out.

I'm skeptical, because Robinson has shown he either gives up on routes or is frequently out of sync with his QB.   It's not that he drops a lot of balls, he isn't anywhere near where he probably should be when the ball is thrown.  Put a guy like D.J.

We have a new expansion team with no home city.   It is a true ""America's Team.""   It's location can move each year, with cities putting together packages for the season.   The home cities are set for the upcoming 4 years, and every year a new location is announced between the Superbowl and draft.   A location can only be used every 4 years.    

To balance the conferences, and serve the international goals of the NFL, a ""Not America's Team"" is also added, but its locations are outside of the US.  

Neither of these teams are confined to the NFC or AFC, they swap each season.   They also are placed in a different division within the conference each year.

The team mascots are fixed, But each year, these teams can rebrand their colors, and obviously city/locale name into a new concept.   Provides great sales opportunities.

Now the NFL gets the ability to target and test new locations, along with increasing exposure of the league.   Obviously playing in games overseas or in BFE is a large ask for players, so I propose this: These teams are owned and managed by the NFLPA and players are given shares, based on every year they are on an active roster for more than (x) games.

Seriously though, a good QB & receiver combo knows the playbook and the QB is making a decision based on the idea that the receiver should be here, he can get here, and the defenders won't be there (decision making), the receiver is running his route with the intent to be in the right place at the right time (precision).   One way the QB can adjust this, is by changing the arc of the path of the ball.    So what we see as a rainbow is intended to be a perfectly executed pass to the receiver.  

All goes back to Walsh's offenses which were quite explicitly timing based and require the QB and R to be in sync to work properly. Walsh's schemes allowed OK athletes with a lot of practice  to seem great and great athletes to excel, and it's still core to most pro offenses.

One things the books did so much better is express the massive amount of time for anything to happen on a solar-system scale.   The TV show wasn't able to do that as well.   You start moving something from the asteroid belt to the earth, well... it takes time and that's non negotiable even with the Epstein drive being a thing.

Jumping forward to the Persepolis Risng story immediately after season six would have been bad, and against the rigor they put into the books to keep them somewhat realistic (minus a super advanced alien race and the deus ex machina of the Epstein drive) The idea that anything on that scale could have happened outside of a human generation is just silly.

5282,31695,31695,CoopNine,"Look at his college career... It was not stellar overall, even though he had a great ending.    Doug Williams was in the Heisman race, and had great numbers... ridiculous numbers in 1977.   

I think Moon could have gone ~ 4th round, but in no way was he a clear cut hall of famer.  He might have, or he might have lasted later, he would have been a stretch any earlier.   Objectively looking at the two in 1978 you'd say Williams is a far better bet.   

And Williams was a great QB.   He managed to help elevate a bad TB team to a NFC championship appearance.  He won a superbowl.     Ironically, if you want to look at racism at the QB position, Doug Williams is probably a better example because he was screwed by Culverhouse in contract negotiations, and went to the USFL for 3 years.   If those 3 years were in the NFL, he might be in the HoF today.   Now I'm not going to say that was because he was black, because there were more problems with the Bucs when his career in Tampa came to an end, but if we're just inferring racism, there's a lot of places there it could be inferred. 

Personally, I think both these guys endured things they should not have had to.   But the narrative that Moon wasn't drafted solely because he was black is not accurate.   He wasn't drafted because he was already signed with the CFL, and he didn't have an amazing college career.  Had he thrown for 2500 yards in 1977, no doubt he'd have been a first or second rounder.

5283,31696,31696,CoopNine,"Scouting was also so different in 1978 than it is today.   Today just about every college game has easily accessible film, stats are updated and easily accessed after a game.  Then, even the top teams had maybe a couple games that got televised.   There was no sports center to show highlights, and most of the time that great performance was only really seen by the fans in the stands.  You couldn't travel as effortlessly across the country as you can today, and teams had real budgets because they weren't the billion dollar organizations they are today.

What happened with Moon was he would have been a later round pick, which wasn't really out of line with what he did in college.  So instead he  decided to sign with Edmonton, before the NFL draft, he was essentially off the table.   When he decided to move to the NFL, there were a lot of teams interested.   

Has there historically been racism in sports?  Yes absolutely.   Has there been some specific racism around the QB position, yes, I think that also is pretty clear.    Was that why Moon went undrafted?  No, it was because he already was signed with a CFL team.  

Why would he go to the CFL though, they make nothing compared to NFL players, right?   They made less back then too, but NFL salaries have ballooned, then, they were much closer than today.   Moon made more than some NFL quarterbacks did when he was in Edmonton.

Often described as having combined the endearing features of ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"" and production quality of ""Saved by the Bell,"" the show followed a young high school student who was uprooted from his home in New York City and trying to fit in with numerous cliques in his new school in Painters Beach (fictional) California.

Brady winning here pretty much cements him as being the best QB ever, because he proved it wasn't just Bill making things work.  (although it really should have been 28-3) that did that.   Yeah, the Bucs were better than they were the year before agnostic of Brady, but not  too much, the biggest piece was replacing a QB who was a liability with one who is amazing. Gronk was a huge addition, Lenny was a huge addition, even fucking AB was a nice addition.  But Brady was the difference.   Bill also has to overcome his history of being pretty bad elsewhere, while we aren't going to worry about Brady's struggles to be a starter in college.   I think what the Pats did with Mac Jones this year was outstanding as an outsider to that org, but really Belichick has never really been successful yet without Brady, but this isn't necessarily a checkmark against him, their two careers just coincided.

Lynch in my opinion was more a player who defined his position during his era than Rhonde was.   Both were amazing, both are among the greatest to play at their position, but Lynch was that iconic player at safety.   When I think of a great safety I think of Lynch or Lott.

At CB I do have a longer list, and while Rhonde sits near the top of mine, it's not as clear cut as I feel Lynch is.  I mean Rhonde was good, but he didn't even have a neat nickname, no neon night trains in sight.

As it sits right now, If the Vikings were to trade him the team on the receiving end would be on the hook for his 35M salary, and the Vikings take a 10M hit in dead money.   Cousins is not worth that.   The best the Vikings can do is restructure and extend him to make him appealing to someone else for future years, and maybe get something for him before he hits FA, but dealing him for next year would likely still cause them to have to take a significant hit.

Listen, I understand the NFL is a business, and there has to be a serious evaluation of someone who is a bag of shit, and that shittiness vs the value they bring on the field, up until the point both the owners and players union can get on the same page saying a person of a certain character cannot be employed.  (It would be brilliant of the owners and NFL admin to put this in the hands of the players' union BTW, as well as being a huge cop-out--although the legality might be questionable)   I think us signing Watson would suck, but am I going to stop paying attention to guys I love like LVD, Evans, Godwin (he's coming back), MF'n Cam Brate, etc because of it?

0:14 it's dumb.   You might have a couple chances at the endzone there, just throwing from the spot.   Targetting the sideline would usually get you three outcomes, gain with clock stoppage, incomplete, or an int.   Worst (or second worst actually) case scenario is what you had here, where the team is scrambling to get a spike.   

Let's be real, their hope was that Dak would have a lane to the endzone.  That's why he didn't have a early slide.   They know he wasn't reliable throwing the ball last night, they felt like this was their best option.  Fucking own it, like Harbaugh does, when he acknowledges his team isn't capable of winning in overtime. Everyone had to know it was a huge risk, and if the players were not understanding the rule that they can't sandlot spot their own ball, that falls entirely on the team, including the coaches.  

I love that the officiating crew came back and have said 'well, accc-tuuuually,' if you would have run a play instead of spiking it, we would have counted it.

I'm glad it didn't go there, because it was a bad spot, and at that point the 49'rs would have had a real beef.

Guy is an amazing athlete, but also a huge risk on whether he'll work long term in the NFL.   Dolphins would be wise to not fall into the Taysom Hill trap (or a number of others) where they end up hoping he's the guy but end up having to try and rely on a sub-par QB until that might-maybe-someday-they-hope day comes.  

Flores is a good head coach, he did a lot with quite a little.   If the scuttlebutt is true and he got canned because of Tua, the Dolphins are dancing a rather dangerous dance.   I get when the Broncos fired Reeves because Elway was tired of him, but Tua isn't Elway at this point in his career, and that's a really high bar, that I just don't think Tua is capable of reaching given what I've seen.  

You have to be really sure when you fire a coach based on a player's opinion.   I don't think Ross is competent enough in evaluating anything in football to make better than a 50/50 decision.  I don't think this was a 50/50 decision, because I think Flores was better at his job than Tua.

If injury really was the issue, he had 8 weeks to figure out what the plan was.   If it's too bad to play through, get your surgery and go on IR.  Maybe if he had done that after the injury, he'd have been back already.   But he was trying to get ready to play before his suspension, and the team held him out.   Then he gets suspended for doing something stupid, and is too dumb to figure out how to fix the problem.   

He probably goes to Brady and says you gotta get me the ball, and Brady says something along the lines of, I'll do what I can, but you know how it is.  This pisses him off, and he decides to take out out on AG, who really is Brady's BFF, and gets a WTF??! from Brady.  

Too bad, because I thought maybe he had turned a corner.   The Vax card was stupid, but was something he could have managed, and in the grand scheme of things not a big deal.   No one is calling for Mike Edwards to be cut, nor is the NFL seemingly interested in looking at any other team for this, and I would be really surprised if these few cases were the only instances in the NFL.  His prior shit was the nasty deplorable stuff.  Some of those things should be the intolerable stuff.   Presenting a fake vaccine card, shit, that ain't nothing.  And the dipshit could have corrected it after he got vaccinated, just by saying look, I was really scared about nano-bots and the stuff whack-jobs like Aaron Rodgers were talking about, and I did my research, found it was safe, and got my vaccine like a good boy, he's the real proof.  I profusely apologize for my initial reaction.

With all this garbage, I could still see him landing with GB, LA, KC, or the aints, who can backdoor into the playoffs.  I don't blame the team that ends up picking him up, because that's how it goes, if you've got talent, you'll play.

I was at the Colts game, and talking to a couple guys from Tampa before the game, and I understand their frustration with a lot of the bandwagon.   People who are just fans of Brady can be frustrating.   We have a great team around him, and between Brady, what he brought with Gronk, and ... I guess... AB, and the existing team we won a superbowl.   But Brady couldn't have done that with the lions, and honestly, I don't think he does it with even a pretty good team like SF last year.   He needed a situation where he had a ridiculous number of great receivers, and a defense that was able to keep opponents in check.  We've had a great core here in TB for a while, but prior to Brady we had a QB who punished the team with his mistakes.   We were a good situation for him, and he was a good situation for us.   I don't think this works everywhere for Brady, just like I don't think if the Bucs were able to land Herbert it would have ended in a superbowl.   

Then I watched that game in Indy.  Brady slept through the first half.   He made mistakes that could have cost us the game, But he's Tom Brady, and the Tampa fans understood that, he can also fix these mistakes.   I think the Tampa fans understand and appreciate what TB brings to the team, but a lot of the bandwagon fans think it's all about TB, and it's not.   The Bucs were a solid team before, and made better with Brady, Gronk, AB.   

A lot of tampa fans are hard core college fans as well, and they're thoroughly cemented in SEC and ACC territory.  Devin White will always be better in their minds than LVD, even if he isn't.   Before that it was Kwon... and that's OK.   

Bandwagon fans are a pain, because they know, and the franchise fan knows, they're only here for the ride, so it's silly to say, don't be mean to us.

Going from 90 to 91% isn't valuable though.   Especially when there's other risks in play.   Main thing is, when you're in control of a game you have to think about the next games too, that could be a play a crucial player gets injured.  There's so many things that statistics like this aren't taking into account.   Calling it better decision making is disingenuous.  This is one  dimensional decision making.  A head  coach in the NFL also has  to take into account the rest of the season.   Is this a game they *need* to win.   Even if the reward is  a higher  chance to win, IF you already have a high chance to win, is even a small risk worth it?  When is the decision made?   A risk in the first quarter is blatantly different than the 3rd or 4th.   Likewise a risk in the last  quarter of the season when you're trying to secure a seed or playoff spot  is more important than  early on.  

Point is, this graphic says virtually nothing of value.  Flip it on it's side and you can make it say something completely different, and that's the beauty and evil of statistics.  You've got the two teams second  from  the edges with  the  same record.  Only a fool  would say that Stefanski is a better coach or makes better decisions than Belichick at  opposite ends  of the graphic.  Best  record in the NFL is in the middle, surrounded by... mediocre teams.     

I personally think the conservative vs. aggressive argument is more pertinent  to defensive play calling than offensive.   When I have a major gripe it's much more often about soft defenses  giving up chunk plays rather than sticking to  what got them there.  But that's a lot harder to make a pretty bar chart about. 

A solely statistics based approach assumes everything is equal, and outliers don't exist.   Statistics say Brady should be done (objectively false).  The key to using statistics to your advantage is determining when they are valuable and when they are  not.   There's a lot of nuance here, and  simply following  what the stats say you should  do pulls you more  towards  the center.   If you realize you are an outlier, or more accurately a successful outlier, changing tactics to  rely on average statistics  is quite likely a  folly.",3.0,buccaneers,t3_qbzp0s,False,1.0,:buccobrucewhite: ,2021-10-20T16:36:00Z,buccaneers,0.0248559963558358

That data point is diminishing returns and your starting chance to win at the point of the decision.

Conversely if you're at a 10% chance to win, you have no choice but to be aggressive, not risking it,  probably won't get no biscuit, but WTH. Statistics assume past performance on a broad level influence future performance on a discrete level, which is an incorrect assumption.  

Often times you can be more successful when others are using statistics for their main decision making, to try to be an outlier.

Now am I saying that this staff is a bunch of geniuses and playing a game with the  gamers?  Nah.   But this type of analysis  is pretty worthless  when you look at facts as well.   The majority of the teams  with 'better decision making' have worse records than the Bucs.

5496,32170,32170,Coral_Polyps,"So actually I have some experience with this. About 4 years ago I was working the night shift at a hospital when a family brought their 6 year old son into the emergency room and he was immediately brought to the ICU. The family says that they had a tire swing in their backyard and the rope had snapped, causing him yo flip upside-down and land on his head.

He was in the ICU for 7 or 8 hours I believe, and luckily they were able to stabilize him and his family were then allowed to see him. They eventually moved him up to a private room where the boy and his family could get some privacy while the doctors figured out the best way for him to recover. 

It was probably about 3 days later when the boy finally spoke up and told a nurse that he hadn't been able to sleep that night, or any night since arriving at the hospital. The doctors worried that maybe he had been bleeding internally in his skull, and the pressure of the now-coagulating blood might be the cause of his restlessness. 

They did the whole 9 yards with MRIs/CAT scans but nothing turned up. Other than a small fracture on the underside of his jaw, he looked perfectly normal. 

Worried that the lack of sleep would soon begin to negatively impact the boy's organs and cognitive abilities, they prescribed some pretty heavy doses of sleeping medication, but 24 hours later nothing had changed.

As it turns out, Tom Brady, 7 times superbowl champion quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (At the time Patriots) was visiting the hospital- I believe- for a 'Make a wish event that was happening in another wing of the building.

Well, apparently word made it's way to Tom about the boy's struggle to sleep and he was very adamant about seeing the boy as soon as possible. The boy was ecstatic to meet Tom and told him about how he always played as him in Madden. They chatted for a few minutes and then Tom suggested a treatment for his current condition.

I wasn't in the room at this point, but I was just a few meters away at the nurse's station. Tom suggested to the boy, and his family, that he sing a lullaby to put the child to sleep. It seemed a bit silly, but it was Tom Brady and even though it likely wouldn't work, it would still be enjoyable. So they all agreed and Tom began to sing... _""Lullaby..... and good night...""_

Only 30 seconds later one of the heart rate monitors at my nurse's station began beeping erratically and flashing red, indicating an extremely low heart rate. The boy's heart rate had dropped to 36 bpm. I rushed into the room to see what was happening, and was mortified by what I saw.

The boy, his father, mother, little sister, and 4 of the 5 doctors in the room at the time were all comatose. His song had worked so well they all were sent- not just to sleep- but into a literal coma. The 5th doctor had locked herself in the bathroom and was screaming ""La La La La"" to try and block out Tom Brady's voice. When I entered Tom was fiddling with the door handle to the bathroom, not even trying to open it, but rather just to make it rattle. He was gently saying, ""It's nappy time little one,"" through the door when he turned to me and made eye contact. 

He paused for a brief moment, still maintaining eye contact, and then he gently started again, ""Lullaby..."" and I immediately sprinted out of the room, and explained the situation to security.

When they arrived, Tom was nowhere to be found, nor were there any records indicating that he would have ever been there that day. Make A Wish told us he never participated in an event that month, and the Patriots front office told us he was at practice on the date and time I told them.

More to the point about his voice, him simply singing ""Lullably"" was the most gentle, warm, and calming thing I have ever heard on this planet. Even now, I yawn insistently day in and day out because of it. I believe if I hadn't escaped when I did, I too would have been put into such a deep sleep I wouldn't have woken up.

The boy and his family? They haven't woken up these past 4 years, but every year on the anniversary of the incident, they get anonymous flowers sent to their room with a card that says, ""My name is Tom Brady, 7 time superbowl champion and quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and you can catch me on _The Masked Singer_ weekdays at 8, 7 central only on Fox""",110.0,nfl,t3_wsffcg,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers,2022-08-19T11:27:31Z,buccaneers,0.0226333539514355

Brady to the Colts from that timeframe is a fun hypothetical, like Peyton or Rodgers to NE.

Add an elite offensive talent.  Have him for 4-5 years of cheap contract.  Can be an immediate contributor, which is important in all of Tom's remaining years, as they each might be his last.

Our defense was bad last year because of injuries.  I think we were missing 3 members of the secondary on a regular basis.  We shore up the depth chart and add Ryan's replacement.

Phidarian, Phiddy, Mathis is 3 Tech out of Alabama.  While there's still going to be a learning curve in the NFL, he's as pro-ready as they come.  Whether we re-sign Suh or not, Phiddy will add a talented body to a unit that needs one to help it over the course of 20-21 games.

* R4 P133 - IDL - John Ridgeway

Ridgeway offers us the chance to get Vita Vea a backup and be more versatile with our fronts.  Vita plays in ~50-60% of snaps these days, which allows us to rest him for the plays he's needed, but it does leave a sizeable hole in the roster when he rests.

There's not a whole lot we can use pick 248 on that's going to be 'sure-fire', but we're thin at RB currently, this guy has excellent return skills, and he's elusive AF.  He has a path to the team through special teams, but a truly dangerous underneath threat is a piece missing from the offense.

My first ever game in Tampa, Bucs vs Broncos in 04, we got pretty cheap tickets in front row of the endzone.  Now, we could have absolutely paid less to be up higher, but I rarely get out to see a game and, when I do, the cost of the tickets are often not the most expensive part of the trip.  This year, given our SB championship, Brady, and the lack of attendance last year, this advice may not be helpful.

Lodging: If you're an out of towner, particularly an out of towner from up north with no beaches and cold winters, I strongly encourage you to get a hotel on St. Pete beach and demand a west-facing room.  Every time I've visited the area, I've been able to watch dolphins hop in the sea from my window, I've seen glorious sunsets that will look amazing on your socials, and I've had great food/drinks/music minutes away from where I'm staying.

If you go later in the season, as the weather starts to chill, the manatees will hang out in inland waterways, which is the best way to experience them.  I enjoy some quiet time, nature time on Friday/Saturday if I'm going to spend my Sunday getting hammered and losing my voice.

""Why, if the energy source centers around a hue, as the rainbow centers around green, surely there's no coincidence that the ancient form of life that sucks up solar energy is also the same color,"" I mused. 

In time, I would come to meander over the possibilities of what this might mean elsewhere. Are plants blue around blue stars? Would life evolve to perceive blue as the center, giving rise to a conscious experience of what we might consider green? If not, what the fuck is the qualia of their new color like? Also, if my intuition is correct and photosynthesis' color around a given star is determined by the star's emission spectrum, can we use telescopes to find planets that reflect the light of their host star?

The league usually puts on a good matchup everyone can get pumped about for opening day, so I'd say that Panthers, Saints, Falcons, Cowboys, and Giants matchups would be a pretty heavily favored game.  The Bears are an option, but they're not rolling out Fields on opening day, so they probably won't showcase Dalton.

So, logically, Bucs vs Bills makes the most sense, it'll let the announcers yell over and over that Tom vs Bill is coming up, it's a competitive matchup between two teams contending for the championship, and both teams should be ready to go week 1.

* In the run game, he rarely penetrated into the backfield to blow up the play, but you also don't see big runs into his gaps, and you do see a lot of big runs.
* In the pass coverage game, he actually drops into coverage a lot, which makes me think this is a big reason he was picked.  Being able to be versatile with our chess pieces makes the defense dangerous.  Again, while we don't see amazing coverage skills, we see enough to thwart passes from his area.
* In the pass rush game, he generates a few pressures which force throws, but doesn't get home.  With a stellar line and a mobile QB, this isn't surprising.  Tryon appeared to generate the most pressure for a team that got 0 sacks on the day.

Again, I think he's capable of lining up on the outside in odd or even fronts, can cover well, and will be an excellent player to put on the field when JPP and Shaq need to rest.  Getting Tryon at 100% energy for 10-30% of snaps while the starters rest will help to exhaust blockers faster.

Politics is muddy.  I am not vilifying the woman, but I think she is ill-suited to have power delegated to her.

I don't know the timeline of events as far as what she knew when and how far back her father had issues, but she hired her father to help her campaign, she didn't just ""get support from her parent"".  Again, a father that was accused of kidnapping and raping a 10 year-old.  That shows poor judgment.  Which is fine, lots of people show poor judgment and learn and grow and move on.  But, in this case, she sought a different avenue for power, one with a much larger platform, and one where blindness to pedophilia can also have large consequences.  

> So 1: you're asking that every single trans person act with the same level of decorum, whit and composure as the president of the United States! So they can play 4D chess politics and manipulate bigots into acceptance overtime (by allowing them to destroy the lives of trans people left and right, offering them up as sacrifices to the mob).

I'd start with the ones who want to run for elected office.  And while I don't think we should all be expected to practice Obama's decorum, we can all chase the Dream of hope and an end to divisiveness.  Falsely shouting transphobia engenders division, it doesn't heal it.

> And 2: you're advocating for this to mimic a strategy that failed spectacularly. Trump was the ringleader of the racists against Obama and he went onto become the future for the Republican party and the 45th president of the United States...

There's a lot to unpack here that I don't think is possible while staying within the subs rules, but I would again remind you I'm only advocating that known pedophile apologists should not be placed in positions of power and trust.

I won't continue this discussion any further, Reddit has decided and I feel as if I have laid out my beliefs fairly and clearly, even if they may not be being responded to as such.  

I will leave on a note that the struggle for the future is long and slow.  ~150 years ago, you weren't even a person if you were black.  ~100 years ago, you couldn't vote if you were a woman.  ~50 years ago, you were a second class citizen everywhere you went if you didn't have the right skin color.

While it feels like the country and the world has never been so divided, the reality is that we are closer to seeing Gandhi and Mandela and MLK's Dreams realized now than ever before, but we live in a time of instant communication with almost anyone on the planet, which can make divisions apparent.  In 50 years, we will not look back and say ""we used to live in a dystopia but we've finally achieved utopia"", but we will have a world which can look back and see us healing wounds that will be bettered in the future.

10341,68410,68410,JennMartia,"To me, what grinds my gears is that she seeks a position of power and trust given her blindness to her situation. As you pointed out, Aimee has no accusations of wrongdoing against her directly, but she is blinded by her upbringing if she is repeatedly willing to dance around the pedophile landmine. If she weren't a public figure and leader, I would absolutely be disappointed in everyone attacking her, but she chose her path. She knew there would be incredible scrutiny, and she chose what she chose.

And yes, there has been an incredible amount of transphobia here, phobia and hate rears its ugliest head when the target is easy, but it is so bad for the community to ring that bell when the public is at you for pedophilia topics. I recently finished Obama's memoir (no politics) and in it you hear the words of a, frankly brilliant, mind tortured by when to point out that race was a factor in how situations went down and how they were covered. You hear him lament the times when pointing out accuracies in society hurt him and created more racial wounds. You hear a soul learn things about how to play that card. While he obviously isn't trans and wasn't talking about these issues, the lessons we can learn from him would indicate that it's almost never a good idea to play the transphobia defense, just like few public situations are improved after playing the race card.

Lastly, it's easy to get lost in this, and other people are taking their arguments to some pretty inappropriate places, but please don't accuse me of things I didn't say and don't feel. I don't feel she should disown her father, I think love heals wounds better than shunning, but I also don't think politicians should hire child rapists, regardless of their blood status. I don't believe she is a pedophile nor do I believe she is seeking to empower a pedophile agenda, but blindness is often as dangerous, is this is a pretty unfortunate unknown unknown to have as a leader.

[Javon Hagan](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HagaJa00.htm) has never played in a game.  Projecting him to the practice squad is reasonable.

[Cam Gill](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GillCa00/gamelog/2020/) is a special teams contributor and is likely to find a home on the roster.  I've added him.

[Khalil Davis](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DaviKh00/gamelog/2020/) is a rookie sixth round pick, and statistically most sixth rounders don't end up on their drafting team's roster in year 2.  That's especially true of players who never really broke into the lineup.  He is more likely than some, but he should consider his roster spot not-yet-earned.

[John Molchon](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MolcJo00.htm) has never played an NFL snap.  It would be silly to project him to make the roster before FA finishes and the draft happens.

[Jaydon Mickens](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MickJa01/gamelog/2020/) I did goof on, but I mostly just got him mixed up with [Justin Watson](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WatsJu01/gamelog/2020/).  Blame my dyslexia.  Mickens is likely to make the team, but if Watson can't prove more valuable than as a special teamer who doesn't handle returns, he should be seen as an outside roster candidate at best, competing with CB6 for a spot.  I've switched them.

Otherwise, I stand by my yellow blocks.  Several of those blocks are special teams players and can come in the form of OL, DL, LB, WR, RB, CB, or S, so consider the back half flexible.

10360,68445,68445,JennMartia,"I'm not worried about Suh's delay in re-signing.  I believe he is self-represented, which means it is significantly harder for him to skirt around the tampering rules like professional agents can.  I believe a reunion with Suh is in everyone's best interest and will happen.  Suh wasn't re-signed until April last year.

The more I think about it, the more I want Lenny back.  I actually think it makes a lot of sense for him, too, which is a big part of it.  I think he saw the market for him didn't put him at RB1 out there, so he's looking at money under that now.  A 2 year deal in Tampa gives him one year in a committee with RoJo, with a high likelihood of being RB1 next year if we move on from Jones.  I expect us to draft a receiving back or two next month, but that player won't compete with Fournette directly.  Fournette is still 26, so an age 28 free agency after 3 years in a high-powered offense, at a time when the salary cap is ballooning, could be very, very lucrative for him.  This is particularly true given how we won't run him into the ground like he might be elsewhere.

I don't want White.  I think we have too good of an opportunity to acquire younger players who can compete for snaps in the offense.  I think we owe ourselves the chance to hunt for a receiving threat in the draft, assuming Lenny comes back.

Brown can again take an incentive-laden deal while he shows he can navigate an entire NFL off-season, a whole regular season, and the thrill of being SB champs.  The best thing for his long-term earning potential is to show the league he can still contribute, which means at least one more year here.

10383,68477,68477,JennMartia,"So we currently have $12m in free space, but with only 45 players under contract, this number is closer to $8m after accounting for 6 vet minimum contracts.  $8m is about what we need to set aside for draft picks and money to make in-season moves.

So, with the prospect of signing Godwin, Brown, Gronk, Fournette, David, Barrett, Suh, and Succop on the horizon, and $0m in free space to do it, some tradeoffs will need to be made.  Personally, I think we could free up about $30m extending Jensen and Smith through 2023 (which would keep Smith, Jensen and Marpet together through then, in Wirfs' 4 cheap years), trading Howard, and extending Evans through 2025.  We could get some more from restructuring Brady's deal, as well, but I think the only people truly privy to Brady's future in 2022+ (45 year old season+) are Brady and the front office.  At any rate, I don't think that playing with his contract enough to free up space to sign a Godwin/Barrett type player is a wise decision, especially with the 2022 cap also being depressed.  Anyways, the point is that having $30m in spending cash is reasonable going into FA.

Personally, priority #1 is Succop.  He'll cost between $4m and $5m, judging by other kicker contracts.  Lavonte will likely take a hometown discount to stay, as well as some level of reduced year 1 salary to help the team, but he'll get a reasonable paycheck.  Gronkowski wants to play in 2021, Brady wants him to play, and it'll get done, but he's not playing for peanuts.  On a 1 year deal, which is the only reasonable offer for both parties, there's very little wiggle room.  Brown we should get an excellent deal on, I believe, as he still has yet to prove he can maintain himself through an offseason and after a championship, and getting in a full year with Brady is valuable to him.  He could come as cheap as $2-3m for a year.  Suh is still a dominant athlete, a good leader and has incredible durability, missing a total of 2 games in his career.  Guessing at numbers, let's say $4.5m for Succop, $8m for David, $6m for Gronk, $3m for Brown, and $7m for Suh.  That's almost all of our $30m available.  Even if we can squeeze another $10m out of Brady's restructure, there's not enough meat left for Godwin or Barrett.  Assuming my made up numbers are close, Godwin would cost us Gronk + Brown + Suh, and I know which one I'd rather have.  I think Fournette could have a home here, but I think now is the best time for him to get paid, so he'll test the market.

Letting Barrett and Godwin walk gives us two third round comp picks in 2022, too, assuming we offset our other free agent moves.  As a fan of both players, we'd be letting Godwin walk into a FA market where he's the clear WR1 on the market and multiple teams that are a WR away from deep playoff runs (Indy, Miami, Baltimore), and he hasn't yet had a chance to cash in on significantly overperforming his rookie contract.  Barrett's best place for production is in Tampa, I believe, but he's got a chance to sell high and bet on himself, a chance that won't come along again, and he should take it, IMO.

I don't think Godwin leaving leaves us a huge hole at WR, as Evans, Brown, Miller and Johnson is a solid WR depth chart, especially with Gronk and Brate at TE.  Similarly, if the only defensive piece that walks is Barrett, I think we can replace him with 2 draft picks in the first 2 days and still have a defense that's capable of winning a championship.

It is disappointing that we could have kept the entire band together in a normal offseason with $30m more cap space available, but c'est la vie.",3.0,buccaneers,t3_lxjxqm,False,0.0,:JennMartia: ,2021-03-04T13:54:39Z,buccaneers,-0.0092100419017298

13721,95849,95849,NotWilll,"1.) You’re saying the people he’s playing with and against are unlikely to make their teams on both sides, so that again isn’t enough. When he was playing with the second team in the first half we saw him under throw miller, dink and dunk down the field, and hand off the ball as much as physically possible. 

2.) You’re right preseason games do mean nothing. Last year we all thought Chase was a bust because he couldn’t catch the ball. Defenses in the preseason run basic schemes to not give anything away for the season and offenses run basic schemes as well. So trask beating them even with his 3rd team o line doesn’t get me anywhere close to seeing QB1 because the disparity in scheme and talent from where he’s playing now and in an actual nfl game is so large

3.) I don’t think ronde is stupid and knows nothing about football. I do think he is paid by the team to commentate and wants to hype up fans for players, especially one coming from UF. As well QBs are award winners by nature of the position (see Brady winning sb mvp over James white) and trask played longer than anyone else, giving him the most stats (still only 1 td btw).

Management has to have a continued long term competitive outlook otherwise you have these long cycles of drought in between the few years of success. Sometimes that means managing the cap by having a guy like Trask start at QB, see what he can do for a year or two until all this dead money comes off the cap. 

Starting a young unknown QB doesn't mean giving up either.  We can't afford Wilson, or Rodgers, or any 20 million or up QB if we want to keep any kind of talent on the roster. 

If Trask can put it together, we have a huge advantage as a franchise in having a guy who has 3 more years on his rookie deal which allows all the cap debt to dematerialize and get better. 

It also allows us to bring first and second round talent in over the next two years, the cost of trading for a franchise piece. Licht has most of his draft hits in the first 100 picks so it would not only cripple us cap wise, but for future prospects as well.

&#x200B;

Also time of possession doesn't necessarily mean your team had the ball for more time than the opponent, it just means you used more game clock.  I could throw two incomplete passes, meanwhile running out the clock to one second on the play clock before each play, then get a first down on third and ten and use up more real world time than a team that ran the ball three times to get a first down but snapped the ball with 20 seconds left on the play clock.  

&#x200B;

That second part is in reference to a team having a higher time of possession as it relates to keeping the defense fresh.

18346,125721,125721,TheChrisDez,"Hey there- 

My mother was diagnosed with pancreatic earlier this year. She was complaining of pain in her stomach for a while, and eventually the Drs did some digging, and found the cancer. Super rare for them to find anything with her showing almost no signs. They were pretty positive going forward. The decision to do chemo for 6 weeks to try and destroy the cancerous spot wasn’t my favorite move- as it grew a few CM bigger, but that wasn’t my call. It did end up being the right move, and she has been deemed cancer free at the time. 

It was definitely a whirlwind of emotions. Obviously fear, anger, at peace with it, fear, sadness. All of it coming and going. Hope is hope. You shouldn’t look at it as false hope although I understand it. The biggest thing I can offer you and your family: be open minded. Remember that it’s her body. You need to see that it’s her going through this and not everybody else. Give space, offer help. But try not to step the boundaries. Call her on the regular. Maybe once a week? I ended up calling with my mom every Friday on the way from the gym to work. That’s stayed the same after the fact too- just to let her know  thinking of her, and it does more for me than I’m sure it does for her. 

Hope this can help you. Best of luck for your Mother, and the family. Sending you my thoughts and well wishes!",4.0,buccaneers,t3_nko0m5,False,0.0,Grape Powerade,2021-05-25T09:38:45Z,buccaneers,0.0214601162805394

19984,128948,128948,TheRencingCoach,">	Did we get stronger at any position groups

Imo - stronger and weaker are simplistic ways of framing this. There are trade offs to how teams and position groups are constructed and we, as fans, should try and think about those!

Let’s take WRs for example:

-	Depth: more proven
-	Investment - Salary hit: much higher, thanks to signing Godwin, Gage, and Julio Jones (last one still feels weird to say). Salary hit here is a multi year impact
-	Investment - draft picks: none (*because* we prioritized proven depth)
-	Scheme fit: Gage and Julio are probably gonna fit in pretty well
-	Injury concerns: many, especially with all of our WRs either being injured (Godwin), injury prone (Evans, Julio, Godwin), and another year older (meaning, chance of injury is higher)

Overall, is this group stronger than last year? Hopefully - at the cost of many salary cap $$ and an older group of players which may get injured more easily.  

Anyway, that being said this is my overly simplified breakdown:

Stronger:
-	WR - hopefully
-	RB - guessing that replacing RoJo with White is an upgrade
-	iDL - assuming that Hicks stays healthy and Hall is worth a second round pick

Same:
-	QB
-	OT
-	EDGE/OLB - JPP was mostly injured so his loss will be felt more in the locker room than on the field. 
-	ILB
-	CB - same guys, we’re just paying Davis waaay more. Let’s see how the depth looks with McCollum. Improvements at S should help mitigate any depth issues here
-	S - loss of Whitehead hurts because he was proven and cheap. We don’t know if Neal will be able to be healthy and provide the same level of play. We don’t know if Logan Ryan has lost a step - hopefully the combination of those two will help our secondary as a whole. This is one more place where we went with proven experience and paid money for it instead of using draft picks. 
-	P - used a draft pick to save some salary cap $$ and hopefully get play that’s just as good. Let’s see
-	K - same guy, just older. 
-	LS - is this still Triner? Assuming it’s the same lol 

Weaker:
-	TE - no Gronk and 2 rookies at a position which is hard to translate to the NFL 
-	iOL - last year we had proven experience, this group *may* be better, but they’re unproven",5.0,buccaneers,t3_x6eg31,False,0.0,:winfieldPeace: Winfield Jr. ✌️,2022-09-05T10:57:12Z,buccaneers,0.001625969133117

And a small nitpick on what you said: I think the roster battle right now is one of ability+contract, not potential…. If they had the spots, they’d keep everyone…. Instead, it could make sense to move on from 400 yards earlier instead of later. 

Like if you’re deciding between Darden and Miller, Miller will be a FA at the end of the season, while Darden will have 2 years left. If you cut Miller today and you can try to replace his 400yards with Darden’s for the next 3 seasons (this plus 2 more). If you cut Darden today, you’d still have to do something about Scotty at the end of the season *and* you don’t have Darden to step up into his place.

Okay fine - let's do this. Winfield is elite. He shouldn't be covering the triple crown as a safety. We need a veteran corner even if its a high end slot corner.

Our secondary, other than our Oline and receivers (due to injuries) were why we lost the game and imo are the clearest offseason need along with trench depth.

So since trench depth can develop (and corners, to me, being less surefire to make an immediate impact).. I think we need to prioritize paying for secondary (read CORNER) help.

That was my point.. not trying to shit on Winfield. Bowles was using what he had and it wasn't enough.

We need a veteran (at least slot) corner because we shouldn’t have a safety covering the triple crown. Even Jason Verrett would have been better there if we need a slot god vs. a safety.

White is not as good when LVD isn’t there. Sack Barrett was manhandled. 

Our secondary is decent but we don’t have an elite player back there and with AB, Brate and a few others falling off payroll we have to stop assuming we can draft depth a star corner. Even Surtain had some bad games. 

I remember in the draft talks we looked heavily at Greg Newsome who looked awesome for Cleveland who sniped him in front of us but ultimately we can’t rely on a rookie to win big games against a Kupp or Davante Adams.

28283,169619,169619,j4ni,"Well, short answer: yes.     

Long‘ish one: while losing weight (or rather bodyfat , since we don’t want to loose muscle) is the result of the simple equation energy input vs. energy used, alcohol a) reduces the amount of fat the body burns as it is dismantled into an acetic acid in the liver the body sees as a poisonous substance and hence tries to get rid of it as fast as possible thus burning it before using fat but more importantly b) consuming alcohol will very likely lead to consuming more calories than planned as you’ve got less control over yourself and will probably get snacky especially in a social setting.

If you know you’re going out and have some drinks, limit yourself to a certain amount of alcoholic beverages, make sure you have some healthy and not too calorie-dense snacks at hand and try to make some room for the extra calories by eating less calories throughout the day. (Which makes it even more important to set yourself a reasonable limit as you might get intoxicated earlier due to lesser food being consumed).

She was one of (or the first) to bring all that forensic stuff into the center of crime fiction attention. Funny enough, she shares a lot of similarities with her main character and often times uses a handful of different real cases as influences of her stories. I buy them as used books for cheap. I got gifted one of the more recent ones and liked it so I went back to the first one and read all of them chronologically. But I’m not done yet. Might be a really good one as an audible I guess. 

I don’t like doing cardio so I got my bike out as well a few weeks ago and I feel your pain.   

Omelettes are mighty fine too. I usually just put the eggs in a bowl, mix em with a fork and then pour it into a non-sticking pan. Let one side steady (probably the wrong term here, sorry German and all...) and then  turn it over. Done. Super simple, super tasty. When I still used to eat meat, I put a slice or two of gammon on the top before I turned the egg over and topped it with cheese after the turn. Put a lid on it, let it melt. Enjoy.

I started stranger things but I’m not sure yet if I like it or not, also I’m doing Archer as well as modern family. But binge watching meaning one or two episodes at the weekends (lol); I’m binge reading all of Kathy Reichs novels rn....    

No big plans, super happy that we get the opportunity to “rent” our gym once or twice a week (depending on demand) for 50 minutes. Everything else isn’t allowed Covid-wise.    

Best breakfast food? My everyday breakfast is 70grams of oats, 300 ml chocolate whey shake with milk and two big hands full of blueberries. I leave it soaking for three to four hours but have the rest of the shake straight away with my multivitamins. I prepare it at 6am and usually have it at 9:30ish. Love it. (And Ive been eating that 5 days a week for years now...)
On the weekends I have “normal”ish breakfast with the wife and kids! 

If you’re productive on Sunday, that’s your Monday! I’d go for Saturday being productive (that’s our chores day)...

You literally said he was “just fortunate enough to play on the Bucs when their defense was loaded.” That’s the part I disagree with. 

Simeon Rice proved he could hold his own without a loaded defense before he got to the Bucs.

Tbh Simeon Rice had a better career than Gerald McCoy, and in my opinion Gerald is kind of overrated (and I like Gerald McCoy). I don’t believe he was as dominant as Simeon Rice while he was a Buc.

Testaverde now sits at #15 all time in passing yards and #16 all time in passing touchdowns. He has 7 seasons that are better than his best season with Belichick

15. The Patriots offensive coordinator Charlie Weis from 2000-2004, produced 3 top 10 scoring offenses in 4 seasons with Brady as his starting quarterback. Without Brady, he has only produced 1 top 10 scoring offense in 5 seasons

16. Josh McDaniels who was the Patriots offensive coordinator from 2006-2008, and then from 2012-2019, has had a top 10 scoring offense every single year Brady has been his starting quarterback.

With that said, not calling in and not showing up to work once, I could almost see as grounds for dismissal alone.  Obviously give the worker the opportunity to explain, in case it was a legitimate thing like a family emergency, which if so, I wouldn't count any points at all.

Same with being over 4 hours late.  What if you call in and say you'll be late?  If they allow for that, and not hit you with a half point, that's fine.

Here are their touch numbers under 27, including playoffs, which my original numbers did not.

* 2017 (26) = 17
* 2018 (27) = 308 **Included this entire season even though he was only 26 for part of it**

31481,190333,190333,nutramoil,"What do you not understand?

I understand perfectly fine.  I understand this is arguably the worst betting advice I have ever seen in my life.

Let me explain it to you, again, this is using even money odds.  Meaning no matter what team you bet on, you only need to be $1 to win $1.  No point in complicating things with odds or the Money Line, which makes this so much worse in your scenario anyway.

All starting balances are $4, so you can bet $1 per game if your team makes it to the Super Bowl.

**Your team loses in the Wild Card round (Best case $ scenario)**



 | Balance | Team Results
---|---|----
Start | 4| 
Win WC Bet | (+1) 5 | Your team loses the WC
Net | +1 | You come out $1 ahead



**Your team wins the Super Bowl (Worst case $ scenario)**


 | Balance | Team Results
---|---|----
Start | 4| 
Lose WC Bet | (-1) 3 | Your team wins the WC
Lose DIV Bet | (-1) 2 | Your team wins the DIV
Lose CC Bet | (-1) 1 | Your team wins the CC
Lose SB Bet | (-1) 0 | Your team wins the SB
Net | -4 | You come out $4 in the hole


**You team loses in the DIV round**

 | Balance | Team Results
---|---|----
Start | 4| 
Lose WC Bet | (-1) 3 | Your team wins the WC
Win DIV Bet | (+1) 2 | Your team loses the DIV
Net | 0 | You break even.


**You team loses in the CC round**

 | Balance | Team Results
---|---|----
Start | 4| 
Lose WC Bet | (-1) 3 | Your team wins the WC
Lose DIV Bet | (-1) 2 | Your team wins the DIV
Win CC Bet | (+1) 1 | Your team loses the CC
Net | -1 | You come out $1 in the hole


**You team loses in the Super Bowl**

 | Balance | Team Results
---|---|----
Start | 4| 
Lose WC Bet | (-1) 3 | Your team wins the WC
Lose DIV Bet | (-1) 2 | Your team wins the DIV
Lose CC Bet | (-1) 1 | Your team wins the CC
Win SB Bet | (+1) 0 | Your team loses the SB
Net | -2 | You come out $2 in the hole


So, as you can see, there are only two scenarios where you don't lose money.  

So if you assign a happiness value to either winning money, or your team winning the Super Bowl, that brings it up to a whopping three scenarios of happiness, one of which loses you the most money.

You just gloss over a TON of details.  Is this ATS?  ML?  What are the odds you are getting/giving?

Even if you just assume there is no point spread and each bet was $1, the only way to turn a profit is if your team loses in the first round.  You would break even if they lost in the second round.

If your team goes on to win the Super Bowl, you'll be down $4.

If your team goes on to lose in the Super Bowl, you'll be down $2.

If your team loses in the Championship Game, you'll be down $1.

If your team loses in the Divisional Round, you'll be at even money.

The Eagles play the Cowboys the last week and the 49ers play the Rams the last week.


Now will we face then, that is tricky.

The Saints look to be either the 6 or 7 seed, though if Arizona loses out the Saints could be the 5 seed, but that doesn't seem likely since Arizona plays the Seahawks at home in the last week.

For the Bucs to be the #2 seed, which opens against #7, they need to win out and for the Rams to drop a game.  The Rams finish up with @Baltimore and SF at home.  

For the Bucs to be the #3 seed, they would have to either be tied with the Rams only, or both the Bucs and Dallas lose one game with the Rams winning out.

I feel like the most likely situation is the Bucs getting the 4 seed with the Bucs, Cowboys and Rams all ending up tied and winning out and unless the Cardinals lose out, if the Saints make it, the Bucs wouldn't play the Saints in the first game.  

The Bucs could play the Saints in the second round if the Bucs win, and the Saints were the #6 seed and the #7 seed also won.  Otherwise, if the #2 seed won, the Saints (#6) would go to Green Bay.

So bottom line.  I think if the Bucs get the #4 seed, there is a very small chance they would end up playing New Orleans.  If the Bucs got the #2 or #3, those chances are much higher.

* Cappa (likely get a big payday in FA and we can likely get Stinnie for cheaper and about the same production)
* Whitehead (Love to see him stay, but just feel he'll be the odd man out with so many other guys looking to get paid on defense soon)
* Delaney
* Watson

**Unsure**

*  Fournette (Can see him taking the highest offer, especially if we win a second.  Unless Brady stays one more year, then I could see maybe him taking a cheapish one year deal, but guessing he's looking to get paid.)

Evans: 297 Rec, 4722 Yards, and 43 TDs
Adams: 432 Rec, 5310 Yards, and 47 TDs

While this favors Adams, I think it points to what sets Evans apart, which is his longevity and consistency. If you ask Bucs fans, of course we’ll always put Evans top 5 or even top 3 at any given point in time, but that’s just not the case when you ask NFL fans as a whole. However, looking since 2014, top WRs have come and gone, but there’s no way to argue Evans isn’t 3 or 4. It’s Julio, AB, and then Evans or DHop depending whether you prefer 478 yards or 9 touchdowns.

It’s funny listing out the names at any given time too to see how things have changed. In 2016, it was Julio, AB, and OBJ. In 2019, it was Michael Thomas. In 2020, it was Diggs, Adams, and Tyreek.

The issue is twofold- a lot of times I get anxiety thinking about doing the work because it seems daunting, but it always ends up easier then it seems if I just do it one step at a time.

To sit here and act like there weren’t huge question marks surrounding all of those guys is laughable. 

Brady is obviously the safest of them all, but even now you still have people who will argue we don’t even have a single top 7 WR in that “deepest WR core.” Nobody outside of tampa knew who Scotty Miller was before last year and AB still had plenty of question marks surrounding him. Not to mention all the people who said he’d “break the locker room.” The GOAT TE was coming off retirement, hadn’t put together a full season in years, and looked like a shell of himself the last time we saw him. That great OL was completed when we landed a slam dunk in Wirfs. Cappa was his first season as a starter and Donavon Smith was a liability before last year.

Getting into the defense, don’t act like anybody knew how good they’d be. Hell they weren’t even that good until they all came together and played their best ball when it mattered. Even if all of that was known, it doesn’t matter. We didn’t build our team the way the Rams did. The Rams are going all in at the cost of the future, and it may work out for them, but Tampa didn’t give up much to put the team together.

2. So Andrews isn’t helping Lamar since he’s a top TE in the league? If you would take Lamar over mahomes at this stage of their careers, you’re dumb.  He’s had more success than Lamar.  Sometimes there is that “It” factor that makes a difference.  But yes without a doubt I think Mahomes is the better QB overall.

Gerald McCoy, too friendly for a DT, and tried way too hard to be the next Sapp for us. I feel like he was too confident for someone with zero playoff appearances. Ecstatic about him at first. 

Josh Freeman, had a clutch ability to win come back games in the 4th. But also had an ability to fumble or throw a costly int.
