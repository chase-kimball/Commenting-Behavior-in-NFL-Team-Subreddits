**Edit:** [Kyler and Kliff have deep college ties, to the point where they're stylistically linked](https://www.si.com/nfl/cardinals/news/arizona-cardinals-kyler-murray-kliff-kingsbury-partnership)

Just because Rosen and Murray were both on the cards does not mean they were on the same team. The 2018 Cardinals had Wilks as HC and Fitz+JJ Nelson as WR. Rosen was only on the roster for 2018. The 2019 Cardinals had Kingsbury as HC but the 2020 Cards also had Hopkins + Fitz + Kirk at WR, which is elite. I'm comparing Year 2 here because it's the most important developmental year for QBs. Rosen had no year 2, while Kyler had a familiar coach and elite weapons. Fields is somewhere in between those situations, so clearly worse off than Kyler was.

As for record: most of the QBs I listed had more than one thing on the list of important factors I listed (team success/culture, stable coaching, weapons). You can argue Fields got the team success element in year 1 since we went to the playoffs before drafting him, but it's also fair to say he has 0/3 in year 2, which I reiterate is the most important developmental year for a QB

**c)** also have not paid any attention to recent developmental situations:

* Mahomes: went to 12-4 playoff Chiefs with a great offensive mind, time to sit, and elite weapons

* Deshaun Watson: went to 11-5 playoff Texans who had one of the top 3 receivers in the NFL, plus Will Fuller

* Josh Allen: went to the 9-7 playoff Bills with a great OC

* Lamar Jackson: went to the 10-6 playoff Ravens with a great OC

* Justin Herbert: The chargers made the playoffs at 11-5 two years prior, and had Keenan Allen

* Kyler Murray: Cards had elite talent (Hopkins + Kirk + Fitzgerald) by year 2, plus Kyler's college coach who knew how to scheme for him

* Joe Burrow: the Bengals were a dumpster fire the year prior to drafting him, but they surrounded him with Mixon, Higgins, and Boyd in year 1 and upgraded a great group to an elite one by adding Chase in year 2

Technically, about 50 players per year can be described as having ""first-round grades"" for the purposes of a self-serving argument. Had the Bears selected David Ojabo or Nakobe Dean instead of a receiver, they could at least justify the pick as a player who had gotten top-10 or top-15 notice and was therefore too good to pass up.

>

Look at what the Giants are doing: eating bad contracts on one front, adding top draft talent on the second, hedging their bets with Daniel Jones (without throwing their chips out the window) on the third.

Turned Khalil Mack into a rookie safety, slapped some Band-Aids on the offensive line, and purpose-built the weakest offense in the NFL. Good thing they drafted a punter!

I also get very frustrated when people try to argue we had no resoources. We started the offseason with the [11th most cap space](https://twitter.com/spotrac/status/1474379645105721348), then we [spent the 3rd least](https://overthecap.com/free-agency-spending/), and now we have the [6th most remaining](https://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space/), and the only move we *attempted* to make was to overpay a mid-tier DT. Meanwhile, NOR was $78M in the hole and GB was $50M in the hole, and they both brought back nearly every impact starter (except Davante). Hell, the Saints even signed Honey Badger. Nobody is saying we should've signed Kirk for $21M, but especially with creative use of signing bonuses, incentives, backloading, and void years, we could have easily signed good WR talent, and we chose not to, and then we chose not to draft any either. Folks in the Bears sub keep saying ""we'll do that next year"", without acknowledging that Year 2 is vital for QBs, and if we ruin Justin this year, who cares about all our cap and picks next year.

* Mahomes: went to 12-4 playoff Chiefs with a great offensive mind, time to sit, and elite weapons

* Josh Allen: went to the 10-6 playoff Bills with a great OC

* Lamar Jackson: went to the 10-6 playoff Ravens with a great OC

* Justin Herbert: The chargers made the playoffs at 11-5 two years prior, and had Keenan Allen

* Kyler Murray: Cards had elite talent (Hopkins + Kirk + Fitzgerald) by year 2, plus Kyler's college coach who knew how to scheme for him

* Joe Burrow: the Bengals were a dumpster fire the year prior to drafting him, but they surrounded him with Mixon, Higgins, and Boyd in year 1 and upgraded a great group to an elite one by adding Chase in year 2

*Meanwhile,* better prospects who have gone to worse teams (Trubisky, Darnold, Mayfield, Rosen, Tua) have struggled, and ultimately busted.

4439,12449,12449,Antitypical,"Here's the thing about terrible special teams: it shows mis-prioritization in the 53-man roster cutdown.

It's one thing to get the right starters, but for the backups you need people who are hard workers, love the game, and have chemistry with each other because that's what makes a good special teams unit. You hear coaches talk about it all the time, especially wrt late round draft picks: ""Are they willing to give it their all just to play special teams?"" There are several FO guys who talk about how sometimes you might genuinely pick the worse pure RB/CB/S for that 4th or 5th spot on the depth chart because they're a better, more passionate, more disciplined special teams player.

So when you have a special teams roster that's as bad as Green Bay's was for as many consecutive years as it's been that way, it's partially bad coaching-- that's absolutely an aspect-- but it has a lot to do with many repeated errors selecting which backups make the final cuts as well.

So combine critical missed picks, pissing off Rodgers, letting all their receivers walk (remember when they signed Graham instead of Nelson?), etc, and I think it's fair to say there's a ton of blunders that Rodgers has covered up.

""Eddie Jackson said he's had rookie safety Jaqaun Brisker over to his home this offseason to watch film/answer questions. It's something he offered up to his teammate early on, and Brisker took him up on it immediately. Jackson said the players who did the same for him as a rookie were the likes of Kyle Fuller, Danny Trevathan and Akiem Hicks and when he became a veteran, he decided to pay it forward.

Just when did he feel the need to take on that leadership role?

He was on the show and was always dishing out but was super sensitive whenever he was criticized especially if it was regarding Sam Mustipher who he was training

6496,21882,21882,BiffApotamous,"Offense Overall: C- 

-Monty looked great, feed him the ball, for the love of Ditka.

-What is Nagy’s obsession with bubble screens? I mean I get it, but when the defense knows you never send your speedy guys downfield it doesn’t really do you any good. 

-Why are we putting in Fields on RPOs only? Either commit to getting him play time or let him watch. 

- 7.5 yards per pass attempt? We spent all this money getting speedy weapons and we just aren’t going to send them downfield? 

- The OL run blocking was decent, the pass blocking was shaky but wasn’t as bad as I was anticipating. 

Defense Overall: D

- I get we have a new defense coordinator but this unit looked bad. Missed tackles, poor coverage, little pass rush. It was just not good. 

- The secondary was exploited. Badly. The inexperienced corners really got picked on. There wasn’t much communication and it was very apparent. Plus not tagging Van Jefferson down on that first Rams drive really was lazy. Finish the play. 

-We should not be giving up multiple 3rd and long conversations because our defense couldn’t close in. It was pathetic.

Overall thoughts: We need to bring in some corners/safeties for tryouts or scan the market for trade candidates. I’d personally like a safety to replace Gipson who could help with run support and just let Eddie play the middle of the field. Christian was bad, Our corners besides for Johnson were bad.

6544,22015,22015,BiffApotamous,"Let me give my 2 cents real quick. Can agree or disagree if you want. Forgoing any trade up to get a QB. Bateman is a stud, and if we know we can't retain AR then he offers a similar play style and would be very complimentary to Mooney. Wouldn't hate Newsome here either, with Fuller getting canned having another corner opposite of Johnson is a solid boundary corner would be a good idea for the future. As for addressing the OT position I think someone like Dillion Radunz, Jackson Carmen, or who knows maybe another tackle may fall, I think the tackle position this draft runs deep and we could find some value on day 2. Another interesting take could be trading AR to Baltimore for Orlando Brown. I love AR as much as the rest of the fan base but if we can't find a way to extend him then we may as well get some value back whether it be draft capital or someone like Brown who can be a good piece for our line for years to come.

So two notes from our conversation with @rvfc10 that I don't think were out there. 

1.	Fields was “pissed” about the game plan in Cleveland, his first start. 

2.	Cole Kmet joined Darnell Mooney in Georgia for a few of the workouts with Fields. Veal raved about Mooney.*


I'll add a third. 

The primary objectives of what he said were 15 or 16 private workouts over the offseason were increasing the speed of his drop, increasing the speed of his delivery, and ball security. 

Veal said these were things Fields relayed to him the coaches wanted.",153.0,chibears,t3_tu2173,False,0.0,Moon Me Mooney,2022-04-01T16:29:46Z,chibears,0.000953086419753

Also agreed on why Emery was brought in. That was totally the plan - take our aging D and build an offense to hit the playoffs. But he mortgaged our future in the process and left us with the oldest and least talented team in the league when he left. 

And Shea McClellin was still that bad and a brainless pick at 19. But we agree that Emery is shit.

It’s hard to fault Pace in the situations you bring up: Floyd was the best pass rusher available in the draft and White was supposed to be a no brainer blue chip WR. They thought he was the next Julio. No way of knowing his shins would die on him. We even forget that Pace traded BMarsh for the 5th round pick he used to draft Amos. 

O’Donnell seems fine at a 6th but idk if it’s some great draft play. Hard to be upset with it still.

In the end - I think they should be viewed differently yes. We watched Emery try to compete with an old team and patchwork it together with FAs and it didn’t work. #2 offense still led to a 8-8 season, about as good as an average Pace year here - but without mortgaging and ruining our future.

Pace built a team from the ground up when he was hired. Had 1 great season where everything aligned, then ~.500 the next few seasons.

The Amos year was between paying Bojack and Amos iirc - we chose to let Amos walk because he only forced like 1 turnover his entire 4 year career with us. He then went to the packers and played much better. A player from our 2018 defense was going to walk and make $$ - and it just happened to be Amos. And he got PAID too - more than what Trev made before and currently.

The Leno drop was tough and looked even worse when Teven Jenkins went down in camp. I think Leno's contract led to the decision too. Not great but idk if Graham had anything to do with that. Plus covid not raising the cap led to a lot of tough decisions for us (leno + fuller) - we expected a 15 mil cap boost that just didn't come this year.

Trev vs Kwit turned out to be a wash - both seem meh now. Kwit STILL has issues in pass coverage and its why he isn't starting for the raiders.

Trey Burton played great for us in 2018 then injuries broke him. I mean he looked awesome for most of that year. Then just disappeared...

I will agree on his drafting strategy. Continuing to trade up has left us with a lack of depth. He needs to get back to trading back. Paces 2nd draft with us, remember when we traded back twice in the 2nd round - then took Whitehair. We need more of that.

I just remember the Angelo and Emery years very well. Assuming our draft picks would suck because of how few, high and low round picks, turned into anything. Some fans don’t even know what that’s like - Pace changed that.

You can say he missed on Fox but if you remember the situation, he didn’t even have a choice on who to hire that first year. It was Accorsi and McCaskey. So he really mainly missed on Nagy, who was supposed to be the next McVay.

If we go back to that coaching cycle - only Frank Reich has done better since, and they hired him after McDaniels accepted then declined the HC offer.

My point is that it’s easy to look down with a generalist view and say he failed. But if we look at each situation as it stood, like trading picks and redoing contracts as we swung for a playoff run, i think we want a GM who does those things.

I blame the QB failures on Nagy. You mean to tell me Mitch, Foles, Dalton, and a rookie Fields we’re all misses? Or is it more likely that Nagy doesn’t know what he’s doing and failed with each one?

Emery went and signed some good players like Bennett and Marshall.. but who else on O?

I think this coaching staff saw Fields, Mooney, Kmet, Herbert as an offense with just enough potential that they could concentrate on filling holes elsewhere.

Carr will be 31 and isn't the guy to make everyone else around him elevate their game. Seems like a nice guy and all, but he's just a very good but not good enough QB to win it all.  Not to mention they're in a stacked division where you're probably going to have the third best QB in the division - if you're lucky - for at least the next decade.

Fields at least has the potential to be better than Carr. We're one Rodgers decision away from our division being completely up for grabs and if Fields takes the next step, he's the best QB of the bunch.

That said, I think we all need to realize that this league is all about the QB. Arians didn't win shit without Brady. Reid didn't get over the hump until Mahomes. We're never going to be real contenders until we pair Fields with someone that can get everything out of him and put him in the best position to win.

The easiest path to doing so is nabbing an offensive coach that has a vision and can implement it long term even if it means OC's get promoted and leave vs. going defense and hoping they find the right guy initially...because what happens if they leave?

I know there are recent examples of both working (see: Buffalo), I just tend to be a believer in having the HC and QB having that chemistry.


Nagy had all kinds of red flags that eventually came back to bite us. He was only ever under Reid so he didn't have exposure with any other systems or philosophy in his coaching career.

I'm surprised not to see Marc Trestman's name being brought up here as an example. In his first season, the Bears finished 8-8 with a top ranked offense. In his second and final year they went 5-11, losing their last 5 games. BUT, the worst of it all was in the middle of the season.

[Bears 2014 Season Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Chicago_Bears_season)

In week 8 the Bears visited the Patriots. They lost 23-51. They allowed 38 points in the first half, the most in team history. Then the Bears had a bye week to lick their wounds before playing the Packers on Sunday Night Football. They ended up losing that game 14-55. The 42 points allowed in the first half was a franchise record (two weeks in a row), and the six touchdown passes allowed in the half was an NFL record. By allowing 51 and 55 points against the Patriots and Packers, respectively, the Bears became the first team since the 1923 Rochester Jeffersons to allow at least 50 points in two consecutive games.

By mid-season, he had totally lost the locker room. I've never seen anything like it and hope I never see anything like it again. No way he deserved a third season ""to figure it out"". It was already figured out. He was not a good head coach.",2.0,nfl,t3_ojhpmb,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2021-07-13T19:00:12Z,chibears,-0.0213988538528873

I would say these QBs are comfortably ahead to start the season [13]:  Mahomes, Allen, Rodgers, Brady, Herbert, Burrow, Prescott, Lamar Jackson, Stafford, Russell Wilson, Kyler Murray, Deshaun Watson, Derek Carr.

Tua and Jalen Hurts [2] are wild cards that have can have a lot of variance in their performance, but I would guess they end up as middle tier to back of the upper tier with the weapons they have going into this season.

Then you get into the vets who are probably mid-tier starters [4]: Matt Ryan, Kirk Cousins, Ryan Tannehill, healthy Jimmy G.  It depends on what you want from your QB if you have these guys as a starter because their ceiling isn't great in my opinion, but they're probably not going to be a disaster either, so you have have to be a pretty strong starter to be ahead of them.

Guys who are vets but probably below average/lower-tier starters [8]:  Baker Mayfield, Jameis Winston, Daniel Jones, Wentz, Goff, Sam Darnold, Trubisky, Drew Lock.

I get what he was trying to say, but being ""poor, hungry, and desperate"" would've been an extremely difficult thing for Brisker to go through, and labeling someone with those words is very insulting at least.  Imagine if you were in a job interview and they wanted to dig into how rough your childhood was, and the worse off you were, the more the interviewer thought that was a positive for their sake.  ""Did your family have any money when you were growing up?  No?  Perfect, we like poor people.  Was there a struggle to have enough food on the table?  Even better, hungry people are hard workers out of necessity.  Are you desperate to make it out of your circumstances growing up?  Wonderful, desperate people will work hard for us.""

> Jaquan Brisker, who is one of eight children, was born in Pittsburgh and later moved to Monroeville. He attended Gateway High, where he was a three-year letterman as a safety and wide receiver. As a senior, Brisker earned team MVP and First Team All-Section honors for the second consecutive year. He set a school record with 42 catches for 781 yards and 11 touchdowns in 2016, adding five punt return touchdowns. He was held out of several games in high school, including a playoff loss his senior year, due to declining grades and missed classes. Brisker also lettered two seasons in basketball, earning First Team All-Section honors as a senior.

> A three-star cornerback recruit out of high school, Brisker received interest from several Power 5 programs in the 2017 recruiting class, but he admittedly didn’t focus enough on academics, and the major offers never arrived. Instead of accepting an offer to grayshirt at Toledo, he decided to enroll at Lackawanna Community College to get his grades back on track. A two-year junior college starter, Brisker led the team with 64 tackles as a sophomore and was named an All-American. A four-star juco recruit, he was the No. 1 juco safety recruit and the No. 12 player overall. Brisker committed to Penn State (his dream program) over offers from Alabama, Pitt and others. His older brother (Tale’) was shot and killed in Prairie View, Texas when Brisker was a high school sophomore (February 2015), which was a major reason for Jaquan’s focus issues in high school. He participated in “Senior Day” in 2020 and received an invitation to the 2021 Senior Bowl, but took advantage of the NCAA extra year of eligibility and returned for a fifth season in 2021. Brisker graduated with his degree in communications (December 2021).

Also said the offense is going to be built around Fields with a strong running game and play action passing, and he made it pretty clear that the Cover 2 defense Eberflus runs is modernized from the Lovie and Dungy days.  Eberflus was partially hired for the way he holds players accountable.  Maybe the biggest insight was that rebuilding the offensive line seems to be priority number one for Poles.

Seems quite different from a defense that solely just expects players to win their matchups, which would probably result in a lot of close but not quite pressure stuff.

Just talking out of my ass here.

Edit: also an offense that respects the pass rush is going to game plan a lot of quick throws where pressure isn’t really possible. But, in game situations when teams have to let pass plays develop (Bengals, Lions, Raiders games where Bears had a lead), Bears are getting sacks… makes sense to me that overall pressures would be low and sacks high with that playing out.",2.0,chibears,t3_q8n8be,False,0.0,Kyle Long,2021-10-15T10:18:31Z,chibears,-0.0382059320521211

This is true.


>Mack on defense helps more then a late 2nd rounder.


Still a dumb argument.


>18,14,13, and 7qb hits in a half a season is pretty consistent to me. Pressures is 40, 40, 30. Hence why he went to the pro bowl each year. Was graded highly each year. Was respected by his peers each year.

>The only year he hasn't been great, was last year when he got injured and missed half the season. And he was still pretty good in that half season.


45 pressures, 30 pressures, on pace for 20 pressures. Mack is still great, but it is 100% dependent on health. The older he gets the more likely this is a reoccurring issue.


>There is a reason the only people who think Mack isn't going to continue to be a beast next year, is bears fans trying to cope with the horrific return we got and trying to justify it by going oh yeah well i like my gm making decisions out of fear of further injury.


He is a beast.


>His lowest value is right now. Coming off an injury with no tape showing he's back to khalil mack. In order to say his highest value is now. You're yet again arguing out of fear.


That assumes a bounce back to a fully healthy season at the same production level. But if that doesn't happen, hes a year older, a year less of contractual control, proven further injury concerns. Why risk it? 


Our team is better with khalik mack. Our team isnt winning this year and probably not next year. So why not get picks that help us in the future? Im so confused how that concept is going right over your head.

Bears fans go yeah well he was injured last year so he's never going to be good so a 2nd rounder for an elite rusher is good and uhhh it's good we're eating more in dead cap in 2022 then if we kept him because you know it would be illegal to move him at any other point before 2023 and having only 100 mil in cap in 2023 was really holding us back. We needed to be at 120 mil so we can sign more bad lineman like lucas patrick!


Mack is a great player, never said he was going to be bad. The bears dont need him right now, why keep him? And the odds of him being as productive, along with injury concerns, by the time this team is ready to compete, are not great. So get capital that will help you win in the future.


>It was a bad trade. When 30 other franchises go, Damn we could have gotten mack for a 2nd why didn't we do that? 1 franchise goes, i can't believe we did that for a 2nd. And one franchise goes yeah well he totally is going to be injured so any thing is a good deal. Take a hint.

I agree. But the argument isnt just him being effective, but also, ""how does he help us win a superbowl"". By the time our roster is there, I doubt mack will be making the type of impact that justifies his salary.


>His sack totals went down since 2018 but his pressures and pressure rate stayed relatively the same.



[Not really tho](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MackKh00.htm). Look at his advanced stats for pressures, qb hits, knockdowns.


And i'm a big mack fan, I have no ill feelings towards his time here at all, he's a beast. Injuries just hampered his play. But I do agree, even through injuries he was good because hes a HOF caliber player.


>And it absolutely is a decision that's being made out of fear. Your entire argument is built around the fear of him not returning from his injury. You're making the assumption that mack is done and the bears getting anything is a good deal.


I'm not saying he's done, I'm saying he doesn't fit the window, and he will likely be less effective by the time we need him, and injury situations tend to not get better with age, that's just a fact. He's played through injuries every year and it has made him less dominate. You have to do the math and decide if it's time to cut your losses, and get what you can.


>When we just saw what a half year rental from an elite edge rusher the season coming back from injury went for. And it was a lot more than a 2nd rounder.


It was a second and a third. Mack got two seconds and a sixth


>His dead cap is higher than his cap hit. We had absolutely no reason to do this deal now. We had until the next league year, then you needed him off the cap if we're going to add youth to the team around Fields. Which is why i've never brought up issue with getting rid of Mack. We should trade quinn too. And if anyone is dumb enough to take Eddie jackson, ship him off too. No one but Fields, Mooney, Roquan, and Jaylon are off limits.


His value is highest right now. Next offseason it goes down , and why risk him getting hurt and having zero trade value if your plan is mid season trade. I


>Just because it's a good decision to move on from mack doesn't mean it's a good decision to do it at any cost. A 2nd round pick is not more valuable then having an elite edge rusher who can reduce the pressure on fields to score 30+ and help create pressure that leads to turnovers, which leads to confidence building scoring drives.


It's two 2nd round picks, and I totally disagree with the premise that this is going to affect fields in any way, that's ridiculous.

And it's not decision being made out of fear. If you look what your window is, the cap hit, his health - and in turn production, his age - and in turn his production, the fact that his trade value will only continue to diminish (unless of course he stays healthy and dominates, but that's far from a given), I think his trade is more than justifiable, even if the return isn't as much as you hoped.

22743,108459,108459,LL_Cruel_J,"Oh jeez it's a pretty long story but I'll try to keep it as short as possible. 

The sellers purchased this house as a foreclosure at the beginning of 2021, along with the fines that the previous owner had. They totally gutted and rehabbed the place and built a second floor.

The current sellers had to go to court to clear all the fines/liens on the property. However, the court only schedules these hearings once a month and the sellers were out of town the first time. 

The second hearing, they showed up but the Judge told them the hearings are now only Zoom, so they had to wait a few weeks again. At the next hearing, the Judge informed them that since it was essentially a ""new-build"" the City of Chicago needs to come out and send their own inspectors to review the plumbing/electrical/HVAC. And the City of Chicago is typically slow as fuck. 

After these were finally approved (with no errors, all perfect), the city was like ""oh wait a minute, one side of the house needs Hardie Board because that side of the house is on the neighbors property line"" ... uhhhhh ok. The sellers knew this in the middle of June (probably earlier) but didn't do it. So they quickly added it and painted it to match the rest of the siding. 

Meanwhile, our rate lock kept getting extended from the beginning of May until now, at the crisp rate of $500/week (at the sellers expense). The rate lock expires for good tomorrow so we just made it. 

This is all stuff the seller should've done prior to listing the property. I don't know why they didn't, considering they are a company that buys houses and flips them so they should've known better.

I guess what I'm saying is that one of the biggest differences in the situations and why I don't think they are equivalent is  the contract situations for that starting QB were completely different.

23827,116956,116956,Lungorthin666,"Definitely agree with that.

Barring that, 2 years isn't honestly that bad. BUT, if in today's NFL if your top 3 picked QB isn't ready to start by then you made the wrong pick.

And mind you I actually really like Trey Lance. I'm in no way talking about his play or him as a prospect. I just think the current meta of the NFL and one that is an effective strategy is the timeline for playing your rookie QB. Of course you want to play him when he's ready.

That is a very calculated move. And I've mentioned this in other posts, but the Love pick itself isn't really what I have an issue with, but the timing of it I have significant issue with. Regardless of if you think Rodgers was on the decline, you still didn't have a realistic out from his contract for AT LEAST 3 years at the time. Which means that realistically Love would not start for a minimum of 3 years from his time of being drafted.

23829,116958,116958,Lungorthin666,"I definitely agree with moving up to get the quarterback you want. I've even argued that AT THE TIME the Bears didn't make a huge mistake in trading up to secure Mitch. In hindsight it was clearly an awful decision but the sentiment is the same. If you want to secure your guy you secure your guy.

My feeling with the Packers is, if 3 years away was the window for wanting a QB to start then drafting Love at that time doesn't really make a ton of sense in the first place. That means Love is starting on year 4 of his rookie contract and you really only have 1 year of game time evaluation to determine if the 5th year option is worth taking. Did they legitimately believe they wouldn't have an opportunity to draft a QB they liked in a year or two where they could better take advantage of that window? I mean, if they had a much higher draft pick at the time I would almost agree more with it because they wouldn't belive they would have another opportunity to draft that high, but where they drafted Love they should expect to be a reasonable range for them every single year.",1.0,nfl,t3_n5lspt,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2021-05-05T18:54:16Z,chibears,0.118360210853815

Jimmy G is at best average, Rodgers is at best a goat. You go and replace that average QB with a number 3 overall pick if you have that opportunity.

Packers replacing Rodgers is a big mistake, at least when they attempted to do so.

23833,116962,116962,Lungorthin666,I'm of the opinion that it is a mistake to sit a 1st round QB for more than a year. We've seen countless examples of why that is the case. Namely it is because of the rookie contract of a 1st round QB and your ability to build a team around that contract for a few years and the window for competing that gives. Sitting a 1st round QB for more than a year is a mistake and you are wasting that window.,0.0,nfl,t3_n5ojff,False,1.0,:Bears: Bears,2021-05-05T16:20:36Z,chibears,-0.137665625
23834,116963,116963,Lungorthin666,"I totally agree with you're point about the fifth year option, however I don't think this applies well in this scenario. The other (and arguably more important) aspect of drafting a highly valued QB prospect is that you have a window to compete with them on a team friendly contract. The Packers are wasting Love's window for that highly coveted rookie contract with him as a backup. When Rodgers was drafted that rookie contract situation wasn't even a thing so it's not a comparable situation. If you aren't playing your rookie QB by year 2 on his rookie contract in today's NFL you are making a mistake (unless his play warrants otherwise, in which case that's a different conversation).

So it's my opinion that the Packers drafted Love with the expectation that Rodgers would continue to fall off and Love would be the starter this year, which also explains why Rodgers feels slighted because he understands this was the intended scenario. And if the Packers did intend for Love to go the Aaron Rodgers route and sit for 3 years before playing him, then that is arguably an even bigger mistake because of the rookie contract.

edit: also important to note. The Packers were already in the first round when the traded up for Love, so the fifth year option argument applies even less.

I clearly said they were good WHILE with us and Howard was simultaneously a good player while on our team and showing clear signs of declining and worth getting rid of. Both can be true. Players decline and its ok to admit that and even better for a GM to admit that. The proof is clear Howard was worth getting rid by the fact that he still continued his decline after he left our team. How can you look at Howards numbers and performance and believe he was worth keeping? That is not a logical inconsistency, thats called not falling for a sunk cost fallacy. Just because he WAS good with us does not mean he was going to continue being good and he clearly did not continue being good. And sure I should have rephrased the stone hands comment but it was just a catchall for his complete lack of a passing game. Tell me how did that improve for him with other coaches he's had when he moved on? Clearly that was Nagy who didn't understand how to use Howard properly. I also think its a BS take to hinge on the monty pick as lucky. All picks have some element to luck involved (see Kevin White) but to say a pick was pure luck is just plain wrong. We got rid of howard but got monty so everything did work out... as intended not out of dumb luck.

Again you just ignore half the argument I make. I said I was reserving judgement on the Cohen extension like any reasonable person would. Cohen is a real solid threat out of the backfield as a pass catcher, can occasionally make things happen from a handoff, and is a threat every time he fields a punt. And bullshit he was predictably injured his injury was sustained on a punt which he called for a fair catch and got dove at the knees. By your logic every running back can be predictably injured (which actually may be true due to the nature of the position).

And stop with the meathead bullshit. Whether you agree with me or not a meathead is an idiot that won't even engage in a discussion and pulls out unreasonable takes. I even said I agree with a lot of the things you said and only picked out a few key points I disagreed with. And how the fuck am I arguing with myself? I'm arguing with you mostly about a disagreement on Howards value and time to move on from him.

23865,117026,117026,Lungorthin666,"Pace has had certainly a lot more than just a few one hit wonder picks. I certainly hope JJ and Mooney aren't one hit wonders and I think Kmet showed a ton of potential as well. Beyond those you also have Monty, ROQUAN, Bojack, Cody Whitehair, Bilal Nichols, Eddie Goldman, James Daniels, I still disagree that Cohen was a one hit wonder, his rookie and 2nd year were both good to very good, 3rd year he fell off a bit but was still a weapon and only shy 1k all purpose yards by 6 yards. Then an injury year. 

And there are also picks hes made that are no longer with the team (debatable if they were worth keeping or not but I think were at least good while with the team) like Howard, Floyd, Kwit, and Amos. I honestly do not think Pace has drafted that bad with a BIG exception for Trubisky.

Also you keep complaining about 40% of our picks being used to replace Howard while neglecting the fact that 1 of those was Monty and the other was a 7th round flyer.

I do not follow your logic with the 49ers comment. Are you saying because they considered our offer they were not considering other offers? That makes zero sense. And it takes 5 seconds of googling to find articles from immediately after the draft about teams looking to leapfrog the bears. Also of course KC and Houston executed lower cost trades to move into lower positions, they were exactly that, lower positions. The value of going from 3 to 2 is much higher than going from 20 to 10. If you look at the value charts for trade positions the move Pace did makes sense. I don't criticize the move I criticize his scouting when it comes to the Trubisky situation. Should he have moved, in hindsight absolutely not, but if his scouting on Trubisky had been accurate it absolutely justified the move because there were plenty of people that had similar value on Trubisky and again, be aggressive and get your guy.

And wtf are you talking about with this Howard stuff. You criticize pace for using picks to replace Howard then earlier said one of his good decisions was drafting monty... who replaced howard...  and again howard has been trash the last 2 years and you would have still preferred him on this team? You would be ripping pace even harder with howard on the team. Do you listen to yourself? You are saying pace's trademark is creating his own holes (howard) but then we don't fill them? But again earlier said monty was a good pick which did what exactly? Filled the hole he created???

I'll hold out on criticizing or praising extending Cohen. I think he showed his value enough to warrant an extension, personally, but on the same token I don't believe in extending runningbacks. I'll wait to see how Cohen performs on the contract extension to decide how I feel about it. Regardless, I don't think it deserves to be in his ""bad decision"" category, at least not yet. And Monty still has 2 years on his contract, we have time to decide on that but again, using a mid round pick on a running back to replace his mid round pick running back has been pretty successful for Pace imo.

Listen I'm all for criticizing pace and was on board with firing him but at least stick to the criticisms that make sense like picking trubisky and some of his awful free agent signings. There isn't a lot of reaching that needs to be done yet you are trying so hard to do so.

Not sure why extending Cohen is a bad decision?

Saying he traded up in the 2017 draft so he didn't have to settle is pretty disingenuous. I'd prefer my gm be aggressive and not settle. Did he make the wrong pick? Absolutely but the move itself makes sense to me in the moment. Hindsight is a bitch

That fuller contract comment also seems like a stretch. You honestly believe the packers were just targeting fuller to drive his price up? I don't even think we over payed for fuller he's been worth his pay and earned his keep.

Pace has used multiple 2nd round picks on offensive line and Massie and Leno have been serviceable and stable, especially for their price.

Just because Alshon won a superbowl with the eagles does not mean we made the wrong decision there. Alshon has been shit since then and even that year he was mediocre at best and just a cog in a really good overall team. Also how well did bmarsh play after we shipped him off? If memory serves correctly maybe not very well and value we got for him by that standard was fair. Also same thng can be said for Howard. He was also shit after we traded him. There is a reason these players get the value they do in a trade, he was done with his rookie contract, not a scheme fit, and on a steady decline. You keep framing these trades as if we should have gotten crazy value out of obviously declining players at tail ends of contracts.

I like Patterson a lot hes been great for our team and more than just a kick returner. Was hoping he would return. Also his value as a kick returned has been worth it imo.

So why is it bad to incentivize them to get out of this comfort zone and give other people opportunities?

* This section was written by /u/HopLegion who did a much better job than I could have.

&nbsp;

* 1 | 49ers | Sun 9/11 12:00 PM Chicago starts the season playing a team that made it to last year’s NFC Championship game. SF beat Chicago the year prior with Fields starting, though it was a closer game then the end score shows with Fields highlight run nearly tying the game with under 10 minutes left.  A lot of unknowns with Lance likely getting his first full start as undisputed QB1, but SF is clearly better talent wise nearly across the board.  This will be the first game we will get to see Fields starting against another 2021 QB draft choice in Trey Lance.  Overall, Fields outplays Lance in the game giving the Bears hope, but  the score remains a similar result to last year with SF able to secure the win.  CHI 26 - SF 31 (0-1)

* 2 | @ Packers | Sun 9/18 | 7:20 PM  An away primetime game against the Packers in Week 2, what could possibly go wrong.  If recent history is any indication, this will likely be an early lowpoint for Chicago.  Everyone is well aware of Rodgers history with the Bears and Bears fans should already be preparing themselves to read or hear the sound clip of Rodgers saying “I own you” 100+ times that week.  Until Chicago can show he doesn’t, it’s an accurate statement.   Losing Davante Adams won’t be enough to move the needle in the Bears favor.  For whatever reason in most games the Bears are able to stick in it through the first half, but the Packers won’t be worried as long as Rodgers is at QB.  When the final whistle sounds Green Bay wins by 10+.     GB 35 - CHI 23 (0-2)

* 3 | Texans | Sun 9/25 | 12:00pm  This is the week we learn if the Bears are truly a team destined for a top 3 pick, as many in the media projects, or if they will remain in the below average category they generally float in.  Fields gets his second game in the first 3 weeks against a QB drafted in 2021 in Davis Mills.  Bears fans also get to see former Head Coach Lovie Smith return as a head coach of another NFL team which most never thought would happen after his time in Tampa Bay and the collegiate level.  For the game, Fields continues to take a step playing better than another 2021 QB as the offense begins to click for the first time under new OC Luke Getsy.  The young defense is able to use Lovie’s principles against him forcing multiple turnovers and the Bears pull out their first win of the year at home.  CHI 31 - HOU 27 (1-2)    

* 4 | @ Giants | Sun 10/2 | 12:00 pm The only team the Bears blew out last season was the New York Giants, beating them soundly 29-3.  A lot went Chicago's way that game as famed former Chicago Bears QB Mike Glennon was starting for the Giants and completed a total of 4 passes for 24 yards and 2 INT.  This year the Giants should be improved with Jones back at QB and a new HC many Bears fans hoped would be coaching Chicago in Brian Daboll.  Overall, it ends up being a 50/50 game with Fields getting in his first game winning drive of the year to set up a last second Field Goal to put Chicago ahead.     NYG 26 - CHI 29 (2-2)

* 5 | @ Vikings | Sun 10/09 | 12:00 pm The Bears went 0-2 last year against the Vikings which was surprising as Nagy had actually gone 5-1 versus them his first 3 seasons as HC.  The biggest change for Minnesota during the off season is the change in Head Coach which will lead them to finding a more consistent offensive identity in 2022.  Overall, for this game the elite skill players and better QB play for Minnesota make the difference and lead to a Bears loss in Minnesota.  MIN 28 - CHI 17 (2-3)  

* 6 | Commanders | Thu 10/13 | 7:15 pm Nothing like Thursday Night Football excitement with the Washington Commanders versus the Chicago Bears to really get the NFL week going.  Coming off short rest this is going to be a sloppy game for both sides leading to neither team getting consistent offensive production.  Fields continued growth under Getsy and a defense that is able to generate turnovers ends up being decisive as the Bears win a sloppy low scoring game most fans shut off by halftime.  CHI 17 - WAS 16  (3-3)   

* 7 | @ Patriots | Mon 10/24 | 7:15pm  The third game of the season that will pit Justin Fields versus a QB drafted in the 2021 draft in Mac Jones and the third primetime Bears game in 7 weeks (got to love the Chicago market ratings boost early in the season).  Bears will be coming off a mini-bye after playing 11 days ago on Thursday Night, but unfortunately this causes them to come out of the gate slow.  A conservative offensive game plan by Belichek with the continued development by Mac Jones will lead to a Patriots victory at home in Prime Time.  NE 24 - CHI 17  (3-4) 

* 8 | @ Cowboys | Sun 10/30 | 12:00pm Every year the Bears come down with a surprise win and this is the game it ends up happening.  Fields will be running for his life all game (and likely season) as Parsons is used creatively to get into the backfield, but overall this will be his statement game as Fields makes play after play to put the Bears ahead ending with a last second touchdown pass to 3rd year tight end Cole Kmet to seal the victory. CHI 34 - DAL 31  (4-4)  

* 9 | Dolphins | Sun 11/6 | 12:00pm  Another team with an offensive HC many Chicago fans wanted to see in McDaniels.  Tua vs Fields will be the big story leading into the week, but the overall difference will be in the talent Miami has at wide receiver as the combo of Waddle and Tyreek show out against Chicago’s secondary.  Fields struggles as he tries to do too much and Miami ends up with the victory.  MIA 28 - CHI 20  (4-5)  

* 10 | Lions | Sun 11/13 | 12:00pm  This will be a tough game for the Bears as many have come to expect the Lions to be a victory almost every time.  Nagy was 7-1 against the Lions over the past 4 seasons, but a lot of those games have come down to the wire with luck going Chicago’s way in the final few minutes.  Overall, the Lions play a tough game with Swift catching a game tying touchdown pass (this time) in the final minute to take it to overtime where the Bears win with a long Darnell Mooney TD catch.  CHI 27 - DET 21 (5-5)  

* 11 | @ Falcons | Sun 11/20 | 12:00pm  Chicago vs Chicago South as the Bears face a Falcons team with 2 former Bears GMs on the staff, 5 players who were on the Bears in 2021, 4 players who played for the Bears while Pace was GM, and 5+ coaches on the coaching staff who coached recently in Chicago. This week versus the Falcons, the Bears show the difference of what a bad team is versus what a below average team is as they blow out Atlanta for their first big victory of the season winning by 10+ points.   ATL 13 - CHI 28 (6-5) 

* 12 | @ Jets | Sun 11/27 | 12:00pm We get the final 2021 QB showdown as Fields faces Wilson marking the 4th QB he will have faced from the 2021 draft.  The New York Jets are a fascinating team this year with a lot of talent on paper and high draft capital on offense.  In another year or two, I think they will have built a consistent team on offense, but for 2022 it could be a lot of ups and downs.  In a close game, the defense is able to create turnovers from a young offensive core for the Jets leading to a Bears victory and marking the high point of their season.  ATL 17 - CHI 24 (7-5) 

* 13 | Packers | Sun 12/04 12:00 PM CST In what ends up being the most hyped game of the season for Chicago who has a surprising winning record ⅔ through the season, Aaron Rodgers once again reminds Bears of the difference a HOF QB makes.  Rodgers plays a near perfect game as he decimates the Bears momentum heading into the bye week.  Fields takes a big step back trying to do too much and plays his worst game of the year.  The Bears lose big at home leaving a lot of questions heading into the bye week.  CHI 13 - GB 31 (7-6)   

* 14 | Bye (Finally)

* 15 | Eagles | Mon 12/18 | 12:00 pm Coming off the bye Chicago gets off to a slow start.  Similar to previous games, the talent on offense begins to show as AJ Brown and Devonta Smith make the difference.  The Bears are shown again teams need multiple high level players on offense to take the next step.  Fields and the offense bounce back, but are outmatched against a more talented Eagles team.  CHI 24 - PHI 30 (7-7)  

* 16 |  Bills | Sat 12/24 | 12:00pm Just the Christmas Eve present every Bears fan wants, playing one of the best teams in the NFL while the team is “In The Hunt” for the playoffs.  The best thing the Bears could hope for is the Bills are 15-0 and are resting some players, but unfortunately the Bills show what the Bears hope to be in 2 years soundly beating them at all 3 levels and lowering their playoff hopes.  CHI 17 - BUF 31 (7-8)  

* 17 | @ Lions | Sun 1/01 12:00 pm  After a tough Christmas Eve loss where they were outclassed, the Bears are ready to face a Lions team they barely beat over a month back.  Unfortunately this will be another lesson showing multiple playmakers are needed on offense and the Bears just do not have the personnel on their team as it stands.  In another tight game the combo of Jameson Williams who is hitting his stride in his rookie season by this point showing he should’ve been the first WR drafted and Amon St. Brown put the Lions over the Bears in the final minute, crushing any hopes the Bears had.  DET 27 - CHI 20 (7-9)  

* 18 | Vikings | TBD  As usual, the Bears visit Minnesota to finish out the season. However, at 7-9, they're firmly on the outside of the playoff picture, hoping only to play spoiler to the Vikings' wildcard hopes. This game will give Bears fans some future hope heading into the offseason as they put together a complete game on both sides of the ball with young players on offense and defense buying into Eberflus HITS principle.  Kirk Cousins gets a chance to win it at the end, but comes up just short.   CHI 27 - MIN 23 (8-9)

Final record: 8-9, 3rd NFC North",8.0,nfl,t3_vsq3jw,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears :Lions: Lions,2022-07-06T08:31:26Z,chibears,-0.0104162015561811
27684,146625,146625,PlatypusOfDeath,"###Culture and Scheme

&nbsp;

Eberflus is known for his culture. He instils in his players a need for tenacity, hustling until the whistle. Instead of micromanaging his coordinators, or taking control of the defence, it is expected that he will work as a true manager, while letting the people he hired, do their jobs. Both Poles and Eberflus have [talked](https://gg.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/t7am93/per_ras_created_by_mathbomb_the_chiefs_interior/) about the need for versatile and athletic players, causing the Relative Athletic Score to become a popular reference in /r/chibears. The new coaching staff are big proponents of HITS workouts. High intensity, relentless versatile athletes will be the norm in Chicago.

&nbsp;

Offensive Scheme: Explosive plays have been mentioned when discussing the new identify of Chicago's offense. With their hiring of OL Coach Chris Morgan, it is likley that the Bears run scheme will be [outside-zone](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=outside+zone+scheme) or [wide-zone.](https://www.ganggreennation.com/2021/10/6/22706331/wide-zone-inside-zone-and-power-gap-schemes) Furthermore, Getsy's offense is [expected](https://theathletic.com/3101662/2022/01/31/what-makes-bears-qb-justin-fields-and-offensive-coordinator-luke-getsy-a-good-fit/) to feature a lot of RPOs and will aim to take advantage of Fields speed and skill as a runner while getting recievers downfield in a west-coast type passing game.

&nbsp;

Defensive Scheme: The Bears are switching back to a 4-3 defense. This is the third time Eberflus has been apart of a team transitioning from 3-4 to 4-3. He is quoted as saying that the scheme will fit around the players and their skills. The defense will be attacking the ball in mass, hustling each and every play.",33.0,nfl,t3_vsq3jw,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears :Lions: Lions,2022-07-06T08:31:13Z,chibears,0.0001580159333227
27685,146626,146626,PlatypusOfDeath,"###Training Camp Battles

&nbsp;.

* **CBs** - Thomas Graham Jr was PFFs [76th best prospect](https://gg.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/n2t4gf/oregon_cb_thomas_graham_jr_was_the_76thranked/) prior to the 2021 draft. Last season, he was waived and re-signed before playing 4 games and a total of 102 snaps. He also opted out of the 2020 season. Jaylon Jonhson has been practising with the second team and seems to be being encouraged to step it up. Kyler Gordon is a second-round rookie. They're likely to be the starters, though it seems everyone has a shot.

* **LS** - UDFA Rookie Antonio Ortiz is most likely a camp body but this sub loves its long snappers so we'll see if 34-year-old Patrick Scales can keep going.

* **LT, RG, RT** - Who will end up where? Lucas Patrick at Center and Cody Whitehair at Left Gaurd are the only positions anyone is willing to bet on. Tevin Jenkins has also been playing with the second team while Borom and Braxton Jones had some moments of fame in camp.",3.0,nfl,t3_vsq3jw,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears :Lions: Lions,2022-07-06T08:30:59Z,chibears,0.0520402891176115

**Drafting BPA** - ""Generally speaking, you do want to stick with best available. I think that's how you capture value the best on the board. And then if all things are even between four guys and one's in a position that you need and it's a premium position, then you will adjust to that. But you really should have the mindset of best available.""

&nbsp;

**Trading up or down** - ""To move up, it's got to be a special player that really checks all the boxes. We talk about 'Bears Fit,' the guys who represent exactly what we need, and if that matches a high level of performance, that's something that we would consider. In terms of moving back, then it becomes a numbers game, and I work with some of our analytics folks to come up with rules for that on draft day. If you have the ability to maneuver around and you still can get a guy in the proper value for where you're picking, then that might be the best move because then you add draft capital as well.""",14.0,chibears,t3_t5ms6c,False,0.0,Sweater,2022-03-03T02:28:35Z,chibears,0.1102027454435825

Tons of question marks, I know. But if the right moves are made the oline could be completely be revamped.

LT - If they wanna break the bank, Armstead is obviously the guy. But he can't be counted on to stay healthy a whole season. Duane Brown is still playing excellent football but is 37. 2-3 year deal if it's cheaper than Armstead may end up being the best value. Fisher is... ok I guess. He'd be the next best LT FA to get but he doesn't inspire anything in me--a Leno-level signing. In a perfect world, the Chiefs are inept and allow Orlando Brown to straight up walk, in which case we *have* to bet the whole house on him. But that'll never happen. I like Duane the most out of all these choices.

LG - There are plenty of choices throughout the draft for us to look at at guard. Idk how Getsy, Morgan, and Poles wanna look at it but I believe we could see some rookie play at LG. Zion Johnson could be our first pick. Other names to consider at various parts of the draft: Ed Ingram, Jaxson Kirkland, Jamaree Salyer, Marquis Haynes, Dylan Parham, Spencer Burford, Lecitus Smith, Cole Strange, Chris Paul. My personal favorite pick would be Tyler Smith from Tulsa. He was their LT last season but projects to be better at guard. Seriously, go look up what he did to Ohio State's dline and tell me he won't be incredible as a guard.

C - Whitehair is certainly not my first choice at center. I don't think his snap is something you can reliably count on. Then again, his only Pro Bowl season came from playing C in 2018. However, with the amount of $$ we spend in this hypothetical scenario, I don't see us further breaking the bank for a Brian Allen (preferred choice) or a Ryan Jensen. Keep it in house and see if new coaching can bring Whitehair back to greatness.

RG - Will Hernandez. He's the guy. He's an underrated guard and he gets under the defense's skin. Watch the Giants home game from 2019 and you'll see what he does for his teammates and his QB. He's a more experienced interior-playing Jenkins. No more of this bullshit fuckin Germain Ifedi nonsense of getting angry AT YOUR OWN TEAMMATE FOR STICKING UP FOR YOUR GODDAMN QUARTERBACK. Fuck him *forever*. Keep Ifedi and toxic assholes like him the fuck off my fucking football team.

RT - I expect Jenkins to be the guy. Hopefully this new coaching staff doesn't just hand the starting position on a silver platter to him with no competition (*coughmustiphercough*). Let him actually compete against Borom and maybe a low cost FA or another rookie and see who deserves it.

29060,160388,160388,Selkiesxx,"Minshew is so damn likeable. I loved the trade that brought him to you guys from your perspective as it cost so little and you just *knew* that with the Eagles heading into the season with just Jalen Hurts at QB, it was a matter of time until this trade payed off for you guys.

I'm hoping that Sirriani gives Minshew a real chance to establish himself as the long-term answer, as I strongly believe that with the young talent and draft capital you guys have accumulated, this could be a very quick turnaround. 

You've got strong pieces on the offensive line with Mailata, Dickerson, and Driscoli plus a stable of good, young RBs, an ascending talent at tight end with Goedert, and some good vets on defense with Slay, Nelson, and Maddox; in addition to ancillary guys like Josh Sweat, T.J. Edwards, and Milton Williams that should be long-term pieces.

It's obvious what the Texans and the NFL are trying to do. They've basically just told Watson to keep his name out of the public's eye for a bit and they'll see to it that he makes it out of this just fine. 

In my personal opinion, I think the Texans *knew* they would have to bite the bullet for a year or so and that they never had any  intention to move him *this season*. It's in their best interest to let Watson rehab his name and image out of the view of the media.

* #1 - Jay Cutler
*I'm 30 years old, I never got to see Sid Luckman play, so this might be a controversial take but from a talent perspective, this is where he belongs, in my opinion. If someone around here is old enough to have actually seen Luckman play his entire career (and somehow remember it) then I'd love to hear what they think.*

* #2 - Sid Luckman
*As I said, I wasn't alive and the game was different back then anyway. With it not even being post-merger, I feel kind of silly for even including him because I have no way of quantifying how good he really was.*

* #3 - Jim McMahon
*So, I was born in 1990 but have an two older brothers who I respect the opinions of that were old enough to recall the quality of McMahon's tenure. What they've said is that McMahon was in the right place at the right time, as he wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination and was incredibly injury prone.*

* #4 - Erik Kramer / Mitchell Trubisky*
*I put them together because their Chicago Bears careers are strikingly similar if you ignore draft positioning and how they were acquired. They both had one good year statistically and after that struggled with inconsistent play and injuries.*

* #5 - Kyle Orton
*I have no doubt in my mind that if Orton's Bears career were any longer, he would legitimately give Jim McMahon a run for the #3 spot. Like many Bears QBs, the stats don't tell the whole story as Orton played in some truly talent-deprived offenses in the oh-so-creative offenses of well-known ""offensive-savant"" Ron Turner.

30970,173886,173886,Ssquad,"I’m happy with the picks. They fill a need. I remember last year dreading watching our DBs all game. 

So, with Gordon last season he surrounded only a 50% completion rate with a 47.3% passer rating according to PFF. On top of that, from 2019-2021 he never gave up a TD. The NFL is a whole different ballgame but that’s some quality coverage. If that can transcend well enough to the next level we’re good.

Now on to Brisker, fills another position of need and an area where we lacked playmaking. I believe Brisker can bring that. In three years at Penn State he’s had 143 tackles, 10 TFLs, 5 INTs, 14 PD & 1 FR. I’ve read he can play up top, inside and in the box. That adds tremendous value. 

Plus, everything I read says he’s a sure tackler that itself should thrill this fanbase considering how many comments people left in game-threads, posts, Twitter that Eddie can’t tackle or doesn’t have the willingness too.

Gordon and Brisker combined for 1,678 coverage snaps and gave up ONE TD. Again, the NFL is a different ball game, I hope for that kind of success but if that can translate to the NFL we have a solid young secondary. 

Also doesn’t help that our division has some and added some good WR. Can’t ask Jaylon to cover Jefferson, Thielen, Willams, St. Brown, Watson and I wouldn’t put that up to the DB room of last year again.

There was one against the Buccaneers that was a high throw and went off Mooneys hands. On that one there was pressure but I personally think it was an alright pocket to make that throw in.

Not that I think you have to be a vegan to be healthy, but he found a pretty restricted diet that helps his body.  He is willing to alter his diet, and his life, to keep himself in tip top shape.  That says a lot about the kid.  I don't think many players are willing to commit to that level.  You know who else does stuff like that?

> Dear Mr. Foster,

> In your editorial Tuesday, February 8, you noted that Norm Van Brocklin admits his humorous way concerning the selecting of players in the seventeenth round of the draft.

> I think that I am as good a fan as the Atlanta Falcons have.  I do not think the draft is a place for childish humor.

> Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that Bart Starr, a name we are all familiar with, was a 17th round choice.  Danny Abramowicz was a 17th round pick for New Orleans and he has been the most consistent receiver in the NFL over the last several years.  Julian Fagan was a 17th pick and is one of the top punters in the league.  Needless to say, his average is far above that of the Falcon punters.  Don Nottingham was the last man drafted in the 1971 draft.  He was number 442 and he rushed for far more yardage than Joe Profit, Atlanta's first choice, who was the 7th man selected.

> I realize that Joe was hurt in the St. Louis game and the injury ended his season, but up until the time he was hurt, he had carried the ball 3 times for 10 yards.  If he was the best running back in college in 1970, why wasn't he in the backfield instead of returning kickoffs??  You didn't see John Brockington returning many kickoffs!!!

> I think that a team that gets only 10 yards out of their first draft choice, shouldn't make a joke out of their 17th choice.

> I suggest you print this letter, maybe Norm will read it and take it to heart.

> Thank you,

He was basically just some random guy who lied his way onto the St. Louis All-Stars' roster in 1923 by saying he was a former college star.  After unsurprisingly sucking in his short stay with the All-Stars, owner Ollie Kraehe decided to ship him off to Green Bay in exchange for desperately needed money, and Kraehe sold Curly Lambeau on Gray with the same exact pitch that Gray gave him.  When Gray sucked with the Packers as well, Lambeau confronted Kraehe who admitted the ""trade"" was entirely a prank and gave the money back.

As for Gray, he disappeared when the Packers were boarding the train.  Nobody knows where he went or who he is.",21.0,nfl,t3_un1kgn,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-05-11T00:29:33Z,chibears,-0.0080901105967078
35417,212589,212589,ZappaOMatic,"Fun fact: the Bears began this year with three straight scoreless ties before losing 2–0 to the Packers.  They were 4–1–6 entering the final month of the season.

As mentioned by another comment, there was no postseason at the time and the champs were crowned by win percentage, with the Bears and Spartans playing this as basically a tiebreaker.  However, the circumstances to set it up were just as hilariously chaotic.  The Wikipedia article linked discusses the situation, but here's a bigger picture ([I did a write-up on this for the sub back in 2018 if you want even more details](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8z548w/the_1932_packers_blew_their_lead_atop_the/)):

Wikipedia's section on the standings fiasco mentions that the Packers ""controlled their own destiny at the end of the 1932 season, but lost their last two games to the Spartans and the Bears.""  Both games, which were against opponents whom they beat earlier in the season, were pretty wild too.  Against Portsmouth, they lost 19–0 in a game where their opponent played the same exact 11 players for all 60 minutes without any substitutions; this was payback for what happened in their first game, where the Spartans accused the Packers of getting help from the refs (something something time is a flat circle), and for the previous year, where Green Bay abruptly canceled their season finale against Portsmouth in order to protect their spot atop the standings.  This loss dropped the Packers to .833 and behind the Spartans' .857, while the Bears won their game in New York to also reach .833.

The final game of the year was between the Bears and Packers.  Even if the Packers won, their .846 would not be enough to surpass the Spartans (who did not have any games scheduled), so Portsmouth was obviously rooting for them to pull it off.  The Bears proceeded to win 9–0 and improve to 6–1–6, giving them a .857 percentage and therefore tying them with the Spartans.  Portsmouth fans and media were unsurprisingly pissed at the Packers for blowing it, and [one local paper wrote the following](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mTNBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sagMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6715,4175710):

> Chicago, in defeating the Green Bay Packers, finished what the Spartans started last Sunday—proof that the Packers this season have been a greatly overrated ball club and away from the protection of their home influence are just a toothless, straw-armed gridiron scare-crow and not the man-eating, one-eyed ogre conjured by the fans.

> Pampered at home they could ""take it"" but on the road they couldn't stand the gaff. In two straight games the Packers crashed from first place to third and suffered the ignominy of seeing two teams they belittled stamp in their face.

> Whether the Spartans win the championship or not, they have been vindicated in their contention that the Packers are just another ball club and they had been true sportsmen last season and not ""welched"" on the last game of the season and played it in Portsmouth, as booked, they would not have been ""cheese"" champions but ""also rans"".",19.0,nfl,t3_uiz2gl,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-05-05T10:56:50Z,chibears,0.0532484094736113

35421,212608,212608,ZappaOMatic,"Probably because ""lol Jets"".

It wasn't that unusual for fullbacks to go in the first round as you showed, and many mock drafts had both Highsmith and Vick as first rounders (also worth mentioning that fullbacks were usually lumped in with halfbacks, with their roles flipping interchangeably too, for a generic running back position).  For example, [Michael Janofsky](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/26/sports/nfl-draft-87-how-the-first-round-might-go.html) of *The New York Times* projected Highsmith as going #4 overall to Green Bay as a ""tough inside runner for a team that couldn't run"", while Vick was mocked as #22 overall to San Francisco as he had ""good hands, and that's the kind of fullback Bill Walsh likes in his offense.""  [Joel S. Buchsbaum's mock](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/99625648/) had Highsmith to Pittsburgh at #10 (""Chuck Noll isn't in love with Frank Pollard as an all-around fullback and likes to take the best athlete available."") and Vick to Minnesota at #16 (""Vick is cut from the Roger Craig-Chuck Foreman mold.  The Vikings need a big, versatile back."").  Mel Kiper had Highsmith as [his 9th best prospect in the draft](https://i.imgur.com/Jh5SzoH.png).

Most of the negative reactions came because many expected the Jets to address other needs with their first rounder.  Janofsky and Buchsbaum projected Jeff Bregel to help the OL, while others thought they'd go defense like Cincinnati LB Alex Gordon (ironically, Gordon fell to them anyway in the second round).  Most of the defensive players New York wanted like John Bosa and Mike Junkin were already gone when they were on the clock, so Vick was viewed as the best player available.",1.0,nfl,t3_u26c7d,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-04-12T16:30:53Z,chibears,0.08580514508885

Everyone knows about the Steagles, but the Steelers also merged with the Cardinals the following year to form Card-Pitt in 1944, which was a pretty crappy group even with their combined power.  The Cardinals' last winning season was in 1935, and they were on a 16-game losing streak prior to the merger (which included a winless 1943 campaign).  The ""Carpets"" proceeded to lose every game which included throwing a combined 8 TDs to 41 INTs.  RB John Grigas had to singlehandedly carry the team and was actually an MVP candidate for his efforts, but the stress from the disastrous season and his wartime job in a steel mill prompted him to quit the team before the final game.

Once the war ended and the two teams reverted back to their original forms, you can probably imagine things weren't too peachy in Pittsburgh.  The Steelers were basically a shitty team that had just broken up after a year with another shitty team, and they also had to deal with post-war organizational recovery.

Emphasis on the ""modern"" part since that's the type of screen that we see in today's game.  The original screen pass consisted of the linemen charging forward before a receiver ran ahead of them to catch the pass, then behind his blockers who held up the defense.  This was eventually banned in 1928 and would probably result in an illegal man downfield penalty today.

To quote Flaherty:

> I'd been working for all of 1937 and in 1936 on this screen pass.  We'd use a screen pass in college, then they outlawed it.  You couldn't use it because you couldn't screen across the line of scrimmage.  So I got to thinking, 'Why the hell don't we screen back of the line of scrimmage?'

> They were breaking their necks trying to rack up Baugh.  That's what made the screen pass go.  It had been nullified downfield, but we put it behind the line of scrimmage, and the Bears didn't know how to stop it.

In 1921, while George Halas and his friend/teammate Dutch Sternaman ran the team together, the franchise was officially held by founder A.E. Staley.  As part of Halas' deal with Staley, the team would move to Chicago that year in exchange for keeping the Staleys name until the end of the season.  Once the year concluded, the franchise was revoked by the APFA; since Staley was still the franchise's formal holder but stopped investing into the team once Halas/Sternaman took over organizational duties, he never paid the required franchise operating fees and therefore broke league ownership rules.  In other words, for a brief moment, there was no Chicago Staleys/Bears in the league.

Things got interesting from there.  As expected, Halas and Sternaman placed a request for a new franchise under their own control, but so did Bill Harley, a businessman and the brother of Ohio State legend Chic Harley.

During the 1921 season, Halas and Sternaman ""added"" Bill to the Staleys' ""ownership group"" (he didn't actually own anything, but for all intents and purposes, he had that big of a role) because it was the only way for them to sign Chic.  At the meeting, Bill insisted his agreement with Halas/Sternaman also included him being a co-owner, though the league was skeptical and they contacted Staley for his side of the story, during which he explained Halas was indeed heir to the team's ownership.  The other teams' owners then voted to see who got the franchise and Halas/Sternaman won in a landslide.  The rename happened later on in the meeting.

The second and third clauses in today's contract have the same stipulation:

> 2) EMPLOYMENT AND SERVICES.  Club employs Player as a skilled football player. Player accepts such employment. He agrees to give his best efforts and loyalty to the Club, and to conduct himself on and off the field with appropriate recognition of the fact that the success of professional football depends largely on public respect for and approval of those associated with the game. Player will report promptly for and participate fully in Club’s official mandatory mini-camp(s), official preseason training camp, all Club meetings and practice sessions, and all pre-season, regular season, and post-season football games scheduled for or by Club. If invited, Player will practice for and play in any all-star football game sponsored by the League. **Player will not participate in any football game not sponsored by the League unless the game is first approved by the League.**

> 3) OTHER ACTIVITIES.  Without prior written consent of the Club, Player will not play football or engage in activities related to football otherwise than for Club or engage in any activity other than football which may involve a significant risk of personal injury. Player represents that he has special, exceptional and unique knowledge, skill, ability, and experience as a football player, the loss of which cannot be estimated with any certainty and cannot be fairly or adequately compensated by damages. Player therefore agrees that Club will have the right, in addition to any other right which Club may possess, to enjoin Player by appropriate proceedings from playing football or engaging in football-related activities other than for Club or from engaging in any activity other than football which may involve a significant risk of personal injury.",2.0,nfl,t3_ryj96i,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-01-08T02:25:05Z,chibears,0.0403611534800531
35503,212927,212927,ZappaOMatic,"Fun fact about that game: Washington owner George Preston Marshall got ejected at halftime.

Shortly before the first half ended, Marshall walked to the Bears' sideline and sat on the bench.  Bears GM Ralph Brizzolara confronted him and accused him of spying, to which Marshall basically answered that he wanted to be friendly.  The two really did not like each other, so Brizzolara summoned police to escort him to the stands, [where he sat behind home plate](https://i.imgur.com/y0Dxfiw.jpg).

George Halas, who was also not exactly on good terms with Marshall, then decided to mess with him by telling an usher to ask Marshall for his ticket.  Marshall didn't have one, so he was promptly yanked from his seat by the cops and was about to be taken away before escaping to his team's locker room.

Marshall and Brizzolara were fined $500 each for the incident.",4.0,nfl,t3_ryj96i,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-01-08T00:17:47Z,chibears,-0.0008323365021619
35504,212928,212928,ZappaOMatic,"There were actually a lot of ways to get out of serving than you might think.  When someone was drafted during World War II, they were assigned a class that listed their eligibility for military service; for example, Class I-A meant you could join through the usual means, I-A-O was for those who could serve but only in non-combat positions because they were morally opposed to killing or whatever, and Class III was for people who could avoid serving because they were raising a family or working a job that was important to the war effort (like farming or in a manufacturing plant).

Others were turned down simply because they had injuries that the military felt would make them more of a liability than help, even if it did not hamper their sports abilities.  Sinkwich was supposed to join the Marines after college but was rejected because of flat feet.  Tuffy Leemans, who was a star for the New York Giants, enlisted in both the Army and Navy only to be turned down by both because he suffered from concussions.

> Seems like it'd be frowned upon to play sports during wartime.

Excluding [military teams that were formed to help servicemen stay in shape through something they love](https://redd.it/65xu34), professional sports leagues tried to continue operating to the best they could.  Even though the war was on everyone's minds, the leagues basically felt it was their duty to help keep public morale high by playing.  The NFL even had more direct contributions by selling war bonds to fans and [scheduling exhibition games against the military teams as charity events](https://redd.it/qrxznd), with the money being raised going to various funds.

Funny enough, the 1943 Bears nearly killed pro sports for the rest of the war: before the season, [a handful of their players were investigated by the government's War Manpower Commission](https://redd.it/8p322v) because they were suspected of dodging their work in the factories to play football.

I feel the more likely reason is Teven wanted to be an OT, and the staff wanted him at OG. He was probably frustrated training his whole career (and going back and forth between LT and RT his time with the Bears) at OT only to be forced to switch to OG. 

This is very common with a lot of lineman. Teven might've thought they were ruining his development with the inconsistency and position switches (which happens all the time), but he was ultimately losing the camp battles with the other OTs. I think the first preseason game made him realize he might actually have to switch to crack the starting lineup, because he was struggling with outside speed in his preseason reps vs 2s and 3s.

Reason for the shortage is 

1.) DBs are generally thought of as WRs who couldn't catch, and no kid wants to admit they can't catch.

and 

2.) Kids wanna score TDs, WRs do and CBs don't.

However there is tons of unknowns in GB and TB about how the roster will actually perform. Yes they have HOF rodgers and TB12, but with OL changes, offensive weapons, and just years of sustained success. There is a chance for regression. Not saying they will be bad, but they are both teams that should regress, same as the Chiefs. If they don’t they don’t.

Yes I am a bears fan, but let’s be honest Packers lose WR1, don’t replace him. They have their top 2 OL injured. They also lost another center. That OL is being rated high preseason because they have historically been good. They very well could be good, but without Bahk and Jenkins that’s going to be tough. Their defense should be good, but again with their players playing so well, they likely will have a few older players regress. It’s natural, again If they don’t it’s a top 10 unit.

“With Justin, I’m so happy I got my pick on him, because he’s just going to continue to get better. The picks won’t happen every single time. He’s a heck of a talent, he’s going to continue to learn – they just gotta build around him”

""I want to emphasize at the outset that we and Deshaun recognize that sexual assault and harassment are not only unlawful, but morally wrong. It takes courage for women to come forward to report being mistreated, particularly when they attach their names to a lawsuit.  We do not take these allegations lightly.  However, fairness to the accused is equally as important.

Opposing counsel has orchestrated a circus-like atmosphere by using social media to publicize 14 “Jane Doe” lawsuits during the past seven days in a manner calculated to inflame the public and malign Deshaun’s otherwise sterling reputation.  In addition, the tactic of refusing our requests to confidentially provide the names of the plaintiffs so we can fully investigate their claims makes uncovering the truth extremely difficult. Anonymity is often necessary as a shield for victims but opposing counsel has used it as a sword to publicly humiliate Deshaun before the truth‑seeking process can even begin.

I believe that any allegation that Deshaun forced a woman to commit a sexual act is completely false.  And in the one case in which we have been able to identify a plaintiff, we have strong evidence showing the allegation is false.  In January of this year, a woman attempted to blackmail Deshaun by demanding $30,000 in exchange for her “indefinite silence” about what she stated was a consensual encounter. It is our belief this woman is the plaintiff in Cause No. 2021-15613. (Please see the attached declaration by Bryan Burney.)  This calls into question the legitimacy of the other cases as well.

We have received numerous unsolicited comments in the past week from many licensed massage therapists who have worked with Deshaun in recent years. These women describe him as a gentleman and a model client who never engaged in inappropriate conduct. Indeed, before these salacious claims, everyone who associated with Deshaun described him as an outstanding, respectful, and compassionate man.

Again, we are taking the allegations very seriously but we ask only that people not rush to judgment, that people not be unduly influenced by opposing counsel’s antics, and that they let fundamental fairness to both sides rule the day. Thank you for your patience and understanding.""

I get wanting to have a “sure thing” at WR with how important it is for Fields’ development, but outside of giving Chark 1y at $10mil idk what else we could really do. We currently have $14mil in cap space to fill 35+ spots and that’s without $8-10mil of that being used on Chark.

I completely disagree that our offseason plans indicate whatsoever that Poles doesn’t believe in Fields. I think that’s a ridiculous jump, but I get the frustration, I really do.

Teams are almost never just one player away. It’s natural to look at one weakness from the previous season and convince yourself that if you address it you’re headed to the Super Bowl. But it’s rarely that simple. Players get older or injured, or their play declines. Coaching staffs experience turnover. Locker room dynamics change. Rivals improve.


This period on the NFL calendar can be intoxicating for general managers, owners and coaches. It feels like there are so many different ways to improve the roster. But it’s important to have an honest assessment of the state of your franchise before jumping into free agency or making a big trade.


And discipline matters. “Walk-away” numbers can help remove emotion and can keep impulses in check. The idea is to come up with pre-defined parameters for how far you’re willing to go to land a player — either in free agency or via trade. If the price goes beyond your pre-determined mark, move on.


It sounds so simple, but these are high-pressure environments, and every year we see teams act irrationally, fall in love and decide they have to have a specific player.

45253,287697,287697,lulzjihad,"So what’s next?

“We’ll adjust and we’ll keep adding players,” Poles said. “It’s out of your control. It’s just part of the deal where you put your best foot forward and we did. We came strong.

“There’s always work to be done. ... We’ve been in conversations with other people that are still out there, too. There’s always work to be done, especially up front, so we’ll keep at it.”

What the Bears haven’t done yet is identify a replacement for James Daniels, who left for the Pittsburgh Steelers in free agency, and they have yet to specify a plan at offensive tackle. Poles indicated the team could look at second-year players Teven Jenkins and Larry Borom at the tackle positions. He was noncommittal about which side they would play but this was more than he offered the last time he spoke at the scouting combine.
Part of the hesitation is fair. Personnel staff and coaches want to see players on grass. They want to work with them. But it’s also an indication of the serious level of need in the trenches.

“They will compete, but at the same time, we’re always looking to add talent as well,” Poles said of Borom and Jenkins. “If we add another tackle, I want to see all of those guys compete.",2.0,chibears,t3_tqkpc3,False,0.0,Smokin' Jay,2022-03-28T17:14:15Z,chibears,0.007032065888502
45254,287698,287698,lulzjihad,"Few of the nuggets are here, in case it’s behind a paywall:

“I know Teven was right in college, Larry was left in college, so there’s a comfort level there, but Teven played some left last year coming off his whole medical situation, so we’re going to play with that and we’ll see what the best fit is.”

Some around the league said they expect the Bears to pursue a veteran left tackle. Pickings are slim but there are more options to consider than last August when the team scrambled to sign Jason Peters.

Eric Fisher is available after spending last season with the Indianapolis Colts. Fisher returned after suffering a torn Achilles tendon at the end of 2020 with the Kansas City Chiefs, so he was working through that at the start of the season and later was hampered by a pectoral injury.

If the Bears sign Fisher or another veteran, it would create a situation in which Jenkins and Borom compete for the right tackle job. Maybe one could be bumped into right guard, presumably the spot Bates was going to play if the team landed him.

But Poles said he “can’t force something,” meaning he can’t add a player at that left tackle spot if there’s not a fit.

“Larry played in the SEC at left, I think he’ll be fine,” Poles said. 

“Teven played last year at left, he has room to grow. So they’ve done it. Yeah, sure, I would love to have experience but sometimes it’s just the way it all plays out.”

The Bears have two draft picks in Round 2 and one in Round 3, and that can be a fruitful area to find solid interior linemen. 

They’re unlikely to land a future left tackle there. Plus, the depth chart at wide receiver needs more work and there are multiple needs in the secondary at cornerback and safety.

In other words, Halas Hall remains a work in progress but Poles believes steps have been made to better support Fields.

“It’s a difficult challenge,” he said. “But I think as a whole with the scheme, with coaching, with some of the additions we’ve had, I think it’s going to get better. I think he’s going to be put in a situation where he’s going to be comfortable, and I’ve said this all the way back to the very beginning, allowing him to do what he does best is going to allow him to grow from that point.

Pace and Nagy began their QB search early in 2019, which must’ve coincided with them realizing Trubisky’s just never going to have that “it” factor, and I’m sure Pace focused on those traits to make sure he didn’t make the same mistake again when identifying which QB to go after in the draft. Still can’t believe it all came together. Of course, he still has tons of room to grow, but those are the big things you look for in a QB’s growth, and I remember Patrick Mahomes mastered this early on in his first year starting - now, it’s going to be as much a matter of consistency with Fields, as the maker of the video mentioned.",1.0,chibears,t3_q482u4,False,0.0,Smokin' Jay,2021-10-09T22:39:06Z,chibears,0.0806982294792136

8-8 obviously isn’t the goal, but you also have to realize that Pace took over very likely the least talented defensive roster, possibly the least talented and one of the oldest overall rosters in football, and within 2 years had the Bears back to being a top 10 defense (only team to have a top 10 defense three years in a row from 2017-2019), and by year 3 in 2018 had created the best defense of the 2010s by DVOA (ahead of peak LOB Seahawks and the Broncos defense that carried Manning to his 2nd SB win), not to mention the best run defense by DVOA in the Bears entire history (5th best run defense of all time by DVOA).

Damien Williams has been serviceable and Quinn at least has Mack on the other side with Gipson behind them as a promising young player that had a super productive game. If JJ went out, it’d be Artie Burns. 

If you go by the more conventional definition of most valuable, or just by straight up production, it’d have to be Montgomery, IMO.

45313,287765,287765,lulzjihad,"I knew this would be the response. You’re naming teams, and you’re going by who got better. Not comparing actual draft picks panning out. Like the Titans 1st round OT that was cut at the end of his rookie season. In fact, the Titans 2020 draft has to be one of the worst drafts in recent memory - not a single starter. Robinson’s not a bad GM though, but I still point out that since arriving in 2017, only 2 of his 36 players drafted have had any sort of recognition/Pro Bowls/All-Pros or are considered blue-chip players (Henry and Byard). 

And you’re honestly saying Jason Licht and Steve Kiem have been better at drafting compared to Ryan Pace? I lived in Arizona so I know the Cardinals drafts a lot closer than others and let me tell you, he’s atrocious at drafting. Made a great decision in cutting ties with Rosen and drafting Murray, along with the trade with BOB for Hopkins, but let’s not forget he drafted Rosen in the first place, or that he has at least one or two drafts that didn’t net a single starter at all. Murray and Kirk are literally the only draft picks from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 draft classes that were hits, with Simmons being an iffy one (most cardinals fans would say he so far has been a very regrettable pick). 

Jason Licht’s 2016 draft had 1st/2nd/2nd rounders spent on Hargreaves, Noah Spence, and Robert Aguayo, a kicker that they cut. This guy drafted Jamies Winston, his 2017 1st/2nd was OJ Howard and some safety they cut two years later, but he has done better since 2018. 

Others you mentioned, like Brandon Beane of the Bills, on the other hand, have been great at drafting. It’s too exhausting to name out all the draft picks that did or didn’t pan out from each of these teams, but I hope you get my point. The Saints and Ravens have better drafting GMs, as do a few other teams. But the point of all of this work is that if you actually look at the draft picks, other GMs have similar 1st/2nd round pick success as Pace but nowhere near the late round success. Maybe they make up for it by their FA acquisitions. But most don’t.

But, you point out all these successful examples, without accounting for the possibility that they may have ended up being good in spite of that. Or they might have been lucky to have avoided getting into those bad habits. Or they may have been even better even quicker had they not started right away. Who knows. There’s a chance that out of all the countless busts at QB taken in the top 5 or top 10, at least some of them would have had wildly different careers had they not been thrown into the fire too early. And if you don’t believe me, Jay Cutler recently made this exact point in that interview with Pat McAfee. Not saying that makes it true, but this is coming from someone who’s actually played QB in the NFL.

You’re making the common mistake of judging him by all the picks he’s missed on, without realizing how much of a crapshoot the draft is. That’s why I suggested you compare him to other GMs. Nobody is going to have even close to a 70% hit rate. Even the first round, you’ll be hard pressed to find a team over 50% as the sample size gets large enough to differentiate accordingly. 

Jaylon Johnson already looks like a premier, top CB. Pace got him at pick 50. He’s PFF’s 2nd highest graded CB this year. Mooney and Kmet have been quiet this year, but Mooney broke the Bears rookie receiving record as a 5th round pick. If you read that Athletic article from the start of the season where they interview 4 scouts to break down the Bears roster, as all over the place as they were on many player evaluations, all 4 raves about Kmet’s potential, surprisingly stating that they believe he’ll be a top 5-10 starter and blue chip player pretty soon (not that I necessarily agree, and he’s been quiet so far this year). Kindle Vildor has stepped in and held his own as a CB in his first year starting, and he also was a late round pick last year. This is all just from last year’s draft alone.

Also, Cody Whitehair doesn’t need to be able to snap perfectly, we play him at guard, and that’s what we drafted him to be. He’s a 2-time Pro Bowler at guard. Daniels may not live up to the first round hype he was getting predeaft but he’s absolutely not bad as you suggested, and he’s like 22 still. 

You just listed out a bunch of draft picks that didn’t pan out - literally every team has tons of those over the last few years. Instead, compare him to other GMs. You probably haven’t, because it’s way easier to criticize without spending any effort getting to the truth. 

Just keep in mind that Pace inherited the least talented, oldest defense in the NFL when he took over, and within 3 seasons was able to turn it into the best defense of the 2010s by DVOA. And the best run defense in Bears history by DVOA. You can say it was Fangio, but which defense did Fangio run that outperformed that 2018 defense? His 49ers defenses and Broncos defenses, although good, statistically haven’t come close. Criticize Eddie Jackson for his play now, but Pace did find an All-Pro FS in the 4th round that year, and that’s not even the only All-Pro he found in that round of that draft. He got Jordan Howard and Amos in the 5th. Tarik Cohen, All-Pro returner in the 4th. Kwiatkowski, a defensive captain for the Raiders in the 4th. UDFA in Bryce Callahan (highest graded nickel per PFF two separate seasons), RRH, and C Meredith (who definitely played as a solid WR2 his short career with us). Bilal Nichols 5th. David Montgomery in the 3rd. Goldman in the 2nd, who’s a 2-time Pro Bowler at NT, which is tough to do.

45341,287793,287793,lulzjihad,"Nitpicky, but the defensive touchdowns did not make anywhere the difference you think it made - 6 touchdowns over the course of a season isn’t enough to explain that magic. They were a product of the insanely high turnovers, as well as the massive amounts of pressure the defense put on opposing QBs. Hicks, Goldman, and Mack completely took away the run (our 2018 run defense was a top 5 run defense of all time by DVOA, and actually the best in our history, believe it or not). With no run game, and having to face pressure from Mack, Hicks, and Floyd, and having to throw against what was the best secondary I’ve ever seen on the Bears - with career years from all 5 starters in Fuller (All-Pro), Jackson (All-Pro), Amukamara, Amos, and Callahan - it was a nightmare for each QB to go up against us. That’s the only time in my life I’ve seen a Bears defense shut down nearly every QB they faced, and absolutely frustrate the shit outta both Brady and Rodgers (for 1.5 games at least). It was beautiful. 

From an offensive standpoint, we still had the fundamentals of a strong outside zone running game from Fox’s tenure, with that offensive line (Leno playing his career best season, Whitehair playing lights out in the run game) and Jordan Howard, although Nagy strayed from that to install his west coast spread hybrid inside zone scheme, which still worked since there was no tape on nearly any part of our passing offense, at least not together and with the Bears, with Robinson, Gabriel, Burton all being added that offseason, and Trubisky’s weaknesses not yet exposed. At that point, defenses still viewed his passing ability as a threat (somewhat) as his intermediate accuracy was still a strength of his like we saw in college, and he wowed on that 6 TD game against TB early on - and most of all, his ability to scramble as well as escape a collapsing pocket augmented an offense that just needed to be average to win with that insane defense. 
Teams didn’t know how to gameplan against Mack and Hicks on the same line yet. Vic Fangio didn’t let them figure it out while he was there, and employed a ton of stunts and pass rushing techniques to get tons of pressure with just 4 rushers - something I see a lot of in Desai already - while also maximizing the talent he had at DB.

45344,287796,287796,lulzjihad,"According to Olin Kreutz, most of the Chicago sports journalists, as well as some inferences made on quotes from Bears coaches, Mustipher’s main strength by far is his intelligence and understanding of the game, especially with calling and adjusting protections and getting everyone on the line on the correct assignment. Kreutz has even said he feels that this was as big of a deal regarding the line’s dramatic improvement as getting Coward out the lineup, playing weaker defenses, and utilizing Trubisky’s mobility. It’s something that’s been echoed across the league. I think physically he has a lot to be desired unfortunately, but the issues Fields was having seem to be more due to inexperience and unfamiliarity practicing with his teammates, and I’d assume it would massively improve as he logs more and more practice time. Ideally, yes, it’d be nice having some competition at the position, but given our salary cap constraints it’s more than understandable that they held off. In an ideal world, Borom establishes himself as an above average LT and Jenkins comes in as a stud RT but that looks a long way away at this point.


Btw, as a response to him getting manhandled against good teams, I think the value he brings with his strength is how much better he makes the rest of his line perform when he’s in, which isn’t easily noticeable if you evaluate him on his block win rate vs failure, instead something you can really only compare with his replacement, which, has been Whitehair at center, and unfortunately there’s a ton of confounding variables to this, but the line did look exponentially better after Mustipher was named the starter (but Coward was replaced, Trubisky was in, we played terrible defenses, so a ton could’ve contributed to that).",3.0,chibears,t3_ptbvpp,False,0.0,Smokin' Jay,2021-09-22T19:23:29Z,chibears,0.0350826210653238

I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, since I seem to be alone in this opinion, but I feel like Nagy did a good job - his offense actually seemed to work, and Montgomery, Kmet, and Dalton to some extent were impressive. That defense we played was top 2 in the NFL last season (them vs the Bucs imo). I was expecting us to struggle to move the ball down the field at all, but our running game and quick passing game did surprisingly well, and if our secondary wasn’t complete shit, this game would’ve been pretty close.

Yes, this season is going to be long. And it sucks having a defense that has a great D-line get decimated due to poor coverage, but I saw Nagy’s offense work actually for the first time since 2018.

No, this is incorrect. There are tons of regulations that ensure this doesn't happen. Some states require monthly notices to both insureds and claimants giving them an update on the status of claims. 

The reality is that some claims are black and white, it's either covered or not. If it's covered, it's paid right away. If it's not, it's denied right away. If it's a gray area, outside of health insurance (which I will never work for) most companies are erring on the side of paying.

It's called a ""contract of adhesion"".

It essentially means if there is a question of coverage, the insurance company must pay.

>Insurance companies aren’t a bank, they’re betting they will pay less than they collect in aggregate. Their WACC works like any other company. They have a meaningful financial incentive to fight to ensure any gray area falls in their favor, even when against the spirit of the policy.

You're partially correct. Underwriting approves policies with the anticipation that the premiums collected will outweigh losses paid out. But accidents happen. It's the balance of risk.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. 

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. 

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too.

I think Pace rolled the dice on Trubisky and it didn't work out. You get one shot with a high level pick, and though I disagree with the trade up, he can't control that Trubisky was a bust. There's no guarantee on any player in the draft.

If Trubisky had been who we hoped he would be, people would be circlejerking about Pace. There are plenty of QBs, and even more players that were drafted at high draft position in the past where the concensus was that it was the correct call, and it didn't work out. That's life.  At least he took a shot. Some GMs just sit on their hands.

50298,314730,314730,patrick_e,"> if you followed everything Poles had been saying, this is more or less what his plan was from the get go.

This is why I have confidence in Poles. Well, to an extent. He still has plenty to prove, but he clearly has a plan. Pace seemed to just get enamored with talent and sell the farm to get it. That was his plan--just fall in love in the draft, release the vets ahead so the rookies get all the snaps, rinse, repeat. 

So far, Poles seems to have a clear plan, like all good teams do. 

- rebuild the OL (we've seen that happen in the draft and via cheap free agent signings) 
- emphasize special teams (drafted VJJ and Ebner, both great returners. Testing Bojack on the return team) to steal some close wins 
- find the easiest place to rebuild and start there. There's some good talent in the front 7, but our secondary was terrible last year. Two second round picks later, our secondary has a lot more talent. 

So, he's building up defense and special teams. What are the strengths on offense? Montgomery and Herbert, plus one hell of an athlete at QB. What are the weaknesses? WR and pass blocking. If you implement a conservative, clock-chewing offense with lots of runs and play-action deep passes (playing to Fields's strengths) and have good play on D/ST? You're at least competitive in most games. 

Now, he still has to hit on the picks and signings. There's a lot that can still go wrong. But there are so many out of town stupid national pundits who see the lack of a big WR or LT signing and say, ""Wow, what are the Bears doing?"" 

I think it couldn't be more clear what they're doing, and the thing is he's pretty much told us what he was going to do...and then he's done it. Give Fields a simple offense that plays to his strengths, build his confidence, get a few more W's than you're supposed to, and then next year you have more picks and more $$ to continue to fix holes (specifically in the passing game).",22.0,chibears,t3_wa99b8,False,0.0,69,2022-07-28T09:55:29Z,chibears,0.0315880735804903

50317,314755,314755,patrick_e,"1. Nothing in your citation says Halas was responsible for the ban on black players. It’s literally just, “Well he probably had something to do with it.” The team has reckoned with that time, and discussed it in a book on team history (that’s pretty open). Halas was reasonably progressive for his day, but that’s obviously still pretty regressive for today’s standards. Erasing his initials doesn’t erase his history. It just makes it less likely to be reckoned with. It’s clear his daughter and his grandkids don’t stand with that ban, and as the article is very clear about, it’s murky at best where Halas himself stood. 
What we do know is that the Bears signed the first black QB in NFL history. We also know that the Bears have a black GM, a black assistant GM, had a black head coach (tied with Dungy for first in the SB) for 9 years, had the first black GM (…in fairness he never had the title, but had the position/authority from ‘93-96). The bears donate hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to racial equality causes. Not race, but they currently have a female scout in the scouting dept, something that’s not common. They’re literally reckoning with their past in real time. Maybe we should respect when people grow and learn and change? 

2. The units are beautiful, I have no idea what you’re taking about. They’re consistently rated highly in uniform rankings. It’s such a classic design. It’s an homage to the history of the Bears and their importance in the history of the league. Which, since we’re not very good, is at least something. 

3. Chicago will always struggle vs LA, NYC, and maybe some warmer climates. But that has everything to do with location and nothing to do with team policies. If you think three initials on a sleeve is the difference between being a good franchise and a mediocre one…yikes. I’m not sure what works you’re living in. The Bears have gotten key free agents when they’ve wanted to. Hell, the Redskins did, and they’ve been an overtly racist organization for decades. 

When it comes to original families (NYG, Ari Cards, Steelers and Bears) the Halas/McCaskey clan is at worst middle of the pack and at best on the progressive end (especially as time went on, which means a lot—Halas was willing to learn  and change). And the team now is really on a forward trajectory that embraces both the flaws of its past and also the possibility to be better moving forward.

Of course it’s easier to mask 20% of your OL being bad than it is masking 60%. But “a stable veteran presence” doesn’t necessarily do that (the one caveat being a Center, since they call protections, a veteran C with the same physical ability [or even slightly less talented] will add more to the line than a less experienced C). 

I think we’re in agreement that the Bears, in a vacuum, would be better off in 2022 with Peters. Where I think we start to differ is saying that having Peters (or some commensurate entity) on the line is the best move in the long-term. I don’t think anyone, including the front office, knows that yet, which is why he hasn’t been signed when he’s (at least IMO) clearly indicated interest. 

There’s a lot of young talent on the OL and unless you’ve been at every mini camp and OTA, and the FO conversations in-between, the truth is none of us really know how these guys are performing and how to feel a lot them. Im not saying we should uncritically trust a front office; Im a Bears fan, I would never suggest that.

He is still quick, he is still accurate. But between our absolutely inconsistent Oline and terrible play calls and scheme, we’re not giving him a chance. His quickness should help overcome Oline deficiencies, but he’s not. Time to find the why’s.

He’s mobile, strong arm, has a lot of qualities that should counter the inconsistent o line and lack of success in the passing game. But he’s not. Part of it is that he’s a rookie and still learning, but he’s still not developing at a steady rate. Time to find the why’s.

Not to bore people with the complicated situation with the Bears but i'll try and explain. The Chicago Park District owns Solider field so technically it is a public stadium. It is this way because of the location on the lake. Part of what makes Chicago special is the entire lake front is publicly owned parks/museums/land. Those parks have a massively successful legal team to keep it that way. Being owned by the Chicago Park District would make things difficult for the public not to be on the hook for some funds unless the Bears are serious about building a new stadium in the suburbs (Which I don't think they will).

had just gotten married the previous May so besides our honeymoon, traveling to Chicago from southeast Missouri was our first big trip to plan as a married couple.

we had a little Kia spectra car and i was worried if there was snow we wouldn’t make it, so we instead caught an overnight train from St. Louis to Chicago. Not too bad, boarded around 1am I think, dozed off, woke up in Chicago.

We stayed downtown, walked to the game, didn’t wear warm enough shoes, and watched from the nosebleeds.

i remember that a blocked PAT by us earlier in the game kept us from losing when Favre/Rice scored on the final drive of regulation. Robbie kicked an OT FG that most the stadium thought went in. then Hillenmeyer forced an AP fumble. Cutty came to the line in what seemed to be a run formation, called a check at the line, and threw a bomb on the first play to 19, ballgame. 

I thought he was gonna be legit, but about two years later I got his jersey for $5 at Bourbonnais.

57644,358531,358531,work4work4work4work4,"> There are MUCH stronger unions in the US than the NFLPA.

There sure are. That's why I said one of the strongest though, not the strongest or anything like that. It also doesn't change the fact that they are still one of the strongest unions in the US. 

Police associations are also a completely different animal and aren't even seen as representative of American labor unions these days. Much of the discussion at the upper echelons of labor is whether or not they should be expelled for the damage they do to the larger movement, or kept ""in house"" as a way to attempt to change and moderate them over time to stop acting outside the interest of other workers and the general public. This kind of sentiment isn't new though. If you go back to the beginnings of the American labor movement in the 19th century, you had police associations violently responding to most organized actions by any other labor groups then too.

But I digress, to get back to your initial ""question"" I mean strength in that you can rank the NFLPA as the weakest of the 4 major sports unions, and it's still stronger than the strongest non-sports unions in the US like NEA, SEIU, AFSCME, IBT, and others because of the way the laws in the US are written.

In a way both police unions and the NFLPA both enjoy the same kind of advantage of operating under a different legal framework than other unions and from that creating a unique leverage other groups do not have. This is also why teachers unions which were historically so strong began to weaken greatly when laws were put in to prevent them from striking as the threat of parents losing their childcare was often stronger better leverage at creating a good education than just getting kids a good education at the negotiating table. 

The NFL relies heavily on various allowances by the Feds to maintain their empire so if push goes to shove, the NFL does not want the NFLPA doing anything that might jeopardize those allowances.

My table has a column for position (according to Pro football reference) because most of them aren't even WRs

Rank   | Player | Position | Yards
| ----- |------|--------|-----
1 | Johnny Morris | Flanker/HB | 5059 |
2 | Harlon Hill | End | 4616 |
3 | Alshon Jeffery | WR | 4549 |
4 | Walter Payton | RB | 4538 |
5 | Mike Ditka | TE | 4503 |
6 | Curtis Conway | WR | 4498 
7 | Matt Forte | RB | 4116 |
8 | Marty Booker | WR | 3895
9 | Willie Gault | WR | 3650 |
10 | Ken Kavanaugh | End | 3626 

It takes the Bears top 8 leading receiving yardage leaders to get to 5 ""WRs"" (if you can call Johnny Morris a WR, it's arguable he kind of isn't. The first half of his career he had more rushing yards than receiving). And even then Johnny Morris and Harlon Hill are maybe on the edge of like ""Hall of Really Good"". For their eras, they were good players but the WR position didn't even really exist or function like it does now. And even then, it took Johnny Morris 10 years and Harlon Hill 8 years to get those pretty forgettable numbers.

After those two ""bright spots"", there was a flash in the pan where the Bears had Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffrey, and then there's Allen Robinson, but besides those 3 guys, there's hardly another WR the Bears have ever rostered that even deserved a starting job in the NFL. The Bears QB history is about 100000x better than this sorry bunch.

So. If Allen Robinson gets tagged next year (I expect he will be, he's certainly worth more than his second franchise tag number of ~22 million) and he puts up more than 954 yards/year over the next two years, which is much worse than what he's done the last 2 years, he will be the Bears franchise receiving yardage leader by the end of the 2022 season.",1.0,nfl,t3_od7fxt,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2021-07-04T12:52:13Z,chibears,0.0119429466428735
