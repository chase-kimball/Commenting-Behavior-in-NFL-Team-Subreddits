Not because he's not skilled, but because of his selfish and immature behavior.

We know who the legit QBs are in the league, and we know which teams are early favorites to go deep in the playoffs. Yet again, waiting until week 4 is him selfishly hedging his bet rather than doing the hard work of elevating his team.

4115,20297,20297,BaconDwarf,"It's a good question! The short answer is: you're probably not going to make yourself constipated if you're getting enough fluids, too. For ""how much"": map out your average daily diet, total up the fiber levels you're getting, and see how that looks compared to recommendations. 

It's also important to note that a high fiber diet with foods is different than using a soluble fiber. It kinda gets complicated but it's recommended you get what you can from foods and use the supplement to help - rather than a replacement. The article I link below estimates only 5% of folks are getting enough fiber.

Too much anything is going to be a negative. It's really important to get enough water if you're using a fiber supplement (which is why most dissolve in water as part of their administration). 

It would be pretty damn unusual for the average person to get constipation levels of fiber in their diet, assuming there's no other underlying issues. If you're a normal size guy, for example, you're recommended to get about 38 grams a day.

Now consider a big Metamucil dosage is like 6 grams if you're putting in two servings. You'd really have to go wild on the fiber to go over your daily value.

But of course those numbers are going to vary from person to person. Smaller people need less. Some people naturally ""bind up"" more. And yes, paradoxically, fiber can *help* ease constipation or cause it to get *worse*. It really depends. 

The good news is it's one of the most benign ""drugs"" you can take and you'll know in 1-2 days how it impacts you. I only drink a single serving every day and it helps keep my stool far more regular. If I stop using it, I experience mild IBS symptoms. I could probably clean up my diet enough to not need it, but when it comes to drinking a single serving of the stuff in the morning or needing to eat perfect - you can guess which one easier to achieve. 

You can find all kinds of great info about this on the internet from reputable sources. Here's one to get you started which covers all the big talking points with good science: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5413815/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5413815/)

To answer your question: No, I don't want them to do taxes.

All these teams, including the Packers, make more than enough to fund their own way without asking for additional help. That's the point.

586k views on them combined... people sure are not liking them. You really got me there. And no, you really have no clue what you're talking about. 

I just like replying to people that act like a know it all, and that their opinion holds more weight than everyone else's. Imagine calling something too long compared to the original when its literally 20 seconds longer. You're a clown. I'd really love to see you make one, but you wont.

> universal praise since v2

Don't even know what that's supposed to mean considering every time I make these they garner a ton of traction. I couldn't care less about Reddit ""Internet points"". This sub is a cesspool anyways. 

You can defend someone without acting like a dick and calling someone out. It's a fucking video about a football meme bro. 

I'm far from crying. Just felt the need to reply, since it's clear you don't know what your talking about, and that was very clear with the ""far-too-long"" comment. Plus the super cringe ""not faithful to the original"" point. Like I have to model my videos 100% after said original.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word.

6356,32048,32048,CaptainCorpse666,"""It could be argued that Mike McCarthy will enter the 2022-23 NFL season sitting on one of the hottest seats of any head coach in the league. Since (and even before) the Cowboys first-round playoff exit last season, the pressure has been building for McCarthy. It dialed up even more with offseason rumors swirling around former Saints head coach Sean>Payton, who’s now on the market .But it’s still a little surprising to see McCarthy, one of only eight active NFL head coaches to have won a Super Bowl, rank so low among his peers. CBS Sports recently released their rankings of NFL head coaches leading into the 2022 season, and McCarthy comes in at No. 18 on the list as he begins his third year as the Cowboys’ head coach. He’s seven spots below the next guy with a Super Bowl ring, that >being the Jaguars’ Doug Pederson at No. 11.“The pendulum has probably swung a little >too far in terms of criticizing McCarthy, even if he did have Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay,” >CBS Sports’ Cody Benjamin writes. “He’s now compiled nine different double-digit-win >seasons, including 2021 with Dallas. He’s also wisely given plenty of control to play-caller >Kellen Moore. And yet, with so much talent at his disposal, ill-timed, old-school decisions >have too often doomed him. Maybe that’s why team owner Jerry Jones publicly ponders >about canning him for his own defensive coordinator. ”McCarthy is lumped in with fellow >old-schooler Ron Rivera at No. 19 and the two look like outliers in that area of the rankings, flanked on both sides by rookie coaches and one-year guys like Brandon Staley (San Diego) and Nick Sirianni (Philadelphia).Andy Reid tops the list with 2022 Super Bowl champion Sean McVay trailing behind at No. 2 and the immortal Bill Belicheck at No. 3.It’s no coincidence that those top coaches were the coaches on three of the last four most recent Super Bowl teams. Perhaps McCarthy can join the top echelon of the ranks by adding another ring to his resume with the Cowboys.""",2.0,greenbaypackers,t3_vzwcua,False,0.0,:69:,2022-07-15T14:27:58Z,greenbaypackers,0.0310273962291505

**Edit:** What I said above was flawed. I misinterpreted Ticketmaster's account implementation. With that said, ownership is a very loose term. While your information (or token, which TM generated for your account) is now included in this particular blockchain, the NFL still owns the copyright to the video and thus there is nothing preventing the NFL from minting this video as a NFT on another blockchain. So, the current artificial scarcity is not guaranteed. In addition, your ""ownership"" doesn't limit the access to the video in which the NFT is associated with. Anyone can still view it...at least until TM deletes it from their servers. Then nobody can...not even you - the owner.

Good teams respect and listen to their veterans and consider their thoughts in decision making - good examples of this include the Bucs with Brady, the Saints with Brees, the Colts and then Broncos with Manning, etc.

It reminds me of the later years of the McCarthy era when McCarthy would call dumb plays and get the Packers into a bind and then Aaron would take over play calling in the 2-minute drill when things got desperate and suddenly they would be unstoppable. But McCarthy didn't want to admit that Aaron had become better at play calling than he was, because his ego wouldn't let him.

Now we're seeing the same thing with the FO, they won't admit that Aaron actually has a lot of value to contribute in making roster decisions as they relate to the offense and especially he passing game. I think trading up for Love was an arrogant move - believing that you could be that confident in a guy that apparently most of the rest of the league was cool with passing on - and then doubling down on your arrogance by not having a conversation with your HoF QB who you're blatantly working towards replacing.

Even removing the polarizing Love pick, it doesn't appear to be very good. 5 of the 8 other picks may not be rostered this year. Right now Dillon and maybe Degura appear to be the only locks to contribute this year, with Degura being the only starter. This is not ideal for a team about to be cap strapped. 



Packers 20 draft recap

•Love- didn't play, looked above average during preseason considering not much talent around him. One can hope we get three great QB's in succession.

•Dillon- shows talent, but was a 3rd string player without the ability to help in ST. I was worried he couldn't catch anything, but he looked good when asked.

•Degura- ACL injury. Excited to see if he makes a difference this year.

•Martin- cut after 1 year at a position we are not very strong at, not good.

• Runyan- thought he played really well when asked. Probably won't play much this year.

•Hansen- Practice squad last year, not sure he'll make the cut this year.

•Stepaniak- taking a injury prone interior lineman was weird, now retired from injuries. Never played a down 

•Scott- 7th rounder could make it this year? Could be cut too.

•Garvin- not sure what to make of this dude. Thought he looked good at times in the preseason.",1.0,greenbaypackers,t3_pdvnzm,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2021-08-29T22:01:49Z,greenbaypackers,0.0179108114244925

* \#178 - Shemar Jean-Charles (CB):  C+. Low ceiling, slow but incredible work ethic. Hope this guy can at least play special teams. Avery Williams from BSU has elite speed, similar size and it's a electric returner.

* \#214 - Cole Van Lanen (OT/G):  B+. Cool story, hopefully the next Tauscher?!? Makes me think Turner and Patrick are in danger.

They will never fire a GM after back to back 13-3 seasons.

Before you say the Favre situation was different, he was washed up, contemplating retirement, etc. In my opinion he was treated worse. TT came in and gutted that team, no QB in the history of the NFL had a chance to succeed with that roster. Every veteran player was cut or not resigned for comp picks, Sherman was a lame duck coach and they were staring down a rebuild with a 37 year old HOF QB, who wouldn't contemplate retirement?!?

With Rodgers we kept home grown talent and signed free agents, and got rid of the lame duck head coach, and gave him an extension. In 2017-2018 he missed a ton of throws he should've made, especially on deep balls. When he came back this year, he looks like he gained 20lbs of muscle and played amazing.

12962,80784,80784,Goodbye_Hercules,"On an outside zone play, which is McVay's bread-and-butter, the RB is usually aiming towards the outside hip of the playside tackle and usually has three reads from the outside in:

* If the outermost blocker (playside TE/tackle) gets a reach block, **bounce** it to the sideline

* If the outermost blocker doesn't get a reach, **bang** it inside to the first available hole

* If neither are open, **bend** it and cut back to the middle/weakside

To counter this, the Pats ran a 6-1 front which basically allowed the DL and LBs to get upfield and take away the bang/bend, and set the edge to take away the bounce as well as the jet sweeps and bootlegs. It's pretty hard in general to run against a 6-1, but one way to have some success is to run man/gap schemes instead of zone. IIRC McVay hadn't implemented them into his playbook at the time. 

To stop the pass, they ran a lot of hybrid and match-zone coverages with some zero blitz on 3rd downs. They'd also come out in one look and then rotate to a completely different one when the play clock hit 15 seconds.

But this defense though—could be a championship contender if they keep it up the rest of the season and we get guys back healthy. Holding Mahomes to 13, including 2 RZ stops, is impressive especially with said injuries. 

Special teams is fucking trash lmao

3rd round - Alex Green (RB) - 510 rushing yards - 3 years in the NFL

4th round - Davon House (CB) - Actually looked liked a decent 4th round player 

5th round - D.J. Williams (TE) - Played 2 years with the Packers, getting 16 receptions

6th round - Caleb Schlauderaff (G) - Traded to Jets for an undisclosed draft pick

6th round - D.J. Smith (LB) - Failed a Physical in 2013 and released by Packers

6th round - Ricky Elmore (LB) - Never made an NFL roster

7th round - Ryan Taylor (TE) - Played a decent 3 years for Packers so pretty great for a 7th rounder

Key phrase there is ""could be"" -- you and all the other conspiracy theory lovers have ZERO evidence for these claims. Meanwhile there is TONS of evidence of the efficacy of the vaccine to prevent serious illness and death. 
 
Do you ever wonder why there are so many stories of unvaccinated people on ventilators asking the doctor for a vaccine when it's way too late? (You'll probably just respond that everything is a conspiracy.) 
 
I highly recommend that you just talk to your general practitioner doctor who you trust with any other medical question and ask them honestly whether they recommend you take the vaccine. If you're truly willing to admit that you're wrong, as you say, you'll be able to accept their advice no matter what it is.

Outside of McGinn, Tom Silverstein is probably the best beat writer currently writing about GB. He actually writes about the games, instead of about the personalities or the drama, and he does a lot of work to show different aspects of the Packers' offensive and defensive schemes, or to break down why a particular play succeeded or failed.

* (Jones rolls across the goal line)
* (pause)
* ""Taking it!""

And then he's saved by the color guy. 

Dude is so scared to make the wrong call that he's looking at nothing but the official, and when the official doesn't immediately make a call, he's left with nothing to say. He's so concerned with being loud and excited-sounding when he makes the ""Touchdown!"" call that he forgets to describe the play after ""Jones has got an angle"". I know this is TV rather than radio, but you don't have to just pull a Joe Buck - you can describe what is actually happening. ""Jones lunges for the goal line. Is he in? No signal yet.""

I get not wanting to call it early, but you can say what it *looks* like. I'd rather an announcer say ""Touchdown"" and be wrong then wait 10 seconds going ""Aaaand... it is... a.... score!"" This isn't just a Buck problem, but because he's the guy Fox assigns to its biggest games, it's more visible with him. 

Additionally, you've put your finger on another part of the problem. Summerall could afford to be laconic because John Madden was so voluble, affable, and had such a knack for analysis. When he summed up a play in a couple of short phrases, he knew Madden would be able to fill in behind him with something interesting and insightful. But when Buck holds back and waits for his color commentator to fill space, he gets all the stammering incoherence that is Aikman's trademark. Aikman isn't half as articulate as Madden was, at least in his younger days, and that's saying something.

16193,102630,102630,Journeyman12,"I really don't like this. Either from a player standpoint or a precedent standpoint. 

Cobb's best season was 2014. Since then, he's lost some of his quickness, dealt with numerous injuries, and not been especially productive either in Green Bay or in his two post-Packers stops. Even so, this would've been a decent move a year ago, because the Packers were so desperate for a slot receiver that they were trotting out Tavon Austin to run the jet motion and return punts. This year, with Amari Rodgers on the team, his role isn't as clear. Injuries can happen, and it's good to have backups, but it wouldn't make much sense to play Cobb over Rodgers at this stage of his career. 

Which brings me to Aaron Rodgers the GM. 

I think Rodgers thinks he's Peyton Manning. 

In 2015, Mike McCarthy stepped back from coaching the offense and handed over more day-to-day control to Rodgers. Longtime offensive coordinator Joe Philbin had also just left for Miami, and McCarthy promoted RB coach Edgar Bennett to offensive coordinator and promoted QB coach Tom Clement to assistant head coach to help fill the void. He also gave Clement, who had never been a play-caller at the NFL level, the responsibility for calling plays. This was widely seen at the time as a delegation of authority to Rodgers, and there were newspaper stories in the preseason about how Rodgers was poised to take the next step in his career and, like Manning, use his knowledge of the game to call plays and act as an offensive coordinator on the field. 

What happened? Well, the 2015 offense was weird for a lot of reasons. Eddie Lacy got fat, Jordy Nelson tore his ACL in the preseason, Davante Adams had an ankle injury and wasn't Davante Adams yet, and the offensive line suffered numerous injuries and never really jelled. But we still got an idea of what Rodgers's vision of the offense was. Early in the season, it was incredibly safe: lots of one-step drops, screens, pick plays with Cobb, comeback routes to James Jones, and exploiting free plays for all they were worth. Most of all, it relied on Rodgers scrambling for five or six seconds before finding an open man downfield - deliberately relying on his ability to create outside the normal framework of the offense. 

And it *sucked!* Once defenses figured out how to shut down the pick plays and sat on the comeback routes, the Packers' offense dropped off a cliff. We [finished](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/index.htm#all_team_stats) 15th in total offense, 15th in scoring, 25th in passing yards, 28th in yards per play, and 28th in net yards per pass attempt. Yes, Rodgers's approach led to transcendent moments like the Hail Mary against Detroit or the two Hail Marys to tie Arizona in the playoffs, and yes, we still finished 10-6 and won a wild-card game - but we also gave away a division title with an awful Week 17 loss to a mediocre Vikings team, and certainly had a shot at beating Arizona if we could've managed more than 13 points in the first 59 minutes. 

Mike McCarthy took back control of the offense late in the 2015 season and reinstated himself as the play-caller, but Rodgers continued to push for a greater role in the offense, sometimes directly [undermining](https://www.businessinsider.com/aaron-rodgers-ignored-mike-mccarthy-calls-packers-2019-1) McCarthy's authority in the process. By 2018, the Packers had somehow gotten to a point where backups Deshone Kizer and Tim Boyle were literally [carrying messages](https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/11/29/green-bay-packers-problems-aaron-rodgers-mike-mccarthy-ted-thompson) between McCarthy and Rodgers, explaining to the *head coach of the franchise* what plays his quarterback was calling and why. That's partially on McCarthy, sure, but some of the blame has to fall on Rodgers for turning the offense into a dysfunctional, poorly performing mess. 

Peyton Manning could call plays on the field, design his own offensive system, and make it work at a Hall of Fame level because he was Peyton fucking Manning. Rodgers is a three-time MVP, a Super Bowl champion and a Hall of Fame quarterback, but he's not Peyton Manning. 

That's what worries me about Rodgers apparently demanding more input into the Packers' personnel decisions. It's not just that players should play and GMs should GM. It's that by all public indications, he's not very good at playing GM. Manning famously had a lot of input into personnel decisions in Indianapolis and Denver, and to me it feels like Rodgers wants to do the same thing. But I don't think he's going to match Manning in this area either. 

Rodgers was pissed that we cut Jordy Nelson at the end of his career when he couldn't run anymore? He was pissed that we traded Jake Kumerow, our 27-year-old No. 6 receiver with 20 career catches? Seriously? Now we're trading for Randall Cobb, apparently because Rodgers wants him back, even though he'll turn 31 in August and hasn't had a great season since 2014, and even though we have a younger, probably better guy at that position that we just drafted literally this offseason. Oh, and he's going to come with a big price tag, at a time when the Packers are struggling to manage their cap space due to the coronavirus-induced cap shrinkage and paying big money to keep players like Aaron Jones and Kenny Clark around. This doesn't make any fucking sense except as a sop to Rodgers. I like Cobb as a person, but at this stage of his career, trading for him is a really stupid move. 

The Packers have bent over backwards this offseason to appease and flatter Rodgers. I'm glad they were able to get through this crisis without putting themselves in salary cap hell. But if this is the way Rodgers's relationship with the team is going to go, I hope we do trade him next year, regardless of how good he continues to be.

Lazard made the team in 2019 as a 6'5"" 230lb wrecking ball receiver to perfectly fit in LaFluer's running scheme.  He was behind Davante, MVS, EQ, even Geronimo Allison and Jake Kumerow.

He isn't going to transcend everyone's expectations because they are all butt-hurt about 17.  He is a guy who found a way to stay in the NFL by doing the things he is good at.

Even analytics support him.  Lazard was 5th among ALL receivers in DVOA last year, meaning he was the 5th most per play value generating receiver because the guy helps the team on all plays (can block, decoy in play-action, plays Special Teams, gives LaFluer wet dreams).

In 2020, Lazard was 1st in DVOA and DYAR among all receivers under 50-receptions.

Lazard is also 1st in the NFL for Passer Rating among all WR since he entered the league.

I also get that Love may have been their last first round talent and decided to trade up to get him as opposed to the cost of possibly trading back.

Also, everyone thinks this is Madden, there are complexities that happen behind the scenes. Rodgers definitely changed his attitudes around the time Love was drafted to be more zen, but we don’t know what was happening behind closed doors. What happens if some of the Rodgers McCarthy stuff that Dunne mentioned was real, what happens if Rodgers was being difficult. We don’t know the whole story.

You will probably be able to push cap for a good 3-4 years and try to win it all with Rodgers and payment would come due and have to rebuild for a couple years as you offload contracts, etc. hopefully by that time you’re drafting well and young guys step up, you draft a good QB, and you can maintain the dip of cap room, but with the cap going up too, this may not look as bad in a couple years.  All hinges on probably QB they get if there is some down years after Rodgers retires.

2) trade Rodgers and try to retool a team without going through a rebuild. Similar to above, you may have a year or two of not competing based on probably the QB. If Love is the guy, you can be in a good shape, if Love needs some more time, may be another 2 years before really SB contenders.

I’m definitely not a GM, so I’m not going to say which I feel is better, but if you don’t cut Dean, you may have to cut Turner then, who has played real solid at OT. 

There’s too much planning on how well the depth is doing in growth because we’re not at practice. Is the depth better there or on OL. Do they want Jenkins at guard or Tackle, what is the plans for the draft, what’s the cap and thinking of filling position down the road.

We can speculate all we want but unless we’re in the role everyday, seeing all the practices, looking at all free agents not only this offseason but next, taking into account the draft and who’s on our board, I can’t tell you if cutting Dean is the right move to penny pinch or not.

Bad personnel decisions, not the cap, are the impediment to roster building. The idea that they would be in rebuilding mode is a joke to me.”

I don’t see them doing it, but honestly I didn’t see this past year  as a very “Packer” thing.

But this team had literally everything in place to win the SB last year and this year and came up short. Seasons are crap shoots, playoffs are crap shoots. Injuries and other things play a role, if we went all in on Rodgers and Adams next couple years and Rodgers gets hurt, or we are decimated with too many injuries to handle, etc.  This is why an all in approach is so dangerous in football, it’s too easy for your season to go sideways.

We will see if it pays off for the Rams, but they got lucky they didn’t absolutely blow that game yesterday.

As much as I am scared, I don’t know what else to do.  I feel you have to build a great team and hope you get a QB good enough to not screw away your changes and is at least good.  Hell our MVP QB was beat out by Jimmy G, not necessarily him, but the team.

If you use the draft picks from Rodgers that catapults you into the next era in a great position, and you have to just not shit the bed with a QB. If Love isn’t it and you don’t see that “it” factor you have the ammo to get a QB in next years draft.  

Yes finding a QB is hard, but taking out Brady and Mahomes recently, the other QB I’m the super bowls have been…

Jimmy G
Jared Goff
Nick Foles
Matt Ryan
Cam Newton
Russel Wilson
Colin Kap
Eli Manning

Some good QBs, maybe Russell and Eli will make it to the HoF, but not sure the rest do.

Football is the ultimate team sport, and yes Rodgers will always have us in playoff contention, but other teams make it without a good enough QB.

Cutting Dean, Mason and Cobb can probably save us around 13m.

I feel the problem is our D is sometimes on the field too long which leads to too many substitutions which ravages us. Bend don’t break is fine, but you need to get off the field, otherwise teams when they get into the red zone are going up against our backups.  Letting our opponents dink and dunk and pick up 3-4 yards per play leads to long drives. Like LaFleur said, dink and dunking is fine, but the D needs to dictate.  Offense needs to help with sustained drives too.  

Last nights game had no reason to be as close, we should have easily won by 2-3 scores, but offense killed us with those couple 3 and outs, putting an already tired defense back on the field.

Lawrence honestly is the biggest disappointment. I know the Jags are dysfunctional, but I really expected to see a little more in terms of skill and polish, and it looks like he’s regressing.

Wilson just looks out matched. He was a QB who needed to sit. Coming from a smaller school and going to NY and playing in the NFL isn’t the easiest of transition. I’m rooting for the kid, but I have a bad feeling.

26310,185365,185365,ThePressle54,"**What about Campbell?**  
Ginnitti: De’Vondre Campbell turned a near minimum salary signing with Green Bay into a career year and a first-team All-Pro selection. He’s already beloved in the Packers’ locker room and should be a priority re-sign this offseason, currently projecting to a cap-adjusted version of A.J. Klein’s three-year, $18 million deal with the Bills. Something in the three-year, $19.5 million range, half guaranteed, should get it done.  
  
**And Douglas?**  
Ginnitti: After being released by the Texans, signed to the Cardinals’ practice squad, then signed to the Packers’ active roster in October to a league minimum salary, Rasul Douglas now holds a $9 million calculated valuation just three months later. The 26-year-old was a turnover machine for the Packers down the stretch and his numbers across the board hold up with any recent major cornerback signing in the game. The problem? The Packers have two former first-round picks (Eric Stokes, Jaire Alexander) slotted to take on the cornerback roles for the foreseeable future, so coming back to the Packers means he would have to accept a depth contract ($6 to $8 million per year). There’s simply more money on the open market for Douglas.  
  
Schneidman’s solution: Campbell should want to hit the open market to gauge interest around the league. Let’s ink him for that three-year, $19.5 million, half-guaranteed extension mentioned above, but let’s not worry about that with regard to complying with the cap by March 16 since it’ll come after the new league year starts. And even though Douglas told reporters it wouldn’t take much more money than he made this season for him to return to the Packers, I bet his agent has gotten in his ear since about his earning potential on the open market. Letting Douglas walk will be tough, but it’s the financially responsible decision.  
  
**What about an extension for Jenkins?**  
  
Ginnitti: Elgton Jenkins’ versatility will certainly factor into both a decision to extend him and the cost to do so. As it stands, Wyatt Teller’s four-year, $56 million extension in Cleveland seems to fit the bill for Jenkins. However, with David Bakhtiari’s deal offering an “out” after 2022, Jenkins may be a left tackle in waiting, meaning his ceiling and subsequent cost would both rise. While Green Bay may find value in locking Jenkins into a contract this offseason, doing so will greatly increase his current $2.1 million cap figure. Jenkins also has good reason to hold off until next offseason for a new deal.  
  
**Ginnitti’s game plan to get under the cap by March 16**  
Release Za’Darius Smith, freeing up $15.2 million  
Release Billy Turner, freeing up $4.3 million  
Schneidman: Turner played near a Pro Bowl level for the first 12 games of the season before injuring his knee against the Bears in Week 14 and missing the rest of the regular season. Yosh Nijman, who will be a restricted free agent the Packers can bring back on a right of first refusal tender, proved he can start this season. The Packers will need to cut players they’d like to keep because of their cap situation, and Turner might be one of them. The Packers can start David Bakhtiari and Nijman at the tackle spots.  
Release Mason Crosby, freeing up $2.4 million  
Schneidman: For as reliable as Crosby has been for most of his 15-year career with the Packers, this is a no-brainer. Not only is it too much money to pay a kicker for a team in cap hell, but it’s too much money to pay a kicker who was as unreliable as Crosby was this season. The Packers kept J.J. Molson on the practice squad all season for a reason, and the 2020 undrafted free agent out of UCLA likely will get a legitimate shot to win the job in camp.  
Release Randall Cobb, freeing up $6.8 million  
Schneidman: Cobb can still contribute, as he showed right before his core muscle injury in Week 12, especially if Rodgers is the quarterback. But paying him in accordance with his current contract is too much for an injury-prone slot receiver soon to be 32 years old.  
Restructure Kenny Clark’s base salary and roster bonus (plus 2 void years), freeing up $10.9 million  
Restructure Aaron Jones’ roster bonus (plus 2 void years), freeing up $3 million  
Restructure Preston Smith’s base salary and roster bonus (plus 4 void years), freeing up $8.2 million  
Extend Jaire Alexander for four years and $64 million with a projected $6.7 million cap hit in 2022, freeing up $6.5 million  
Schneidman: Alexander played in only five games this season (playoffs included) because of a shoulder injury after being a second-team All-Pro selection in 2020. Otherwise, he’d probably be making even more than $16 million per year on this deal. It still makes him the fifth-highest-paid cornerback in the NFL in terms of average annual value, behind only Jalen Ramsey, Marshon Lattimore, Marlon Humphrey and Byron Jones.  
Extend Aaron Rodgers to the above contract, freeing up $12.6 million  
Extend Davante Adams to the above contract, including a $9.13 million cap hit in 2022.

26311,185366,185366,ThePressle54,"**The Smiths (Za’Darius and Preston)**  
Ginnitti: Za’Darius Smith will be entering a contract year in 2022, set for $15.75 million cash and a $27.65 million cap figure. After 26 sacks and more than 100 tackles across 2019 and ’20, he was limited to just two games (one regular season, one in the playoffs) due to a back injury this season.  
  
Preston Smith has been healthy for all three of his seasons with the Packers, missing only one game in that span, and will also be entering a contract year in 2022 ($13.75 million cash, $20.9 million cap figure). Preston’s production nearly halves that of Za’Darius, but his reliability and availability are very much in his favor.  
  
It stands to reason that one of the Smiths falls off the roster this spring, while the other is restructured/extended for cap and football purposes.  
  
Restructuring, but not extending Za’Darius Smith  
  
A full base salary restructure while tacking on four void years to the back end of the contract will drop his 2022 cap hit from $27.6 million to $16.8 million. However, this move will mean $10.8 million of dead cap money remains in 2023, barring an extension prior to it.  
  
Multiyear extension for Za’Darius  
  
Despite pushing 30, Smith projects to a four-year, $66.8 million extension, essentially a carbon copy of the deal he’s set to finish out in Green Bay.  
  
Trading or releasing Za’Darius  
  
Regardless of when, trading or releasing Za’Darius this offseason leaves behind $12.38 million of dead cap, freeing up $15.2 million of cap space.  
  
Restructuring but not extending Preston Smith  
  
By converting both his base salary and $3 million roster bonus into signing bonus, restructuring his likely to be earned incentives ($1.25 million) into not likely and tacking on four void years to the back end of the deal, his 2022 cap hit can drop from $20.9 million to $11.4 million. However, this move will mean $8.25 million of dead cap money in 2023, barring an extension prior to it.  
  
Multiyear extension for Preston  
  
Preston Smith projects to a two-year, $24 million extension this offseason, slightly below his current contract ($13 million per year).  
  
Trading or releasing Preston Smith  
  
Preston has a $3 million roster bonus due March 18, so Green Bay will move on quickly if that’s the plan. An early March trade or release would leave behind $7.25 million of dead cap and free up $13.7 million of space.  
  
Schneidman’s solution: While cutting both Smiths would certainly help the Packers escape cap hell, Rashan Gary is the only proven edge rusher on the team. He’s a bona fide star, but needs a competent No. 2. The Packers showed they can get by and even excel at times with Gary and Preston Smith as their top two edge rushers while Za’Darius Smith missed 16 games. Cutting him frees up more cap space than cutting Preston, anyway, so I predict Za’Darius is gone. He seems to know it, too. Preston Smith could be headed for a second straight restructure, and that’s what we’ll do for the sake of this exercise.",37.0,greenbaypackers,t3_sjsvuv,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2022-02-03T14:09:46Z,greenbaypackers,0.0107837307774706
26312,185367,185367,ThePressle54,"**Allen Lazard**  
Ginnitti: The restricted free agent likely played his way into the WR2 role for 2022 and Green Bay will need to protect him financially this offseason, either via a multiyear extension or a second-round restricted tender (currently projected to come in at $3.9 million). If they try to get cute with a $2.4 million right of first refusal tender, they open up the possibility for an offer sheet from a cap-healthy team who can steal him away with contract structure. A three-year extension between $20 million and $24 million seems like the right offer here.  
  
Schneidman’s solution: The Packers should be able to get away with keeping Lazard with a second-round tender. Any other team can offer Lazard after he signs the tender with Green Bay, but the Packers can match the offer and keep Lazard. If they don’t match it, they get a second-round pick from whatever team offered Lazard. I highly doubt anyone is willing to part with a second-round pick for Lazard despite how valuable he has proven to be in Green Bay while earning the nicknames “goon” and “war daddy.”

**The rest**  
Ginnitti: Randall Cobb becomes an interesting question mark; his contract suggests the Packers shouldn’t bring him back, but his relationship with Rodgers says he should stay. With $8.25 million cash and $9.5 million cap to boot, and just $2.7 million of dead cap up against that, the Packers would likely favor the $6.8 million of cap to be freed up. It’s certainly possible that they release him out of the current contract and sign him back to something more team-friendly.  
  
Marcedes Lewis comes in relatively cheap for 2022 ($1.92 million cash, $2.4 million cap), but he’s a TE2 at best at this stage of his career. Robert Tonyan Jr. is a pending free agent, so this will be an area of upgrade via draft/free agency.  
  
Equanimeous St. Brown and Marquez Valdes-Scantling (who projects at three years, $25 million on a new deal) are pending free agents who are unlikely to be retained at this stage, putting Green Bay in the market for at least one notable WR this offseason.  
  
Schneidman’s solution: Cut Cobb to free up the $6.8 million of cap space before March 16 and sign him back to a more team-friendly deal later. No need to touch Lewis’ contract. Let Tonyan hit unrestricted free agency and draft a pass-catching tight end early. Let both St. Brown and Valdes-Scantling walk and draft a wide receiver in one of the first two rounds.",37.0,greenbaypackers,t3_sjsvuv,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2022-02-03T14:09:24Z,greenbaypackers,0.0019310761794448
26313,185368,185368,ThePressle54,"**Davante Adams**

Ginnitti: There’s a simple answer to this one, but it comes with baggage. The Packers will almost certainly slap a franchise tag on their prized wide receiver, a move that will account for $20.12 million of placeholder cap space immediately. This certainly doesn’t help Green Bay’s financial situation, but it does keep Adams in their control for a bit longer. It should be noted that the $20.12 million value stems from a 20 percent increase over his 2021 salary and represents a non-exclusive franchise tag, meaning other teams are able to negotiate with Adams in an attempt to acquire him via a tag and trade.

What about a multiyear extension for Adams?

Spoiler: This is going to be expensive despite the fact that Adams will be approaching 30 years old at the start of next season. Adams carries a near $26 million per year valuation in our system, but for the purposes of a multiyear outlook, we’ll assume a five-year, $125 million extension this offseason.

[Adams contract:](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/02/02110245/adams.png)

In this projection, Adams gets a $35 million signing bonus, $52.6 million over two years and more than $73 million across the first three seasons. These cumulative values are far and away the highest among wide receiver contracts. The real sticking point here is the 2022 cap hit, which comes in at just $9.13 million, $11 million less than his franchise tag.

In terms of guarantees, the first two seasons are fully locked in at signing ($50.62 million), while his $19.38 million salary in 2023 becomes fully guaranteed in March 2022. This means a practical contract of three years and $73 million through 2024 with a clear out thereafter for the Packers ($14 million dead cap).

It’s fair to say this contract may not be enough in comparison to where the wideout position has risen to financially, but the cash flow and upfront guarantees easily make this a top-of-the-position contract.

Schneidman’s solution: I believe if Rodgers stays in Green Bay, Adams will, too. If Rodgers is traded, I’d imagine Adams is on his way out as well, whether it’s via a tag and trade or free agency. Adams wants to be the highest-paid receiver in the league in terms of average annual value, while general manager Brian Gutekunst said before the season that Adams deserves to be the highest-paid at his position. Yet the two sides haven’t come to a deal because of their different definitions of what that means (Gutekunst declined to elaborate when asked for his definition).

Whether the Packers franchise-tag Adams first to buy themselves more time on an extension or simply extend him first, that needs to be the move. The above deal makes sense, not only because of the relatively miniscule 2022 cap number, and Rodgers and Adams can chase that elusive Super Bowl ring together for the next couple years.",50.0,greenbaypackers,t3_sjsvuv,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2022-02-03T14:08:49Z,greenbaypackers,0.0340167331727786
26314,185369,185369,ThePressle54,"The Packers are looking at a fascinating offseason ahead, and not just regarding the future of their quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.

They find themselves in the second-worst salary cap situation in the NFL, yet head coach Matt LaFleur said there won’t be a rebuild and that all of the organization’s higher-ups want Rodgers back. Whether Rodgers will be back may be a different story, but the Packers don’t necessarily need to trade him in order to navigate salary cap hell while still building a Super Bowl contender.

The Athletic consulted Spotrac founder and salary cap guru Michael Ginnitti to work through the math of various offseason roster moves. We then formulated a plan that Green Bay can follow to get under the salary cap threshold by the start of the new league year on March 16 and keep 2021 first-team All-Pro selections Rodgers and wide receiver Davante Adams with enough pieces around them to maintain Super Bowl contender status.

Here is that plan.

**Aaron Rodgers**

There are two options the Packers can pursue while keeping Rodgers for at least next season.

Ginnitti: Option 1 is to restructure the 2022 salary to reduce the cap hit, but keep Rodgers a free agent in 2023. A full restructure (adding four additional void years) can bring the 2022 cap figure down to $26.1 million, freeing up more than $20 million. It will, however, mean a $27.9 million dead cap hit will stay with the Packers should he walk away in free agency next offseason. Not the biggest dead cap hit ever, but certainly one of them.

Option 2: Negotiate a multiyear extension. Obviously, there are an infinite number of ways this negotiation can go, from a “Tom Brady discount” type of deal, to a Kirk Cousins-style deal, maxing it out and fully guaranteeing the deal. We’ll use our calculated valuation math as a placeholder example and assume that Rodgers gets a two-year, $92 million extension, or a three-year, $120 million extension fully guaranteed.

[Here’s how the two-year extension looks:](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/02/01185547/rodgers.png)

As you can see, the 2022 cap figure has been reduced from $46.4 million to $33.9 million with tenable cap figures of $41.7 million and $44.7 million through the remainder of the deal. The final two years of the contract automatically void after the 2024 league year, leaving behind $26.4 million of dead cap to Green Bay, barring another extension.

Rodgers gets to flaunt a historic $46 million average salary, a ridiculous $120 million three-year cash flow, and a 100-percent fully guaranteed contract. It locks in over $383 million of career earnings for Rodgers through the 2024 season, by far and away the leader in that regard (though Matthew Stafford, Patrick Mahomes, etc. will be knocking on that door quickly).

Schneidman’s solution: For the purposes of this exercise, let’s sign Rodgers to the aforementioned two-year, $92 million extension. (I think the Packers should extend him and I think he should stay, but I’m sticking to my prediction of what will happen as he gets traded to the Broncos.) There’s no point in restructuring his deal for just this season if he wants to come back only to lose him in free agency and get nothing in return. Either trade him now or extend him. Assuming he’s still willing to play into his 40s, as the 38-year-old has said publicly, Rodgers gives the Packers the best chance to win for at least the next three seasons given how he has played the last two.

Figure out what to do with Jordan Love later. Don’t move on from Rodgers just to see what you have in Love. Until Rodgers actually shows signs of declining, the Packers should do everything they can to keep him in Green Bay and build a team around him that can win a Super Bowl. Yes, he has been a deterrent to doing so in some instances, but he still gives the Packers the best chance to win a championship of any quarterback they could feasibly start.",129.0,greenbaypackers,t3_sjsvuv,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2022-02-03T14:07:57Z,greenbaypackers,0.0355422212333233

Bakhtiari played 27 snaps before exiting mid-series, while Myers played 32 first-half snaps.

“You can train as long as you want, but there’s nothing like getting in football shape, going out there and actually playing the game of football and having to react to the man in front of you that’s trying to compete against you.

But we have to do our best to get them ready.”",10.0,greenbaypackers,t3_s3uxvw,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2022-01-14T09:28:48Z,greenbaypackers,0.0971025464773178
26339,185411,185411,ThePressle54,"Meanwhile, Rodgers and Jennings, who had caught 67 passes for 949 yards and nine touchdowns despite missing the final three games, weren’t on the same page several times that night, including a potential 5-yard touchdown on a scramble drill early in the game. The offense lost three fumbles in the game, equaling its total for 16 regular-season games in one night.  
  
“You win a championship and you’re kind of at the top of the mountain, and you forget kind of how bad this feeling is,” Rodgers said after the game, which turned out to be his worst statistical performance of the year (26-of-46, 264 yards, two touchdowns, one interception, four sacks, 78.5 passer rating). “And it sucks. This team, this organization, this fan base expects championships. We had a championship-caliber regular season and didn’t play well today.”  
  
The point of this history lesson: While getting your best players back is — obviously — advantageous, it is not without pitfalls. It’s imperative that not only are those players up to speed and perform like the top-flight players they are, but that the coaches are realistic and utilize them properly, including potentially limiting their snap counts if they’re not physically prepared to play a full 70-snap game.  
  
“The enticing part of it from a coach’s standpoint (is) you’re not talking about just a player or even a starter. You’re talking about Pro Bowlers. You’re talking about elite players that have played at an incredibly high level their entire career,” defensive coordinator Joe Barry admitted Thursday. “Of course, selfishly as a coach, if you’ve got two guys like that, you want those two to be part of your 11 all the time. And I think that’s where we just have to be smart.  
  
“It’s different when the ball is snapped and you’ve got to take on a 300-pound man or you’ve got to cover a guy that runs 4.3 and then tackle him when he has the ball.”  
  
On defense, Barry can rotate Alexander, who hasn’t played since injuring his shoulder on a tackle in the team’s Oct. 3 win over Pittsburgh, through a deep cornerback group if he’s not ready for a full workload. The Packers wanted to get the fearless, physical Alexander some work — and, more importantly, some in-game contact — against the Lions, but he landed on the reserve/COVID-19 list and practiced just once leading into the game, scuttling that plan. So his last tackle before his playoff return will have been the one against Steelers running back Najee Harris that he was injured on.  
  
Smith, meanwhile, had been on the shelf for four months before returning to practice on Wednesday. He played just 18 snaps on Sept. 12 in the Packers’ 38-3 blowout loss to New Orleans and went on injured reserve five days later. For as good as he was in 2019 and ’20 — leading the Packers in sacks (26) and pressures (144, according to Pro Football Focus) — LaFleur has taken a cautious tone about what Smith’s role might look like, if he plays at all.  
  
“We’re just trying to get him to a position where we feel comfortable, where not only can he go out there and compete at a high level (but fill a role),” LaFleur explained. “He hasn’t been really in the system other than one game, so we’ve got to make sure he understands his job responsibility first and foremost. Because as we’ve seen so many times throughout the course of the season, when we have all 11 guys on the same page doing their responsibility and owning their roles, I think our defense can be pretty good. And if you have some undisciplined play, then you get beat.  
  
“I think we just want to reacclimate him into practice and see how that goes and see how it all meshes before we solidify our plan.

26340,185412,185412,ThePressle54,"While that 2011 team was the defending Super Bowl XLV champ and had gone 15-1 during the regular season after a 13-0 start, there was plenty of adversity en route to the postseason. Franchise left tackle Chad Clifton had suffered a hamstring injury in October and been on the shelf until playing 25 snaps against the Lions on the final day of the season. (Sound familiar?) Right tackle Bryan Bulaga had missed the final two games with a knee injury, and the team’s preferred five starters up front hadn’t been together since the second week of the season. No. 1 receiver Greg Jennings hadn’t played since early December because of a knee injury of his own.  
  
“Luckily, we’re going to get a little extra practice time this week, (so) the open week is beneficial, I think,” the team’s offensive coordinator at the time, Joe Philbin, said during the bye. “You’re banking on some experience. I don’t want to make it as simple as riding a bike, that you don’t forget — there’s a little more to it, just the timing of those things. It kind of is what it is.

As it turned out, they weren’t.  
  
Clifton struggled in the Packers’ 37-20 divisional playoff loss to the Giants, including on a pass set on the first drive of the second half, when he was beaten inside by Osi Umenyiora for a strip-sack of Rodgers.

The Green Bay Packers head coach was pleased, but in the back of his mind, he was also a little concerned. He used the cliché all coaches love to use — “a good problem to have” — and spoke confidently of how fortunate his team was to be getting healthy at just the right time, as the win-or-go-home NFL playoffs commenced.  
  
“It’s where you want to be. It’s definitely better than the alternative,” he said as the team’s playoff bye week began. “To get everybody practiced, everybody repped, it’s going to be tough making the inactive list for the divisional playoff game. That’s never any fun. You’ve played a full season, and you have healthy guys you have to put down for the game. But those are good problems to have.”  
  
If that sounds like something Matt LaFleur said this week as the Packers, following an injury-riddled regular season, prepped for next weekend’s NFC Divisional Playoff game against a yet-to-be-determined opponent, that’s understandable. He easily could have, as a cavalcade of his best players — left tackle David Bakhtiari, cornerback Jaire Alexander, outside linebacker Za’Darius Smith, wide receiver Randall Cobb, right tackle Billy Turner, center Josh Myers, edge rusher Whitney Mercilus — were practicing after injury-related layoffs of varying lengths.  
  
But that wasn’t LaFleur. It was his predecessor, Mike McCarthy, and it was said a decade ago.  
  
With the Packers having entered last week’s regular-season finale against the Detroit Lions with the NFC’s top seed and a first-round playoff bye locked up, lots of comps were being made between the current squad and that 2011 team, which also had nothing to play for and rested a number of starters — including quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was about to win his first NFL MVP award — in its regular-season finale, also against the Lions, that year.  
  
But while LaFleur opted to play Rodgers (and All-Pro receiver Davante Adams, among others) this time around, the play-it-safe vs. keep-the-momentum debate wasn’t really the parallel between the 2011 and 2021 teams.  
  
Rather, a decade later, it’s the challenge of figuring out how to reintegrate some of the team’s brightest stars at certain critical positions that feels oddly familiar. And the plight of that 2011 Packers team is a cautionary tale for LaFleur and this year’s Packers as they aim to avoid a similar fate in next week’s NFC Divisional Playoff.  
  
For while there’s nothing but good vibes emanating from the training room inside Lambeau Field, that’s how McCarthy’s crew felt about its return to health, too.",16.0,greenbaypackers,t3_s3uxvw,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2022-01-14T09:28:14Z,greenbaypackers,-0.0271985368486883

He has built a convincing case to remain a starter even if Alexander returns for the playoffs.

Even the (defensive pass interference) that he got called for (against the Bears), I thought he was being aggressive and going to attack the football. He makes key plays. I love how aggressive he plays. He’s fearless. He’s resilient. He’s just a ball hawk.

He played only seven special teams snaps as a rookie in the Eagles’ Super Bowl win over the Patriots, but it’s part of the reason why, even as he cycled through five teams since the start of 2020, his belief in his ability never waned.  
  
“I always knew what I could do in the league,” Douglas said. “It was just about me getting the chance. I’ve always showed it in practice and against my teammates and stuff. They all knew, ‘Yeah, you’re going to be a good player when you actually do get the chance,’ and I’ve done it before. I’ve been to the playoffs, Super Bowl, NFC Championship. It’s not like I haven’t done it to where I lose faith in myself.”  
  
Douglas was inactive for his first game with Green Bay, a 25-22 Packers win in Cincinnati in Week 5. He didn’t start the following week in Chicago, either, but after cornerback Isaac Yiadom struggled on the Bears’ scoring drive to open the game, Douglas was thrown into the mix. He has given the Packers no reason to take him off the field since.  
  
Not only did Douglas intercept Murray to end one of the most thrilling games of this season, but on Sunday, he became the first Packers player to return an interception for a touchdown in consecutive games since Pro Football Hall of Famer Herb Adderley did so in 1965.

26404,185513,185513,ThePressle54,"After combining for 83 tackles and five interceptions in 2013 and ’14 at Nassau, Douglas finally felt what it was like to be wanted as a player. According to 247 Sports, Douglas received offers from West Virginia, Florida State, Louisville, Tennessee, Illinois, Kentucky, Utah State, Rutgers and Kansas. Even when he wasn’t shutting down opposing receivers, he was showing off his athleticism to anyone who would watch, randomly backflipping across the field at practice in between drills.  
  
“He’s just a nutcase,” Guilliam said with a laugh. “Why are you flipping? What are you doing, idiot? We’re in the middle of practice getting ready to prepare for a game and he’ll just be backflipping sometimes. … Like, I just asked you what the coverage is and you’re backflipping.”  
  
Guilliam allowed it, though, because Douglas always delivered when it mattered most: “He’s always been ready for the moment,” he added.  
  
Brian Mitchell, the former West Virginia coach who sold Douglas on joining the Mountaineers, said he sat down with him in Guilliam’s office at Nassau to make sure he would qualify academically to play Division I football. Douglas eventually arrived at West Virginia the day before classes started, so it took him a month to learn the defensive scheme after missing so much training camp time. Mitchell said it started clicking for Douglas, their third cornerback, around their seventh game in 2015. (Ironically, Douglas first started for the Packers in Week 7 after taking a couple weeks to learn the defense following his late arrival.)

26405,185514,185514,ThePressle54,"Even before his NFL days, Douglas knew what being unwanted felt like.  
  
He didn’t even want to play football after high school — he was primarily a basketball player — but his head football coach at East Orange (N.J.) Campus High School, Marion Bell, wanted to change his mind. Before convincing Douglas to choose the gridiron over hardwood, he approached Curtis Guilliam, the head coach at Nassau Community College.  
  
Bell told Guilliam that he had a defensive back that was athletic, big, fast, versatile and tough, with a high football IQ, that he thought could one day play at a school like LSU. Guilliam trusted Bell’s evaluation from their history working together, even if it seemed outlandish that this no-name kid out of East Orange who played basketball could play big-time college football in just a few years.  
  
“I hounded (Douglas) about, ‘Man, Coach G. wants you to come up to play football. That’s what your future is,'” Bell said, eventually persuading Douglas to ditch hoops.  
  
“You’re a smart man,” Bell told Douglas when he made the decision, “because it’s gonna pay off for you one day.”  
  
Life at Nassau was far from glamorous, however. The school didn’t have scholarships, dorms or a meal plan. Douglas instead ordered off the McDonald’s dollar menu and made sure the food lasted multiple meals. He redshirted his first year there in 2012. Douglas knew adversity from growing up without parents around — he was raised by his grandmother — and he faced it again on his path to becoming a Division I football player.  
  
“What I tried to do was instill the mindset of, ‘If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere,'” Guilliam said. “It was always just an attitude of, ‘Listen, yeah, it’s rough here, but it’s going to be worth it when you get the grades and you end up getting a scholarship.

Rasul Douglas was no stranger to being overlooked as he showed up to Arizona Cardinals practice day after day for a month without an active roster spot early this season.  
  
This was the cornerback’s fourth team in less than a year. He finished the 2020 season with the Panthers, and in an eight-day span this August, he was told by both the Texans and Raiders that he wasn’t good enough.  
  
But now he was on a practice squad for the first time since entering the NFL in 2017, and this was different.  
  
“You feel like you’re working for nothing,” he said of the experience.  
  
Douglas, now with the Packers, said that while standing at a podium in the bowels of State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ari., on Oct. 28, moments after waving goodbye to the crowd following his walk-off interception in the end zone of Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray.

Douglas was withering away on the Cardinals’ practice squad when the Packers signed him in the first week of October before their Week 5 game against the Bengals. The Packers were his fourth team in 2021 after he spent time with the Raiders, Texans and Cardinals. Douglas has been a stalwart cornerback for a team that desperately needed one after All-Pro Jaire Alexander injured his shoulder in Week 4. Douglas replaced Isaac Yiadom in the lineup after Yiadom’s terrible opening drive against the Bears in Week 6, and he hasn’t looked back.  
  
In Week 8 against the Cardinals, Douglas sealed Green Bay’s 24-21 win by intercepting a Kyler Murray pass in the end zone with 12 seconds remaining. On Sunday against the Rams, Douglas returned an interception of a Matthew Stafford pass for a touchdown to put the Packers up 19 late in the third quarter, and he logged a game-high four passes defended. Two of them came after he got beat by Beckham for a 54-yard touchdown the drive after his pick-six, a rebound head coach Matt LaFleur is sure to highlight in the film room.  
  
“Rasul has been a huge pickup for us,” LaFleur said. “You’ve got to give credit to Gutey and his staff for finding him. I just love how he competes. You see it play in and play out. The guy is so competitive. You see it in practice every day. Obviously he’s made two plays that have made major impacts on games this year. There’s multiple other plays he’s made that have really impacted games. … I think our guys have really embraced him and took him in, and we’re lucky to have a guy like that. It’s rare that you find a guy like that midseason.”  
  
Douglas is just one of the “bargain bin” signings that Gutekunst and his staff have made that have the Packers as perhaps the favorites to hoist the Lombardi Trophy.

There might be a misconception floating around regarding what “going all-in” looks like in the NFL.

The two teams that squared off at Lambeau Field on Sunday might be the two best examples of how such a strategy can appear different but still be the same at its core.

On one hand are the Rams. They recently traded for future Hall of Fame outside linebacker Von Miller and signed mercurial yet talented wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. General manager Les Snead would seemingly rather have food poisoning than a high draft pick. Their strategy of going all-in is in your face — that’s not a bad thing — and a distinct effort to push all their chips to the middle by adding big-name players.

On the other hand are the Packers. They’re notoriously averse to splashy in-season acquisitions. It’s why star receiver Davante Adams, now in his eighth season with the team, has learned to temper his expectations whenever rumors circulate about Green Bay being in the mix for a player such as Beckham or cornerback Stephon Gilmore during the season. Instead of adding Gilmore and Beckham, they’ve bolstered their roster with guys like punter Corey Bojorquez, cornerback Rasul Douglas, wide receiver Randall Cobb and inside linebacker De’Vondre Campbell, among others.

And you know what? That avenue to building a Super Bowl contender has worked.

If you thought after Beckham chose the Rams over the Packers a couple weeks ago that general manager Brian Gutekunst wasn’t “all-in” because the Packers offered him only a veteran minimum contract, check the scoreboard at Lambeau Field on Sunday: Packers 36, Rams 28.

Going all-in comes in different shapes and sizes, and the Packers are as all-in as any team in the NFL. They’re 9-3 entering the bye week, a half-game back of the No. 1 seed and lone playoff bye in the NFC — they own the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Cardinals (9-2) — and hold a 3 1/2-game lead in the division with five games left on their schedule.

“It’s taking a chance sometimes,” Adams said of the Packers adding lesser-known players to build a contender. “You never really know for sure. Obviously you go get a star, there’s a better chance of a guy panning out. But (a) shoutout to our scouting department for seeing a guy like Rasul, who came in and he’s a difference-maker on that defense, man. The confidence he plays with, the speed he plays with. He can give up a touchdown, but the type of plays he makes out there, go out there and have a pick-six and just that energy he plays with, too, is so contagious. I know that the defense really feeds off that as well. And I enjoy watching him out there.

26452,185589,185589,ThePressle54,"Is Adams the best receiver in the game? At this point, he’s irritated by the debate.  
  
“I’m truly done with even answering that question,” he says. “Because now I feel like it’s so obvious, to a certain extent at least, that I believe it. When people ask that, it’s like, ‘Ugh, God, like, you shouldn’t even be asking.’  
  
“Of course I’ve been thinking this shit since I had 24 touchdowns at Fresno. I was thinking that there’s nobody that could fuck with me the whole time.”  
  
Now there’s evidence to back that up.  
  
Since the start of the 2016 season, Adams has 63 touchdown catches (eight more than anyone else), 6,618 receiving yards (fourth-most among wideouts) and 530 catches (second-most). Despite missing two and a half games last season, Adams led the NFL in touchdown catches (18) and receiving yards per game (98.1). This season, hounded with double coverage, Adams ranks third in the NFL with 97.9 receiving yards per game. Since his 10 drops in 2015, he has had only 12 over the last five-plus seasons.  
  
In a matter of months, maybe sooner, Adams will become the highest-paid wide receiver in league history, possibly making as much as $30 million per year. A gold jacket might be in his future.  
  
“It’s still surreal to me,” Brown says. “Because we don’t come from this. We come from a small little city. We don’t come from a lot of money. We don’t come from none of this.”  
  
Earlier this season, she saw a TV commercial starring her son. She started crying, so she called him. Brown told Adams how proud she was of him. Adams told Brown how proud he was of her.  
  
“I’m not doing anything,” she responded. “I’m just living.”  
  
“Yes,” Adams chimed back. “And I was just living when you took care of me.”  
  
Adams wears his past proudly — the things he saw that he shouldn’t have, the struggles he endured but overcame. He splits his time between two homes in Wisconsin and California with his wife and daughter, a stark difference from how he grew up and a testament to how far he has come.  
  
“Now, for me, it’s just continuing to find ways to push myself so I can blow the roof off of this thing,” Adams says. “Because it’s Year 8, but it don’t feel like it. Got a lot more left in the tank.

They talked for an hour and a half. Adams had just lost his third NFC Championship Game, and it ate at him. He caught nine passes for 138 yards, but the game wasn’t even close. Adams felt like he wasn’t doing enough.  
  
“He basically said, ‘I’m willing to do, think like, act like and behave any way I need to to become the best wideout in the NFL,'” Williams says.  
  
Throughout the 2020 season, they spoke three to four times per week about every aspect of wideout play, from how to release off the line of scrimmage, how to think if you want to be a game-changer, even about maintaining balance down the sideline after Adams stepped out of bounds on what would’ve been a touchdown against the 49ers in Week 9.  
  
Now his prowess after the catch, near-flawless hands, impeccable route-running and lethal releases comprise a total package that looks nothing like the defeated wide receiver who lost his cool on that car ride six years ago.

Brown would call Davante to tell him what everyone was saying. He told her to stop checking Twitter. She didn’t listen. One time, she snapped.  
  
“Davante is my baby,” she says. “He’s my only child, so I went into protector mode. I read one too many things, and this one time I went on Twitter and I replied and I went off on the dude … just to get my frustrations out.”  
  
The tweet has long since been deleted. Brown doesn’t remember exactly what she said — something about not criticizing someone you don’t know, probably with some choice words sprinkled in. One of Adams’ friends sent him a screenshot of the tweet and he called her immediately. He told her not to give in, exactly what he was training himself to do as a stranger to such criticism.  
  
Even as Adams floundered on the field, largely due to his insistence on playing through the ankle injury, a Packers teammate who had known Adams since he was in high school maintained faith he could one day prove fans who wanted #JanisOverAdams wrong.  
  
“No. 1, I knew how good he was,” says former receiver James Jones, a San Jose State product who met Adams through Williams. “No. 2, you had to be a blind man to see he wasn’t 100 percent, and he still was out there trying to gut it out. … Everybody in that building knew that (Janis) wasn’t even close to Davante. And I love Jeffy with all my heart, but we all knew that.”  
  
Jones also knew how much of that East Palo Alto grit Adams had in him, and Jones wanted to pry it out. So he claimed he was faster than Adams.  
  
That did the trick.  
  
“This is in the middle of the season,” Jones explains. “Davante is on a bum ankle and after practice, me and him lined it up and we raced in a 40. … We had one of the coaches dropping his hand for the go call, like it was a full-on race for the 40. And he beat me by the hairs of his chinny-chin-chin, and he’ll never let me hear it down. And he still ain’t faster than me.  
  
“You don’t see that all the time,” Jones says. “Guys talk and do all this all the time on the football field, but they don’t ever lace ’em up.”  
  
Adams had another believer in his corner, too.  
  
“To have him play most of the season with an injury to his ankle — a guy who makes his living at the line of scrimmage — but to see him not complain the whole year really stuck with me,” Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers says. “How mentally tough he was from the previous year (through a lack of targets) and then physically tough through ’15. So you pair a mentally tough and a physically tough person together in the same person, you’re going to get something special, especially when you have the kind of crazy talent that he does.”  
  
Adams had impressed teammates with his perseverance throughout a miserable second season in the NFL. He wanted to showcase that crazy talent, wanted to have fun playing football again — but first he needed to get healthy.  
  
In 2016, he did. And in the three years following his disastrous 2015 campaign, Adams caught 35 touchdowns, second in the NFL to only Antonio Brown’s 36.",84.0,greenbaypackers,t3_r0dg87,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2021-11-23T07:46:39Z,greenbaypackers,-0.0149733254847656
26455,185592,185592,ThePressle54,"Fresno State’s Williams liked what he saw enough to give Adams a chance when he found him the next year, even if he needed substantial work to become eligible. Adams took eight classes his senior year when everyone else took four. There were only seven school periods, so his day was longer than everyone else’s. Brown signed Adams up for four-hour SAT sessions on Saturdays (“He stayed pissed off at me,” she says). He took the SAT twice and the ACT once. He finished high school with a GPA in the low 3s.  
  
He had played Superman, and all he needed to do to play at Fresno State was pass an oceanography class at San Jose City College to fulfill an outstanding NCAA credit requirement. “Literally the dumbest class I’ve ever taken in my life,” he says, still visibly frustrated about it.  
  
Fresno State began training camp before the NCAA clearinghouse declared Adams eligible. While he waited for them to finalize his oceanography grade, he stood on the sideline in street clothes because he wasn’t allowed a uniform. Adams tore up camp when he was finally cleared, Williams said, but coaches chose to redshirt him because the Bulldogs had a stacked wideouts room.  
  
That decision drew the angst of Adams and Fresno State’s starting quarterback, as the freshman receiver embarrassed starters in practice all season.  
  
“I was like, ‘Why are we redshirting him? He’s not gonna be here all four years,'” says current Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, one of Adams’ best friends. “I remember saying that, like, to the head coach. And I’ll never forget it. They were just like, ‘Yeah, yeah, you know what? You’re right.'”",90.0,greenbaypackers,t3_r0dg87,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2021-11-23T07:46:19Z,greenbaypackers,8.484355553847265e-05
26456,185593,185593,ThePressle54,"When Keith Williams arrived at Palo Alto High School in 2010, he didn’t know Davante Adams existed.  
  
Williams, the Fresno State wide receivers coach at the time, was there to watch another player, but Palo Alto head coach Earl Hansen pulled Williams aside and advised he take a look at a senior receiver who had more recruiting buzz as a basketball player.  
  
“I’m always open to finding a sleeper,” says Williams, now the Baltimore Ravens’ passing game coordinator, “So I don’t like leaving any stones unturned.”  
  
The kid Hansen suggested carried a bigger, more physical frame and impressed Williams with how he adjusted to balls in the air, how he stayed on his feet after catching passes and how he carried himself. But Adams didn’t have eye-popping stats because of his team’s run-first nature, and his grades drove away at least one school.  
  
“Cal came to talk to him when he was in high school, and that was like his dream college to go to,” Adams’ mom says. “And then when they start talking GPA, they took a look at his transcript and they saw a couple D’s or whatever on there, and they frown upon D’s.”  
  
Adams had prioritized basketball over school. He had broken his arm three times before high school and didn’t start playing football until his junior year in 2009. He needed to catch up, on the field and off it.  
  
Hansen knew Adams could do a 360-degree, between-the-legs dunk but wasn’t sure if he could play football. Adams didn’t understand route concepts. He knew what he was supposed to do, but not how he fit into the rest of the offense.  
  
“He was as raw as can be,” Hansen, now retired, says.  
  
Adams wasn’t even the Vikings’ best two-sport athlete at receiver. Joc Pederson, now an Atlanta Braves outfielder, caught 30 passes for 650 yards and nine touchdowns as a senior in 2009. (Adams caught 25 passes for 484 yards and seven touchdowns.) To this day, the back-to-back World Series champion maintains he was better.  
  
“I mean, the numbers don’t lie,” Pederson says with a laugh.",94.0,greenbaypackers,t3_r0dg87,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2021-11-23T07:46:00Z,greenbaypackers,0.0354870348345082
26457,185594,185594,ThePressle54,"Two years prior, Adams amassed 24 touchdown catches at Fresno State — eight more than anyone else in college football. He was second in the nation with 1,719 receiving yards. That was enough to be selected in the second round of the 2014 draft after his redshirt sophomore season.  
  
“I was so used to doing what I was doing in college,” he says. “Go and score literally two touchdowns a game, putting up monster numbers, just having a great time.”  
  
This failure was foreign, but Adams had navigated worse.  
  
When he’s introduced as Davante Adams from Palo Alto, he interjects.  
  
It’s East Palo Alto. Not the east part of Palo Alto, which is what people think he means, but a city entirely its own in California’s Bay Area.  
  
When thinking about the two cities, “The Lion King” provides a helpful comparison, Adams says. Palo Alto — synonymous with Silicon Valley and extreme wealth and home to Stanford University and Tesla — is like Pride Rock.  
  
East Palo Alto is like the Elephant Graveyard. That is where he’s from.  
  
“It’s not too far away,” Adams says. “But it’s two totally different worlds.”  
  
After a long pause and a deep breath, he continues: “It’s tough talking about it.” One of his best friends was killed. He witnessed drive-by shootings. Brown wouldn’t let him leave the house unless he had a specific destination, not even if he just wanted to play outside.  
  
“Knowing where we were from, I just refused for my kid to be another statistic,” Brown says. “East Palo Alto was always like the underdog city. It was a lot of gang violence. It was a lot of drug sales and everything. It was just not the greatest place to grow up, you know?  
  
“Not a lot of them make it out of there. Not at all. A lot of kids that Davante played sports with ended up in jail or dead or just got caught up in the gang violence.”  
  
“I literally could’ve lost my life,” Adams says, “just knowing, seeing people that I spent a lot of time with, how they lost their life, lost their freedom.”  
  
Adams split time with his parents from the age of 5. Every Monday and Wednesday and every other weekend, he lived at his grandmother’s house in East Palo Alto with nine other people: his dad, his dad’s girlfriend, aunts, cousins and his grandmother. He never had his own bedroom, sleeping on a couch until he left for college.  
  
“I’m a teenage boy growing into a man, my room is out in the open,” Adams says. “It’s the same place people come in and … sit down to hang out with my grandparents or my dad.”  
  
Every Tuesday and Thursday and every other weekend, Adams lived 10 minutes away with his mom in a two-bedroom apartment in an affordable housing complex. Brown balanced two jobs, one as a site manager for software company Synopsys and one braiding hair out of her home after she returned from work.  
  
“That was my superwoman,” Adams says. “My mom was the epitome of a legalized hustler.”  
  
Adams never got — or wanted — an allowance because he felt he didn’t deserve to get paid for basic chores. He got $20 per week for lunch, but meals at a plaza across the street from Palo Alto High School cost $6. “And that shit adds up,” Adams says.  
  
Brown didn’t have time for a relationship amid her son’s basketball and football schedules, and she didn’t allow him to get a job because she wanted him either in school, at practice or a game or inside her house.  
  
“I said, ‘Don’t worry about it. You just do good in school so you can get a scholarship that I cannot afford, and I’ll get my grind on and work and I’ll support you in your sports,'” Brown says. “I kept him so tied up in sports that I didn’t allow him to know the streets.”",110.0,greenbaypackers,t3_r0dg87,False,0.0,:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:,2021-11-23T07:45:38Z,greenbaypackers,0.006604931772209

Davante Adams started screaming.

“I hate football!”

It was November 2015, and he was at the wheel, driving home from Lambeau Field with his mom. Pamela Brown was startled by his outburst.

“Don’t say that!” Brown said. “No you don’t!”

She had flown from California to Green Bay to watch her son play the Bears. Adams’ wife, Devanne, was there, and so was her mom. Aaron Rodgers targeted Adams a team-high 11 times on that rainy night, but he caught only two passes for 14 yards. The Bears won 17-13.

“Yes I do!”

When they arrived back at Adams’ house, he retreated to his room and didn’t come out. Brown brought him a plate of food and left him alone. She was shocked, if only because her son hadn’t yet opened up to her about how his second season in the NFL, a personal disaster, was weighing on him.

It was the injuries. The drops. The lack of production. He was thrust into the No. 1 role following Jordy Nelson’s preseason ACL tear, but he sprained his ankle in Week 2. Adams re-aggravated the injury the following week, missed three games, then played through pain after he returned. This Thanksgiving night game, which Adams still calls the worst game of his career, was the tipping point.

He admits now that he paid too much attention to what people wrote about him online. He remembers fans wanting him gone, the Twitter hashtags calling for 2014 seventh-rounder Jeff Janis to take his place. After a regular season in which he caught just 50 passes for 483 yards with a career-low one touchdown catch and a career-high 10 drops, he finished the year by tearing his MCL in a divisional-round win against Washington.

""I'm not gonna get into specifics, but I will say that there has been great communication.

Obviously Rasul Douglas, the hero of the game there was a pickup that we brought in. Whitney Mercilus, loved that addition as well. You know, obviously with Bobby getting hurt and with Kylin getting hurt, our third running back, there are some opportunities to add to the roster. But, I like the roster the way it is - Especially with some of the guys we have coming back. Za'Darius Smith is back in town, not sure what his potential coming off the IR is gonna be, but it's good to see him again. Jaire got some good news a few weeks ago, still hopeful that he'll be around for the stretch run. Hopefully we can get Kevin King back in the coming weeks. The big giraffe at left tackle probably has a chance to play in the near-near-near future. So, I like our roster, I like the fact that we're sitting here at 7-1.""

""Look at our cap situation, too. We had to adjust just about every contract to get under the cap, and there's obviously some issues with the cap going forward. That's probably the reason why we weren't necessarily in the Stephon Gilmore sweepstakes, because we couldn't take on a big contract. And there's other guys who have been rumored, I know there's guys who want to come to Green Bay, but we are definitely salary cap-hampered at the moment. If certain guys were to get cut, that would be a whole different story.

2. Stokes has (in my opinion) shown more than you could realistically expect from a rookie corner. He's been thrust into an every-down role due to Jaire and Kevin's injuries, and has taken that challenge on with confidence. He has had his share of rookie mistakes, and seems to bite on the double-move pretty hard, but I think the sky's the limit for him.


3. Not really. Keep in mind that the game plan was still Barry's game plan (He was in all of the defensive meetings via Zoom). Gray and Olivadotti did a great job with minimal prep, but there's no need to pull the fire alarm on anything just yet.

That is the state of our media and really our culture, not just media. But our culture. This woke PC culture, and if I may elaborate just slightly, if you don’t mind. I think that in general my feelings are this:

There’s a PC woke culture that exists, and there’s a cancel culture at the same time. And it’s based on people’s own feelings of personal miserability or just distaste for their own situations or life or just an enjoyment of holding other people down with their thumb, but when you engage in this culture and you’re immersed in it and you’re in it so much and for me, when I took time in the offseason to work on myself and work on my mental status, I was selfish or nonresponsive, and selfish and entitled. When I came back and said what I said at what I felt like was the right time and spoke the truth, the same sentiments were shared. Maybe not by as many people, because a lot of people respected what I said, but the same sentiments were shared.

When these ridiculous sentiments and story lines and narratives get drawn on about me, about—pick a topic, from my family to my leadership style. They just go on and on and people start thinking, well he hasn’t responded to it so it must be true, right? And they run with these stories. And when I respond to it and set the record straight, when I finally said enough is enough, this thing has gotten so far and so ridiculous, then I’m being sensitive.

When Week 1, I have been there unfortunately before and have had a few dud games and people think I don’t have enough passion, I don’t care about what’s going on, then I’m passionless, I’m not all in. When I make a statement after a touchdown that puts us up two scores, now I’m not a sportsman, now I’m making this shit about me. This is the thing that goes on.

And ultimately there’s a game within the game. And in this game, there’s a player and there’s a game. If the player abides by the rules of the game, he’s a part of the game. Now the rules of the game are you must acquiesce with the woke mob at all times. You must. However, when you live about the game, the game does not exist. That’s where I’m at.

Preston had a great year with a very incentive heavy contract, and deserves getting paid more, which he did but it's still pretty tame.

OT is a much bigger need than people think. Packers always try to draft a year (o even two) ahead of upcoming needs (AJ Dillon and Rashan Gary arr very good examples of that). Elgtons contract is up and he'll most likely and deservingly demand top LT money.

We just can't afford to pay both of them and keep the rest of the team at the same level of quality. That means we will need a new RT (incase they let Elgton go and aim for the comp pick) or if they trade Bakh and Elgton moves to LT with an new contract.

A lot of the threads and articles since then have settled on the idea that the Saints were probably only guilty of helping with PR support.

My post adding to the list is buried in there somewhere.

But in general our FO is complacent and more focused on making the playoffs than making the super bowl. The popular theory ties the team president Mark Murphy to some ongoing condo projects in Green Bay that would obviously be easier to sell if the team is doing well because at this point the Packers are the towns economy. So the FO is less motivated to go all in for a few years out of fear of having to rebuild and suffer through some down years.

It’s criminal in my mind that the team refuses to fully commit to Rodgers after he dragged McCarthy and Thompson and not only saved their careers but basically built them by pulling off impossible wins and playing at a hall of fame level for a decade.

If I’m being honest I truly despise a lot of our fanbase for not seeing or caring about the context of all this. Rodgers has earned the right to say whatever he wants about the Packers org.

Let’s recap the FO situation with just Rodgers, no picking on the draft or roster management:

1.	Drafted Rodgers to sit him behind Favre. Good move.
2.	Expected Favre to be a professional and groom Rodgers as his replacement. Instead it went the other way and Favre chafed having a first round QB in the QB room when he wasn’t ready to retire. Bad move.
3.	Spent the first decade of Rodgers career playing it conservative. Draft and develop, almost no FAs. Worked out for one super bowl, but considering the talent we had, huge let down. Bad move.
4.	Stuck with McCarthy and Ted Thompson even when the game had clearly moved past them. Bad move.
5.	Hired a new HC and then after making the NFC championship and losing, decided to move up in the first round to draft Rodgers replacement, like we learned nothing from the Favre situation. Bad move.
6.	Now we have a first round salary eating up cap space after pissing off Rodgers. If we keep Rodgers, are we really going to extend a first round QB in 2-3 years while he does nothing but sit on the bench? Whole lot of money and draft capital just going to waste. Bad move.
7.	Try to restructure Rodgers. Rodgers has done his best to make it clear he’s still committed but the FO has apparently done a fucking hack job of making it clear he’s still wanted for things to get to the point where info is leaking that he wants to feel appreciated after an MVP season. TERRIBLE FUCKING MOVE.

If we didn’t get lucky with 2 HoF QBs in a row, we would be a laughingstock. It’s an open secret that Mark Murphy, Packers president, is dependent on the team making the playoffs every year so the Green Bay economy stays strong enough for him to sell condos. The fear being that a few losing seasons would cripple a small town like Green Bay. Meanwhile they ride our hall of fame QBs like a rented mule and our overly optimistic, drunk fan base eats this shit up and claims the FO can do no wrong.

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

That being said, If he had just owned not being vaccinated from the start I would have said what a knucklehead but would have moved on with reservations about the risks to his team mates and competitive disadvantage.  It would have been a story for a few weeks but would have gone away.

However, him implying he was vaccinated by responding ""yeah, I'm immunized"" to the question if ""Are you vaccinated?"" Was some devious wordsmithing and him trying to avoid it being a story.    It just leaves me disappointed at the whole situation and could now potentially screw the Packers on playoff seeding.

I hope that he recovers and no one around him gets seriously ill either.  Hope he sees the error of his ways and gets vaccinated after this and admits to being misleading but I doubt that will happen.

43876,309928,309928,nootfloosh,"An OT with 34"" arms (which is the bench mark) has an easier time getting their hands into Hutchinson's numbers first after the snap. He is going to need to out-technique and out-hustle every OL he faces on a snap by snap basis. He can improve his form and knowledge all he wants, but he can't grow longer arms.

That isn't saying Hutchinson can't do those things and become great, but 32"" arms is a big deal around the league. Especially for Trent Baalke:

>BAALKE: I like long arms. Last year’s draft should tell you that. I think length is important. It’s important in every sport. Aldon Smith – great leverage player because you can’t get to him. He has a 36-inch arm length. All of the guys last year on the D-line were 34 or more. I think it’s an important trait. It’s a trait that’s hard to find. If you look at this year’s measurements, you’re not going to find many players in this year’s draft that have 34-plus arm length regardless of position – O-line, D-line, linebacker. So it is a trait that we certainly look at.

He was fucking unbelievable in college.  As a hs prospect at LB.  He was something special.  And then this mystique with how he’s losing his grandmother and then a person who he thought was his gf/love of his life during the most impactful year of his career and during the championship game…that’s not just gonna bounce off someone.  it fueled him to play out of his mind that season.  But, It also fueled him falsely during the first part of his career, not just his senior year when he was affected by the loss of his grandma and his fake gf.  That event fueled his story and image, but his gf fueled his focus and drive almost all of his collegiate career.  (Watch the doc) He didn’t ask for the public to react any sort of way.  He just handled it the only way he knew how.  On the field.  Once he was aware that it was a hoax, he didn’t know how to handle it.  it affected manti’s mental health.  Lost his focus. And then unfortunately had injuries derail him.  

Leading up to the draft…he was speculated to be between 15-32 in the first round I wanna say.  And then the story comes out and he drops out of the first round.  You could argue he was hyped by the story the media presented and that also helped elevated his focus to dedicate himself to his craft.  That became his Achilles heel when his driving catalyst (Lennay) was discovered to be a fraud.  You’re rock and staunch supporter is a facade and a lie.  Now go out there and play with the same ferocity? Nah, that completely stripped him of his confidence and while it was a combination of injury and this scandal blowing up, Manti didn’t live up to his pedigree.  It’s unfortunate but, it’s the truth. 

He was a bust but, he at least still made the most of his situation in the NFL and I hope he’s at the very least proud he gave it his best.  That’s gotta be enough.  He’s a human.",-3.0,nfl,t3_wr4akk,False,1.0,:Packers: Packers,2022-08-18T05:19:19Z,greenbaypackers,5.4264263025627816e-05

46489,330547,330547,shouldatakenQueen,"Honestly, when the 2020 pick was made on Jordan Love, it was so soon after covid that the packers brass had to be thinking about a possible lost season:  

“what if we lose a year with Aaron Rodgers to Covid, should we prepare for life without him and draft a QB to prep.”

If they thought last year that Jordan Love had more potential then the QBs we could have grabbed late in this years draft and the packers brass was attempting to account for a lost season? Good pick.  But, I would be lying if I said it was a sexy pick.  Love wasn’t a pick even remotely on our minds when it happened.  Especially with a future 1st ballot HOF QB under contract.  I wanted Justin Jefferson at Wide receiver if we had drafted that position and then reference my username for who I wanted on defense if we went that route.  

I think what’s on all our minds is...why fix what wasn’t broken?  We didn’t lose games because of Aaron.  We were always still in them because of Aaron.  Build around that.  I think that we did our best some years but, the injury bug bit hard and we just couldn’t get to the SB.  So many heartbreaking moments.  Last years was gut wrenching.  it hurt worse than Brett Favre throwing the pick in OT against the Giants in ‘07-‘08.

Jordan Love could be great but, there’s not a single prospect in this draft that I’d rather watch on game day than Aaron Rodgers.

46492,330552,330552,shouldatakenQueen,"It’s also nice to see a resurgence from players who were drafted in the first round.  There’s always players who fizzle out of the league for many reasons: In the beginning they may have injuries or off the field distractions take away from their career and a lot of the time, it doesn’t end up story book but, I think it’s amazing when they live up to their draft grade later in their career.  

The first player that comes to mind for me was Former Panther’s Linebacker Thomas Davis.  

Dude was a first round pick touted as the best safety prospect in the 2005 draft.  Started off his career playing safety but, wasn’t really making any impact and got benched more than once.  Then through pure necessity due to injury, he’s put in at outside linebacker and starts contributing and living up to his draft grade.  He also didn’t really make any pro bowls until very late in his career (2015).  

You could argue by looking at his stats and accolades that early on, that this first round pick had the look of being somewhat a bust or dud.  

Davis was demoted and shuffled in the line up a bit before solidifying that he belonged in a starting line up at all.  He was always someone undervalued or under appreciated that probably was up against some amazing outside linebackers in the pro bowl ballot, especially playing next to Jon Beason and then later Luke Kuechly, to then switch positions, overcome 3 acl tears, and then 10 years into his career he gets selected for 3 back to back pro bowls (first team all pro and second team all pro 2/3 years). 

A decade into the league? Impressive AF.

I look at him as this sort of symbol of persevering through injury and still living up to the hype and playing at pro bowl caliber so late in his career but, I don’t think this was his plan.  Didn’t matter.  Definitely not a bust, definitely still a hall of “Very Good” candidate, but I love seeing him turn a steep decline into a mountainous triumph.

Truly thankful and inspired having watched him play in person.  I still remember analysts thinking he was done, especially after the 3rd injury.  

There’s always gonna be the “what if” story about a guy touted as a bust.  I think he easily could have been a bust and probably was at first looked at like a wasted pick sometimes.  But, wow.  Three back to back acl tears and then he just absolutely starts dominating on the outside.  Father time caught up but, again I think it’s something special:  

Started his career as a first round pick at safety who then switched positions, he then goes under the radar for the better part of a decade probably deemed an average player at best, a role player that then became an All pro player at a completely different position.

Evans has some incredibly consistent production his entire career but hasn't yet had the AP seasons through no fault of his own; has always been great but just loses out each year to someone else's standout season (sorta like Drew Brees and the MVP award).

Adams has had a couple AP seasons and actually is neck-and-neck with Evans in TDs, but his yardage numbers are lower especially earlier on. He started out his career as a 3rd option and was affected by injury/drops his second season. He broke out in 2016 but production dipped a bit (along with the rest of our offense) in 2017 with Brett Hundley as our QB for half the season. If not for that and just missing out by 3 yards in 2016 *and* 2019 he would have 6 straight seasons of 1000 yards rather than just 3 *total*.

49782,364011,364011,xylltch,"That 2011 loss was so frustrating. Copying this from a comment of mine elsewhere:

I just re-watched the Packers loss to the Giants in the playoffs that year and holy crap it was way worse than I remembered. Rodgers actually looked good in that game; he only had a few bad throws (which were really just barely off, the receivers still got hands on them) on 45 attempts.

He was also the Packers leading rusher (66 yards) and had 6 first downs on the ground (our other RBs combined for 81 yards, 3 first downs and 2 fumbles).

What really struck me on re-watching the game was just how bad the Packers receivers were at getting open; the majority of the time Rodgers was throwing to guys with defenders right on top of them, and the guys that did get open dropped it half the time. Before the game was out of reach the Packers had 8 drops by 7 players.

Here were the Packers drives:

Result|Notes
-|-
FG | Dropped pass by Finley and then incomplete to Jennings (if he turned the other way he would have had a TD, but this was just bad luck or miscommunication rather than a drop) killed the drive.
TD |
Punt | Drop by Starks followed by a Crabtree drop that killed the drive.
Fumble | Fumble by Kuhn at the Packers 40.
Punt | Good defense by Giants, no one gets open on Packers before pressure forces throwaways or results in a sack.
Fumble | Rodgers fumbled, but it was mainly a [great play by Umenyiora](https://youtu.be/Qylia58YCQs?t=234); he was through the line, into Rodgers and stripped the ball as Rodgers was about to throw (to a wide-open Jennings) in less than 2 seconds.
FG | Drop by Jennings in the end zone on 3rd and 5.
Downs | Drop by wide-open Finley on 3rd and 5, sack by Giants on 4th and 5.
Fumble | Fumble by Ryan Grant at the Packers 45, returned to the Packers 4 (Rodgers made the tackle to prevent the TD, but the Giants offense scored on their first play)
TD | 
INT | Garbage time at this point, down 17 with 1:56 left to play & no timeouts.

After Adams was drafted in 2014 we didn't hit as well on any receivers in the draft, with MVS in 2018 being probably the best, and that's sorta when our unbroken line of great receivers came to a halt.

He did a great job developing Rodgers, lead the team through an incredibly tough season to win the Super Bowl, had strong teams for most of his tenure and called some great games. It wasn't all Rodgers carrying the team every year.

It did start to break down a bit toward the last few years. He should maybe have found a new DC (and maybe a few other staff) a couple years earlier. He always has seemed like a genuinely good person who is maybe a bit too loyal to his people. He also got screwed a bit with the roster we ended up with after a run of poor drafts, (although I'm not sure how much he might have had to do with those decisions) and couldn't do enough to adapt his offense as the talent waned or strengths shifted.

While the turnaround from McCarthy's last year to LaFleur's first was pretty stark and the offensive scheme (and buy-in/refocusing of Rodgers) obviously has a lot to do with that, I think the roster itself has been far better than what McCarthy had to work with his last couple years. It'd be interesting to see what he could have done if Gutekunst had taken over and made some of those moves in free agency a couple years earlier.

His offense just started to falter as the roster got weaker and he wasn't able to adapt quickly enough to turn things around, losing Rodgers a bit in the process (especially as the team had to lean on him even more) which probably made it even harder to get things straightened out. Unfortunately the defense was getting shakier too and he should probably have made some changes there earlier. Just too many problems finally coming to a head within a season or two.

You can get excited about all the good plays, ignore all the mistakes (they'll get worked out before the season actually starts, right?) and go into week 1 with the thought that this might be a pretty good year for your team.

We're going to have an incredible offense this year!""*) and ignore all the mistakes (*""Sure he missed that throw, but he was probably just practicing some different footwork or something for this drive""*) because it's just preseason and everything's going to be fine.
