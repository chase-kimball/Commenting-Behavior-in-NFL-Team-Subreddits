Ivermectin is also not a horse dewormer as CNN would like to portray it as, it's been used for years to fight viruses in humans. 
Aside from that there's the fact that the Moderna shot is being paused all over the world (mostly in European countries) due to causing heart issues, among other things, and the Johnson & Johnson was paused for blood clot issues. 
Plus we've completely ignored natural immunity, which has been a scientifically proven form of protection for years.

2284,17014,17014,Bandoot,"We played moneyball in the NFL.

But seriously it was a lot more than just back to back firsts. We literally tanked. Not as in a ""lol this team is bad so they must be tanking"" sense but as in our GM and front office intentionally tanked multiple years. We traded away/cut/let walk multiple talented players in the name of cap space and future draft picks, traded back draft picks for future picks and with the extra cap space ate Brock osweilers contract for draft picks. 

This picture https://imgur.com/a/IVDdvKR got leaked during it which shows their mindset at the time pretty well. It shows their ""guardrails"" on how to run the tank. 

We accumulated a metric fuck ton of draft picks. In the 2017 draft we had 4 picks in the first 2 rounds with 3 being firsts. 2018 we had picks 1 and 4 along with 2 seconds. So over 2 drafts we had 8 picks in the first 2 rounds along with 11 picks in rounds 3-7

The biggest part to me at least has been the offensive line. You can have all the shiny offensive pieces in the world but if your QB has negative time to throw to them its not gonna work. Coaching also plays into this majorly too. In 2019 we saw this. On paper our offense should have been near unstoppable but as everyone knows it was very much was. John Dorsey was really good at gathering skill talent but neglected the line and it killed us and ruined Bakers confidence because he had no time to throw. This mixed with Freddie calling 4 verts on 3rd and 10 backed into our own end zone was a recipe for disaster.",2.0,nfl,t3_rl87ch,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2021-12-21T04:48:33Z,browns,-0.03920854914572

I think Baker can improve for sure. The fact that he started going to a QB coach is a good start. His arm talent is really good, and his accuracy is elite when hes healthy. But his head just wasnt at an NFL level and his mechanics completely broke down. 

In 2020, AVP completely changed his motion and they made the offense extremely easy for him to read. He was successful (to say the least).

In 2019 they gave him the aaron rodgers treatment and let him sling it wherever he felt like going and had the recievers just running trees all game long. (He was not successful).

Baker needs to accept that he HAS to walk before he can run. If he does that and he genuinly works every second at becoming the best and listens to his coaches and QB coaches. He can certainly get there. But it wasnt going to happen in Cleveland in the same way Breese would have never been successful in San Diego. (Im not saying Baker is Breese, but just trying to make a comparison.) The question is: Is Baker willing to swallow his pride and accept his shortcomings?

4447,26906,26906,ClevelandOG,"Im not going to put that play completely on Baker, but that play is a good illustration of why Baker was so frustrating.

The initial read should have been middle field closed, even though it turned out to be bracket coverage. In any case, on his left you had press coverage on an in-route. Which is totally fine, you can throw it there if you want, even though it's a difficult throw, it isnt a bad read.

The problem i have is that to his right, he had a perfect set of routes to beat middle field closed. He had an inside fade (Njoku), an option (Landry) and a quick hitch (Higgins). 

You know the inside fade will beat middle field closed all day or it will at least cause the safety to move over to it. In which case you have an extremely easy completion with Landry on the deep hitch.

If you watch the play, Landry is open by 3 yards and it would have been the easiest first down they had.

Was the decision to look to his left and try to hit DPJ on the in route a bad one? No. It wasnt. It would just have been much much easier if he looked right instead.

*That* was my issue with Baker. He has to make everything harder than it needs to be. He decides where hes going with the ball and he goes there no matter what. Does it look great when he threads a 15 yard rope down the middle between 3 defenders? Of course it does, but it looks equally as bad when the ball gets tipped and picked when he could have just taken a checkdown when the throw wasnt there.

Tl;dr not Baker's fault, but he took the harder correct read and the no-call happened which was unfortunate. But you can never count on refs especially with 30 seconds left in a game, and nobody was close enough to landry on that play to even touch him.

There is a reason he doesnt usually make those throws. It's because as a backup QB hes supposed to be a game manager who just possesses the ball and not lose it at all costs. Throwing long over the middle is risky no matter what... But it seems like the Browns coaching staff wants him to take some risks as hes no longer considered a backup.

Baker was great at throwing those deep intermediate middle routes (he threw them a lot, which is partly why his pick numbers are higher) but couldnt operate against middle field closed to save his life.

That INT was on Brissett. He had a blitzing linebacker on the right side which means he should have immediately gone hot to his right. Njoku was there wide open in the spot vacated by the blitzing linebacker. He looked left because before the play he diagnosed the cb giving outside leverage and knew schwartz was going on a quick slant.

Schwartz got cut off and fell down, but Brissett was hellbent on going his direction.

This was a case of trying to go with the initial read hell or high water and not reacting to what the defense was giving him. 

I know Brissett knows it was a mistake and i know he immediatly knew where he should have gone with the ball as soon as it happened. He is a really intelligent QB and you could see his frustration with himself as soon as he hit the sideline.

Other than that play Brissett was pretty solid with reads. The game was a case of extremely vanilla playcalling with a lot of high low concepts not much else. Obviously our offense wont be called this way in the regular season (duh). But coach just wanted the players to get their feet wet.

However,

It's pretty clear that the interior defensive line is not a priority for the Browns. And if you follow the advanced metrics there is a good reason. Running the ball just doesnt translate to wins anymore.

According to Jason Lloyd:

> The stats on this are bonkers. Teams that average 8 yards per carry, **8 yards per carry** over the past however many years are like 12 and 12. Like it doesn't guarantee you anything. But if you throw it for like 12 yards per pass [completion] you are like 32 and 1. You HAVE to throw the ball to win in the NFL.

A part of me still wants to believe that because i love old school trench football, especially in the mud and snow. But the numbers are pretty clear that running just doesnt *really* matter anymore. 

I think the Browns are holding on to the run game because they probably believe the run game will help you keep your leads and take the air out of the ball. Like... Deshaun kills the opponents, D'chunt nails the coffin shut. 

Plus just the threat of a run opens up the field so much when the opposition has to put out an extra linebacker or lineman instead of an extra DB.

4643,27135,27135,ClevelandOG,"I posted this in another thread, but watch Baker's feet really closely. Like frame by frame close. He is supposed to go right foot back, but he stamps his right foot in a false step, then goes left foot back (which is how he learned). He still needs to throw off his right foot back base which means there are 2 extra (1 and a half) extra steps for each drop back.

By the end of the game he was going straight left foot back with no right foot false step. But that still leaves an extra step.

To add to this, he does 1 or 2 huge leg crosses, sometime even heel clicks on his way back.

This causes him to be almost always 10 yards off the line of scrimmage on his release.

To add to THAT he throws off his back toe with his heel in the air. Which gives him barely any base to throw from.

Timing routes just cannot work when there are that many moving parts. Sure you can connect on a couple. But there will be no long term consistency whatsoever. And it for sure leads to high pick rates when you are throwing consistently a half second later than you are supposed to.

Hudson did not deserve to be called out after that game by baker in the public media. When you drop back that far it causes watt to almost take a straight line or barely curving line to the QB.

That is an extremely childish thing to do. It is frankly disgusting to call out your linemen like that. On the field you can yell at your linemen, you can get in their face about missing protections. But you never EVER call them out in public like that.

4661,27156,27156,ClevelandOG,"Oh, i didnt want to seem confrontational. I appeciate the discussion. But i know the frustrations of the linemen with Baker. Between drifting in the pocket, taking way too large of drops, and trying to escape when there is no reason to, they rarely ever know where he's going to be and it's a nightmare to block for someone like that.

I think that sack doesnt happen if he makes Watt run around the edge instead of going in a straight line, as well as if he had time to get 10 yards down the field and take 6 steps, he for sure had enough time to get the ball out if his fundementals were solid. 

But then again, i cant see the routes being run since the camera is zoomed in on Baker...

Even so though, if he sees that nobody is open off the snap, his first instinct should have been to immediately step up and buy time, or step up to eat the sack and not take a 10 yard loss.

If you give TJ Watt a straight line, you are going to have a bad time. I dont care if you have a prime Mike McCormack over there. Watt will get to you. At the very least give your line *something* to work with.

It's like if you're boxing and you keep your hands on your hips. You cant get mad at your gloves for not blocking punches. You have to get behind your gloves...

4662,27157,27157,ClevelandOG,"> This is totally on Hudson https://youtu.be/MCUgH_jsSqo?t=635

Im not so sure... 

Look specifically at his feet. As soon as the ball is snapped, his first step is left foot back (wrong foot). Then he puts right foot back as his next step and it causes him to awkwardly turn on top of already having a false step.

His next step is a shuffle step where i believe his left heel actually crosses his right, at the very least, it's a heel click.

The next step is yet another shuffle step for when he was about to throw.

The play starts on the 42 yard line, but because of the false steps and the large jumping shuffle, he ends up on the 32 1/2. **That is a 6-step drop, 10 yards from LoS.**

This allows Watt to just take a B-line to the QB and since he's much faster than hudson he doesnt even have to make a real move... It's just a speed rush with a quick swim. I dont know if linemen really expect a QB to be 10 yards back on a shotgun timing route. And since their back is to the QB, they can only block to where the QB *should* be, not to where he actually is.

Also, because of all his bad footwork and heel clicking, it causes his timing routes to be off. The first wrong step immediately messes up the timing with recievers and essentially it puts them a half second farther into their routes than it should. It doesnt seem like much, but it's HUGE in an NFL game. It is the difference between open and a pick/sack.

It should be snap, right foot back, left foot back, and boom, ball out as you plant your right foot 3rd step. And if it isnt there, you need to step up so you dont end up so far from the line of scrimmage and leave your linemen out to dry.

I dont know how to do timestamps (thank you for doing it with your videos) but if you watch something like a peyton manning video and look how he handles the shotgun, you will see a gigantic difference in footwork. Baker's fundementals are so so so bad that it's frustrating.

He certainly has the arm talent to be a good QB, but this is year 4 and we are still seeing habits that should have been gone by high school graduation.

Then he got a woman drunk at a bar and had his bodyguard take the woman to a back room where he entered with his dick out. When the woman tried to escape, she fled into the women's bathroom, Ben followed her inside, closed the door and raped her while his body guard stood outside to make sure she didnt escape.

The league gave him 6 games for the incident, appealed to 4, then he made it to the superbowl that same year and all was forgotten when he signed a record breaking contract in that offseason.

He is a lawyer with major political aspirations. He rubs shoulders with prominent conservative politicians, he donates tons of money to campaigns. And he ran multiple times for poltical seats. Once for state house and most recently for mayor of houston in 2018. He will 100% run again for a major political seat when this is over.

After this case, so many more people will know the ""Buzbee"" name. Enough that his next campaign will be a breeze. He has already won regardless of the outcome of the case, and it is in his personal best interest to drag it out as long as he possibly can with the new accuser movie of the week.

More fun facts about buzbee:

He started out as a democrat, but then switched to republican when he realized he didnt get as much support and couldn't win political races in texas as easily wearing blue.

He held fundraisers for trump's campaign, but then backed off Trump when the access hollywood tapes came out and Buzbee publicly ""disavowed"" him. But when he realized trump was winning, he donated 500k to Trump's inauguration committee.

He was arrested for a DUI in 2016 but later that year, the DA mysteriously *personally* dismissed the case. Then Buzbee somehow finished his year long probation in 8 months. It was later revealed he was contributing to the DA's campaign fund.

It is vitally important that we separate the claims from the litigator here. Buzbee is a very easy target to attack because hes a grade A sleeze. But that doesnt make the cases any less valid. It is hard to refuse when you cant find a lawyer to take your case but then a ""hot shot"" billionaire lawyer comes in and promises you the moon.

4687,27195,27195,ClevelandOG,"I get your point here, but lets say the opposite happens and he *does* get injured. Then you for sure get nothing. Nothing in Baker's history says he's a red flag, and he has a really low projected injury risk. Plus, Baker is a really tough person. GMs are aware of everything about him, including that he wont back down from a bit of pain.

As for the projected 17 game season, that is exactly the rub of Mayfield. He can torch teams when the conditions are right and everything is rolling his way. But his inconsistent mechanics cause him to crumble under pressure when your mechanics should be there to save you.

For instance, lets say you play an instrument, and you learn to play a song once and can perform it in front of your best friend without a problem. If you ramp the stress up to 100 and put 20,000 people in a concert hall, it would be difficult to play perfectly. However if you practice the song over and over and over, even if you black out, your muscle memory will take over and you can play the song without even remembering playing it.

Baker is at the point where he can make amazing throws. He has the arm talent to sling it. But when he gets to points where pressure piles up, or hes against really good defenses, his mechanics break down because they are so inconsistent.

There is a reason why Baker ranked 31/32 in the league on 4th quarter QBR. And has been known as someone who cannot close out games. 

Baker could be a GREAT qb if he swallows his pride and works with a QB coach all offseason. And every offseason from now until retirement. You could see how much better he was when AVP changed just his footwork. But then he went right back to his old ways as soon as he hit adversity.

I know Brissett **can** play. Miami was a bad situation for him. Bad oline, horrendous play calling, and no semblance of a game plan when Brissett was in.

For instance, in the Myles Garret fracas, Larry O and Myles both got Thrash and both their suspensions were upheld. Pouncey got Brooks as his appeal officer and his suspension was reduced. (Rudolph got nothing because everyone felt sorry he was born with that face.)

Not to say that they never deviated from that trend, but the players all knew there was at least a bit of bias between the 2.

Now, however, the appeals process is a crap shoot as Goodell has absolute final say regardless of the suspension time (unless it's zero). If the investigator recommends 4 games and you appeal it, Goodell can make it 6 years if he feels like it.

But i think the reason why the atmosphere has changed so much isnt exactly the stadium, it is the price of tickets and increased security. It used to be that you could park in the muni lot for 4 bucks, then wait til after the game started and get a ticket for 5 bucks. Then when you got to your seats, you were given swigs of yukon jack because security didnt give af about that sort of thing...people had literal kegs in the stands.

So for the price of a starbucks reserve coffee today, you could park, watch a game, and get shitfaced drunk.

There is a primary source for my claim. I have yet to see a source from anyone else, which is all i asked for.

I dont even care about Deshaun coming to Cleveland anyway and what hes saying probably isnt exactly true... But it **IS** a primary source.

 my point is that the idea of Baker being the only player to want to play in Cleveland is completely idiotic. But you decided to argue about something irrelevant and outside the original point.

In any case, saying Deshaun had an alterior motive for playing in Cleveland just strenghthens the argument that Baker didnt really ""choose"" Cleveland.",1.0,browns,t3_up3wvn,False,0.0,:crazy-joe:,2022-05-14T20:26:39Z,browns,-0.018477472

Could it possibly be that he wanted to be the #1 draft pick and Cleveland held that pick?

In fact the guy who *actually* chose Cleveland when he had literally 31 other places he could play is Deshaun Watson. So let that one sink in.

The whole attitude that ""nobody wants Cleveland"" is a sorry defeatest attitude that has no merit whatsoever. Players can live anywhere they want in the offseason (Baker chose to live in Lake Travis in Texas), and for the most part, they will all play in the place that pays them the most or gives them the best opportunity. 

Also, i cant find a single instance of a player being signed by Cleveland and them saying they refuse to be there. Obviously Eli Manning did it to San Diego, but if San Diego is not a good destination, God help every other city, maybe it was because the organization was dogshit at the time.

>The Jets quarterback finished his first year in the NFL ranks with a 54.8 passing grade — the lowest among rookies and third-lowest in the NFL ahead of only Sam Darnold and Ben Roethlisberger. He finished with a negatively graded throw rate above 20%, joining Brian Hoyer in 2013 and Terrelle Pryor in 2014 as the only quarterbacks to do so in the last decade. And the young passer didn’t offset that with a high rate of positives, either, as his 2.5% big-time throw rate ranked last among rookies and 28th in the NFL.

Which brings me to the tea leaves.

I think the Browns will package Kareem Hunt and Baker to the Lions for a high pick and the lions taking on Baker's salary. I LOVE Kareem and i would hate to see this happen, but it just makes too much sense...

D'Andre Swift was not good last year (he had a lot of all purpose yards before the injury, but he really didnt perform well) and Jamaal Williams wasnt much better. In fact, when they both went down, Craig Reynolds outperformed them both.

The Lions need a legit running back and they didnt take one in the draft (or a QB for that matter). Both are Dorsey players and we all know too well how Dorsey will gut a team to bring in ""his guys"". It is a win/win trade for both sides. Baker has the fire Detroit wants in a QB.

This season is huge and will determine what echelon we view him in moving forward. Not to mention the whole contract situation lurking in the background.

* Medical staff *clearing* him to play safely, to begin with.
* KS/AVP giving the ""ok.""
* (who knows, maybe Haslam involvement on some level? Maybe Jimmy wanted Baker to play? Complete speculation on my part).
* Baker himself believing he can play without being a detriment to the team.

- refusing to work with a QB guru/coach outside of the season (coincidentally the best throwers of the football are known to do this... odd)
- being stubborn in his (obviously broken) throwing process (especially footwork)
- panics and lowers his head in the pocket at the mere thought of a D lineman in a 10 foot radius of himself

Zac Jackson really sums up most fans - at first he was happy with Watson. Now that it's been a shitshow dealing with his issues he is ready to get off the wildride and already calling the trade for Watson a colossal failure. lol.

I agree with everything you said, esp. overrating the current season vs. future. This was a long term move. We had no shot this year with Baker or really any other realistic QB option available to us. So why is everyone all up in arms that it's likely a wasted season with Watson's suspension?

But what about, say...$25 a year? Maybe $26? That positions him lower than Jimmy Garoppolo, provides staggering cap flexibility for the Browns, and when the cap increases, it would look like a steal.

Obviously Baker would want to bet on himself (it's honestly why he played through injury) but if he realized the reality of the situation was that no team would offer him money comparable to a top-10 deal, perhaps he'd be more willing to take a lesser deal. And if he then performed well, and, say, in 2023, you have the money to throw at a guy like DJ Moore, Deebo Samuel, AJ Brown, or DK Metcalf, well, fuck.

2. Who the fuck knows where that puts Baker now if the Browns commit to him long term? If Carr is making $40, it's almost a guarantee that Lamar Jackson makes more than that. That would likely put them at 2-3 (Lamar) and 4 (Carr) respectively. So what salary even makes sense for Baker then?

This is the other circular problem here: bad teams have remained bad and the churn of head coaches in the NFL is now greater than ever. Think of Byron Leftwich right now. His main suitor has been Jacksonville. The roster sucks ass, the owner is impatient, so when they inevitably go 2-15 and 4-13 in the next two years while Leftwich is left desperately trying to pick up the pieces of a team that doesn't have the talent to succeed, he'll be fired. And then when he gets his Rooney interviews, it creates a systemic feedback loop: ""Well, Leftwich had his chance, he just wasn't good enough."" Giving the next teams up an out and an excuse to hire the same legacy coaches we always see.

So it's not only battling systemic issues, it's battling the fact that the NFL itself simply has too many teams that are actively destroying themselves and amplifying these systemic issues. Think of WAS, CHI, DET, CLE, NYJ, HOU, NYG, LV, JAX. The good teams stay good, and many of the good teams have white head coaches, and them being good coaches on good teams isn't in and of itself racist - even if they likely have, intentionally or unintentionally, benefitted from the system to get to this point.

Of course, Klint got the job with Minnesota because of his dad, who is white. Is this inherently and bluntly racist? No. Is it nepotism? I mean, yes. But why is Klint jumping up the ladder so much?

With that said, if the Browns, or any other team, did make that trade, you then have to go make other big money moves and go all-in like the Rams did. Davante Adams played with Carr in college. You might need to throw a big contract at one of the Bengals DL and add him to the fold. What few 2022 picks you'd have left after any such moves would likely need to be nailed and establish coherent depth. And likely keep a locker-room guy like Jarvis to hold the whole thing together, which also would cost a pretty penny.

It's not specifically a Mayfield issue here imo. It's an issue of if Vegas can keep spinning its wheels with Carr.

10576,75270,75270,JohnnyFire,"I will also say, comparing Baker to Carr, Cousins, or Jimmy is also a feudal mistake on all fronts. We're comparing everything as apples to apples when we have to look at how they all got here.

Cousins was a 4th round safety valve to RGIII, who the Washington Buttfarts proceeded to murder because of organizational incompetence, and then left him sitting on a team that had no real faith in him but also no means of becoming better. Kirk was projected as a project QB who got thrust into a bad situation, and Washington proved that 100% correct. Sure, he got them to the playoffs, but he was largely unable to get over the hump, and he wanted to be paid. He had been franchised multiple times and had stats that implied he was at least a top 12 QB with little talent. Had that been the end of the story, fine, but the problem is, he signed a massive deal with Minnesota, which provided him better offensive talent, aaaaaand the stats remained the same. He didn't become transcendent. He was the same guy who could get you a 4,000+ yard season, but wasn't good enough to suddenly turn you into a playoff squad, even if you had the talent around you.

Carr, meanwhile, was a 2014 2nd who has been through a wildly different situation. While Washington's incompetence held him back, Carr has been held back *even worse* because he's been through some of the worst mismanagement of all time. His stats have remained consistent, but the org traded away his best WR and his best defensive player, and his second best WR he's ever had committed manslaughter, and his next best WR's were in their own heads (Bryant and Brown), and the simply ungodly onslaught of bad coaches, bad hires, and the Las Vegas move all managed to stymie any chance of his success. He's seemed like a good dude who's kept his head down but it's hard to gauge when he's throwing to banged up, second rate, not-good-enough wide-outs, behind a mess of an OL, and a defense that will likely continue to be a revolving door.

Jimmy G, from the same 2014 class, in the same 2nd round was made heir apparent to arguably the greatest QB of this era, if not all time. He got to sit and learn behind Brady, and that was invaluable...until he got traded to San Fran and immediately got banged up in two of his first four seasons. Injuries aside, while he is a ""winner"", he just doesn't have enough tape to justify what he could bring.

And with all 3, you have one other big issue that all QB's that make it past year 8 have: are they ever going to better than they are right now?

It is extremely, painfully hard to gauge, because Matt Stafford, while a darling of fantasy, seemed for all intents and purposes to be on the down-turn ahead of his trade to LAR. In 2019, he was banged up; in 2020, he made his lowest total attempts for a full season, flat out, ever. And while you could argue he had Calvin Johnson, he really didn't have much else in Detroit through 3 playoff appearances. Yet, he comes bac in 2021 with LA and throws 41 TD's (and 17 interceptions, mind), his attempts and completion % actually go up, has his second best QB rating of his career, and third most total yards. In his 13th NFL season. Time will tell if this is an anomaly or a trend.

If you believe in the Stafford rule...you probably want Carr, in that case. Cousins has been given the tools to become great, but he's ultimately not been able to get over the hump. Jimmy G has been way too banged up over his career, and has looked too pedestrian stats-wise in the meantime. Carr at least you could argue has been consistent in the face of a team that has been maddeningly in flux - to very minimal fault of his own.",0.0,browns,t3_sdu0f0,False,0.0,:brownie-elf:,2022-01-27T16:15:04Z,browns,-0.0243254198835032

* Mike Williams unfortunately has a bad habit of shirking away. Kind of a 200+ yards 3 TD or sitting on his hands kind of player. That said, he's definitely got potential to be a WR2 given his play style but that would likely require a WR investment in the draft's first round.

* Hurts is simple: Philly decides to go all in on Watson for whatever reason. Houston's demands are too high and they don't want Hurts. Cleveland steps in and throws in mid-round capital and (""hometown QB"") Baker to Houston, gets Hurts in return to complete the trade.

* Jimmy G, purely statistically, is very nearly a lateral move compared to Baker.

While I could be dead wrong, and the Niners could be giving up on Alex Smith all over again here, I think there is valid reason to have trepidation on GORP - when the organization is so willing to move on from someone who took them as far as he did, there is usually a very good reason for that.",2.0,browns,t3_rwqel0,False,0.0,:brownie-elf:,2022-01-06T07:15:31Z,browns,-0.0302662759555265

The idea is that Cleveland steps in, offers some mid-rounders to Houston and sends Baker ""home"" to Texas in order to sweeten the deal - and in return, Cleveland would get Hurts since he'd need to likely move in the deal as well.

As far as OL is concerned, with Conklin and Wills back at full health, other than the concerns about Tretter long term, Teller and Bitonio are still elite OG. I feel like we're fine if they're all healthy. And obviously you have a few guys like Hudson and Harris who can act as depth (Both need more time before being asked to start long term) - but finding some more capable depth options is key. It was also kind of odd to have pretty much 3 RT's injured through this year, but none appear to be harming that side of the line long-term, for now at least.

Drafting 3 WR's isn't the answer. I'd say we draft a single WR (regardless of in the first or second) and go to FA to find another option. Like noted, even if we're not dumping a ton of cash towards a guy like Adams, if you get a proper X guy in the draft and add Kirk as a speedy slot option, with DPJ at WR3 and scatter sets...eh?

I think plenty of players understand that this was a very strange season between injuries, COVID, and the mass of close games. There's only so much you can do. Will all of them be brought back?

10615,75315,75315,JohnnyFire,"* After Baker has had surgery, put him, Berry, and the coaches in a room and figure out what else went wrong. If there's a mental block, figure out how to get past it. If it really is that the WR's weren't working and the OL depth didn't work, look to the draft and FA to fix it. If Baker and Stefanski are now irreparable, determine what needs to be done - either to manage a trade, or to add a better option at OC to maximize Baker's capabilities. If Baker seems to be the problem in this scenario, see the prior option.

* Internally, bring back Clowney, Njoku, Stewart, and one or both of the Malik's, depending upon the contract. We likely lose D'Ernest but see if you can't run some kind of short term contract and trade him to another team in need of RB help (think JAX if Robinson and Etienne aren't ready, or Houston if the Daniel Johnson experiment is over.) If you have no trade interest on Hooper, it might be worth a post-6/1 cut, since the savings will be immense and allow you flexibility if there are still some names on the market. Find a way to get Denzel Ward re-signed.

* Get the OL and Hunt healthy ASAP. This is the biggest hurdle for this team right now if keeping the OL held together. If you get depth, find guys that slot in well for our needs. Someone who can be the Tretter replacement in 2023 is key if it's not Harris - perhaps Justin Britt or Nick Martin? Also, a viable replacement tackle who can play both ways. Plenty of guys who can get flyers out.

* On defense, look to find a proper defensive mid-field leader. Walker is not that guy. Tennessee's mass of LB talent is coming out this year and all might make sense for us. Go after another developmental, high-upside talent in the draft otherwise. Not a great group to add to the DL or find depth but DJ Jones is a name to watch if San Fran gets Rodgers and have no assets to sign some lower end FA's with. There's no way Cincy lets BJ Hill go but if they do, throw the money at him.

* WR is obviously a grave concern. This is a good draft to need one with at least 3-6 guys projected for Day 1 or early Day 2 values. A trade will be tempting but I don't think there's an obvious candidate out there who can immediately fix the issues and won't cost a ton of capital. As far as free agents, the big get is Davante Adams, but he's almost certainly priced out of CLE. For my money, I'm *in* on Chris Godwin. I know he's been banged up but if he's back and healthy, the dude is going to be only 26, and he was balling out before Brady even got to TB. 11.3 YPR is huge and although he's only 6'1"" he plays above his size. Allen Robinson is intriguing but ultimately may be a reclamation project. JuJu Smith-Schuster is a great dude but between injuries and getting absolutely humbled after his TikTok disrespect the last two years I'm not sure he fits here. A few other intriguing names: Christian Kirk and Mike Williams, of whom I believe will both resign with the current teams but have been *on* in 2021.

* At QB - if we're set to move off Baker, then you have to actually get an improvement. Looking statistically, that *starts* at Kirk Cousins and goes up from there - and Cousins doesn't make much sense. Derek Carr is interesting because he's been absolutely jobbed by LV and OAK, but his stats are hard to gauge, even knowing his best two WR's were A. Traded and B. Committed Vehicular Manslaughter. Matt Ryan is intriguing because of the Stafford effect but his contract is horrific and he might be cooked. Both will require at least a first barring something nuts. I know Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers are available but I doubt either wants to come here and will result in Cleveland parting with upwards of 3 draft picks. I could see us getting in on Watson but you'd have to be 100% sure he's going to be able to play. I could also see us leveraging the Watson deal to try and snag either Hurts or Tua depending on how Houston feels about them (offering Baker and maybe some capital to offset the pick loss for Philly and giving Houston a hometown QB). I don't think the answer is a bridge guy like Trubisky, Brigewater, or Mariota, nor do I see it being a rookie when you have so many guys in their window. Most likely end result is we stick with Baker, either way.

* Hitting the draft, you have to go BPA, but hope that BPA is a WR, LB, or DL. Trade around to keep your assets fluid in the middle rounds - if the Baker experiment does go belly up so you have some capital in case you need to move up for a QB in 2023. 

* Finding a new OC if AVP is out is paramount - but I think you also need one with a foundation in the passing game since Stefanski's operation with the run game is solid enough (barring the last several weeks, of course). Mike Kafka (KC) is the big get at OC having worked with Mahomes and Smith. Pep Hamilton is back on the market after showing how Justin Herbert can be amazing and having to suffer through 2016 Browns and 2021 Texans seasons.

**Cleveland wanted Blake Bortles at 4, welcome to my Ted Talk:**

* The week leading up to the draft, rumors were swirling that Cleveland was highly interested in Bortles.

* The Browns had Hoyer. Bortles was well logged by nearly every major pundit as a player that needed to sit in 2014 and possibly 2015 to get up to full tilt.

* When Jacksonville took Bortles, it blew up their entire draft board and they panicked - they traded back with Buffalo thinking they could get the next guy on their board at 9.

* The next guy on their board was Mike Evans, who was then taken at 7.

* Panicking again that they massive mis-evaluated the entire board, Cleveland then trades up one spot and gives up late round assets for the DB they hoped to grab at 26, Justin Gilbert.

* Realizing that fan reaction and pundit reaction has been wildly negative, Cleveland then decides they have to make a ""splash"" move, rather than adding the QB they had evaluated higher in Bridgewater. 

* So they trade up at get Manziel to spin it as a win. It wasn't.",3.0,nfl,t3_rbui9b,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2021-12-08T15:20:58Z,browns,0.0055288391807299
10627,75332,75332,JohnnyFire,"It's funnier in hindsight, because the Browns really had no one to lap for Quinn. They could've traded well into the final 4-5 picks of the first round for Quinn and given up far less - or even went with a lesser option to build up like Kolb.

Cleveland's picks in 2008 thankfully were barely used well, but the fact that a team with so much hype had absolutely no assets to get better with tanked them. Even just getting back the first, on the board were Chris Johnson, Mike Jenkins, Duane Brown, Brandon Flowers, and Jordy Nelson, any of whom would've been a huge piece to trying to keep up the momentum after 10-6.

Add to that: Derek Anderson then emerges with a phenomenal season. If the Browns wanted to get back into the 2008 discussion, they could've traded Anderson and capitalized on the hype, but instead, they were primed to let Anderson ""earn"" the job again vs Quinn.

They had no way to get better in 2008 and then just made it worse.",2.0,nfl,t3_rbui9b,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2021-12-08T15:15:40Z,browns,-0.0483948001500832

1. We are likely not lapping LAC in any environment. Their schedule is so friendly its borderline absurd.

2. All four AFC North Teams have some rough runs to the end of the season. Other than PIT, none of us play a team below .500 (Steelers get Minnesota).

3. 10 wins might still not be enough, which is absolutely absurd. Assuming the Browns did win 10, there are multiple scenarios where they still aren't a playoff team. If the Browns, Colts, Dolphins, and Pats all go 10-7, and the Ravens win just one additional game from our scenario here, they are the 9th seed.

Point being: Cleveland needs a lot of help right now.

If Baker's hurt, he shouldn't be playing and he's costing himself money by going out there and looking bad. If Baker's not hurt enough that it would affect his play, he is playing horrifically and he's costing himself money by going out there and looking bad. I get wanting to earn that bag, I get wanting to play for your team, but so far this year, for any variety of reasons, plenty of *good* starting QB's have sat: Kyler, Dak, Russ, Lamar. Even less cornerstone players like Bridgewater, Tua, Goff, Garoppolo, and of course Rogers and Roethlisberger for COVID reasons. It's a long season, and now even longer with a 17th game and an expanded playoff.

We can go down to the muni and have a knife fight over if Baker Mayfield is capable of leading the Browns all we want, but do not have a fight on if he's not hurt. He is. He needs to sit.

10634,75343,75343,JohnnyFire,"The struggle right now - you have a roster of players that is better than you've ever had in your franchise since it came back. Garrett, Clowney, JOK, Delpit, Ward, Newsome, JJIII, Chubb, Teller, Bitonio, Wills, Njoku, Tretter. This isn't like the early 2010's where you had maybe three guys worth a damn (Thomas/Haden/Ward) at a time.

So what the hell do you do? If Baker's cooked, you can't go get a rookie and wait for them to develop, and you can't trade for someone who isn't a *significant improvement* over Baker, or else you'll look like a fucking moron. You can't move off Stefanski, but is he going to be willing to move off of play-calling without a struggle? Do you have the money and capabilities to go get a big name WR, and one that will mesh with this team - A-Rob, Davante, Godwin? Do you draft a WR that can slot in immediately? If you move off Hooper, do you resign Njoku? Who becomes the third guy in the TE room - we know Stefanski wants his third TE to play with. 

Like we went from being in impressive shape and a perennial playoff contender to potentially needing to rebuild a quarter of this team. And that's awful. The only thing worse than being bad in the NFL is being ***mediocre***.

To answer your questions/rants in order:

1) Browns have had a massive, but quiet fanbase for years. Now that they can get these clicks/revenue, they’ll beat a dead horse. It sucks. But all you have to do is win.

2) 4-4 isn’t bad. But it isn’t good either. With the expectations laid out there and underperforming, that’s where the toxicity lies. It is what it is at this point, but like I said above, as long as you win, nobody gives a shit. 

3) Basically envision it like this: Robbie Keane one day up and decided during his prime that he fucking hated FAI’s guts with a passion and decided to not play until something was done to get him fed more through balls for finishing on goal. That’s what’s happening. Total diva move and not putting the team before himself.

12388,89292,89292,MyChubbGotRubbed,"1 Derrick Henry, Tennessee Titans Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 6 Age: 28 | Last year's ranking: 1

""I'd still give him one more year at the top,"" an NFL coordinator said. ""He's the constant for that offense no matter who's around him. I still trust him to make it happen above anyone else. You can give him the ball 30 times and he won't disappoint.""

2 Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 7 Age: 23 | Last year's ranking: Honorable mention

""You go into the game with the Colts and say, 'Don't let him kill you. Make the quarterback beat you,'"" an NFC exec said. ""He's No. 1, 2 and 3 on the game plan.""

3 Nick Chubb, Cleveland Browns Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 7 Age: 26 | Last year's ranking: 5

""He was born to run the football,"" an NFC exec said.

4 Dalvin Cook, Minnesota Vikings Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 8 Age: 26 | Last year's ranking: 3

""He needs to stay on the field. The whole team is different when he's in there,"" a veteran NFL offensive coach said. ""He's great and can get even better with discipline as a runner and growing as a third-down receiver. I think he'll show a more all-around game in a new offense.""

5 Alvin Kamara, New Orleans Saints Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 10 Age: 26 | Last year's ranking: 2

""You can put a really good safety on him, and he'll still come back to the sideline and say, 'Uh, we've got a problem,'"" a veteran AFC coach said.

6 Joe Mixon, Cincinnati Bengals Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 25 | Last year's ranking: 9

""He improved a lot as far as pass protection, his detail in his work,"" an AFC coordinator said. ""He's definitely a complete back. He always had the explosive component. The Bengals are better, so he's no longer an underrated player.""

7 Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers Highest ranking: 5 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 26 | Last year's ranking: 5

""Not as dynamic as some others, can't stay healthy,"" said an NFC exec of McCaffrey, who has missed 23 games the past two seasons. ""I'm guessing Carolina will give him less touches in efforts to preserve him.""

8 Najee Harris, Pittsburgh Steelers Highest ranking: 3 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 24 | Last year's ranking: Unranked (rookie)

""Not for me. He had 1,200 yards when everyone knew he was going to run it. They knew the Steelers weren't throwing deep and their offensive line was terrible.""

9 Aaron Jones, Green Bay Packers Highest ranking: 6 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 27 | Last year's ranking: 8

""Versatility -- he does a lot of stuff for [the Packers],"" an NFC exec said. ""The offense is better when he is in there. He really boosts their passing game and is really good getting out on the edge or making something happen with screens.""

10 Javonte Williams, Denver Broncos Highest ranking: 2 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 27 | Last year's ranking: Unranked (rookie)

""You can't get him on the ground, can't tackle him,"" an NFL personnel official said. ""That kid is really good. Depends which offense you're running in that [Ekeler vs. Williams] discussion, and Ekeler is really, really good. But with Williams you just can see defenses feeling like, 'I'm tired of tackling him.' He's not as fast as Taylor but has everything else.""

Honorable mentions

Austin Ekeler, Los Angeles Chargers: Ekeler appeared on several top-10 ballots thanks to a career-high 911 rushing yards to complement his always stout passing-game presence. An AFC coach describes Ekeler as an all-purpose back who has a feel for the passing game. ""Huge asset to Justin Herbert,"" the coach says.

Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas Cowboys: Elliott's fall outside the top 10 is still a bit surprising considering he just produced his third career 1,000-yard, 10-touchdown season. But his rushing yards per game have dipped in each of his six NFL seasons, from 108.7 in 2016 to 58.9 last year. ""He's still a good player, but that burst he once had just doesn't seem to be there,"" an NFC exec said.

Saquon Barkley, New York Giants: Barkley was No. 1 on this list two years ago, but his decline has been precipitous. Injuries have cost him 22 games over four seasons, but that's hardly the only issue with his game. In 2021, he produced just 593 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 162 carries. ""I'm down on him -- he still doesn't know how to play running back enough,"" a veteran NFL offensive coach said. ""He's a bouncer. He wants every run to be a home run. He's going to have to learn that 4-yard runs in this league are good, instead of stopping, cutting it back and losing 2. And he gets his ass kicked in protection.""

If y'all haven't read Dixon's book, ""Day of the Dawg"", it's well worth it. Here's one of my favorite Hanford Dixon stories:

---

>Although I was all of 170 pounds, I looked forward to taking shots at the big boys, like Pete Johnson and later Earl Campbell. By December of my rookie year, the Browns were mired in last place, but I looked forward to taking on Campbell when we went to Houston for a nationally televised Thursday night game on December 3. 

>“Damn. You haven’t seen Earl Campbell,” my teammates told me all week. “Well, Earl Campbell hasn’t seen Hanford Dixon,” I responded with all due cockiness.

>Early in the game, Campbell came around the left side on a sweep. I fixed my eyes on him and charged forward. He looked at me and took aim, and bam! I saw stars. It was just like running into that telephone pole while playing football with my friends back in Theodore. The first thing I thought to myself was, “Oh shit. I’m hurt.” But I wasn’t about to let Campbell, or any of the Oilers for that matter, see me hurt. It’s not just a pride thing. If the opposing coaches upstairs see that you’re hurt, they’ll run a go pattern past your sagging ass on the next play. So I jumped up, maintained my composure as best I could, jogged to the sideline, and sat my ass down. After a second or two, I realized something was wrong. I was sitting on the wrong bench, on the wrong sideline. I jumped up and trotted over to our sideline, much to the amusement of the veterans. We went on to lose that game, 17-13.",9.0,browns,t3_x2hl26,False,0.0,:brownie-elf:,2022-08-31T17:49:30Z,browns,-0.0175929437289784

>>From Denver's perspective, this adds a valuable top-100 pick and still keeps it in the discussion for the best edge rushers in the class.

>>Drake London, WR, USC

>>The Browns have a void at wide receiver and have to add better players around Baker Mayfield.

>>London is a 6-foot-5 aerial threat with the traits to be an end zone weapon. He averaged 11 catches and 136 yards per game last season, before he broke his ankle in late October. He would make Mayfield better.

We are a zome run team, our OL is really good at it. What makes us a dominant ground game though is our variety of runs. We do inside and outside zone well, our guards are extremely good at pulling to run those power concepts, the OL takes it another step too and can run more power schemes like duo (double teams on DL). Point being, our scheme for running is extremely diverse and we can pivot constantly. The defense puts a heavy personnel front out, ok, lets get zone going so they can't catch us side to side. Defense goes light with a dime look and fewer DL, ok, lets pull some guards or double teama up the gut with power. Another option would be running with the QB but we obviously can't do that.


So yeah, Baker is ok in running the QB friendly West Coast offense but we, like the 49ers, struggle to incorporate other stuff: air raid like Kyler in Arizona, or RPOs like the Chiefs run, or like Pit trying to let Ben read things by running a crap ton of shotgun.

I think you're right but for different reasons. 

My feeling, and it is just a feeling I admit, is that some bad shit went down in the locker room over the course of the 2021 season. The seemingly broken relationship between Kev and Baker, the OBJ saga, statements like we just saw from JJ3 implying that a significant faction among the players didnt like working with Baker, the ill advised ""we needed an adult in the room"" comment probably leaked from ownership... 

We'll never know the truth but I think that things started going off the rails when Baker went outside the team to get a 2nd opinion on whether he could play when the team doctors said he needed to sit out... that was the beginning of it. It suggests he was fighting back against the decisions of others in the building, trying to secure his spot.

As Baker's form was affected, his confidence collapsed, he probably turned the bravado up to 11, his footwork went completely to shit (after it was fixed in 2020), he's missing thows, he's not seeing open guys, and meanwhile OBJ (who was universally liked among the players) is already lowkey unhappy to begin the season and goes fucking sabotuer just to get off the team... then you get the comments from Kev & co. along the lines of ""it's Baker's choice to play"" etc... and we're still somehow in the playoff hunt... and eventually it all ends in Green Bay and Pittsburgh with some of the worst imploding QB play you'll ever see.  

Idk man, I just feel like after last season it was over for Baker in Cleveland. If it wasn't Watson it would have been Ryan or Cousins some other QB brought in as the dominos fell. I think people in the building felt that keeping a mid tier QB who's falling out with the head coach and is resented by a large group of players (who they want to keep around) wouldn't be worth the trouble.

25599,186302,186302,gettin,"Quarterback Deshaun Watson was suspended Monday for six games for violating the N.F.L.’s personal conduct policy and was not fined, concluding the league’s 15-month investigation into sexual misconduct claims made against him by more than two dozen women.

It was the first N.F.L. player disciplinary decision to be handled by an arbitration process established in the 2020 collective bargaining agreement, which sought to bolster a system that had been criticized for inconsistencies and potential conflicts of interest.

Since Roger Goodell became N.F.L. commissioner in 2006, he has taken a stricter stance on player punishment than his predecessors, levying some of the lengthiest player suspensions in the league’s history. The personal conduct policy includes provisions for penalizing players even if their transgressions did not result in criminal convictions.

But while Goodell once wielded unilateral power in disciplinary action, revisions to the policy in the last decade have shifted some of the process to third parties. Watson’s penalty was imposed by a retired federal judge who was jointly approved by the league and the players’ union. But Goodell, or someone he appoints, would still have the last word if the league appeals the decision.

Here are some of the most notable suspensions of N.F.L. players during Goodell’s tenure as commissioner:

Suspensions that lasted more than one season

Michael Vick. Vick, a former Atlanta quarterback, was indefinitely suspended in 2007 for his role in a dogfighting scandal. The suspension lasted two seasons; Vick was reinstated before the 2009 season after serving an 18-month prison sentence.

Aldon Smith. Smith, a defensive end who played for San Francisco and Oakland, was suspended in 2015 for a violation of the substance abuse policy (he had been charged with drunken driving). The suspension lasted until Smith was signed by Dallas in 2020 and reinstated.

Dominic Rhodes. Rhodes, a running back who played for several teams, was suspended indefinitely in 2011 after failing a third drug test. He was reinstated in 2014.

Jerrell Freeman. Freeman, a linebacker, was suspended twice for multiple games after positive tests for performance-enhancing drugs while with Chicago in 2016 and 2017. The N.F.L. suspended him for two years for another failed test in 2018, though he announced his retirement days before the suspension.

One season

Adam (Pacman) Jones. Jones, a cornerback then with Tennessee, was suspended for the 2007 season after multiple arrests, including for his role in a fight at a strip club that led to three people being shot.

Calvin Ridley. Ridley, an Atlanta receiver, was suspended for at least a year after he bet on N.F.L. games while away from the team during the 2021 season.

Donte’ Stallworth. After striking and killing a pedestrian in Miami Beach while driving drunk, Stallworth, then a receiver with Cleveland, was suspended for the entire 2009 season. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

Darren Waller. In 2017, Waller, then a Baltimore tight end, was suspended for at least one year for violating the substance abuse policy. He had been suspended for four games in the 2016 season for the same violation. He was reinstated in 2018.

Martavis Bryant. Bryant, a receiver, was suspended for at least one year for violating the league’s substance abuse policy in 2016. After being conditionally reinstated in April 2017, Bryant was suspended indefinitely in 2018 for violating the terms of the reinstatement.

Travis Henry. In 2008, Henry, then a Denver running back, was suspended for at least one year after he tested positive for marijuana for the third time. Before his suspension was complete, Henry was sentenced to three years in prison for financing a drug operation. The N.F.L. reinstated him in 2012.

Josh Gordon. Gordon, a receiver currently with Kansas City, has been suspended six times for violating the league’s substance abuse policy, including a suspension for the entire 2015 season. He was most recently suspended in January 2021 and reinstated in September 2021.


12 games / 12 weeks

Ray Rice. Rice was initially suspended for two games by the N.F.L. after his arrest on domestic violence charges in July 2014. Two months later, after TMZ released a more graphic video of the assault that showed Rice knocking his fiancée unconscious in a hotel elevator, Baltimore released the running back and he was suspended indefinitely by the N.F.L. Rice was reinstated on Nov. 28, after the first 12 weeks of the 2014 season, but he was never signed by a team.

Vontaze Burfict. Burfict, an Oakland linebacker, was suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season after his helmet-to-helmet hit to Indianapolis tight end Jack Doyle in a Week 4 game. Burfict’s penalty, the N.F.L.’s longest suspension ever for on-field actions, took into account his lengthy history of violations of the league’s player safety policies.


10 games

Josh Brent: For his role in the 2013 drunken driving death of a Dallas teammate, Brent, a defensive tackle, was suspended for 10 games of the 2014 season. He was also sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years of probation.

Eight games
Antonio Brown. In 2020, the league suspended Brown, a receiver who was a free agent at the time, for sending threatening texts to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, and for his role in a dispute with a moving company employee. He pleaded no contest to burglary and battery charges and received two years of probation. Brown denied the sexual misconduct claim.

Chris Henry. The league suspended Henry, a Cincinnati receiver, in 2007 after he was arrested four times between December 2005 and June 2006.

Terry (Tank) Johnson. Johnson, a defensive tackle then with Chicago, was suspended in 2007 after the police raided his home and found six unregistered firearms, a violation of his probation on an earlier gun charge.

Mychal Kendricks. Kendricks was suspended after pleading guilty to two insider trading charges in 2018.


Six games

Josh Brown. Brown, a kicker who had been suspended for one game in 2016 after admitting to the Giants that he abused his wife, was suspended for six more games in 2017 after documents released by the Washington State Police revealed he had written extensively about the abuse.

Adrian Peterson. After being indicted on child abuse charges, Peterson, then Minnesota’s star running back, was suspended for the remainder of the 2014 season, which resulted in six missed games.

Myles Garrett. The N.F.L. indefinitely suspended Garrett, a Cleveland defensive end, after he removed the helmet of Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph and hit him with it in 2019. The league reinstated Garrett two days after he met with Goodell and league representatives at the end of the season.

DeAndre Hopkins. Hopkins, an Arizona receiver, was suspended in May after violating the league’s performance-enhancing drug policy.

Ezekiel Elliott. Elliott, a star running back for Dallas, was suspended in 2017 after a league investigation into domestic violence allegations. An ex-girlfriend accused him of assaulting her five times in Columbus, Ohio, where he played at Ohio State. He was never criminally charged.

Five games
Albert Haynesworth. In 2006, Haynesworth, then a Tennessee defensive tackle, was suspended for stomping on the head of an opposing player. Goodell handed down the suspension weeks after he became commissioner.

Terrelle Pryor. Pryor, who had been handed a five-game suspension by the N.C.A.A. for accepting improper benefits while at Ohio State, entered the N.F.L. supplemental draft instead. The N.F.L. mandated that he sit out the first five games of his rookie season.


Four games

Tom Brady. Brady was suspended in 2016 for his involvement in the Deflategate scandal that emerged after Indianapolis accused New England of deflating footballs to give Brady an advantage.

Ben Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger was initially handed a six-game suspension in 2010 after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a Georgia bar. He was not criminally charged and Goodell reduced the suspension to four games after an appeal. The Pittsburgh quarterback was the first player to be suspended under the league’s personal conduct policy without having been charged with a crime.

Greg Hardy. The N.F.L. suspended Hardy, a defensive end, for 10 games in 2015 for his role in a domestic-violence case. An arbitrator reduced the penalty to four games.

Ikemefuna Enemkpali. The league suspended Enemkpali, then a Jets linebacker, for punching his own team’s quarterback Geno Smith during a locker room altercation in 2014.


Three games

Jameis Winston. Winston, a quarterback then with Tampa Bay, was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season. The penalty stemmed from an N.F.L. investigation into a BuzzFeed report that said he made an unwanted sexual advance on an Uber driver in March 2016.",43.0,nfl,t3_wg3ac6,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns :Browns: Browns,2022-08-04T09:59:50Z,browns,-0.0021972644364469

25602,186305,186305,gettin,"Let me get this straight... (I am a Browns fan so things do not come easily to me as you can see from my fandom)

The NFL and the NFLPA agreed to appoint an impartial, independent judge.  Who also happens to be a woman.

The judge used the prior NFL suspensions as a baseline for the six game suspension.

The judge made her findings known to the NFL in June

The NFL, not happy with the ruling, sat on that ruling until this week, and then appealed it.

Watson is guilty.  The judge has shown that.  He is being suspended longer than the judge recommended, again due to prior suspension amounts, because the NFL now wants to set an example.  This is not a just way to go about this process.  It is not Watson's fault that the NFL did not have longer suspensions in the past.  

There is no reason to have an independent judge if everyone (except Watson and his camp) see that he is clearly guilty.  The  NFL could have just suspended him on their own.

Why did the NFL sit on this ruling?

Why are they choosing to make such an example out of Watson?  

Why are they not adhering to the independent judge?

Example:  One person wants to buy a friend's house. They are not using a realtor as there really is no home to search for.  They get an independent agent to do a market analysis to determine fair market value.  The house comes in at $400k where the seller thought the home would come in at $450k... and the seller blows up the deal by insisting that the price be $450k.

Is is the sellers right to do this?  Yes.  No laws are broken, there is no contract.  But why even have the market analysis?  What is the point?  It is negotiating in bad faith.",-6.0,nfl,t3_wfr0qs,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns :Browns: Browns,2022-08-04T08:34:16Z,browns,-0.0074147338942168

for the majority of this you're using hindsight. the 3 QBs you named off had major concerns going into the Draft. Allen was never consistent and was seen as a major project. Mahomes was seen as boom or bust. as for Lamar the majority of teams were wondering if he'd be willing to switch positions. in all 3 cases it took a team that was willing to be patient (allen), change their entire offensive philosophy (jackson) or an offensive genius (mahomes) to be the right spots for those QBs to thrive.

Winking Lizard is also in walking distance and is a pretty good place to get wings and drink - they have pretty big selection. E 4th is a little alleyway between Euclid and Prospect that has some great places, notably Mable's, as well as Butcher and the Brewer. City Tap is a slightly longer walk, but they also have great wings and beer selections.  

A short Uber ride will get you over to W 25th, which has quite a few great places - Market Garden Brewery, Great Lakes Brewing Company, Nano Brew, and quite a few other restaurant (just avoid TownHall). 

Up the road a bit from there is Saucy Brew Works, which has great pizza (sorry, not deep dish) and craft beer. 

Slightly further to the west is Stone Mad Pub and Terrestrial Brewing Company, both of which are local favorites.

If you find yourself really wanting to venture out, check out LBM in Lakewood. They're a Viking-themed cocktail bar with a solid menu.

1. Baker Mayfield, even when injured, can win us games. This game showed he is not the issue.
2. The OBJ + Baker thing ain't gonna happen. Dude's been injured for 2 of the 3 seasons he's been with us, and when he's not injured the balls slapping him in the hands or the chest and he isn't making the grab. We need to move on from OBJ
3. Our defensive talent is inconsistent but not horrible. Our secondary can't seem to keep up with receivers half the time (probably defensive playcalling tbh), but our D-line gets consistent pressure and generates a lot of turmoil.
4. Clowney was a good move, when he's healthy it's an amazing 1-2 punch with him and Garret
5. Our run game was surprisingly lack luster yesterday. Not sure if the Steelers just shut it down or if the playcalling was off.
6. I am saddened by our recent performances

I expected a 10-7 to 12-5 record going into this season. Where I stand with this team now, I would say we're looking between 9-8 at best to 7-10 at worst.

28983,207370,207370,killerfencer,"My Browns Origin begins with a manga called Eyeshield 21. It's about a Japanese highschool football team that is literal garbage until they get a really fast running back, Eyeshield. It taught me the basics of the game and started getting me into the idea of football. 

Then in 2007, I bought Madden 07 for the PSP. I played the ever living shit out of it. I remember I'd play the Eagles or Patriots since they were the highest rated team at like 92-97ish and the lowest rated team was, you guessed it, the browns. The amount of times I have crushed the 07 browns with the eagles or pats on PSP is uncountable. I loved that game. 

Then, fast forward to when Peyton Hillis was on the cover of Madden. I was surprised that the former 68 over all team has come far enough to have a player featured on the cover. So I played the living shit out of that Madden as well, and started a franchise as the Cleveland Browns just so I could use Peyton Hillis. 

I decided by 2015/2016 it was time to actually watch a football game  The first browns season I fully watched was the glorious 1-15 season. Then, believe in Hue Jackson's words ""can't get much worse than 1-15"" I was onboard for the following season of 0-16. Oof.

28986,207376,207376,killerfencer,"I need to Vent about how awful this past month has been. I just resigned my position at a hotel. I was originally hired on three months ago to be a part time, two nights a week, night auditor since I have another job 3 times a week and a weekend apprenticeship. I just needed this job to round out a basic 40 hour work week so I can fund myself through my apprenticeship while also being a part time student come fall.

Fast Forward the last month and I've been pushing nearing 40 hours at exclusively the hotel on day shifts with no maintenance, housekeeping, or management on the property. I had to do all those duties on my shifts, while then having to go to my other part time job right after. On Monday and Tuesday I vomited in the parking lot right outside after my shifts in front of several guests due to what I believe was stress and exhaustion. It was the most embarrassed I had ever been. 

I hadn't seen my SO in over two weeks at this point, and she literally lives like 10 minutes away from where I work, I was vomiting from stress, and was physically / mentally drained. I couldn't sleep at night out of pure fear of going to work and having to juggle everything. I could hear the phone ringing if my room at home was completely quiet. It was just. Bad man. 

So I quit with no notice. I feel bad I quit out of nowhere, but having finally gotten more than 3 hours of sleep for the first time in over a month I don't regret it. I'll probably be put on a do not hire list, and even possibly a ban from staying at any of their properties in the future. But at least I can fucking sleep at night and see my SO again.

They made the evaluation on Baker and determined he wasnt good enough to win a superbowl with/deserving of a second contract.

They tried to acquire a significant upgrade at the QB position to allow them to compete for a superbowl. They did not secure one.

Even if they have to move on from baker, and we get a downgrade it doesnt matter. 10-7 season and miss the playoffs or 7-10 miss the playoffs is completely irrelevant.

They saw the AFC and said Chiefs, Chargers, Broncos, Titans, Bills, Ravens, Bengals, Raiders, Patriots, Colts, Dolphins. We can beat some of those teams with Baker but not nearly enough or not nearly consistently. 

Yes we have sucked before. Get over it. Don’t condemn yourself to mediocrity because youre afraid of regression.

The front office is doing their job. They had to break the stagnation and seek progress. The best way to do that is upgrade qb. Either you get an immediate upgrade or you invest in finding one later. And if we just ride it out and lose with a Meh Vet that’s exactly what we are doing.

*The NFL is the victim of its own terrible mistakes in previous highlycharged cases. It wound up with a judge who treated the question of Watson’s penalty as she would a case in court and refused to exercise too much latitude. That is to be expected when you hire a retired federal judge. Good judges try not to wilt or bend with popular outrage —that’s not a system, frankly, any of us would want to live in.

Deshaun’s suspension is the result of the terrible handling of this previous matters.

Let's go back in time: Is 1964 tainted now that the vast majority of people seemingly unaware of Jim Brown's past (which includes a defenestration, mind you)? How about the Lakers post Shaq, and Kobe's rape accusations? We all like to toss out the ""Local Heroes nab sex offender"" posters and yes, it is good that the lot of fans feel a healthy way about how heinous the accusations are.

But don't fool yourself that people will be discussing the result of this suspension beyond this year.

Hell, Dan Snyder, and the Cowboys nonsense aren't even in the news circle, and one of those involves an owner ducking Congress. 

A good number of the folks here are all in on ""well let's just play some football"" as if these things aren't societal issues that are playing out as we speak.

I've said the below in my personal life several times and there is always some man that jumps up (or sometimes silently says) they have done nothing untoward in regards to women:

Regardless of what you think your actions may have been, there are very few cis, straight American men (or for that matter, men globally) who have not caused a woman to feel potentially at risk in some situation. Full stop. And the vast majority have never even realized it. Never even considered it. Yet, the same individuals feel compelled to vote for select (ALLEGED!) sex offenders, and slander other (alleged) sex offenders. How about they all stay in the bucket until things are fully resolved? How about equitable and consistent outrage *and* personal reflection?

What does that have to do with the matter at hand and am I stating I'm OK with the QB sitch... I'm absolutely not. I'm just done with the selective outrage. You could pick the personal lives of ten people in this conversation and I'll bet you uncover someone a lot more like QB1 than one might care to admit.

If anyone really feels compelled to do something about the marginalization and dehumanization of women, particularly when it comes to institutions that historically are bastions of toxic masculinity, then be that voice and keep that energy consistently and support for all instances... and DEMAND a transparent  conduct policy. You're the consumer; you have that power to make those demands.

Conveniently in this case it would solve a lot of problems for both sides, particularly the NFL armed with a defined, expanded suspension and game/pick/salary forfeiture might you know... be able to actually delve out more equitable discipline.

We're not talking about the locker room or personality; we're talking about his performance. Data and observing his play and what the outcomes per possession are. There's nothing subjective about that.

The Browns lost to the Chargers. He didn't take that game.

I'm going to assume you're referring to the Cinci game in 2020 which was not last season. Having ONE game in two seasons in which you come back and win against the last team in the division is not something you build myths on. That same season he lost to Lamar Jackson disguised as Willis Reed when he couldn't capitalize late. Once again, that was not last season.

This year, in the ONLY game Baker played Cinci the Browns won 41-16. He didn't take that game.

Nick Chubb not only scored the go ahead TD but sealed the game with with a monster run TD. Baker tossed two TD's, one a marvelous throw to DPJ but the game was in hand. One could argue Denzel Ward chipped in the winning score but Cinci tied that game. Chubb sealed it.

As I said, show me ANY game in the past season, ""literally"", ""basically"" or whatever preferred defining adverb you wish to assign that Baker Mayfield went out and took from from an opposing team based on his talent as the spearpoint.

Defining abverbs may sound convincing; as though someone has absolute certainty of facts in particular within the political arena but homie don't play that.

The proof of the pudding is in the tasting.

The closest game from the past season that \*might\* apply is the game against the Texans, as he ran for the trying score in that game and threw a go ahead TD, but Malcolm Smith ended that game in the third quarter with a pick deep in Texans territory that led to the deciding FG. He was not on fire in that game although not bad by any measure and sans the pick, the Browns may well have lost.

That's it, in a 17 game season. It was the game he was hurt in and it was the closest he game to securing a victory by will this past season, and he didn't.

But here you go, the data that matches what I saw from my seat. I actually get the feeling you don't care and would rather stir and insult versus objectively evaluate but hey. Whatever makes you feel better.

When analytical fingers started pointing at Ex QB1 the gloves came off and the ""you must be stupid if"" (I noted there are a fair number of those types of posts in your history FYI) flew.

When suggestions were that this dude isn't as liked in the locker room as folks may think were stated, same thing. So do you expect me to believe that even though now we (well, ""you"") have more complete information yet the caping for this guy is still going on, no I don't think those other 52 guys are getting the same kind of support that folks give this cat.

Let me help you:

Baker Mayfield can play the position of football at an NFL level. He has some very desirable traits as a passer. Unfortunately those traits do not include innate feel or fast processing of field movement. Now, it was confirmed that offseason coaching was not part of his regimen, so as hard as he worked to get where he is there was not an apparent  (sufficient) effort to correct his weaknesses until recently. The same stubbornness that fuels him is his most significant weakness. I do not think he has emotionally caught up..yet. He has to fix the on the field first.

He had four ball handlers at OU that are in the league, three of them #1 on their team at their position.

I mean, I'd expect success.

Four years in he has not make a Pro Bowl while both of his college understudies have. He's had his RB1 (which ""you"" the royal you may appreciate, but ""you"" sure as hell don't ride for him like this cat... I wonder why? Hmm..), WR1, and multiple OL make it in spite of front office turmoil, failed coaching, hell, COVID. Dude's a no go.

What was the last comeback win he had? How often do his champions run to that one game against the last team in the division in 2020/21? Give me a big moment that Baker put this team over the top? Baker, not the defense, not Nick Chubb, not Kareem... Baker.

I've SEEN the guy in person from my too hot seats in FES on seven Sundays a year for three years play well (as I said he can play the position), get lucky and outright not see the field on consecutive plays. Hell, sometimes 2/3 on the SAME play. The Browns/Bears are two teams that don't have a litany of great QBs. We won our last championship with a doctor at the controls.

But dude, you got picked #1. you HAVE to be able to a make plays that separate you from the flotsam...

Ex QB1 has actually had THE BEST positional coaching on the team (save for the RB position) since he's been drafted.

He just didn't want to listen to it save for rookie year, and 2020, or when folks were eyeballing if he was the guy.

Baker Mayfield was not the straw that stirred the drink or the bus driver, no matter how much you find him relatable. He's a QB that can play but creates his own pressure and is his own worst enemy.

Nick Chubb stirs the offensive drink and drives the bus; nobody's trying to stop Baker Mayfield. Myles Garrett stirs the defense and drives the bus on D.

32276,216691,216691,metagawd,"That's why I was asking. The public nature happened to not just Baker.

Jared Goff dealt with it. Jimmy G., Both Saints QBs, Sam Darnold multiple times, Matt Ryan, Tua T., the list is long and distinguished.

Let revisit this timeline, and to avoid going back to.. I dunno... 2019 I'll truncate to the last season:

-Both Lamar Jackson and Baker are not extended early. Now, we all know the story: No QB drafted #1 has failed to make it to the second contract in X number of years.

-Baker starts 2021 where 2020 ended, in KC, on the losing end of a winnable game. The following week he suffers a torn labrum  but we win three straight against teams that did not make the playoffs/are drafting mighty low. No one at this time was overtly concerned about his injury. About the same time Teddy Bridgewater made a ""business decision"" that he got a bit of gruff about, one that I actually argued here that Baker should have made. Stopping that interception was not going to turn the tide of that game.

-The Chargers/Browns game is the first benchmark game since the season opener to evaluate Baker versus a QB that is regarded as the next big deal. The Browns had a 15 point lead on Justin Herbert late in the 3rd quarter. We know who won that game and how he won it.

-The following week is the Cardinals. We know what happened that week as well (the fracture). Kareem who is the outlet gets hurt. From the now established timeline no fracture was reported, and there was a determination made that he would play through it. The framing for fans was that he was being permitted to play. While yes, that's true he also elected to play and not wholly just for his teammates. Sans knowing if the 5th year option is a reality, dude is actually playing for his next bag.

-The Steelers loss and OBJ wanting out. While I personally haven't been sold on  Baker's leadership or dedication and folks, stop it: He can actually play, he's just not as dedicated and is probably not as well liked as he thinks. Kinda ""Bro-esque"" to me and who *really* likes dudes like that?

OBJ was one of a handful of players to directly meet with Stefanski prior to the hire. I'm 100% convinced the struggles/complaints he had about getting the ball or offensive awareness were discussed.

MKC's comments during her appearance on Cowherd's podcast about not only the locker room but the FO and ownership liking OBJ confirm for me that what I suspected: John Dorsey's willingness to elevate him as a team leader upon arrival when he had not earned it, knowing that he has had a history of conflict and resistance to criticism set the table for today.

OBJ, convenient scapegoat took the hit locally for that. You don't bounce your QB, so it has to be the receiver. At that point, critically as an observer of the team not just a fan (anything I spend a lot of money on, I'm observing lol) it's evident where the significant locker room (and  on field) issue is. 

The teammates themselves pointed by what they said and more importantly, what they did not say and what individuals they did not defend.

-I'm skipping the lack of interview post Lions game. 

-Week 17. Pittsburgh, or as someone here called it, the Ivy League cut game. It really looked like a game in which KS called the plays that he expected his QB to make the best read on, and Baker responded with 16 for 38, 185, 2 TDs and 2 TOs. Now, then.. he proceeded to sit the following week.

-It's also been repetitively reported that his intent to hold out was determined prior to the Browns speaking with his camp at the combine but post exit interviews, which predates the Browns even scheduling the meeting with Mr. Watson. This is most likely just after the 5th year option pickup.

Now, in the Cowherd podcast, a second source states that Andrew Berry (after the owner and probably the coach) was worn out by QB1 prior to the formal end of the season and his interactions with media, leaks and such in attempting to dictate the narrative of his experience.

Now, if you're angling to hold out when you've not exhibited consistent play, you elect not to invest in your craft in the off-season to maximize your talent, have no problem in intervening in a contract dispute with your teammate (the locker room actually let him know this was not appropriate), leak, freely are combative with the media and overtly question the offensive strategy because it doesn't fit the way you think you should play, who really quit on whom, or better yet, didn't really try?",1.0,browns,t3_tkv0d9,False,0.0,:brownie-elf:,2022-03-23T15:34:02Z,browns,0.0007166603953128

* “When the deposition resumed, \[Brown\] began texting on his cell phone. Regardless of multiple requests from his own counsel, and from the undersigned, \[Brown\] continued texting.”

* According to the allegations in the motion, Brown’s lawyer waited a few minutes and then left the proceedings, then returned and announced that Brown had left and “volunteered, to the effect, that Plaintiff’s counsel could now file its motion for sanctions.”

The offense sputtered, and didn't score much after we put up such a big lead and almost let them back in the game with a ton of unanswered scoring.

Stefanski and AVP are on the same page.  AVP is the OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.  There's no reason why Stefanski should take full blame and AVP takes none.  He is just as responsible.  This isn't a situation like the Todd Monken/Freddie Kitchens era where those 2 had different philosophies and were butting heads.  Stef and AVP agree on how this offense has been put together.  So changing the play caller will change NOTHING with this offense, it will look the same.

1) With the Brian Flores lawsuit, I thought it was more about racism in hiring of Coaches in the NFL, which the Browns don't really fall under. I mean 2 of our longest tenured coaches since coming back are African American. As well as 3 of our last 4 General Managers.

2) It seems odd that the Browns would have paid money to Berry to lose games, let him leave for the Eagles, and then have him come right back as General Manager.

I had a few complaints but that might be me personally.

1) I think there were times Kevin got a little too ahead of himself on fourth down and should have taken some field goals

2) Working Chubb more in the pass game. It seemed there were times when the defenses knew to stack the box because Chubb was in and when D'Ernest would come in they would drop back more. Chubb is no Kamara, but he can make 1-3 catches in a game to keep the defense honest

3) Near the end of the season, I feel he could have done more with motion and bringing in Tight Ends, to help protect Baker more
