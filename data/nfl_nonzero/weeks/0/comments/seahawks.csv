We immediately stopped and went to get him. There he was, laying down face first on the road with his ass still hanging out. He ended up being fine but needed a LOT of stitches.

By [Demaryius Thomas](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/contributors/baybaythomas) | Nov 17, 2015

The bent soda cans were everywhere. That’s when I started to get a bad feeling. Every time I’d go outside to play in the yard, the cans were littered all over the grass.  When I was really young, I used to think, “Why’s everybody drinking so much soda all the time?”

But where we lived, you grow up fast. It didn’t take long for me to put the pieces together. I noticed the chalky white powder, the little holes in the side of the cans. More than anything, I noticed the same familiar faces, and how their eyes looked.

They were using the cans to smoke crack.

There was a little trailer back behind where we lived where people would come and go. My mamma and grandma would go back there. They always told me to stay away from that trailer. I knew what was going on. I knew my grandma was running the operation. But I pretended that I didn’t. I just acted like nothing was happening.

But one night, when I was 11 years old, I had a really bad dream. I told my mamma, “I feel like something terrible is gonna happen.”

I was a mamma’s boy. She had me at 15, so we were close enough in age where we could play basketball against each other. We used to play one-on-one and race in the yard all the time. I’ll spare you the details about the environment we grew up in. You know the story. Drugs were just around. Dirt roads. Not much money to go around. My mom was doing what she thought she had to do to survive.

But I had this feeling.

“Mamma, something bad’s gonna happen.”

She told me everything would be OK.

A few months later … BOOM.

The loudest sound I ever heard. I was sleeping by the door when the men busted in. It was seven in the morning, right before school. The first thing I saw were the guns pointing at me. Big guns. Like in a movie. I didn’t know they were police. I just saw guns and red dots flashing. They told me to get down.

I laid on the floor and they went into my mom and stepdad’s room. They brought them out in handcuffs.

As they were walking my mamma to the police car, she said, “Can I please just take my kids to the school bus one last time?”

That’s when I knew. Hearing that, even at 11 years old, I realized that I wasn’t going to see my mom for a long, long time. It was real. She begged the police officers, and they agreed to let her walk us to the bus stop. When the bus pulled up, all the kids saw the police cars surrounding us. My mom kissed us on the cheek and waved goodbye.

The first thing the kids said when I got on the bus was, “Awwwww, ya’ll did something bad!” They started picking on me right away. You know how kids are. I looked out the window at my mom getting put into the police car.

I sat on that bus and told myself: Keep it inside. Don’t let them see it.

My father was in the military. My mother and stepfather and grandmother were locked up. From that day on, I was basically an orphan. I came home from school that day and I thought, Where do I go now? I was 11, so I couldn’t really work, but I still had to figure out a way to take care of my sisters. I told myself I was going to get a scholarship so I could get a degree and take care of my family. In the meantime, I had to do whatever I could. We were in rural Georgia. The good thing about rural Georgia is that you can always make some change working with your hands. 

So I started pulling corn and pickin’ peas and butterbeans. Seriously, that was my job. I used to wake up at six in the morning and get to pullin’ before school. That’s hard work. Where I grew up, stupid situations were very easy to get into. I had a choice: the drug game, or the corn game. I kept thinking: just don’t screw up a chance to get to college. That was my light that I focused on.

My mom was eventually sent to prison in Tallahassee, Florida. I didn’t even get to visit her for years. The stability that I was used to was gone. I know that sounds crazy with the drugs all around me, but it was still a certain kind of stability. With my mom gone, my world was so empty. I stayed with whoever didn’t get mad at me that week. Aunties, my dad’s mother, whoever. I didn’t have much. If the house was burning down, I wouldn’t even have anything to grab. For real. Maybe a pair of shoes. That’s about it. I had three pairs of jeans I’d switch out.

It was lonely. I had no idea what I would do with my life. Or where I would be in a few years. At a certain point, I used to cry every night.

In fact, I’m gonna tell you this, just for all the kids out there reading this who are in a similar situation, who are holding it all inside. Even when I made it to the NFL, I’d cry some nights thinking about my mother, wondering if she would ever get out.

No amount of money, no amount of fame, no amount of anything in the world can replace your mother. I realized that holding it all in wasn’t good for me, and I reached out to a preacher who really helped me talk through it all. People think orphans are kids whose parents have died, but 80 percent of orphans in the world have at least one parent who is alive somewhere. There are millions of kids just like me all across the U.S., and hundreds of millions all over the world.

We rely on the kindness and the couches of others to get us through the day. I had multiple high school coaches who looked out for me. Multiple college coaches. Deacons. Pastors. Aunties. Uncles. Friends. If even one of those people had let me slip, would you even know my name? Maybe not.

I talk to a lot of kids who have parents in prison, or who left them when they were young for one reason or another. I know the anger. The pain. The fear. Especially the loneliness. They just want somebody to say, “I care about you.” But that doesn’t happen enough, so they get into trouble.

As men, as athletes especially, we don’t like to talk about love. We talk about brotherhood and all that, but not love. But it’s the most important thing in a child’s life. More important than the kind of school you go to, or what neighborhood you live in, or even if you grow up around drugs and violence. If you are loved, you’ll make it out.",90.0,nfl,t3_skqtw3,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-02-04T23:36:42Z,seahawks,0.0054113544104952

that's not what anyone said? the best player is in a stronger position to demand the max, so it's more significant if he doesn't.

It also helps to establish a team culture which prioritises winning over maximizing individual payouts, and helps to retain and attract free agents who - even if marginally - prefer winning to absolute-max market value on their contracts.

4135,35325,35325,Caulibflower,"Nah, I don't think you can separate the two; landing a painful hit and refusing to give up an inch are both hard-wired into defensive players since Pop Warner. And literally every inch can be significant in football. So long as Carson's momentum was carrying him forward, *any* defensive player's mindset is going to be 'I need to put him into the turf ASAP - and if I can, I'm going to make it hurt.' Like, if you're saying you don't like the 'cultural' aspect of the latter... not trying to be antagonistic by asking, but are you sure you like football? A major, major aspect of the game is draining the will of your opponent by causing pain. It's *absolutely* a psychological thing, and again - is absolutely a psychological thing that's hard-wired into defensive players from the earliest stages of play and coaching. I guarantee you *Carson Wentz* knows that as well as anyone.

You can't expect defensive players to hold back *in a playoff game* if they're *not sure* a hit is going to definitively limit a gain. That's nearly as ridiculous as the other poster below claiming that a player *diving forward* is the same as *giving yourself up* \- as though a QB who's diving forward for additional yards should simply be allowed to do so! There's a reason that QBs are protected when they're sliding but not when they're diving (and that the ball is spotted from the beginning of the slide and not the end - everyone knows that the inches *matter).* 

You've been reasonable in your replies even if I don't entirely agree with the sentiment, but there's a real undercurrent of QB protectionism around this particular play which is really hard to square with the fundamentals of the game. When the QB is running with the ball and trying to gain yards - as Carson Wentz very much was - then he's just a football player playing football. Defensive players are going to try their best to knock the shit out of him, and that's what happened. It's unfortunate he got hurt, but that's how the game is meant to be played.",1.0,nfl,t3_vfxc45,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-06-21T03:55:57Z,seahawks,0.0027387243490494
4136,35326,35326,Caulibflower,"yeah, I don't feel like this actually contradicts anything I said (not sure if it was meant to, but the up/downvote split suggests that people read it that way). I'm not trying to argue that there 'wasn't anything dangerous' about the play, but players suffer catastrophic injuries on routine plays all the time - it's a violent, dangerous game (I know this ought to go without saying).

Basically, I think the *only reason* that people even remember this hit is that Carson got hurt on the play. If Carson popped back up and ran right back to the huddle, everyone just goes: ""YEAH! THAT'S PLAYOFF FOOTBALL, BABY!"" and it doesn't become a core memory for Eagles fans. But it really doesn't take much to cause a concussion. Just think back to Donald Parham's scary one last year - looked like a normal play, didn't even contact another player, just landed weird. We can't even know if Wentz was concussed by Clowney's helmet or when he kind of bounced off the ground.

It's actually a case where I think [the refs' subsequent explanation is truly straightforward](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/seattle-seahawks/nfl-referee-explains-why-jadeveon-clowney-wasnt-flagged-hit-carson-wentz):

""He (Wentz) was a runner and he did not give himself up,"" Smith said via pool reporter Zach Berman. ""We saw incidental contact, and in ourjudgment, we didn't rule that to be a foul.""

Crucially, Wentz *didn't give himself up*, and the refs ruled the helmet to helmet contact incidental (which is at least plausible - and as you note, *we can't know what Clowney was thinking -* the video is pretty ambiguous). Whether that's truly the case is hard to know, but again, that's almost the point (and, I think, similar to the other point you're making); defensive players aren't trying to tackle anyone *gently,* and Wentz was still a live runner. It's unfortunate that he got injured and I totally understand the frustration from Philadelphia (or anyone else who wanted the Seahawks to lose).",1.0,nfl,t3_vfxc45,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-06-20T04:46:36Z,seahawks,-0.0601130659842938
4137,35327,35327,Caulibflower,"yeah, I mean - our flairs aren't helping our case here, but Wentz was an active ball-carrier trying to gain yards. Even if he's \*nearly down\*, it's literally every defensive player's job to \*minimize\* the yardage he gains. So is it, like, everyone thinking that Clowney should've let him keep going? Or ""hit him differently?"" - at full speed and with limited options? It always looked to me like Clowney was trying to put his shoulder into Wentz' upper back and drive him into the ground so that he couldn't extend for more yardage. Until Wentz is actually \*down,\* he can reach the ball out for another yard. Clowney tags him in the back to put him down faster and close that opportunity. That's exactly what he's supposed to do there.",-10.0,nfl,t3_vfxc45,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-06-19T13:48:25Z,seahawks,0.0052728232721321

sometimes, but it's different when you're a 185 lb WR who's already secured a first down, as opposed to a 230 lb running back whose *job* is to make gains towards the marker. It's great that Penny can rip off big runs, but if we're going to rely on him as a starting RB, he's got to see tough, physical, *short* runs as part of his job description. 

> I honestly cant blame a guy whom has had his career derailed by injury to smash into guys like Henry does. Not to mention there isnt a point when we are out of contention to not ease up and lpwer your injury chances. Doubly so when you are in a contract year

And anybody can do whatever they want with their body - that goes without saying. But given we're looking at whether Penny deserves another contract with us, and/or for how much, we've got to look at what he's actually showing. We can't just assume that he's going to 'run more physical' once he's been paid, or when the games matter more. There's no way of knowing that without showing it, and that's why hundreds of players around the NFL are still playing their asses off even though their teams are out of contention. It's because they're trying to earn that next contract - coaches and GMs want to see that intensity at all times. Hell, look at what little Braxton Berrios has been doing for the hapless Jets these last few weeks. Dude is tiny, maybe even smaller than Lockett, and throwing his body all over the place. He's not leaving anything on the field. 

I'm not saying Penny's not earned himself some money over the past month, and I'm not even saying he owes to to anyone to run with better leverage and physicality at the line of scrimmage. *I* wouldn't be running straight into NFL defenders. But if you're talking about a 230-lb back who's trying to make the case to be treated as somebody's starter - that lack of a killer instinct around the line of scrimmage does count as a bit of a red flag, and a reason to pause before paying Penny like he's going to be the guy to make your offense work from week to week.",2.0,seahawks,t3_ryeqgd,False,0.0,​,2022-01-08T16:42:11Z,seahawks,-0.0531476054531232

yeah, this is it - and why if we bring him back, I don't want to count on him as more than a 1B in a timeshare. I still don't trust him - at all - to get tough yards. When he breaks to space, he can rip off big gains, but even in just this last game he had some pretty terrible runs. One run in particular, something like his third run of the game, he took a sweep towards the LT and when he saw three Lions there, he literally just flopped to the ground without anyone touching him. You *cannot do that* as an NFL running back. He also consistently doesn't stay square into contact/trash in the middle; he turns his body sideways and just kind of falls down. 

It's great to see him string some good games together and he's definitely shown he's worth bringing back - but there are some pretty obvious flaws to his game, and I still lack much confidence that he can be an every-down back capable of carrying our offense against fast, tough, physical defenses.

> hyper-analyzing one of the two sacks

There's a pattern here. On the one hand, you're very right that this is a product of the style of play which Russ has relied on over the course of his career. However, drive-killing sacks are also something he's been *criticised* for over the course of his career - it's one of the aspects of his game which has always been a fairly obvious area for improvement. On the whole, we've largely accepted it because his tendency to wait til the last possible moment has resulted in some ridiculous plays. But that means throughout his career, the line between 'brilliance' and 'error' has been very thin.  

The real issue lately is the bad plays are starting to overtake the good ones. Maybe/probably his finger is still affecting his deep throws, and that's part of the issue. But his athleticism is also declining as he enters his mid-30s, and if he wants to remain a viable starter long-term, he'll need to adapt his style of play. I think that's the real criticsm here. It's not about labeling him 'elite' or whatever else - it's just the reality that Russ is an ageing scrambler who's going to have to play smarter if he wants to extend his career.

We also *know* that Pete Carroll won't let his OC's do their job independently.

Not in the sense of trying to make it ineffective on purpose, but by over-prioritising a running clock and shortening games, over-committing to certain aspects of the run game, etc., created a situation where Schotty - again, I think pretty clearly - didn't feel like he was able to do his job (running the most effective version of Seattle's offense). 

That's what I've always found really interesting about the 'philosophical differences' part of the team's explanation for his departure - it's an unusual justification. It just about suggests that Pete Carroll would have been happy enough to keep him around, but Schotty basically wasn't willing to toe the line and call a 'Pete Carroll offense.'

Rewards the true masters of clean releases as well as receivers who play with physicality. Also provides a needed +1 to pass defenders by removing ticky-tacky calls from the game entirely.

to my eye, Jones recognised the route and turned to run the path the Thomas needed to run. The result of that is that Logan Thomas tried to keep pushing upfield, but Jones was in the way - so Thomas pressed forward with his chest on Jones' shoulder and his arms in the air, and successfully appealed for the PI. 

But isn't Sidney Jones allowed to hold his ground and maintain his route? Doesn't he have a right to that space, even if he isn't necessarily looking back for the ball? 

This one is a little bit weird to me, because he didn't grab jersey, pull an arm, or the usual stuff you see with PI calls - he was just running where Logan Thomas wanted to be, and so Thomas ran into him. If there was a lean into Thomas, it was pretty subtle - but the reverse angle really made it look like Jones was just holding a line to the sideline in a way that obstructed Thomas' path without necessarily being the one to 'initiate' contact, besides knowing Thomas wanted to run his route through the same spot on the field. 

The basis for the call seems like it must be something along the lines of 'defender cannot impede the route of the receiver' - but is that right? I didn't think defenders had to just allow receivers to run routes literally wherever they wanted (like - to the extent that you'd say the defender had to 'stay out of the receiver's way' in order to avoid a fall call). Or is the crux here that Jones wasn't looking back for the ball? I'm not sure why that would be the key if he *was* allowed his own space/route. 

Or is it something along the lines of 'defender can't impede the path of the receiver while the ball is in the air, unless he is actively playing the ball'? is it a ball-in-the-air thing?

wrong again - that's not what's happening. The question is more along the lines of ""as his athleticism declines and Russ is *forced* to rely more on his ability to diagnose defenses (as opposed to running around until someone pops open), is he going to become a less-effective QB?"" There's not an obvious answer to that right now, but it's not a ridiculous question based on the way he's played - not just yesterday, but at several points over the last couple of years. 

> Somehow you've taken a quote from Lockett's interview, where he's pretty clearly discussing struggles at all levels on the offense (including himself,) and then just magically turned it into a piece of evidence for your ""theory."" It's a joke.

This isn't the dismissal you think it is. QBs are usually expected to be the mental leaders of the offense - the player who gets his teammates into position, understands what the defense is going to show, and leads the attack. When Lockett effectively says 'the offense is confused,' that obviously includes Russ - which is what we're talking about. Obviously it would be *worse* if Lockett was saying something to the effect of, 'I'm where I'm supposed to be, based on the coverage, but Russ isn't seeing me.' But the fact that it's a team issue doesn't actually protect Russ from the question of whether or not he's struggling to diagnose defenses. Likewise, maybe some of that blame ought to be assigned to the coaching staff and whether they're putting their players in the best position to succeed, or whether they're effectively teaching their players how to recognise and adapt to what they're seeing. But that still doesn't prevent us from wondering whether Russ is confused - it would give some reasons why it might be a fixable problem, which would be good, and would be reason for optimism. 

But either way, people have legitimate reasons to wonder whether Russ is confused by what he's seeing, and what that means for the offense. If it *is* true, it doesn't necessarily mean it's all on him, doesn't mean it's not fixable, etc. This also isn't just because of one thing Jonathan Vilma said, and it's a bit unfortunate for this thread that we've got people acting like Jonathan Vilma is the source for this idea. Fieldgulls, for example, has criticised Russ' decision-making for years. Not constantly or anything, but it's certainly an issue that they've returned to periodically, and usually framed within a question of, ""Does Russ sometimes struggle to read defenses, or is he just so athletic and creative that he sometimes presses too hard for the big play?"" This question has been around for awhile, and as Russ ages it's going to be a question that will in many ways define his legacy - he hasn't answered it yet, so you're probably going to keep seeing it.",1.0,seahawks,t3_qzg8dh,False,0.0,​,2021-11-22T13:31:08Z,seahawks,0.0020413842151144

And to pick a screen pass, which I don't think SEA has ever actually run successfully, as the play that somehow proves a 10 year vet apparently can no longer understand what he's seeing in front of him?

See my post below. Deep shots and check downs can both, in their way, depending on the context, indicate struggles to read the defense. Russ has done both - he's been criticised for taking deep chances when he should be recognising checkdowns, and he's resorted to checkdowns when it seems like there are better chances downfield. That's why we're talking about it. The fact that we've seen both tendenceis from him suggests - potentially - a more general discomfort with his defensive reads. Checkdowns do not = ability to read defenses. Throwing deep does not = ability to read defenses. What people are talking about is whether what we saw on Sunday is indicative of Russ having some issues deciphering what he's seeing. Do we know for sure? No. But why are you getting mad that people are wondering aloud about it?

> The fact is that there's years of history, and comments from the coach, reinforcing what Lockett has said in regards to this team (offense and defense) being incredibly static and refusing to adapt to what its opponent is doing. This is the same coach that was 100% okay with running into a brick wall for 3.5 quarters in a playoff game.

What Lockett literally said in the linked piece was:

> it's hard to be able to get ready because you don't know what you're gonna get... you got to be able to figure things out faster.

The implication of this is that they *weren't prepared for what AZ showed them defensively,* and furthermore, that they were *confused.* i.e., they didn't know how to deal with the defensive looks they were given and were trying to figure it out on the fly, to little avail. The timing of Vilma's comment wasn't ideal, because he misidentified a called pass while making a general point. Vilma's error there doesn't invalidate that general point.

4204,35645,35645,Caulibflower,"OP here is correct that the play in question (the 3rd down call to DeeJay Dallas that Vilma incorrectly described as a checkdown) was a called screen, but the overarching question is (and has been) whether Russ is, or is able to, consistently make the correct reads over the course of the whole game. 

If he's attempting nearly-impossible throws downfield when he's got an open receiver near the marker - then that's the wrong read. Similarly, if he's got opportunities for downfield throws but he's checking down instead, then - again - that's the wrong read. 

What we were seeing yesterday looked like tentativity with downfield throws, which is unsual and so warrants comment. Vilma - because he's not a great commentator - made this point on a called screen, which was bad timing for an accurate overall point about the way Russ was playing. I think a lot of the time a commentator has a point that they want to make and so wait for a play that they think illustrates it. Vilma's not great in the booth, so the play he used as an illustration was the wrong one. He could have made a similar point instead, which is that our offense was calling a lot of short passes - screens, speed-outs, and quick-hitches - in part because no reads are required for those. They're quick plays where Russ basically takes the snap and immediately throws. So you have color commentary saying that it looks like Russ isn't comfortable throwing downfield, combined with a lot of short called passes and checkdowns, combined with even Tyler Lockett saying in his post-game interview that the defensive looks were confusing the offense and affecting their gameplan. 

So, yeah. Fans can be fickle and I'm sure we're seeing some of that in the sub today.

4205,35646,35646,Caulibflower,"Yeah, I agree that Russ's head doesn't seem quite right, and maybe hasn't for awhile. I think back to last year and the 'Let Russ Cook' period. There was that AZ meltdown game where it *really* didn't seem like he understood what he was seeing and threw a couple of horrible picks. Similar vibes with the picks he threw last week - I just don't think he sees the field that well. I'm reluctant to attribute that to his height, but I suppose it's possible? But there's a part of me that also just thinks - similarly to what you're saying - that because he was (/needed to be) so reliant on his legs to make plays during his early career, he maybe never really became comfortable playing with the diagnostic side of his brain and relying on his reads to make plays. It was always playground football and deep shots. But then again, that was pretty much his college game, too, and when it comes down to it I'm totally happy to have gotten a decade of that as our QB - there's no question that even if he's never *more* than that, he's our best QB of all time. 

Maybe it's habits, maybe it's a psychological hurdle that Russ can clear with a different team or a different system. Whatever it is, I think the pressure of being the only thing on our offense which has worked consistently - for years - has hurt his play in the end. But yeah. There's a part of me that thinks if you inserted Russ into a different and ostensibly 'better' (or at least more-balanced) offense, it might not look that much different than what we're currently seeing in front of us. Like, imagine how Russ would look playing on that Chicago offense if that trade had happened in the offseason. It's hard to imagine he'd be playing any better. He's got a couple of truly elite weapons here in Seattle and our offense has still been terrible. 

I dunno. It really feels like we're coming to the end of the road for the Pete & Russ partnership, and I have enough faith in Russ that I hope he at least stays in Seattle. Having watched him for over a decade, though, I'm not very optimistic that we'll see a Drew Brees-like late-career surge. I don't think he has the intermediate accuracy or anticipation.

4227,35709,35709,Caulibflower,"I don't think that's why Adams gets criticised. Obviously a player who can play multiple positions is extremely valuable - but their ability to play multiple positions doesn't make them the best of either of those positions and Adams is frequently described as one of the league's *best safeties*. 

Adams gets a lot of hype and respect because of his ability to play both linebacker and safety, though there is some debate about how good he is at those respective roles. Some people think he's the best safety in the NFL seemingly *on the basis* that he can also give you things that you normally expect of a linebacker or edge rusher. I don't think anyone is arguing that Adam's isn't valuable *because of that*, but some of those critiques emerge when people argue that Adams ought to be considered the best safety in the NFL ... *because he can rush the passer*. Since pass-rushing isn't part of a safety's normal duties, 'linebacker playing safety' might be used by people who think Jamal Adams is actually better at things that are normally done by a linebacker. By calling him a 'linebacker that plays safety,' people are inevitably taking a dig at Adams' coverage abilities, which were inconsistent at best last year. 

Kam Chancellor effectively *was* a linebacker playing safety; it wasn't about positional versatility or schematic gimmicks so much as Kam literally played as a linebacker in our defense while also possessing the ability to carry tight ends up the field or rotate up to the single-high when Earl pressed the LOS. Kam would set the edge against running plays in a way that Jamal Adams simply does not and has not ever done. 

The other thing is their respective reputations when coming into the league. Jamal Adams was seen as a blue chip prospect, while Kam was a late-round tweener who wouldn't have been missed if he'd failed to stick on a roster. Kam's ascension meant that his original deisgnation as a 'tweener' - intially used as a pejorative - gave way to 'linebacker that plays safety.' It's a transition from 'we don't actually know where to play this guy,' to 'this guy can play multiple positions for us.' 

Whereas Jamal Adams came into the league as someone who was supposed to be an impact safety - which is a position whose first responsibility is usually coverage - who has made his biggest impacts attacking the line of scrimmage. He has had *more* success than expected when rushing the passer, and *less* success than expected when in coverage. 

I don't really mean all of this as a dig on Adams, though - just reflecting on why it feels more complimentary to Kam while more derogatory to Adams. Has a lot to do with what their initial expectations were. For people who are calling Adams a linebacker as a pejorative, presumably they have a different idea of what a safety ought to be doing and think there are others who are better than Adams (and so more worthy of top honors/recognition). I'm personally pretty happy to think of Adams as one of the league's most versatile linebackers, and appreciate him as such. But I think the position of 'safety' is also changing lately, especially with players like Deone Bucannon, Jamal, Isaiah Simmons, etc. It's becoming a position where teams like to have hybrid players, but we don't really have a good word to separate those guys from the more traditional safeties. Calling them 'strong safeties' doesn't really seem to create enough of a distinction. We need a word like 'rover' to capture what they do, but I suspect the league as a whole would resist an additional positional designation.",3.0,seahawks,t3_p9q3by,False,0.0,​,2021-08-23T07:32:09Z,seahawks,-0.0097918787153155

They had different styles.

Shaun had great vision, acceleration, quickness, decisiveness - the things you need to identify and maximise the opportunities created by the blocking in front of him. 

It's not taking anything away from Shaun to say that Marshawn carried more of the offensive burden on the teams he played for - and that's what people are thinking of when they say they preferred Marshawn, and would have liked to see him running behind Shaun's offensive lines. It's people remembing the 2000s Seattle OL as the driving force behind their offensive success, and Marshawn Lynch as the driving offensive force behind the ascendant 2010s Seahawks.

well, not quite (which is why I made the comment). I specifically argued that the difference was *not negligible* between Kumerow and another player. i.e., the issue is not that Rodgers had an *arbitrary* preference for Kumerow that the FO should have respected 'because Rodgers is a HOF QB,' but that by failing to appreciate the chemistry, development, and relationship Rodgers has invested in Kumerow, they've failed to understand how their own team works. OP had given the impression that they thought it didn't matter, so the FO should have just respected Aaron's wishes - but I think there's a stronger argument to be made.  

> the difference between Kumerow and another low-end receiver is minimal to the front office, and probably minimal to the coaching staff. 

And Rodger's point is that it *shouldn't* be minimal, because that disregards his relationship, investment, and chemistry with a developing player.

I mean, *probably* - but it's also not like on a HS football team where if you're a JV player you really know you're not going to play. Just about anyone on an NFL roster is there because they can play; the margins are razor thin. But I think that's just us re-converging on your second point, because yeah - I think it's probably somewhere between ""the guy you replaced Kumerow with isn't any more talented, and I really liked Kumerow"" and ""I'd just gotten Kumerow up to the level where I think he should be getting into the game, and now you're making me start over again with another receiver... after I asked you not to""

either way, it's pretty easy for me to understand his frustration, even if it's not stuff that's going to end up seemingly statistically significant.

4250,35868,35868,Caulibflower,"> I'm sure ... the difference between them and Kumerow would've been negligible.

I'm not sure this is true. It's easy to think about NFL rosters through the Madden Lens, which makes a 67 over player interchangeable with any other. But if ARog is investing time and energy into *developing those players*, I think he has a right to feel like the rug is being pulled out from under him if they're cut against his wishes. 

If ARog is going, 'I think Kumerow is coming along really well - we're really on the same page, he gets the concepts, he's where I want him to be at the time I want him there' - I can pretty easily see the frustration when or if the FO decies to cut the guy and simply bring in another. 

If 'the difference is negligible' - why do it? But I also suspect the difference is *not* negligible, especially from ARog's perspective, both in terms of time invested, relationship developed, and his comfort with his receivers. Guys come up from the practice squad and lower fringe of the roster all the time. It's not always about whos' going to put up fantasy-relevant stats; in a case like this it's really just about who your QB likes throwing to. It's the front office getting rid of a player who cost them virtually nothing when their QB was saying, ""Hey - I actually really like what this guy brings to our WR group."" 

I think you can understand that from a football perspective, as well as ARog maybe even taking a stand on the behalf of some of the lower-roster guys who he thinks aren't being treated very well. I mean, that last suggestion is admittedly more speculative than the rest, but it wouldn't be crazy to read that into his other statements about 'how it's about the people in the organization' (I can't remember the exact quote). I think I'd be pretty frustrated too if I was developing relationships and chemistry with bubble players who I thought had potential, and my GM wiped that out just for the sake of keeping the edge of the roster turning over. Some FO's do seem to operate on that kind of philosophy, and it may be that ARog thinks he has enough clout (he does) to make sure the Packers don't (or perhaps, at least, when it comes to guys he's specifically said he'd like to keep around).",130.0,nfl,t3_nvwcu9,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2021-06-09T12:22:30Z,seahawks,0.0417622217704828
4251,35881,35881,Caulibflower,"I'm no Tebow-maniac or anything, but just comparing their 40s is selling Tebow's athleticism pretty short. 

Tebow had [one of the bigger spider charts you'll see for a QB](https://www.mockdraftable.com/player/tim-tebow), including elite marks in vert, 3-cone, and his 10-yard split. You're talking about a guy with a very physical playing style who's checking in at 6'3"" and nearly 240, who's in the 96th percentile of the *entire NFL* for the 3-cone drill, who's got a 40-inch vert and accelerates through ten yards like an elite running back (same 10-yard split as Alvin Kamara). 

So just calling Tebow 'a fullback' is either a little disingenuous, or you just don't realize that - except for a pretty average 40 - he pretty much blew up his combine. Didn't have the long speed of some of these other QBs we've seen, but physical runners with elite short-area explosion can definitely be really dangerous in the NFL. 

Even if we were going to limit the comparison to guys who actually play fullback in the NFL (LeG Blount and Arian Foster were both all-around less-athletic/explosive testers than Tebow, but are exceptions to the general requirements of their position), you're looking at Tebow as a significantly more-explosive comp to Kyle Juszczyk, or really similarly to someone like Jonnu Smith (aside from being 0.1 slower in the 40, which isn't a massive difference at that position). And Juszczyk and Smith are both considered among the most-athletic players in those H-back type roles (and in some respects, among the whole league). 

But even just comparing Tebow to Hill - yes, Hill is going to win a straight-line race by a gap. But Tebow also had *significantly* better short-area times than Hill - a 1.55 10-yard split to Hill's 1.61; a 4.17 ss to Hill's 4.37; and a 6.66 3-cone drill to Hill's 7.03. 

All this is really just to say that I still sometimes think about whether Tebow could've been one the league's better FB/H-back/TE hybrids if he'd just let himself be coached into that role from the get-go. Like if there'd been a team who'd have been willing to basically use him the way Florida did during his freshman year, as a short-yardage specialist and utility player. He was also definitely effective as a runner for Denver, and I sort of feel like people forget that due to his ineffectiveness as a passer. So even besides the measurements, I think there's actually pretty solid proof already on tape that he could be (and in fact *was*) a pretty effective runner at the NFL level.

Maybe there actually *was* a team, or even multiple teams, who would've tried to use him like Florida used him as a freshman, but the irony is that by picking him the first round, Denver kept him from reaching those other teams who would have used him better.

TEs need to be able to do a lot of different things, and Thaddeus Moss is able to do some of those things very well.

4280,35971,35971,Caulibflower,"Most people are just naming QBs who've had some form of success but people don't actually think are very good. 

If we're talking *overrated,* we're talking about perception passing reality. Saying Joe Namath or Trent Dilfer or Joe Flacco were carried by their teams is not really that controversial (and fwiw, Joe Namath did some ground-breaking things as a passer, which has as much to do with his induction as The Guarantee). 

So I'll go with Peyton Manning. 

Yup. Get ready to hate this post, but I'll try to back it up. 

Peyton gets thrown around a lot in the best-ever conversations - but part of that, I think, has to do with the explosion of fantasy football and a massive uptick in the NFL passing game. But here's the thing - *Peyton Manning was a system quarterback.* And what that means, is if you could disrupt the system, you could disrupt Peyton Manning. 

The truly greatest quarterbacks in NFL history are what you would call 'transcendent talents.' *What* are they 'transcending,' exactly? They transcend their teammates, their offense, their opponent - they're just *better.*

However, this isn't what we saw with Peyton over the course of his career. The thing with Peyton and the way he played, was that he had a *tremendously* high floor. In fairness to Peyton, he'd probably has a HOF case on this basis alone - he may have the highest *floor* in NFL history. But his ceiling was also, I think, substantially lower than some of his contemporaries. Peyton was renowned for knowing where to go with the ball before the snap. And this isn't nearly as simply as being in a 1-read offense, although it's similar - it's Peyton knowing what that 1-read should be, 90% of the time. 

But the problems came when the read wasn't there, or his man couldn't get open, or the pass rush got home, or what have you. And again, of course, *this is true of all quarterbacks*. But because Peyton relied *so much* on his pre-snap abilities, I think this actually meant that the ceiling of his play is lower than you'd expect of someone with 5 MVPs. 

To say someone is an MVP is to mean that there's no one better in the league at sealing a win. If it means anything, it's got to mean that. But I think a lot of Peyton's lore really is more to do with his unprecedented accumulation of counting stats, rather than his ability to put away the NFL's best defenses. 

Now, this post is long enough already, but I want to back this up with at least a little bit of evidence. What I'm going to do is look at some of the top QBs of the last 20 years, and compare their career playoff QB rating with their career regular-season QB rating. This goes back to what I said earlier about transcendence - the 'transcendent' QBs are going to stay at their best regardless of circumstances, but lesser QBs will see a drop. So (Career Regular Season= CRS, Career Playoffs = CP):

Tom Brady - CRS: 97.3, CP: 90.4

Aaron Rodgers - CRS: 103.9, CP: 100.5

Ben Roethlisberger - CRS: 94.0, CP: 86.4

Russell Wilson - CRS: 101.7, CP: 95.3

Drew Brees - CRS: 98.7, CP: 97.1

Philip Rivers - CRS: 95.2, CP: 85.3

Eli Manning - CRS: 84.1, CP: 87.4

Peyton Manning - CRS: 96.5, CP: 87.4

Now, I know perfectly well that these numbers don't conclusively prove anything, but they're not *meaningless,* either - and they do correspond to my hypothesis even if they don't undeniably confirm it. At the end of the day, I *do* think Peyton Manning was a great quarterback - but I also think that his MVP count overstates his value as a player.",3.0,nfl,t3_majceu,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2021-03-22T07:42:55Z,seahawks,0.0245277071552097
4281,35979,35979,Caulibflower,"With defensive tackle, we actually felt like we were in a pretty good spot going into the draft. Suh and Ford are a solid 1-2 at the starting positions, and are both under contract for multiple years. Yes, Suh will be entering his age-34 season, but he's also aged really well and that's not unusual for high-level defensive tackles. He was still an impact player for the Bucs last year, and in my opinion, projecting an abrupt decline simply due to age isn't necessarily any more probable than losing a player to injury, which can happen at any time. 

Aside from our presumed starting-2, we also have a couple of promising young players in Bryan Mone and Cedrick Lattimore. Mone played in 20% of our defensive snaps last year and is very capable of filling the primary backup role at nose tackle, and Cedrick Lattimore spent most of last season on the practice squad but had a *very* splashy debut in the Wild Card loss. So we're intrigued enough with Lattimore that we dont necessarily feel pressured to add another developmental pick. 

Then there's LJ Collier and Rasheem Green, who can both rush from the 3-tech spot. LJ Collier in particular would, I think, benefit from simply being moved inside. I have liked him a lot better as a defensive tackle than as a defensive end, and I actually think he's got some real long-term potential as a 3-tech. So in this exercise, I've considered him part of defensive tackle group. That's 5 core players, with a comfortable floor as well as some intriguing upside. (I can't remember right off the top of my head, but at various points last year I think we were going into games with only 3 or 4 'true' defensive tackles.) We've also historically had a lot of success signing street/late-process FA to play DT for us, if the need arises. But it's not a position we seem to want to throw a lot of bodies at - we've been much more likely to acquire defensive ends who can also play inside. Janarius Robinson probably also fits this category, as he looks like he can easily carry 280 lbs or more if he wants to. 

There were definitely some defensive tackles we had high on our board and could have easily taken if things had fallen in other ways - Alim McNeill, in particular, is someone we were very keen to get in alternative scenarios. But ultimately we felt like we already had enough DT-talent in the building to go in other directions over the course of the draft, as other talent remained available that we either considered higher-priority or too good to pass up.",3.0,seahawks,t3_lzzx6w,False,0.0,​,2021-03-08T07:47:14Z,seahawks,0.051936716783227

4284,35982,35982,Caulibflower,"So, I think most of my reasoning has been explained elsewhere in the post, but I appreciate the effort here and so will just reiterate with a couple of condensed responses. 

> 1) Pick 2.56 - Javonte Williams: There wasn't a stud OG/C/OT available who was worth drafting there. But why didn't you a) trade back to the end of the 2nd and get an additional 4th round pick and draft a CB there or b) draft an CB right there at 2.56?

> Eric Stokes went at 2.60 / Paulson Adebo at 3.70 / Kelvin Joseph at 3.104 (that won't happen BTW, he'll be gone waaaaay earlier) - What was your knock on them? I really like all of them.

Like /u/Doctorvrackyl says below, we can only make the trades we're offered. But to be honest, we probably would have taken Williams even if we were offered that trade, because I think he has the potential to be a top-5 back in the league and don't think there was another player on the board who offered that kind of impact, at any position. From there it's just back to whether you think any back should be picked in the first three rounds - while I do think the running back position offers some of the best value of any position the later you get in the draft, I also think Javonte Williams is a special player and has no business lasting until the end of the second round. 

> 2) 3.71- Quinn Meinerz: What makes Meinerz better than Trey Smith/Ben Cleveland. I don't like Meinerz at all. His Senior Bowl performance was, in my opinion, not really impressive. He was really good at recovering, but he constantly lost at the LOS, especially if the DT/DE was fast than him or had more than one move.

Not really sure which Senior Bowl you watched, then. Not going to argue with you if you're that far apart on his evaluation, but the short version is that he impressed me with what I was able to see, and the guys who cover the Senior Bowl in detail every year, guys like Daniel Jeremiah and Jim Nagy, were emphatic about his ability. It's not about disliking anyone else (I do really like Ben Cleveland, especially), but about having Quinn Meinerz as one of our top centers in the draft. 

> 3) 3.82 - Tamorrian Terry: I like this guy, but why didn't you double down on OG/C? You said you wanted to help Wilson, but your help is Quinn Meinerz and James Carpenter? That's worse than what we had this season....

We *did* double down on OG/C. Again, you're welcome to disagree with the evaluation, but we are really high on David Moore and thinks he's worth a day 2 pick. Part of this process is trying to figure out who's going to go where in the draft - we don't actually get to know where everyone's going to go before we made our selection. Terry was perhaps the most unusually-gifted player remaining on the board, and we also suspected that David Moore would still be available when we were next up. So that's what we did, and we guessed right. 

I also don't think we're actually worse than we were at last season; as I've mentioned in another reply, the best-case scenario is that both rookies are able to start. If that's the case, then it's likely that we've improved the line (and even if there are some growing pains, the 2022 line will almost certainly be better than it was in 2020, at least on the interior). But we still have 4 of 5 starters returning, and that means the worst-case scenario is that we've thrown 2 highly-rated rookies and an established veteran at the remaining spot, and really, the best you can do in the draft is try to take good chances. As you know, there are no sure things. 

What it comes down to is that we are very high on both Meinerz and Moore, and also accurately predicted where they would be available to us.

4289,35987,35987,Caulibflower,"Yeah, I see some similar things. 

One thing that's hard to represent in the summary is how everything unfolded over time; it's very much a fluid process, so it ends up being a combination of having a plan and dealing with surprises. I agree that the DE group looks a bit crowded - but we'd gotten towards the end of free agency with a decent bit of cap space and Floyd still available. He was just too good not to make an offer, and I generally lean towards the idea that you really can't have too many quality pass rushers. Having a pass rush that stays fast and fresh throughout the game really pays off as the game wears on. As I mention in the summary, Floyd also gives us some options (and so some floor) with our LB group; with his ability to play SLB as well as the 'LEO' spot, we're not left out on a limb if Cody Barton's not up to the task at WLB - Brooks simply swaps back to the weak side, and Floyd slots in at SLB. 

It's a similar thought process with our OL group. You'll probably have already noticed that we brought back Ethan Pocic as well - so it's actually only the LG spot which is guaranteed to have a new starter. I know our line has been in the news again with some of Russ's recent comments, but to be honest I feel like they were better than they're being given credit for. But regardless, I think we've at least held steady on the line, and that's three players - two of which are young players with major upside - who can all compete for the LG spot. Best case scenario is that both rookies transition well enough to start in 2021, but between the three of them (Meinerz, Moore and Carpenter), I would be pretty confident that we'll at least be competent at LG, and so across the line. There also just weren't very many quality guards available in free agency. It was a very tight market and guys were getting paid at a level we weren't willing to go when we had so much confidence in the iOL who would be available in the draft. 

Agree the corners feel a bit sketchy, but would be cautiously optimistic if this were our actual group. The one thing I'll add aside from the way I'd envision this competition playing out (as I've indicated in the depth chart comments), is that we did actually hope to bring Richard Sherman back in free agency. He ended up taking an almost-identical deal to the one we offered to play for Buffalo, and that was one of our bigger disappointments of the process. But that's just how it goes!",5.0,seahawks,t3_lzzx6w,False,0.0,​,2021-03-07T18:47:14Z,seahawks,-0.0003615766232732
4290,35988,35988,Caulibflower,"> What did Linsley eventually sign for?

he signed for, if I remember correctly, $58 million over 4 years with $45 million guaranteed. I'm not sure if I would have matched that, even if I knew what it was - that's an awful lot of money to guarantee to a 30-year old player, even if he's the best at his position. Our offer was a similar APY ($54 million over 4 years), but only about $30 million guaranteed. And that was after we raised it. 'Linsley's agent' wasn't very communicative with us, though, and sometimes that just how it goes. It's easy for us to think, ""Why doesn't the team just go out and sign X player?"" but sometimes the Corey Linsleys of the world just want to go play for Miami instead. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

> Any concern with Lockett's cap hit and guaranteed money in '23 given that DK will enter his next contract in that season? I've struggled with that dilemma in my projections.

Somewhat, yeah. It's not the deal I wanted to sign - my original offer was to add $20 million guaranteed and 2 years to his existing deal. I think that's a pretty reasonable offer, if a little bit below what he can probably get on the open market, but I feel like it splits the difference between upside and guaranteed money. However, the way these things are decided is basically dice rolls, and that forced me into offering him a bigger contract than I was comfortable with, because I both a) really wanted to keep him around, and b) needed to lower his 2021 cap hit with a re-worked deal. I don't think the guaranteed money is too much of an issue, though - you can just backload DK's contract a little bit to make it fit, and the other comings and goings of the roster will create similar spaces. Whether the team is able to meet DK's asking price at all is a more worrying question in my mind, because I can easily see him wanting $25 million/year (or more). At that point it's not really a question of whether it fits under the cap, but how much you can actually justify paying a wide receiver. (This is also part of why I drafted Tamorrion Terry - aside from presenting a really formidable 3rd option in the receiving game, he's also a bit of a hedge in case the team struggles to find common ground when DK's up for a new contract.)",9.0,seahawks,t3_lzzx6w,False,0.0,​,2021-03-07T15:56:59Z,seahawks,-0.0200743855415027
4291,35989,35989,Caulibflower,"**Projected 2021 Depth Chart and Comments**



- **OFFENSE**

Once we committed to keeping Russ, we also committed to improving his protection and his weapons. New OC Shane Waldron is likely to be bringing some of the concepts which have made the Rams’ offense successful in recent years, including a lot of play-action passes, creative screens, in-motion wide receivers, and crossing routes. We wanted to make sure we got Russ at *least* one more legitimate receiving threat, and exceeded that target significantly. The one area we felt we came up a little bit short was at tight end - though Jared Cook is still surprisingly spry going into his age-34 season and is actually a very good consolation prize. We had hoped to bring in either Jonnu Smith or Gerald Everett, but Jonnu was tagged-and-traded, and Everett went early in free agency. 

The addition of Tamorrion Terry immediately changes the shape of our offense by upgrading the outside threat opposite DK Metcalf. In many ways Terry’s initial role will be similar to David Moore’s - whether we begin the season with Moore or Terry in that role will be one of the more interesting camp battles to look forward to. However, Moore is also only signed to a 1-year minimum deal, so Terry will likely replace him in 2022 even if he takes the year to develop. Jaelon Darden presents some interesting possibilities as well, and we could potentially see him used on jet sweeps, screens, and other plays that get the ball into his hands quickly, even if he is listed down on the depth chart. 

The final thing to note is how this rookie class is also expected to shape the run game. For years, Pete Carroll has continued to talk about getting back to a hard-nosed, physically-intimidating brand of football. Well, we think this class will make *him* happy, too. Quinn Meinerz and David Moore join Damien Lewis to form a young and exciting core in the middle of the offense line. Each of them has the tools to be a dominant run-blocker, and the physicality of Javonte Williams is the perfect compliment. Rashaad Penny is allowed to return as a change of pace and home run threat, a role he was just beginning to take hold of before his 2019 ACL injury. We were prepared to enter 2021 with Penny slotted in to start, but we’re much happier for him to return as a high-end number 2. An effective run game is also the necessary ingredient for an effective play-action game, and adding an additional field-stretcher in Tamorrion Terry just makes this offense all the more lethal. With Tyler Lockett and Jared Cook smartly working underneath while DK Metcalf and Tamorrion Terry cause anxiety in the deep secondary, this offense is now constructed to constantly threaten defenses at all three levels and create big plays in both the run and the pass game.

- **DEFENSE & ST**

After consecutive offseasons which saw us lose our top pass-rusher, I was determined not to let that happen again. Re-signing Benson Mayowa and extending Carlos Dunlap keeps the group intact for at least the next two seasons, but we added another significant piece in last-year’s divisional rival, Leonard Floyd. Known previously in Chicago as a well-rounded outside linebacker who didn’t quite live up to his billing as a pass-rusher, a change of scenery seemed to unlock that ability in Floyd as he set a career high in sacks with 10.5 for the Rams. Floyd’s versatility allows us to try multiple configurations on defense as we search for the most effective packages. Is Cody Barton ready for a significant role? If he is, Floyd can rush from the ‘LEO’ spot. If Barton proves to be a liability, Floyd is well-suited for our strong-side LB duties. With the surprising emergence of Alton Robinson and the eventual appearance of Darrell Taylor, we feel really optimistic about our ability to create explosive pressure off the edges, in 2020 and beyond. 

On the interior, we’ve basically swapped out Jarran Reed for Ndomukong Suh, in a move that allowed to extend Poona Ford for the next 4 years and acquire the draft pick which turned into Jaelon Darden. Suh still appears to have a lot left in the tank, and Poona Ford is an ascending player who we felt we needed to extend before his price tag really got away from us. Young interior players Bryan Mone and Cedrick Lattimore both showed promising signs last year (with Lattimore registering 6 tackles on just 26 snaps in our Wild Card loss to the Rams). LJ Collier hopefully continues to develop as an inside-out player; while he is neither as effective as Carlos Dunlap as a strong side end, or likely as effective as Suh on the interior, we expect him to be a primary reserve at both spots. He potentially moves towards getting used mostly as an interior rusher, where his skillset actually seems most suited. He may even be able to challenge Suh for the top spot in this role in 2021.

The biggest defensive question marks are at the outside cornerback spots. DJ Reed was a revelation last year, and returns in 2021 with the inside track at one of those jobs, most likely at right corner. If Quinton Dunbar can return - and importantly, stay - healthy, 2021 will be a season for him to rebuild his stock and look to cash in when free agency returns in 2022. Challenging for a role in the mix is disgraced former Packer Kevin King, who was rated highly on our 2017 draft board but didn’t do enough to keep his job in Green Bay. Pete Carroll loves a reclamation project, and physically speaking, King has everything Carroll looks for in a cornerback. It’s a relatively low-cost signing for a young player who may well have additional room to grow in a new system. Rookie Olaijah Griffin will be thrown into the mix as well. Depending on how the competition shakes out, Marquise Blair may also be given a look at outside corner. He had surprisingly won the starting nickel spot by the outset of 2020, with coaches raving about his natural ability for man coverage. The coaching staff likes him best in the middle of the field, but if the initial competition outside fails to satisfy, there’s a decent chance Blair will be added to that competition, since Ugo Amadi also played well at nickel last year.  

The big addition to special teams is, of course, Jaelon Darden. Our hope is that Darden slots right into the role of primary return man, with DJ Reed entering the season as a likely starter at one of the cornerback slots and David Moore and Travis Homer failing to impress as returners over the last couple of seasons. Tamorrion Terry was also a standout gunner on punt coverage units while at FSU, and his speed, wingspan and physicality could see him get another look for that role in Seattle.

4292,35990,35990,Caulibflower,"**Seahawks Draft**

**2.56 Javonte Williams - RB - North Carolina**

Javonte Williams was our number 1 choice heading into the draft - we were shocked when he made it all the way to our pick. Williams is very similar to Chris Carson in his punishing physicality, size and frame, and contact balance. However, we think Williams has a considerably higher ceiling - he is a more fluid athlete and has a breakaway gear that Carson lacks. In 2020, Javonte broke a tackle on 48% of his runs, according to PFF - the highest rate they’ve ever recorded. He also gained at least 10 yards on over a quarter of his attempts. His blend of physicality and big-play ability immediately makes him the most dangerous running back we’ve had since Marshawn Lynch. There’s not even much more to say about him - he’s that good. Just look him up on YouTube. He’s an awesome runner. 

**3.71 Quinn Meinerz - C - Wisconsin-Whitewater**

The big, athletic interior lineman from DIII Wisconsin-Whitewater simply *dominated* the Senior Bowl, rep after rep, day after day. His performance against other top prospects drew comparisons to Ali Marpet, another DIII interior lineman who had an excellent Senior Bowl and has gone on to be one of the best centers in the league. Meinerz is likely an even better athlete than Marpet (he can dunk a basketball at 6’3” 320) and [plays with a finisher’s demeanor.](https://www.giants.com/video/wisconsin-whitewater-quinn-meinerz-ridiculous-block-senior-bowl-highlights) Part of the reason we capped our pursuit of Corey Linsley was because we really liked the interior linemen in the draft, and Quinn Meinerz was at the top of our wish list. We think he’s a top-50 talent in this class, and as with Williams, wasted no time submitting this pick. We think he can play either guard or center, but he’ll get his first look at center. 

**3.82 (2022 2nd) Tamorrion “Scary” Terry - WR - Florida State**

The pick that threatened to break the mock. The discord chat *hated* this pick. I was prepared to take “Scary” Terry in the 2nd round if our other top targets were off the board, so I began shopping our 2022 second round pick as he continued to drop and eventually found a taker. We went into this draft wanting to give Russ more targets, and Terry possesses a truly unusual combination of traits. At 6’4” 210, with a well-defined frame and extremely long arms, he also has incredible deep speed and breakaway ability. He possesses the playmaking instincts and alpha mentality of a true no. 1 receiver, and managed to dominate the ACC despite subpar QB play. His stock seems to have been depressed due to a 2020 campaign where he spent the first 6 games attempting to battle through a knee injury, before finally calling it quits to prepare himself for the draft. However, what he showed in 2019 was enough for me to firmly grade him as a 2nd round pick or better - he is perfect for the Seahawks offense. 

Terry is one of the most frightening big play threats we have seen in some time. [Over the course of his career,](https://seminoles.com/sports/football/roster/tamorrion-terry/) he averaged a TD every 6.5 receptions. He holds the FSU records for TDs over 70 yards with 5. For his career, the average length of a TD reception is 49 yards. In 2019, the average length of a TD catch was 58 yards on 9 scoring catches. In 2019 he also recorded a gps-tracked top speed of 23.4 mph - for reference, [the highest speed Tyreek Hill has ever recorded is 23.2 mph.](https://twitter.com/BrettKollmann/status/1365716771529887750) But all these numbers just reinforce what I first saw on the tape - a huge receiver who can both engulf defensive backs with his frame to secure contested catches, and also pull away from them in the open field. He’s not as powerful as DK Metcalf, but he’s more fluid. I especially enjoyed one incredulous comment in the mock-draft chat: “I don’t understand why you’d take Terry when you already have DK Metcalf!” The answer, dear reader, is in the question: It is because the player Terry first makes me think of is DK Metcalf. You better believe I’ll spend a 2nd round pick trying to get another one.

**4.129 David Moore - OG - Grambling State**

Another Senior Bowl standout, David Moore is the rare dude who can carry 350 pounds on a  6’1” frame without appearing to have any bad weight. [Just look at these guns!!](https://www.nfldraftdiamonds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5E1C439E-8D27-4E1F-AE53-8DEB040BAD04.jpeg) It’s madness!! Men of this stature should not be allowed to do back handsprings - it should be illegal. But [David Moore doesn’t care.](https://youtu.be/P_intm8npMA?t=576) He will do a back handspring, just because he can. Not many FCS guards have highlight videos - but David Moore does. Look him up if you think it’s funny to see defensive linemen thrown into the air. Moore was also voted the [Senior Bowl’s best offensive lineman](https://eu.thenewsstar.com/story/sports/college/gsu/2021/02/05/grambling-state-lineman-david-moore-nfl-draft-senior-bowl/4337251001/) - an award voted on by the defensive linemen he played against. He was the other interior lineman I *really* wanted, and he’ll immediately be given the opportunity to compete for the starting spot at left guard. 

**5.163 Jaelon Darden - WR/RET - North Texas**

After going offense on our first 4 picks, we were ready to go defense by the 5th round - but Jaelon Darden kept falling. We think the 2020 Biletnikoff finalist could have easily gone in round 3, so really represented a BPA pick to us here. There was also the question of immediate impact; at this stage in the draft, most of the defenders we were considering were more developmental - but Darden is likely to immediately contend for punt return duties, and possesses a level of quickness and elusiveness which no other player on our roster really has. We’re also mindful of the offensive changes new OC Shane Waldron is likely to implement, which include a lot of screens and crossing routes which allow a player with Darden’s elusiveness to really shine. We’ve got a lot of talent in our WR room, but Darden’s unique skill-set could nonetheless lead to early usage, both in the return game and on plays designed to get the ball into his hands quickly. 

**5.168 Olaijah Griffin - CB - USC**

Though we felt ok about our group of corners after free agency, it was the next place we really felt like we needed to address a need in the draft. Olaijah Griffin has a somewhat slender build, but has decent length to his 6-foot frame. Physically, there are a number of similarities to Jeremy Lane. But while Griffin may not necessarily stand out in a lineup of big Seattle corners - what he brings is a feisty play demeanor and sticky coverage. He doesn’t have a ton of counting stats to throw around - but if you turn on the USC defensive tape, what you often see is teams targeting the opposite side of the field. In 2019, [he posted a lower completion percentage, fewer yards per target and a higher rate of pass breakups per target for the season than Utah star CB Jaylon Johnson,](https://www.nbcsports.com/edge/college-football/nfl-draft/player/41032/olaijah-griffin) who went in the second round that year. In 2020, he allowed [only *38%* of passes to be completed against him.](https://draftscout.com/dsprofile.php?PlayerId=1022220&DraftYear=2021) Griffin likely won’t be called upon immediately, as he learns our system and gets a little bit stronger, but appears to have all the traits to be in the mix, and possibly sooner rather than later. 

**7.249 Janarius Robinson - DE - Florida State**

We wanted to get one more defensive lineman out of the draft, and again were surprised to see one of our highest-priority targets last all the way to our pick. Yet another Senior Bowl standout, Robinson possesses truly unusual length at 6’5” 266 with 35” arms and an 87” wingspan. He looks like he could carry even more weight without losing mobility, and is an extremely exciting developmental prospect at defensive end. Florida State has seemingly struggled to capitalise on their talent in recent years, and Robinson going this late in the draft is likely due to that trend in underperformance. TheDraftNetwork has him listed as their 111th-ranked prospect and says of him: [“He is a powerful run defender, smart processor, and has plenty of tools to become a more effective pass rusher. He has some really exciting flashes rushing the passer where his length, flexibility, rush variety, effort, and hand power shine.”](https://thedraftnetwork.com/player/janarius-robinson/mTYDnon00W) Even just looking through some of his highlight tape, that upside is evident. In [this one,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ4G7QY1NnA&t=106s) you see him beat a guard with quickness, strike and stop the lead blocker with power, and then finish by securing the runner with his length. In [another clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ4G7QY1NnA&t=222s) you see him get off the edge quickly, gain leverage against the tackle with flexibility, and get home to cause the fumble with power and length. So while Robinson lacks the statistical production of other top defensive end prospects, we think his upside is really, really exciting and we were absolutely thrilled to get him in the 7th round.

We all know Russ is a much more effective QB when he has a strong line and a decent run game to complement his skills as a passer. Similarly, couple Jamal Adams with a decent pass rush and decent CB play, and his versatility within a defensive scheme enables him to excel in all aspects of his game.

6985,55202,55202,DiamondDash2k,"In case people hate reading images:

***Top needs: QB, OT, DE***  
*Seattle had three picks in the entire 2021 draft. This year? It entered Round 1 with three in the top 41, thanks to the trade of Russell Wilson. I always struggle with what the Seahawks are thinking; they stick to their board and don't worry about a leaguewide consensus. That's why it was good to see coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider also saw their hole at left tackle and went that way at No. 9.*

*Charles Cross is the best pass-protecting tackle in this class, an easy mover with great fit and long arms. (And this is a rare Seattle mock draft pick that I nailed, even if it was from March.) He'll replace Duane Brown immediately. Say what you want about moving on from Wilson, but at least the Seahawks got a lot of capital in the deal, and they now have a left tackle who can be there for 10-plus years.*

*On Day 2, I thought there was a prime opportunity for the Seahawks to take quarterback Malik Willis and develop him into a future star. They ended up passing three times on Willis, which I suppose means they're OK with Drew Lock and Geno Smith being just average in 2022. Carroll and Schneider must think the roster is farther along than I do.*

*As for whom they got on Day 2, I like the players, even if it's not what I would do. Kenneth Walker II (41) is a bowling ball of a running back, and he is going to play in an offense that values those kinds of players. Boye Mafe (40) has some raw pass-rush traits off the edge. Abraham Lucas (72) might be a rookie starter at right tackle, which is rare for a third-round pick.*

*On Day 3, the Seahawks doubled up with cornerbacks Coby Bryant (109) and Tariq Woolen (153), who in particular fits what Carroll likes in his defensive backs. Woolen is 6-foot-4 with a huge wingspan, and he ran a 4.26-second 40-yard dash at the combine. The former college receiver is just very raw. Wide receiver Bo Melton (229) has some speed that makes him a potential seventh-round find.*

8856,65243,65243,Esuu,">I thought I saw $25m, but somewhere else said $40. That’s a huge number and they need to offload him. He hasn’t played in a year.

Whoever trades for him is on the hook for:

* 2022 - $35m
* 2023 - $37m
* 2024 - $32m
* 2025 - $32m

If we were to trade for him I imagine we'd restructure his 2022 contract to make whatever room need for other signings. If you drop it down to $14m in 2022 then it becomes $44m/$39m/$39m for the final three, which is essentially the mid tier going rate for a QB nowadays. Whatever happens the contract is as manageable as any for a QB not on a rookie deal.

Since he comes with 4 years of control on a reasonable contract I would expect his price to be above Wilson's. $32m in 2024 and 2025 is going to be a steal once we get there. The other side of this though is that Watson has shown that he's perfectly capable of refusing to play so playing on a reasonable contract might not be something he's willing to do.

The only thing that could drag down the asking price is obviously the demand. If teams that he's willing to go to aren't willing to sell the farm then he could get dealt for what seems like cheap.

>Explanation of the Advanced Passing table
This is a quick look at how a quarterback did compared to league average in eight different passing stats: yards per attempt, adjusted yards per attempt, net yards per attempt, adjusted net yards per attempt, completion percentage, passing TD percentage, interception percentage, and sack percentage.
First, for each stat for each year for each league, we computed two things:

>the league average for that stat in that league during the three-year period with the given year in the middle. For example, the ""league average"" for the 1963 AFL would be the aggregate average of the stats accumulated in the AFL from 1962 to 1964. (NOTE: the 1960 AFL and the 1969 AFL, as well as the current season, will be based on only two years worth of data rather than three.)
the standard deviation of the stat for all individuals who had 14 or more pass attempts per scheduled game during the three-year period.
Next, we computed how many standard deviations away from the league average each player was in each of his seasons. We multiply that number by 15 and add it to 100, and that is the number you see.

>Bottom line:

>On all stats, 100 is league average.
On all stats (including sack percentage and interception percentage), a higher number means better than average
The greatest passing seasons of all time are in the 140s. A typical league-leading season in most categories will be in the high 120s or the low-to-mid 130s.
Fine print:
Only seasons in which the player attempted 50 or more passes are included in the Advanced Passing table
The career score at the bottom is an attempt-weighted average of the numbers in the column. 

>For seasons in which times sacked was not recorded, the stats involving sacks are blank. For these stats, the totals at the bottom include only the seasons for which the yearly score is not blank, so in some cases they might not be representative of the player's entire career.

Basically they take the average of the year in question, previous year, and following year then compare it to each player. How many standard deviations each player is from average determines what they add or subtract from 100.

So if during a certain time period everyone is throwing a ton of interceptions then it accounts for that.

[Tyler Lockett](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577327/tyler-lockett), WR, [Seattle Seahawks](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks)

The NFL is so well-stocked with receivers that many could be classified as underrated. But Lockett can only be overlooked for so long. His quick start (278 yards and three touchdowns) is hardly a surprise, with a third straight 1,000-yard season well underway.
Seattle loves the nuances of his game, from making the right decisions when the unexpected happens mid-play to studying a cornerback's posture at the snap for clues on coverage. He's elite on quarterback scramble plays. His body control is top-shelf, especially on throws to the sideline or the back of the end zone. He's a motion-and-shift expert, running 342 routes off those looks since 2017, second in the NFL. He's also known in Seattle's locker room as one of the most mentally tough players on the roster.

""He's been pretty unbelievable there from Day 1,"" an NFL offensive coach said. ""People are slowly coming around on him, but he's elite. DK [Metcalf] is the upside guy there, but you could argue [Lockett] is the No. 1. It wasn't long ago [Seattle] thought he might be a three, but he's outplayed that in a big way.""
Since 2017, the [Russell Wilson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson)-Lockett tandem ranks second among QB-WR duos with 17 touchdowns on throws at least 20 yards downfield. They've connected on two 60-plus-yard scores already this season.

Several receivers are considered underappreciated around the NFL -- the Rams' [Cooper Kupp](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977187/cooper-kupp) and Washington's [Terry McLaurin](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121422/terry-mclaurin) come to mind -- but many of them make compelling cases as No. 1 receivers.

If the defense makes a big play it's almost always right in the opponents face(big tackle, pass breakup, sack, etc.). Hell even an interception or fumble recovery usually ends in a tackle by the offense so there would be someone right there.

If the offense makes a big play there's a decent chance they've run away from the defense *or* the defense has moved away from them(e.g. QB makes a big throw celebrates but the dline has drifted toward the catch).

There's also the fact that the offense dictates the speed of the game so they often have an incentive to not slow down the game by celebrating after anything but a scoring play which will also often happen well clear of the defense. The defense has the opposite incentive.

Michael Clayton is a good one for a recent WR(Bucs). 80 rec, 1193 yds, 7 TDs his rookie season. Stayed in the league the next 7 seasons but only recorded 1762 yds, and 3 TDs during the rest of his career.

[Per this article](https://www.si.com/nfl/talkoffame/nfl/collier-on-gradishar-and-hall), the number seems to come from his defensive coordinator that he gave to the Bronco's PR director for publicity's sake.

A quote from his DC:

>“By looking at the film, I would make the sure the tackles were accurate,” said Collier[Bronco's DC]. “Randy made a lot of first hits, and he made a lot of assisted tackles. A lot of people probably don’t give credit for assisted tackles. If a ballcarrier is still moving and the whistle hasn’t blown, and a guy gets there to help with the tackle that’s an assisted tackle.

>“I think the guys up in the press box didn’t pay much attention to a guy who came in with the second or third hit on a ballcarrier. To me, taking tackles the next day off of the film … they’re accurate tackles. No question about it.""

I don't necessarily disagree with his logic but if the common practice is to *not* count the things that he's considering tackles as tackles but he is then that number would be inflated over other players even if it actually is more accurate or a better number.

Ultimately, any stats you see for tackles before 1987 at the earliest is likely pretty suspect.

9007,65464,65464,Esuu,"From 2017-2019 triple doubles happened ~117 times per season. Over the 1260 total games in the NBA that's one every 10.76 games. With 16 games the NFL season had 256 total games or ~20% the number of games in the NFL. So we're looking for something that happens about 24 times a season. 

The issue with this is that different positions have different stats. Since a triple double is mostly offensive stats I'm going to focus there and the three main stat positions(QBS, RBs, WR/TEs) and divide that 24 down to some that happened around 10 times in 2020 as a starting place.

QBs:

* 350+ passing yards and 4+ passing TDs - 12 times
* 300+ passing yards, 3+ passing TDs, 1+ rushing TD - 13 times
* 300+ passing yards, 30+ rushing yards, 2+ passing TD, 1+ rushing TD - 8 times
* 400+ passing yards - 12 times
* 300+ passing yards, 50+ rushing yards - 8 times

RBs:

* 180+ rushing yards - 8 times
* 100+ rushing yards, 2+ rushing TDs - 5 times
* 3+ rushing TDs - 7 times(1 was a QB though)
* 100+ rushing yards, 1+ rushing TD, 1+ receiving TD - 5 times
* 65 rushing yards, 65 receiving yards - 10 times(1 was a WR)
* 50 rushing yards, 50 rec yards, 1+ rushing TD, 1+ rec TD - 5 times(1 WR)

WR/TEs:

* 180+ receiving yards - 9 times
* 180+ receiving yards, 2+ rec TDs - 6 times
* 100+ receiving yards 3+ rec TDs - 6 times
* 3+ rec TDs - 9 times

Intuitively, 300/30/2/1 for a QB feels fairly similar to a triple double to me. 50/50/1/1 or 100/1/1 seems to fit the best for RBs but is slightly less common than a triple double in the current NBA. It is closer to the frequency of a triple double 5+ years ago though. 180/2 or 100/3 seem to be the best options for WR/TEs.",3.0,nfl,t3_oqgxf2,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2021-07-24T08:52:01Z,seahawks,0.064204112772

9032,65504,65504,Esuu,"Something funky is definitely going on with career AV. At first I thought you were right about the rounding issues because of a few of the other players I looked at were also off by a few points from what the raw numbers add up to that could easily be explained by unseen rounding. 

Then I looked at Stephon Gilmore and somehow he has 93 career AV but 51 raw AV with the Pats and 25 raw AV with the Bills for 76 total which is a much larger difference that can't be explained by pure rounding. Quenton Nelson is another one with 15 raw AV in each of his 3 seasons but 50 total. Just the basic math of that possibly being 15.49...x3 could only possibly get him to 46.49... for his career. Ryan Ramczyk is similar with 54 total from adding his 4 seasons but 59 shown as his career AV.

On their explanation of AV they say

>...""career AV"", which is just the unweighted sum of a player's AV scores.

but that rarely seems to be the case. It's also from an article in 2011 so it might have changed in the decade since. Either they're doing something different like PFF does with it's career grades or there are just a ton of mistakes. I would assume that PFRs stat totals are automated so it being mistakes would be odd so my thinking is that they calculate career AV separately from each individual season.

If we get one more first down we can run out the clock and kick the game-winning FG which would make us 12-4 that year rather than 11-5. That would give us the #1 seed instead of the #5 seed and the NFC playoffs would have gone through Seattle rather than San Fransico. We were by far the hottest team in the NFL going into the playoffs and I think with home-field advantage 2012 would have gone similarly to 2013. I don't know if we beat the Ravens but I do think we make the Super Bowl.

Another aspect of this is that we wouldn't have played the Redskins in the Wild Card round so it's possible that that game goes differently for RG3 and he never tears his ACL/LCL. Maybe it still happens but maybe he doesn't get injured that game and recovers from his LCL sprain completely over the off-season and his career goes a different direction than it did.",2.0,nfl,t3_mv9i1n,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2021-04-21T10:07:35Z,seahawks,0.0628730218094258

Realistically right now the next team to do it would be whoever out of Ridley, Juju, or Kupp stays on their current team long enough to hit 10k yards. I wouldn't be surprised if Amari Cooper or Robert Woods hits 10k career yards at some point I just doubt they'll be able to hit 10k with just their current team.

There was a real sense that the winner of this game would be in the driver's seat for a wildcard appearance, while the loser would have an uphill battle to make the playoffs. We had not yet been on a run of dominating the 49er's - up until this point they had been a frightening opponent and this felt like the game that would show who us who both teams truly were. And we absolutely dominated them.  


After winning this game, the Seahawks went on to win out their remaining games, holding all three division rivals to single digit scores. We stole the division from the Cardinals, and beat the Packers in a miraculous comeback on route to a second straight super bowl appearance.  


For the 49er's, this was the exact moment of their collapse. They lost 4 of their remaining 5 games, finishing 8-8. Coach Jim Harbaugh was fired at the end of the season, and a mass exodus of players drained the team of talent. The 49ers would not have another winning season until 2019.

It's insiders jobs to be first to report news worthy tweets and headlines. There's a very real possibility he caught wind of the deal, inquired with Penny/his agent on the details to report on and got information about the other offers. 

There's also a reason Ian or any other insider won't report the alleged offers. Those offers are trusted private information that front offices don't want available to everyone.

I'm really liking their adjustment to the modern NFL. Everyone is going to complain about running the ball but they fail to realize that's the very foundation of the Shanahan/Mcvay schemes.

We currently run zone under Waldron. Last year was weird cause we had Solari but clearly wanted to transition from his scheme. You could see it happening at the end of last year, players have been on record saying that is when Dickerson really started to take hold of the offense. Pocic went as far as crediting Dickerson for the success of Penny late in the season. 

Solari relies on the Chris Carsons of the game (power backs) where they get north and south, hit A or B gap, lower there shoulders and chunk off plays. To me that's not the player Homer is.

As far as his performance goes. Of course Pete is gonna run the ball as much as he can. Any team starting a backup is going to find a way to gameplan to run the ball and use lots of quick and easy throws to keep the backup managed.

He's mobile like Russ and real ra-ra kind of leader like Russ but has no where near the accuracy, touch or zip. I also worry about his size, he's not thicc like Russ and as a mobile QB who has frequent designed runs, he's gonna end up getting hit a lot. He's got a killer arm and if he can find a way to be more accurate he might be able to step up to the next level but accuracy seems more like an innate QB trait. Like Teddy Bradshaw said, ""It's the kid in the neighborhood that could hit the stop sign with the snowball everytime"". I'm afraid he might be stuck in kind of a tweener QB mold; not an elite runner like Lamar and doesn't have an elite arm like Rodgers, Mahomes, etc but is pretty good at both. In the NFL you at least need one or the other. As you alluded to as well, Liberty used a TON of designed runs for Malik and he rarely stepped up in the pocket to deliver passes to his receivers. There's just so much that scares me about Malik. 

I'm honestly more sold on Pickett at this point but really not a big fan of any prospects and it's not like whatever rookie we bring in is going to have a vet to learn behind. I say run the season with Lock and Minshew, let them battle it out and who knows? Maybe one will surprise Seahawks fans and be enough of a manager to get the Hawks to the playoffs.

If that doesn't work out then we're likely looking at a high draft pick and we can select an actually elite college QB in the 2023 draft and hopefully the picks we used in 2022 put some nice pieces on our team as a foundation for the young QB.

There will be times where he's lighting up the field then others where he looks like he can't read the defense at all.

17514,131140,131140,MysticalMango21,"The quarterback came back from injury and spent a month playing poorly. Wilson was 16-of-27 for 181 yards and two touchdowns against Chicago, and his protection held up most of the afternoon, but he couldn’t avoid taking a huge sack in crunch time. Seattle’s skill players also have long droughts without touching the ball. DK Metcalf caught a 41-yard touchdown in the first quarter and a quick pass on the first play of the second quarter, then never touched the ball again. Tyler Lockett caught two passes in the first half and didn’t catch his third until the final drive. He finished with 30 receiving yards.  
  
Seattle’s third-down offense is now the worst in the league by expected points added per play, according to TruMedia, and conversion percentage. Seattle was 3-of-10 on Sunday. “That’s just not good enough execution,” Carroll said.  
  
Oh, and Seattle’s kicker is one of the least accurate in the league. Myers has hit just 68.4 percent of his field goal attempts, which ranks 40th out of 45 qualifying kickers.  
  
Every facet of Seattle’s game has fatal flaws. This typically means the issues are systemic.  
  
“I have to do more,” Carroll said. “At a time like this, I feel like I got to find ways to help our guys more so that we don’t get in a situation where we give them a chance. That’s what I’m doing. I’m trying to figure out how I can help and get us cleaner down the stretch and win the football game.”  
  
Now that the Seahawks are eliminated from postseason contention, these final few games are mostly meaningless. Several players are on expiring deals, so their performances are certainly relevant, but the wins and losses aren’t all that impactful. What does matter is whether the on-field product gives team owner Jody Allen any reason to keep the Big Three of Carroll, Wilson and general manager John Schneider together.  
  
What about this team’s roster construction would lead Allen to believe Carroll and Schneider can right the ship with cap space and draft picks?  
  
  
Pete Carroll’s Seahawks will miss the postseason after starting the year as Super Bowl hopefuls.  
Their investment in the cornerback position this offseason was a disaster. So much so that Schneider had to trade for Sidney Jones and Reid — the team’s starters Sunday — during training camp. Despite multiple draft picks, free-agent signings and trades to bolster the pass rush, the Seahawks have one of the worst pressure rates in the league and a new scheme that shelved Dunlap — the team’s best pass rusher — for most of the season. Their win-now trades on defense aren’t resulting in enough wins to justify the transactions.  
  
On offense, Penny, the team’s top pick in 2018, is having an outstanding finish to the season. Only the Rams’ Sony Michel and the Colts’ Jonathan Taylor have more rushing yards in December. But it has taken Penny four years to have this type of production, and the coach with a run-first philosophy has done a shaky job building a run game that thrives without the oft-injured Chris Carson. Up front, the run blocking is hardly ever elite and the offensive line still grades out as one of the worst in the league in pass protection (it tends to rank well in ESPN’s pass block rate). The offense looks lost when it isn’t throwing to Metcalf or Lockett, and the receiver the team selected at No. 56 in 2021 to address that problem (Dee Eskridge) hasn’t had an impact out of fly sweeps.  
  
Why should Allen have confidence that Carroll and Schneider can create another championship-caliber roster?  
  
What about the way Wilson has performed since Week 10 of the 2020 season suggests that he’s going to be effective — or satisfied — running a Pete Carroll offense? Does Wilson need to be better? Of course — he’s 21st in EPA per play, according to TruMedia. But by now, it’s clear that changing offensive coordinators doesn’t do anything for Wilson. He is who he is as a quarterback: an elite downfield passer and playmaker, one who thrives on play-action passing. A perennial Pro Bowler. He can create in the pocket, but sometimes his tendency to do so harms the offense. He’s an average third-down passer in obvious throwing situations, and his passing charts would suggest he prefers throws outside the numbers instead of over the middle.  
  
Does anything about the past 14 months suggest that keeping Carroll and Wilson together will change any of that? This marriage has simply run its course.  
  
Carroll replied “I don’t know” on Sunday when asked if this team needs a rebuild. To be fair to Carroll, he can’t afford for that to be on his mind in a postgame setting. But the answer to that question should be above his head anyway. That question is one for Allen.  
  
The answer seems obvious.",22.0,seahawks,t3_rpfx22,False,0.0,:old_logo:,2021-12-26T23:58:50Z,seahawks,6.520917993062034e-08
17515,131141,131141,MysticalMango21,"  
Before this season, the Seahawks had missed the postseason only once in the Russell Wilson era. It was 2017. Seattle limped to a 9-7 finish in part because the Legion of Boom slowly began to deteriorate. It appeared time for a rebuild.  
  
Seattle chose not to. Instead, the buzzword that offseason was “retool,” which proved to be a fitting description, as the team didn’t change the quarterback, head coach or general manager. A rebuild typically means changing at least one of those three people, and there was an argument to be made at the time to keep those three in place.  
  
The Seahawks can’t make that argument now. They need change. Significant, franchise-shifting change.  
  
It’s all but official: The Seahawks need a full rebuild.  
  
This has been obvious for quite some time, truthfully. Once the quarterback calls out the organization during the offseason and passive-aggressively suggests he’d like to be traded, there should be questions about the future of the franchise. Then Wilson suffered the first significant injury of his career and Seattle was ill-equipped to survive without him. But even with Wilson in the lineup, the Seahawks were a train wreck on offense and stumbled to a 3-8 record after an embarrassing loss at home to the Colt McCoy in Week 11. That felt like rock bottom.  
  
The evidence had been mounting for months, but what happened Sunday at Lumen Field, a 25-24 loss to the Chicago Bears, truly encapsulated all that is wrong with the Seahawks.  
  
Consider the situation. They were hosting a four-win squad with a lame-duck head coach, down to third-string quarterback Nick Foles. Seattle was playing at home. Yes, the field was covered in snow and the Seahawks were playing on a short week, but that didn’t put either team at a significant disadvantage.  
  
The first 45 minutes proved this to be true. The Seahawks held a 10-point lead entering the fourth quarter. Then, the final 15 minutes demonstrated how much of a disaster this season truly is.  
  
First, it was a Bears field goal. Then a backbreaking sack of Wilson on third down in the red zone. Then a missed field goal attempt by Jason Myers. A few minutes later, a six-play, 80-yard scoring drive by the Bears made it a one-point game with 1:07 remaining. Then, a two-point conversion sealed it.  
  
“That was about as disappointing a loss as we’ve had,” Carroll said.  
  
Why?  
  
“It was our game to be had,” Carroll said. “We had the opportunity to win the football game, and we didn’t do it.”  
  
The Bears are an awful offensive football team on third down, yet they converted 7 of 14 of them Sunday. The final conversion was a jump ball on third-and-14 to former Seahawks tight end Jimmy Graham, who boxed out third-string cornerback John Reid in the end zone to cut the deficit to 24-23. The Bears are an awful red-zone team, yet they not only converted that play to Graham but also got a successful two-point conversion in the back of the end zone on a throw from Foles to receiver Damiere Byrd, who towered over a pair of Seattle defenders to secure the winning points.  
  
  
The Bears have one of the league’s worst scoring offenses and entered this matchup averaging 17.1 points a game. They scored 25 on Sunday, becoming the first team to score above their average against the Seahawks since Pittsburgh did so in Week 6.  
  
“It hurts,” said linebacker Jordyn Brooks, one of the two defenders guarding Byrd on the final play. “This game, we’re not supposed to lose.”  
  
The Seahawks are 5-10, owners of the third-worst record among the 16 NFC teams. They have a minus-1 point differential that, pending the Sunday night and Monday night games, ranks 17th in the league. The Seahawks rarely get blown out. Even in the double-digit losses to the Packers (17-0), Cardinals (23-13) and Rams (20-10), the games were effectively decided in the final moments. The narrow nature of the losses has, to some extent, prevented a sense of panic or friction inside the locker room.  
  
“We’re getting in these dogfights,” defensive lineman Carlos Dunlap said. “In Seahawks history, typically the ball bounces our way. This season, it hasn’t. Whether it’s us not making a play, us not closing the game, controversial calls, it’s been rotating what the issue is. Most importantly, I would love to just put the game away early and just finish the game and not let it come down to the wire.”  
  
But why Seattle continues to find ways to lose games — a characteristic of a bad football team, by the way — is the important part of the discussion.  
  
The Seahawks have a semi-reliable defense, though it’s susceptible to allowing points in two-minute situations, an issue that goes back multiple seasons. The offense is below average and couldn’t run the ball until December. Even on a day when Rashaad Penny ran for 135 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, the offense still couldn’t put the Bears away in the fourth quarter.",18.0,seahawks,t3_rpfx22,False,0.0,:old_logo:,2021-12-26T23:58:45Z,seahawks,-0.0049971985754744

18657,155143,155143,RCarson88,"The Seahawks are a weird team. With a lot of other franchises, it can be easy to point to one issue as the root cause of a teams failures, but this isn't the case for us. Some claim Russ hasn't been good enough, others say Pete is too conservative which holds back the team, and more people say that poor drafting has held back the team. I personally (to an extent) agree with the first two.

Wilson hasn't been great this year. Period. He hasn't had that Russell magic at all, which is evident by the fact that the Seahawks don't have a single 4th quarter comeback all season. However, it's difficult to pinpoint a reason as to why. Sure, outside fans may point at his mallet finger injury and leave it at that, but Wilson was very mediocre before his injury. Game tape shows that Wilson has missed a ton of open receivers, especially in the middle of the field. Waldron's scheme has done a fine job getting Wilson open men in both the quick and deep passing game, but there's been a failure to execute on Wilson's part, especially in the quick passing game.

These offensive struggles often get pinned on Carroll, who gets blamed for being too conservative on offense during critical moments. While this is true, I don't really blame him. Unless we're playing the Texans or Lions, the offense has been very inconsistent at best. Combine the poor offensive performance with Pete's defensive, pound-the-rock style of football, it only makes sense that the team doesn't play as risky as they should sometimes.

My conclusion is this: Even if Wilson is traded (which I highly doubt) and plays at a high level for his new team, I won't think any less of Pete Carroll as a head coach. Wilson is at the root of the offensive issues this year and Pete is simply doing his best with the hand he's been dealt with. The best case scenario for us is that Wilson adjusts to Waldron's scheme this off-season and comes back better than ever. As a result, Carroll will likely be more aggressive when it comes to 4th down calls which will help everyone move past the messiness that has come with all the Wilson trade rumors. However, even if this doesn't happen, Carroll's legacy remains the same, at least to me.",1.0,nfl,t3_rvmilw,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-01-04T01:55:16Z,seahawks,0.0006136195586139

If anything happens, it'll be Pete getting a position in the FO. Even that doesn't seem particularly likely to me. 

Besides, Wilson hasn't been good since week 6 or 7 of last year. He's been a liability for the most part, and as much as r/nfl likes to trash on the rest of the roster, that ""trash"" is what's giving this team a chance in every game this year. The defense in particular has been excellent considering they're on the field for 3/4 of every game. 

Wilson has missed a ton of easy completions, always goes for the deep sideline throw, and takes a TON of unnecessary sacks. Yes, the OL isn't the greatest, but he still has an average amount of time in the pocket relative to the rest of league. Now that he's older, Wilson can't rely on his legs as much as he used to, which hid most of his flaws. Many older quarterbacks have to master the quick passing game to move the chains, and it remains to be seen if Wilson can do that. If this year is any indication, Wilson isn't able to/refuses to do this.

2022 is clearly a rebuilding year so the cap hit isn't a big deal. It looks a lot better in 2023. The Adams trade isn't something I'm thrilled about, but if you look at what the picks turned into it brings it into perspective a bit. Also, yes he had a down year last year but he's been an all-pro caliber player throughout his career, not impossible he returns to form.

Lastly, regarding drafting that is fair for a good amount of our drafts in the past. There is a sense of optimism with this year's class. It's too early to tell but it's been pretty widely accepted as one of the league's stronger draft classes this year. Reports out of camp have been more positive than usual for a rookie class in Seattle.

After that interception, I was so disappointed just because I figured that was going to be the last time we saw that core group together. I so badly wanted them to go out on top... and it would have been badass to go back-to-back.

The good: Geno is capable of carrying this team, and aside from that interception (everyone was looking for a flag there), he performed as well as Wilson normally would. Having DK and Tyler helps too.  Collins performed admirably and wasn't a liability.

Defense:

The good: Diggs with yet another interception.

The bad: Defense played too soft, again. Teams know our zone and run defense is garbage, and they've taken advantage of it by eating up time. Where were the dime packages? Jamal could have blitzed on those. 

Overall: Seahawks is always good for an exciting game. The mantra of never playing a normal game still rings true. There goes the perfect record with all our alternates.  I was thinking we were gonna be 1-1 due to the short week, so I'm glad we didn't lose to SF.

We need help on the defensive side. Like badly.  The Rams always slings points against us, but defensive scheme wise, zone defense is just not happening right now.

Also, they picked up one of the top 2 RB's in the draft, some say the better of the two, in a position that is ACTUALLY needed, despite what media and pundits were expecting. Chris Carson is a sneeze away from paralysis, and Rashaad Penny has yet to stay healthy and play for an entire 16+ game season. Having the most elusive, highest yards after contact RB, in addition to an improved O-line to take pressure off the fill-in QB in Lock or Smith will be doing wonders.

The WR's they took in the 7th round have some incredible promise compared to other early round WR picks (come @ me in 1 year about how Bo Melton pans out)

That's also assuming that the NFL is a party to the contract (as opposed to just the raiders) or that they could be brought to court as a third party beneficiary to the contract which is a whole other issue,4.0,nfl,t3_qsko6x,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2021-11-12T20:36:41Z,seahawks,0.1261701067386831

On the same accord, an human that chooses not to get a vaccine, that would otherwise protect them, not only endangers themselves, but endangers others. While opponents of the vaccine state that the vaccine does not supply immunity, it can be argued that the vaccine is steadily increasing the speed of herd immunity across the world. A virus spread from a person who is unvaccinated will likely have serious side effects and destroy cells in the body, when it is spread to others, its virulence stays constant and will endanger others who are not protected or vaccinated. If a virus infects a person who is vaccinated and boosters against covid, the virus that they could potentially spread to others has been fundamentally weakened by the protected immune system. This means that when it is spread, it's effects won't be felt nearly as severely if the recipient of that transaction is also vaccinated. 



In short. The vaccine is what will relegate covid to a flu like issue in the future, once the majority of the world is vaccinated. Until then, it will continue to spread and develop within people who have no protection and those stronger strains will continue to effect society. 



So when you say your body, your choice. Sure. Whatever. But if you think that your choice to avoid a vaccine ethical in any way, or more ethical than a woman choosing to abort her fetus, then you are sorely mistaken. They are incomparable, a child potentially a life endangering commitment, one that has many physical, mental, social and financial consequences that can be detrimental.



The vaccine's potential consequences are exponentially less severe than that of bringing a child to term, only in specific cases should a vaccine not be received. Otherwise, you are simply a fool for not getting one while actively endangering society.

37705,328764,328764,totes-muh-gotes,"People still seem to overlook the most obvious catalyst that makes this scenario a reality: *Russ wants out*. 

It hasn't even been six months since all the trade rumor drama. People can dismiss it as nothing all they want. Doesn't change the fact that his camp released to the media, unsolicited, a list of teams he would agree to be traded to. Regardless of what one might think, that happened and its out there in the ether. In the minds of those involved. The thought has been explored.

And why wouldn't Russ want out? The one time in his entire career he was publicly critical of the team, it was regarding the quality of the famously not great Seattle oline. What does the FO do? They sign Gabe Jackson and resign injury addled Ethan Pocic. That was their solution this year to 'upgrade' the oline. And we've seen how that has worked so far. 

Moving on from Pete instead:

Thing is, unless Pete retires, he's almost certainly not going to be fired. There is basically nobody to do that. Jody Allen? Have you ever heard any involvement she has had with this team since she inherited it? Football is not her thing and that is cool. But she is basically the only person in this franchises hierarchy who could force Pete out. Why would she? One down season in a decade? Second most winning coach in that same time span in the league, most in franchise history...Most franchises would kill to have that. 

No matter what happens, this team is almost certainly headed for at least a soft rebuild next off season. Numerous contracts run out, aging players getting expensive and many have not played well enough to justify retaining. 

That includes Duane Brown, who's looked washed all season. Best decision this FO has made all year was not extend him or give into his little hold out. But hes not coming back next year. So we need a new LT. But hey, we'll just grab one in the first round of the draft--oh wait...We *should* be looking to upgrade center. They already passed on Creed Humphrey for Eskridge. But who knows if they will. 

This is largely why so many fans felt the **urgency** for this team to accomplish something meaningful past couple of seasons and why this season so very disappointing. We may not be able to just 'try again next year'--a sentiment I've seen many times on this sub. 

So you have to ask yourself: does Wilson, in the back end of his prime, maybe already out of it, want to hang around another year behind a crappy ""developing"" oline? He has said he wants to play into his forties. He is older, slower, less agile and now has sustained his first major injury that put him on ir...Is a mediocre oline good enough for him going forward?

Russ is due $37million next season. If traded, his dead cap is $26million. That's $11million saved right there. Then they could use that $12+million in this years cap they apparently are rolling over to halve that dead cap hit. Without any of that we'll a ton of cap room to spend next year. The trade would net multiple first round picks, change and players. Plenty of resources to rebuild a team. 

People keep talking about reverting to irrelevancy without Wilson. But teams have rebuilt and returned to being extremely competitive quickly. Rams and Niners did it within a couple of years rebuilding, going to the Superbowl with *Jared Goff and Jimmy Garappolo*, respectively. Think about that, proof in our own division that going to the Superbowl does not require a top level qb. Now winning one...that is a different discussion lol.

And none of this may happen! Frankly, I would not be surprised if Pete managed to keep the core gang together (miraculously) one more season. I would love Wilson to retire a Seahawk a decade from now, hands full of rings, riding off into the sunset...Still, fans *should* be prepared for big changes next off season, Russ leaving being one of them.

Meyers is becoming a Brian Walsh level liability. 3 misses (2fg and a pat) in four weeks. It is consistent enough to just expect him to miss something each week.

Keeping with hawks nest theory, I think this drama is about setting up an exit for next season, give the seahawks one more go to go on a real title run. More teams will have had a year to strategize and make offers. And the Seahawks will have had time to make contingencies. 

One thing I will say is that the last time this team went into a full rebuild, we went on to back to back superbowls, win our first ring and spend a decade as a top team in the league.
