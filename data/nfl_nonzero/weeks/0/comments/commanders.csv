656,7997,7997,Ajkrouse,"Aside from the whole ‚ÄúFire Dan Snyder‚Äù agreement, a new stadium should have:

- The ability to watch the game from anywhere along the concourse. Great sight lines to the field is key. Stadiums like Citizens Bank Park, Cowboys Stadium, Raiders Stadium, have all got great sight lines of the field from almost everywhere.

- Great local food and craft beer. Stadiums that focus on local cuisine and giving local restaurants a chance are awesome. They give a stadium personality and more food options than just the typical stadium food. Citi Field, Barclays Center, NRG Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium, etc.

- Incentive to tailgate. Stadiums with a great tailgate scene allow fans to go into the game happy. The tailgate is about camaraderie with friends and strangers and allow for a diverse set of people to come together for one common thing. Incentives could include lower parking fees for season ticket holders (free parking for season ticket holders of more than 10 years) and perhaps a points system that could be used for merchandise and other stadium experiences.

- Easy access to public transportation options. Metro and bus access is a must. Bonus if there‚Äôs boat access like Nats Park.

- Aesthetically pleasing architecture. I know this is one that isn‚Äôt talked about enough but you know a good looking stadium when you see one and it‚Äôs always because of the architecture. Camden Yards is an obvious example. The new stadium should feel like it is The National Stadium of America. Tie into the things that make the DMV great.

- The stadium needs to be privately funded. Snyder has plenty of money to pay for everything himself. Study after study has shown that stadiums are terrible public investments. The taxpayers financing them rarely want to pay for them. So why are state and local governments willing to subsidize them?

Decades of just losing is different from decades of losing, inappropriate workplace behavior, stadium falling apart, and ownership continuously fucking over the fans. Snyder grew up a fan of the franchise so most people would think, ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôll hire the best football staff and personnel so that the team has a great chance of winning since that‚Äôs what good leaders do.‚Äù Dan Snyder has been a drain on this franchise for 23 years! He took a storied franchise in a top 10 media market that was known for sellouts and as a tough place for away teams to play and made them into a franchise with the worst attendance, stadium, field, and fan experience in the country! 

I‚Äôm 37 so most of my childhood memories are pre-Snyder. I smile thinking back on the tailgates and watching games with my family and friends. Now I‚Äôm just indifferent to the team and, quite honestly, the NFL. 

Seeing the slow and painful downward spiral of this organization feels like watching the downward spiral of someone with a drug addiction. At first you say ‚Äúoh that was a small mistake. No big deal.‚Äù Then, as the years go by and the small mistakes start to add up to much bigger challenges, you grow more and more concerned about their wellbeing. You try to stop them but they just keep lying to you as if everything is under control. Eventually you start to lose control and lose your sense of caring for that person. You still love them but know that you can only lead a horse to water but can‚Äôt make them drink. 

At this point I‚Äôm married, have twins on the way, and no longer live in the DMV. Will I raise my kids to be Commanders fans? Probably not. Will I become a fan of the local football team because I will take my family to games? Most definitely.

The NFL will make money as long as there are fans willing to pay to attend games and advertisers willing to pay for being broadcast alongside them.  There's no reason at all to think that such revenue wouldn't continue after nationalization.  If anything, It'd be likely to increase, as a more ethically run, fan focused, NFL could likely become more popular after more people had more stake in it.

There are ethical concerns with the very existence of football as a sport.  But, as long as its still played, I see no good reason why NFL teams shouldn't be publicly owned, along with all other professional sports teams.

It's certainly something that's been well discussed by plenty of economists and policy makers who envisioned something well short of full socialism, let alone communism.

If they had to be compensated, they wouldn't, you could just direct some of the revenues for a while to pay for it.

I would expect players to make even more than before nationalization as the revenue would remain the same, if not grow,, but there'd be no need for owners to take the majority of it like they do now.

We'd also be able to use some of that extra money for better fan experiences and facilities.  Yet another argument for nationalization.

Parity in the NFL means that it would be relatively simple to impose a reasonable ethical and performance standard for NFL ownership.  You could even simply leave it up to the fans and players to vote every decade or so if they wanted to keep the current ownership group or try a new one.

It also works well for depth charts since Cam Sims would be his backup in the same way that Dyami is Terry's backup & Deandre Carter is the backup for Curtis Samuel. 

Washington has enough cap space to make major signings, re-sign key players, and pay Terry.

For now, all the 27-year-old can be is a shadow. He spent most of Tuesday morning‚Äôs practice, the first of organized team activities open to the media, standing beside defensive backs coach Chris Harris and simulating each rep. He hadn‚Äôt run much since suffering a season-ending Achilles‚Äô tear against Dallas last October, but he said he‚Äôs confident he‚Äôll be ready for Week 1.

Collins also said he knows that, even though his salary cap number is $16.9 million this season ‚Äî higher than every safety in the NFL other than Kansas City‚Äôs Tyrann Mathieu ($19.7 million) ‚Äî he‚Äôll have to compete to win back his old job.

Last season, seventh-round pick Kam Curl not only stepped in for Collins but outplayed him. Curl won fans with his instinctual play and blitzing prowess, and in March, a fan direct-messaged Collins on Instagram to ask if he‚Äôd move to linebacker. Collins replied, ‚ÄúNot happening my guy,‚Äù though a month later, Coach Ron Rivera said Collins had spoken for himself, not the team. Two weeks later, defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio told the team‚Äôs website he expected Collins to remain at strong safety.

‚ÄúI was just laughing at it,‚Äù Collins said of the linebacker speculation. ‚ÄúI was drafted as a safety, and that's where I was going to be. If somebody was to come talk to me about it, we would talk about it. That's about it. If we have packages to put me into play [at linebacker], I'm always open to it. I'd rather have us all DBs on the field anyway. The more DBs, the more merrier.‚Äù

A reporter asked Collins if, after seeing Curl last season, he wondered where he would fit in on defense.

‚ÄúNo sir, honestly,‚Äù Collins said, chuckling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy the way he played. He‚Äôs been playing excellent. He stepped into the position very well, and I‚Äôm proud of him. ... I‚Äôm getting older. He‚Äôs a younger guy, and the more he [learns] from me, and the more we learn from each other, the better we are as a defense.‚Äù

Last year, instability at safety was only one of Washington‚Äôs defensive issues. Regular breakdowns on the back end led to nine plays of 50-plus yards allowed, the league‚Äôs second-highest total. Now, both safety spots remain unsettled ‚Äî Deshazor Everett, Jeremy Reaves and McCain could compete at free safety, while Collins and Curl compete at strong safety ‚Äî and finding the right pairing is key.

For his part, Collins believes his steady rehab will give him a chance to win back his job. He said he works with doctors in Florida, Louisiana and New Jersey ‚Äúat least three or four days a week.‚Äù He has tried blood-flow restriction training, a method former quarterback Alex Smith relied on, and worked with House of Athletes in Miami to regain running form. He has isolated his injured left leg by jumping off tables, landing on it and jumping off it again. He described the recovery as grueling but gratifying.

‚ÄúAm I afraid [of reinjury]? No,‚Äù Collins said, adding, ‚ÄúIf you would see me, bro, all the things I do that's not being shown on the field right now, I have all the confidence in the world.‚Äù

Yet even before he got hurt last season, Collins had struggled. He missed nine tackles in the first six weeks, tied for third most among all defenders, according to Sportradar.

But Collins said he has a renewed drive. He sounded wistful recalling how he could only watch Washington‚Äôs playoff loss to Tampa Bay. He felt like he could have given the team a better chance to win because he knew the Buccaneers‚Äô coaching staff and offensive weapons.

‚ÄúIt just hurt me [not to be out there],‚Äù Collins said. ‚ÄúI know that, if I was on the field, it would've just made it 10 times better because, for me, knowledge is key.‚Äù

Now, he knows his big plan of helping the team return to the playoffs starts with little steps such as the ones he took while mirroring the strong safety snap to snap. Afterward, Collins said he felt close to a real return.

‚ÄúBeing back on the field, being able to run, jump, jog ‚Äî all type of things they had me doing in there ...‚Äù he said, trailing off. ‚ÄúI feel great. I feel strong. I feel like myself again.‚Äù",28.0,commanders,t3_nllkwy,False,0.0,:Rhelmet:,2021-05-26T11:50:13Z,commanders,0.0093588892743976

Guys like Willis (and Mahomes and Allen) have always had superior athleticism to lean on and been hugely successful with that.

We‚Äôre in a great spot in that we could go into the season with Heinicke as the starter and ease in Willis once he‚Äôs ready.

‚ÄãThe Rams moved cities.  The Browns moved to Baltimore but are legally an expansion team in technicalities.

> So, if we want to draw a direct correlation between those Browns and the success of the Ravens, why did it take so much longer for the Ravens to see success than it did these 'true' expansion teams? What gives? Why does the Browns having 1 good season in the 5-6 years prior to disbanding have anything to do with the Ravens winning a superbowl many years later? I get we wanna be bleeding hearts for these guys, but give me a break haha. We're an expansion team and nothing that happened in Cleveland helped us with our first winning season, which took longer than OTHER expansion teams to get.

Jags had success because Brunell was a stud, Coughlin could coach.  Ravens finally found success after years of drafting well with a front office that was in place prior to the move to Baltimore.

16698,132923,132923,Professor_Nincompoop,"Overall I like what we accomplished in the draft. 

Dotson - fits our system well.  He is a refined, versatile, speedy receiver with crazy good hands and the ability to separate.  His game is very similar to Olave except he is a little smaller but has better body control.  He should be able to swap between the Z and Y positions with Curtis Samuel giving Turner yet another weapon that he can shift around pre snap in order to take advantage of defenses.

Mathis - a solid DT.  I can see why Washington had him high on their board.  He was probably third best NT behind Davis and Jones on most boards but he is more versatile than Jones and could see snaps as a 3 tech as well.   The guy was a team captain, showed consistent effort and technique and should prove to be an improvement over Payne when it comes to 2 gap responsibilities and keeping guards off of LBs.  Rivera has reportedly said that he thinks Mathis is the type of DT that can be a special sauce for this Defense and help make the LBs and Safetys better as a result. 

Robinson - I think he will lead this team in carries at seasons end.  He might not have flashy ankle breaking moves or homerun speed but he does everything well.  He is a solid, skilled RB with excellent vision, physical toughness and the ability to contribute as a blocker right away which further frees things up for Turner with pre snap adjustments.  People might have been scratching their head at this pick but Gibson fumbles way to often, has injury issues and was one of the worst starters in the league in Rushing yards over expected which weighs the impact of the offensive line.  If Robinson can improve in those areas our entire team will benefit.

Butler - I knew next to nothing about him pre-draft but Rivera and a few others certainly seem high on him.  He is clearly a plus athlete who played well coming out of a complex defensive scheme which bodes well for him transitioning to the next level.  The staff seems to think he can play all three safety positions and his ability on special teams is a plus.  

Howell - I never really saw it with this guy but as a fifth round pick it is worth a shot developing him

Turner - My expectations are very tempered with him.  He is basically a big body contested catch guy.  He doesn‚Äôt offer much as a blocker and played almost exclusively from the slot which limits him a bit but he should be able to take on a Ricky Seals-Jones type of role on the depth chart.  

Paul - he is a big ball of clay.  Tulsa does a great job recruiting top notch athletes but a shit job of coaching them up and properly developing them.  Hopefully Matsko can work some magic on him, if not he will likely end up on the practice squad.

Holmes - Another good athlete who needs to be coached up.  The team took some very safe (high floor) players with their first 4 picks and took two high upside/low floor guys in the seventh.  Our need for CB depth helps his chances of making the team.",1.0,commanders,t3_ujr4fm,False,0.0,:BurgundyW:,2022-05-06T18:23:48Z,commanders,0.0202063643066829

Kam Curl, Percy Butler, Jamin Davis, Cole Holcomb and Khaleke Hudson can all fit that role situationally and are already on the roster. 

Fuller can play nickel as well but doesn‚Äôt have the same abilities as the guys above when it comes to playing against the run.

Not true, we used Buffalo nickel formations from the get go.  Prior to Collins taking on the role Kam Curl and Kevin Pierre-louis were used in this role. 

>Well Collins is gone, and I expect the Buffalo nickel to be relegated to a sub package and most of our defensive snaps be played in a 4-2-5 nickel using a slot CB or 3rd S.

The Buffalo Nickel package is a 4-2-5 look.

As for the draft there are a couple intriguing options.  We could opt for a high end returner who can also serve a role on offense or defense the top guys in that respect are Calvin Austin who is an undersized but very fast WR capable of contributing to our offense right away as a deep threat.  There is also Marcus Jones a Cornerback out of Houston who might be the best returner in this class and could contribute as a Slot corner in Nickel or Dime packages.  Both could be there when we select in the 4th round.  

There are also returner only options such as Velus Jones (Tennessee) who was an all SEC returner with 4.3 speed who could probably be had in the 6th round and less explosive options like Britain Covey (Utah) and Jequez Ezzard (Sam Houston) who can probably be had as priority free agents.  

People talking about our first round pick being used on a WR that can also fill the returner role are misguided.  Only Wilson and Burks have any experience in the return game and neither was explosive enough to warrant splitting their focus from their WR responsibilities.

18440,147100,147100,Salty_Orchid,"If you are a franchise hunting for a franchise QB, it is better to draft multiple QBs in rounds 2-4 than ever draft a QB in the first round. Here is why?

1)The odds of any QB pick being a bust are much greater than them being a franchise pro bowl caliber QB (Leaf, JaMarcus Russell, Patrick Lynch, Jake Locker, Manzel, Rosen, Tebow, Haskins, etc)

2)The odds of any QB simply being serviceable back up or a bridge QB (not worth having used a 1st round pick) instead of a franchise pro bowl caliber QB is even higher (Daniel Jones, Blaine Gabbert, David Carr, Josh Freeman, Trubisky, etc)

3)Most important, by drafting a QB in the first round, you have locked your franchise into a commitment to a person you have never seen play at the NFL level for at least 3 to 4 seasons. This involves bringing in free agents and drafting around them, hiring and firing coaches, changing schemes to fit their talent or lack there of. No matter how they look in the combine or at the college level, you never know if college was the kids peak performance with no ability to bump it up to the next level or not. It is an all in gamble which can set your franchise back for 5 years.

4)Drafting a QB in round 2 or lower allows you the political capital to simply move off him if he doesn't show signs of being the 'It' guy. Almost every QB you can tell if they have it or not even as early as the first few months of camp. There is a reason why the Nagy was hesitant to play Fields and the 49ers to play Lance, while the Chiefs couldn't wait to get Mahommes on the field.

- Injuries: Another issue with Julio is his injury history, but our WR room would allow that to not hamper our offense too much if he missed time again this year. Having him as a starter would allow Samuel/Dotson to share slot duties and step into starting roles should Julio get hurt. 

- Mentorship: Julio would be a great mentor to our young receivers to show them how to be professionals and more likely to become impact players down the road.

2) In 2003, elite running backs still had significant value. The league wasn‚Äôt as pass-oriented as it is now. Only one team passed for over 4000 yards while 11 teams rushed for over 2000. Compare that to this year when 14 teams passed for more than 4000 yards and only eight rushed for at least 2000. Fifteen years ago, a great running back was worth a lot more than he is today.

Not only was he approved to take on more debt, but the NFL lent him the money (this has actually been reported). My theory says that within the loan, there is an agreement for Snyder to sell within 5 years.

Here's why I think this makes sense:

Most of the owners hate Dan. But all of them realize that he's bad for business. The NFC East contains 4 top 10 media markets. Thus having 4 successful franchises to parade around on SNF is good for business. Having Dan in charge is an opportunity cost for the league.

But a forced sale is ugly. Other owners probably have skeletons in their closet, although not as ugly as Dan's. Owners, and therefore Goddell are wary of forcing the sale.

The large buyout deal was a win for all parties. It gave Dan a huge valuation. It's also a comp (think real estate deals) for all 31 other franchises. It also facilitates the sale, as one owner would be involved.

By delaying the sale, it also allows Danny to soothe his fragile ego.

He played better as his rookie season went along, racking up four sacks, five tackles for loss and eight quarterback knockdowns over his final six games. It was fair to expect him to make a stratospheric leap last season.
Instead, it was a lost year. Young had 1.5 sacks and just four quarterback knockdowns across nine games before¬†tearing his right ACL. Advanced metrics were a little more optimistic, as Young's 18.9%¬†pass rush win rate¬†would have ranked as one of the 20 best among edge rushers if he had played enough to qualify, but he was supposed to have an star-turning season. He did not.
I'm optimistic for 2022. We have a meaningful sample of Young playing at an extremely high level, both at Ohio State and during his rookie campaign. We have a recent example of a Defensive Rookie of the Year returning from a torn ACL in his sophomore campaign to produce a big third season, as¬†Nick Bosa¬†did for the 49ers a year ago. We also have at least some reason to believe Young might be unlocked by better coaching, given that the Commanders just¬†fired defensive line coach Sam Mills¬†during the opening days of training camp.

Redskins in reference to Native Americans can definitely be said in a racist way to disparage and group a people by a physical characteristic. But it can also be used to unite a group and be a stand in for representation. 

Basically what we have here is a point of perspective. Most NAs didn't consider the term racist, but some did, I think you can see that with Latinx and other terms. But to a non NA describing someone by their skin color tends to be racist.  So if you judge how others feel from your perspective only, a term like Redskin can absolutely come off as disrespectful and bigoted. But if you judge the term by how someone else sees it, you can make a different judgment. 

A funny example I have is when I was living in Malawi referring to someone by their skin color wasn't racist at all. And part of our conversation would be to ask for the ""black price"" (local price) for a good rather than being ripped off as a tourist. The way I spoke if translated to English and put in the US would have been racist for sure, but judging my words from thr Malawian perspective it wasn't.

Another way to judge would be the market. Carson was worth a first and a third last year on the open market, and 2 thirds this year (potentially a third and a second).

*Per Wikipedia:*

Prior to his professional wrestling career, Layfield was a collegiate American football coach for Trinity Valley Community College and player for Abilene Christian University. At Abilene, Layfield was a two-year starter on the offensive line and was named first-team All-Lone Star Conference as a junior and senior. Layfield signed with the Los Angeles Raiders as an undrafted free agent, but was released before the 1990 season began. Layfield did play in the World League of American Football, starting all ten games of the 1991 season at right tackle for the San Antonio Riders, wearing jersey number 61. Former Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett was the quarterback of that team.

On Sunday Night Heat right before Survivor Series 1998, Bradshaw teamed alongside former Nation of Domination leader Faarooq to form the tag team of the Acolytes, managed by the Jackyl. Their main gimmick was that of a dark duo known for their unrepentant savagery against their opponents, occult symbols painted on their chest and the Necronomicon ""gate of Yog-Sothoth"" pentagram symbol on their black tights. After the Jackyl left the WWF, Faarooq and Bradshaw joined The Undertaker's new Ministry of Darkness. The Ministry went on to feud with the Corporation. As part of the Ministry, Bradshaw feuded with Ken Shamrock. The two stables would soon unite as the Corporate Ministry, but disbanded after Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Undertaker at Fully Loaded. When the Undertaker went on hiatus in September, Bradshaw and Faarooq's dark gimmick faded.

On the May 31, 1999 episode of Raw Is War, the Acolytes (still with the Corporate Ministry) won their first WWF Tag Team Championship by defeating Kane and X-Pac. On the July 5 episode of Raw Is War, they dropped the titles to the Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) before defeating the Hardyz and their manager Michael ""P.S."" Hayes at Fully Loaded for their second WWF Tag Team Championship. On the August 9 episode of Raw Is War, they lost the titles to Kane and X-Pac.

The duo became fan favorites and changed their gimmick to that of cigar-smoking bar brawlers for hire. In jeans and T-shirts, Faarooq and Bradshaw became the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA), with a motto of ""because we need beer money."" The duo was often seen in the backrooms of arenas with a poker table and later a framed doorway comically in the middle of the often large, open aired hallways.",2.0,nfl,t3_o2n16k,False,0.0,:Commanders: Commanders,2021-06-18T10:01:18Z,commanders,7.36466141863681e-05

If they run it there and get stopped, they have to burn the timeout on 3rd down. That almost forces them to throw on 3rd with no timeouts left; if they run again and get stuffed they‚Äôll be cutting it awfully close to get back in formation and have a play ready to go for 4th down.

They ran a pick play with an inside slant route for Lockette. Browner and Butler recognize the play, and Browner swaps assignments with Butler telling him to get over the top and beat Lockette while he takes care of Kearse.

Now here‚Äôs where the actual problem is. Kearse fails to pick Butler cause Browner absolutely stones him at the line. Butler is free to slide in and beat Lockette to the punch. Lockette needs to do two things at this point:

Run with absolute authority to the point of where the ball is going to be placed

Catching the pass needs to be secondary here, you have two more chances which is why you ran this play to begin with

Instead, Butler basically roadblocks Lockette and blows him completely off the point. And here‚Äôs where the other main part of the criticism comes in: what a AWFUL throw by Russ. This ball needs to be low and slightly behind Lockette; basically Butler should have no chance at the pick. It should be placed where Lockette has one of 3 options (catch, knock it down, let it hit the ground) assuming he didn‚Äôt get blown off his route, which he did. Basically, the worst (and least probable) outcome happened because the Pats were prepared, Lockette ran with no conviction (and I hate saying that, he seems to be a good dude that has his career cut short, unfortunately), and Wilson threw a garbage pass.

[[Paras](https://twitter.com/matthew_paras/status/1516084241611825159?s=21&t=nkFWtm0WLKBcvfuURuRyzA)] The Commanders say last week's letter from the Oversight Committee relies on information from a disgruntled employee that ""sets forth easily and fully rebuttable allegations.""

[[Paras](https://twitter.com/matthew_paras/status/1516084246280032259?s=21&t=nkFWtm0WLKBcvfuURuRyzA)] For instance, Friedman told the committee that Washington withheld up to $162,360 in ticket revenue and diverted it to a Navy-Notre Dame football game. But the team says then CFO Stephen Choi forwarded Friedman's email to accountants who placed it properly in team revenues:

(\*McLaurin a 3rd rounder; DK Metcalf, A.J. Brown, Deebo Samuel all picked in the second.)

Now then...

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516038253291446272?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] Both sides have some leverage in these talks. Franchise tag for the team. For the player, skipping OTA, etc.

Pushing for a trade is the ultimate leverage for the player, but nothing like that is mentioned in this report.

One interpretation is the exact opposite.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516038663045632013?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] Schefter tweets that McLaurin is showing for this initial part of the program, ""as a team leader.‚Äù Why bother showing for gym reps and X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs basics if you want out?

Don‚Äôt dismiss that quote either. It‚Äôs insight into how his side sees these negotiations.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516039009402818565?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] That worldview likely goes like this: All of these receivers are dynamic pass catchers. Terry McLaurin is more. McLaurin is on the team posters as a face of the franchise and probably the one-seed if forced to pick a single player.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516039877850288132?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] 17 is also a tone-setter, the guy coaches tell other players to emulate on and off the field. That‚Äôs different from even more established receivers like Tyreek Hill. There‚Äôs currency there. His agent will make these points.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516040318080196617?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] As for the money, the WR market exploded this offseason. It also helped define the eventual price point for these 2019 receivers. We‚Äôre not debating some massive spread on the AAV. It's in the $20-25M range AAV in terms of real figures. Good times.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516041746614001664?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] Hill reset the market with a deal that at its core is $25M AAV for 3 years. D.J. Moore AAV is $20.6M. These 2019 receivers are in between, and probably closer to the $23-24M range is my guess. Perhaps debate over years, structure, total GTD, but several new guideposts exist.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516042257929019396?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] Assuming Rivera maintains the stance of declining any trade offer for 17, only issue I see from the team side is budgetary restrictions from ownership. I asked Rivera about the lack of FA moves at the owners‚Äô meetings and he said they‚Äôre just being mindful of the salary cap. OK.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516042489068670976?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] The team already created cap space this offseason. More coming when Landon Collins‚Äô contract comes off the books post-June 1. Any new deal for McLaurin kicks in next year, but financial planning starts now. Also, have to sign more players, and Daron Payne is up for an extension.

\[[Bullock](https://twitter.com/MarkBullockNFL/status/1432683116959870977?s=20)\] The other potential way around this is the buffalo nickel package.

30828,238704,238704,goooseJuice,"LANDOVER, Md. ‚Äî What would it take to have the best-in-class playing surface at the practice facility and at FedEx Field, Washington Football Team coach Ron Rivera and team president Jason Wright asked Chris Bloyer.  
Bloyer, the team‚Äôs senior vice president of operations, turned to Pete Benevento, the director of grounds and turf, and vendor Carolina Green to discuss what that would entail and come up with a budget.  
In all, they informed Rivera and Wright that it would take approximately two months to complete a reconstruction that would allow Washington to have the best playing surface in the NFL. The two approached team owners Dan and Tanya Snyder, and Bloyer said the Snyders ‚Äúenthusiastically approved the renovations, improvements and investments.‚Äù  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a significant investment for the good of our players and team ‚Äî and the business in general,‚Äù Bloyer said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nearly $4.5 million into it, and lots of sweat from Pete and his team. And I think we have an outstanding outcome. Just really excited to see how this performs this year. Something like the Chargers, then followed by the Giants four days later (to start of the season) ‚Äî this is going to perform excellent for that. It‚Äôs really going to hold up and provide the drainage and firmness and footing that you need to turn around like that.‚Äù  
Wright has seen some of the progress since the renovation began on May 17, but Rivera‚Äôs first time seeing the surface will be on Friday afternoon, when the team travels to FedEx Field for a ‚ÄúFriday Night Lights‚Äù-style practice in front of fans. Benevento, who is heading into his 12th season with the team, said with a chuckle that he‚Äôs not nervous for the coach and players to get their first look at the new field.  
In fact, Benevento said, his excitement is ‚Äúquite high‚Äù heading into the practice. But how will he feel when he sees the field? He‚Äôll reserve that thought for once the session is over.  
‚ÄúUntil I see it get beat up, then I can be proud of it,‚Äù Benevento said. ‚ÄúIt looks great. It feels great. Seeing it perform is when I‚Äôm going to be the most proud ‚Äî when I see it takes the abuse of an NFL season.‚Äù  
What exactly does it take to make a field state of the art and the leader in its class?  
The heating system remained, but there‚Äôs a new drainage and irrigation system, with 3/4-inch corrugated pipes that run the length of the field. They connected them to two 6-inch header lines on both sides of the field that tie into a main 24-inch line leading to the sewer system.  
The surface was built with a type of sand that meets USGA standards for durability and was tested at Penn State to make sure it provided the right bridging over the perforated pipes. Next came a two-inch layer of sod, a type known as NorthBridge Bermuda grass. Arriving in rolls that weighed one ton and measured 3 1/2 feet wide and 45 feet long, the sod was pushed together to ensure there were no seams or gaps with a machine known as a SideKick. Although the team ripped out the old surface, Rivera remains partial to natural grass over artificial turf.  
Benevento said he calls groundskeepers with other teams that use Bermuda grass, some as far west as Kansas City and as far south as Charlotte, at least once a month to discuss issues with their playing surfaces. Every March, all 32 grounds crews convene for three days to discuss their team‚Äôs fields. They share that information because they also share the same end goal: Making sure players are safe.  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs million-dollar people out here, so you want to make it perfect for them,‚Äù said Tevin Howard, one of Washington‚Äôs groundskeepers. ‚ÄúEvery line, every hash mark, every number, to even the logos and helmets, I want them to look at it, like, ‚ÄòWow, this is what the NFL is like.‚Äô When they see that field, and they‚Äôre standing there, and the coaches come out, and they‚Äôre standing at center field shaking their hands, that‚Äôs what I like to look forward to. Adding to the experience about that, having a good playing field, having a good game, it all goes hand in hand.‚Äù  
The grounds crew has heard the criticism surrounding the maintenance and performance of the playing surface over the last 24 years. It was the first time since the stadium opened in 1997 that the field has had a major facelift, and the organization wanted to make sure its field rivals the best of what the league has to offer.  
Thanks to the renovation of the practice fields over the winter, Benevento and his crew already have an idea what could need tinkering. They‚Äôve been watching those fields closely after the opening days of training camp, and because the fields are made of the same grass, what they learn in Ashburn can be applied toward maintenance at FedEx Field.  
One player who is especially excited about testing out the new fields on Friday is kicker Dustin Hopkins, whom Benevento has kept in the loop about the work they‚Äôre doing. Hopkins relies on a firm surface for his plant foot, and if there are divots or seams where he attempts to kick field goals, or where punter Tress Way will hold the ball, it could spell disaster.  
‚ÄúI look for thick grass, like good growth,‚Äù Hopkins said. ‚ÄúSomething that‚Äôs not patchy. Look for something that drains well, because all too often, I felt like the field did not drain that well in the past. And then, I guess, consistent throughout. I think sometimes you‚Äôll catch seams, like even when the grass is new. I might have to move the spot to avoid hitting a seam and then slipping. So, it‚Äôs things like that, (things) probably nobody would think about.  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going there Friday. I‚Äôm appreciative that (Pete) even would ask me ‚Äî I think it‚Äôs awesome. ‚Ä¶ Every now and then I‚Äôll be like, ‚ÄòHey, if you can, don‚Äôt put a seam on the hash‚Äô or whatever. And I realize you might not be able to, because man, when you‚Äôre dealing with grass at that level ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even know the numbers, but I bet (it‚Äôs) a multi-million-dollar project for sure.‚Äù  
Even though Washington‚Äôs lease at FedEx Field is up after the 2027 season, and there are talks about building a new stadium, that‚Äôs in the future. The team didn‚Äôt want to wait at least six seasons to make the change.  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre investing in the business across the board now,‚Äù Bloyer said. ‚ÄúWe are not holding off until some future project to open TBD. We have a season that starts in a couple of weeks, and we have a few years left here regardless. And we‚Äôre investing in the now to make it better now, to try and win championships now.‚Äù",21.0,commanders,t3_oymi0n,False,0.0,üê∑ Major Tuddy: Top 0.1% on OF ü•µ,2021-08-05T12:38:57Z,commanders,0.0170980394398585

3. He‚Äôs coming off his worst year by most metrics (games played, YPG - which, is worth pointing out, was still AMAZING at over **85 yards per game** - more than Terry managed).

4. Based on what I‚Äôve read on the Athletic, the market seems fairly limited. Lots of teams might *want* him, sure, but how many would he make sense for is a smaller number.

Compared to Route 7 to Ashburn, 95 is a much better option for driving.  It's a major 4 lane interstate plus HOV lanes.

I would bet that Dan Snyder has a research firm working to determine where the fan base actually resides.  Developers do ton' of studies before building anything of this size and cost.  They can map out what fans buy merch, tickets, pay for TV coverage and tons of other indicators.  I guarantee they have a heat map of credit card zip codes from ticket purchases.

Personally, I'd guess that a bigger chunk of fans lives in VA then in MD.  They could pretty easily estimate which area lends itself to higher ticket sales.  I know my family would automatically buy season tickets if the stadium ends up in Loudon or Prince William.

The reality of Prince William would be somewhere in Woodbridge.  The opposite side of the county by 66 is full of NIMBY's, and there are large areas of protected civil war battlefields.  They killed Disney's plans for a park there in the 90's, they would 100% shoot down an NFL stadium.  Which *fortunately* means 66 is most likely off the table.  

One benefit of being off 95 is the reversible HOV lanes.

(yes I know that was in NJ, but whatever)

WMATA doesn't have a say in where the stadium goes, but the states (and DC) do.  Virginia has a big incentive to put the stadium out in the suburbs with a toll road leading to it.  95, 66, and 267 all bring in major tax dollars for the state.  My unpopular opinion is that those roads wouldn't actually be that bad on gamedays, you just have to assume you'll be using the fast lanes and factor that into your ticket price.

I think from a strategic standpoint, putting it way out in VA is more in the center of the fanbase.  Maryland is the furthest north you have large pockets of Washington fans.

38953,304989,304989,wtf703,"There's no way that complicated round logo could fit as an embroidered patch on the back of the jersey at that size.  If there's a logo in that circle, its much more simple than the one on the paper in that photo.  Probably just the W.

There are strict standards for embroidery sizing, it simply wouldn't work.  Embroidered text is recommended to at least be 0.20"" high.  No way would all those details work.

It would have to be a sublimated design embedded into the fabric ([like the all over prints you see in racing shirts on a silky fabric](https://racerink.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Sublimated-Racing-Shirts-TechSport-Racing.png))  HOWEVER even that type of printing has its limits at such a small size.  Something 2""-3"" high would need to be much more simple.
