Losing to the SB champs by 7 in the 4th qtr.

Competitive with the niners, kind of.

Our Defense was non existent. Especially with the lead  2 minute before the half and the final 2 minutes.

We have new offensive minded coaches who are modern and not set on what worked in the 90's. 

They have added new defensive players, plus Danielle is back and a new scheme. 

I think we will have a better more dominant Offense. And we have improved our Defense. If we between improved Defense and more consistent Offense improve by 4 pts a game last year we are undefeated. I know it doesn't work that way, but I do believe Cowherd is right.

One being our defense fell completely apart. One reason was Hunter being out for the season. Also, Kendrix missing games at the end when we were making a run. We lost to the two the two SB teams by a combined total of 10 points. We were close to winning in several other games with good teams. Many of those problems have been addressed. Hunter is back, hopefully for a full season. We have added several FA to our defense that I think improve us. Last year it became clear how bad Zimmer has been. Not talking to his QB, or his GM, ruling by fear, bad time management, trying to farm out OC to anyone, nepotism. 
So long story short. I think we have improved our defense. I think we have also improved our OL. I think we have improved our coaching and front office. For all of this, before the season starts, I feel optimistic.

In the 6 seasons that Cousins has been a starter the teams he was on went 49-45. He was on 4 teams with a winning record, barely. The winning teams he was on averaged a little over 1 game above .500. 10-6 for us in 2019 was the best team he was on. 

Now if you are going to blame those winning seasons entirely on him, I guess he sucks. But IMHO he has never had a complete team around him.

But these statements are rich with context lmfao. The Vikings defense regressed after 2017 and we fired our horrible OC mid year. The last two years we’ve had bottom five defenses and a head coach who was stuck in the 90s. Without Kirk last year we win 4 games. Context is important but is also prone to bias. 

>	The “eye test” and taking account for context is a lot better than reading a stat sheet where you don’t even need to watch a single snap of football.

The “eye test” is subjective and is susceptible to bias. In a relatively close debate like Cousins-Carr, stats are an unbiased way of looking at it and Kirk dominates him in that area.

9723,56764,56764,GUMP20,"I gotcha on the contract situation playing a role in him missing the season. Didn’t know that.

Of course teams will be lining up to pay Deshaun, but I don’t think the situations are comparable. Deshaun has made it very clear he wants out of Houston because of organizational disfunction, not money. He also played last season at an incredibly high level despite his team having little success. If he sits out, his value will remain the same because he would presumably be healthy and would have only missed 1 season.

Danielle would be missing two straight seasons, one partially due to a neck injury that required surgery. Even if the contract played a role in his absence, you’re still taking a substantial risk if you’re a team looking to sign him for top end $. His value will be at its lowest if he decides to take this route. It’s a lose-lose situation.

What you’re also not taking into account is 
1.	He doesn’t play, he doesn’t get paid his current deal in full
2.	Even if he did sit out this year, he’s still under contract with us for another 2 seasons lol. 

IMO sitting out this year is not an option for him. It is not beneficial to him, his agent, his career, the Vikings or anyone. He can play these offseason games all he wants to try and get the Vikings to bite, but at the end of the day the Vikings know they have the power & leverage in this situation, which is why Rick has been adamant that discussions are not taking place.",1.0,minnesotavikings,t3_m16kzv,False,0.0,canada,2021-03-09T12:43:32Z,minnesotavikings,0.009792693322846

9725,56767,56767,GUMP20,"How do you know his contract played such a big role in him missing the season? 

Regardless, I think why he sat out last year is irrelevant. The fact that he missed a full season of football does not help him in negotiations even considering how bad our pass rush looked. 

The only bit of leverage he has is sitting out another season. I’ll say it again, Goodluck with that. Do you honestly think a team is going to pay him in the $20-$25M APY range after not playing for 2 years, especially with a neck injury? He’s an elite pass rusher, but he’s not like prime Von Miller or JJ Watt status, and no one thinks he is. 

This is also COVID cap times and the team is strapped for cash to begin with. Rick and Zim have a better chance of keeping their jobs if hunter plays  on his current deal and those extra resources are allocated elsewhere for this season. I’d be willing to bet they force his hand and make him either play this season under his current contract or sit out again. Prove you’re worth the 20-25 mill after a year off and we will give you that. I could even see a deal being done mid season, just not before. 

If his agent advises he sit out again then that agent should be investigated for gross negligence. That does nothing but decrease his value and raise question marks over his health, priorities, character, etc. The man is under contract for three more seasons and this is the NFL. Players don’t win these battles, especially coming off missed time.",1.0,minnesotavikings,t3_m16kzv,False,0.0,canada,2021-03-09T12:10:03Z,minnesotavikings,-0.0041346258390929

Hunter has 0 leverage in this situation. He’s coming off a neck injury that caused him to miss a FULL season. He also has multiple years left on his contract. If he wants to sit out this year, fine. See what your value is after two years of not playing a snap of football. We would be very stupid to pay him more right now especially given our cap situation.

I bet Rick is telling him and his agent that if he proves he’s healthy and plays like his usual self next year we will pay him next offseason. That is the smart thing to do.

15366,102215,102215,Nijo32,"I'd rank the coaching hires as follows:

1) Brian Daboll, NYG: not only has he come up in the Belichick and Saban coaching trees, but he's been the driving force in developing Josh Allen, an extremely raw prospect, into an MVP-caliber QB. I also really like the coaching staff he's put together, with Wink Martindale, Mike Kafka, and Andre Patterson. 

2) Doug Pederson, JAX: while I personally preferred an up-and-coming candidate for the Vikings, Pederson is a great fit in Jacksonville, as he'll provide the stability the franchise desperately needs. I would have loved to see things work out with Byron Leftwich, though.

3) Kevin O'Connell, MIN: the Rams winning the Super Bowl only helps the perception of the O'Connell hire, but I think this was a great fit regardless. The Vikings needed a fresh start with a priority on adapting to the modern game, and O'Connell is a bold hire to seek out this strategy. Combining the McVay offense and the Fangio/Staley defensive schemes is a swing at the latest and greatest strategies in a copycat league, my only hope is that the staff is capable of its own innovation.

4) Josh McDaniels, LV: I have my hesitations with McDaniels after his stint in Denver and what he pulled on Indy, but if he were ever going to get another shot, the way Las Vegas has orchestrated it is the way to go. Pairing McDaniels with Dave Ziegler as GM is a full committal to the ""Patriots way"", and I really liked their hire of Pat Graham as DC.

5) Nathaniel Hackett, DEN: I'm not as infatuated with Hackett as others, but I can at least see the vision here. Denver is swinging for the fences on landing Rodgers or another franchise-caliber QB, and wants a coach in place who can turn around an underperforming offense that is loaded with skill players. If Rodgers remains in Green Bay and Denver is unable to land a difference maker at QB, this hire could be doomed from the start.

6) Dennis Allen, NO: Allen is such a boring hire, but ultimately I get it. The Saints have been competitive, and their defense was downright nasty for much of 2021. With a unique situation due to Payton ""retiring"" and not a complete overhaul, Allen makes sense if their goal is to remain competitive with the same core.

7) Mike McDaniel, MIA: This one is the toughest to evaluate by far, and will be judged under intense scrutiny due to the Flores lawsuit. Evaluating in a vacuum, McDaniel is an intriguing but unproven candidate, and I worry that Miami's roster as currently constructed is a poor fit for what he wants to do. Patience will be critical, as I think Flores was getting this roster to overperform and regression is likely if they don't fix the OL.

8) Matt Eberflus, CHI: I don't think Eberflus is a bad coach, but this is such an odd time to hire him. The Colts collapsed in the clutch, and there were better defensive candidates available to hire if Chicago was deadset on that approach. However, I think the fatal flaw here is pairing Justin Fields with a defensive HC; Chicago needs to fully commit to him as the franchise, or else they'll find themselves searching for his replacement sooner rather than later.

9) Lovie Smith, HOU: What more can be said about Houston? This organization is a complete disaster. They clearly want to hire Josh McCown as HC despite his lack of experience, and continue to roll out lame duck candidates until they get enough PR to back it. The way they waited and waited to hire a coach, and ultimately settled for promoting Lovie who was already on their staff, makes me question what's going on behind the scenes.

15428,102290,102290,Nijo32,"From what I've read from MN and LA beat writers (and not the national outlets), O'Connell will pull heavily from the Sean McVay and Brandon Staley coaching trees. I could still see an old acquaintance like Mike Pettine get a look at DC, but I personally think it would be awkward for a former HC to work underneath one of his old assistants who is much younger than him. My current guess at a staff would be:

**HC: Kevin O'Connell**  
**OC / Run Game Coordinator: Thomas Brown, Rams RB Coach / Assistant HC / Run Game Coordinator** \- Received a HC interview from Miami this year, gives good balance between run and pass expertise. Wes Phillips (Rams TE Coach / Pass Game Coordinator) and Liam Coen (Kentucky OC / QB Coach) are other names to watch here.  
**QB: Zac Robinson, Rams Assistant QB Coach** \- Robinson and O'Connell should already be very comfortable working in a QB room together, and Robinson has been touted as another up-and-coming offensive mind in the McVay tree. Liam Coen would also be a candidate here.  
**RB: Nick Jones, Rams Offensive Assistant** \- while he has primarily worked with OL and TEs in the past, having Thomas Brown as OC gives a little more flexibilty in hiring an inexperienced RB coach. Jones came up through an NFL coaching fellowship, and will continue to be in high demand as he moves up the ranks.  
**WR: Mick Lombardi, Patriots Assistant WR Coach** \- I'm really hoping the Vikings retain Keenan McCardell, but I'll throw out another name just in case. Lombardi overlapped with O'Connell in San Francisco when both were offensive assistants.  
**TE / Pass Game Coordinator: Brian Angelichio, Panthers TE Coach** \- with Carolina overhauling its offensive staff quite a bit, they may allow Angelichio to consider a lateral move to join Minnesota, especially if Pass Game Coordinator is added to his title. Angelichio worked with O'Connell in both Cleveland and Washington.  
**OL: Shaun Sarrett, Chargers Assistant OL Coach** \- I'd love to land a ""sexier"" name like Mike Munchak or current Rams OL Coach Kevin Carberry, but Sarrett is a more realistic and very intriguing name. He spent 9 years in Pittsburgh as an OL assistant and eventually OL Coach, where they enjoyed immense success developing linemen. Pittsburgh let him go after 2020, coinciding with the retirement/departures of Maurkice Pouncey, David DeCastro, Matt Feiler, and Alejandro Villanueva (Feiler actually followed Sarrett to LA). It's only a matter of time before he gets another lead OL Coach job in the NFL.  
**Other offensive assistants:**   
Chris O'Hara - has worked with O'Connell the last five years as a quality control coach / assistant  
Aaron Kromer - former Rams OL coach  
Zak Kromer - Rams offensive assistant (son of Aaron)

**DC: Bob Babich, Bills LB Coach** \- This one's a bit of a dark horse, but Babich worked with O'Connell in 2015, and is the type of veteran coach with DC and playcalling experience O'Connell is likely looking for. Other candidates would include Wade Phillips (especially if his son gets the OC gig), Jay Rodgers (Chargers LB coach / RGC), Eric Henderson (Rams DL / RGC), Aubrey Pleasant (Lions DBs / PGC), Anthony Weaver (Ravens DL / RGC)  
**DL: Andre Carter, LSU DL Coach** \- Pray that they can convince Andre Patterson to take this role back, because O'Connell's connections with DL coaches are at least publicly very thin. O'Connell and Carter overlapped with Carter for one season in San Francisco (along with Adofo-Mensah)  
**LB: Bobby Babich, Bills Safeties Coach** \- this one obviously comes with the DC hire. Other candidates would likely come from the Rams' or Chargers' staff - Chris Shula, Thad Bogardus, and Michael Wilhoite all make sense.  
**DB: Tom Donatell, Chargers Assistant DB Coach** \- O'Connell is reportedly close with the Donatell family, and was rumored to like Ed Donatell, Tom's father, as DC. With Ed going to Seattle, O'Connell may settle for Tom Donatell, who has done good work with a deep Chargers' secondary. O'Connell also has connections to Jonathan Cooley (Rams assistant DB) and James Rowe (Colts CBs)  
**Other defensive assistants:**  
Roy Anderson - current Vikings assistant, worked with O'Connell in San Francisco

**ST: Dwayne Stukes, Rams Assistant ST** \- could also consider John Bonamego, who was a long-time NFL ST coach and senior assistant for LA the last couple years",2.0,minnesotavikings,t3_smuwvp,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2022-02-07T15:09:03Z,minnesotavikings,0.0019840013181117

Callahan was the interim HC with KOC at OC, and apparently had a strong influence on forcing a run-first approach, while KOC wanted to pass more frequently. Here's a quote I found from KOC at the time:

“It may not be my offense on a game day because the head coach has a way he wants to play the football game,” O’Connell said. “Try to play complementary football with the other two phases (defense and special teams).”

I would love an OL coach with Callahan's success, but it may be tough to pry him out of a similar role in Cleveland. I'm instead hoping we can make a run at Mike Munchak, if he's still available when KOC officially takes over and can start building his staff.",2.0,minnesotavikings,t3_smuwvp,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2022-02-07T14:16:40Z,minnesotavikings,0.11772176

Joker Phillips, WR Coach / Assistant HC, NC State - Phillips has bounced around the college ranks, spending time as the HC at his alma mater Kentucky from 2010-2012, as well as WR coach at Florida, Cincinnati, Maryland, and currently NC State.

Harbaugh was in a contract year and making less than his rival, Pete Carroll

Harbaugh did NOT want to be GM. He had zero interest in building draft boards or negotiating contracts. That did not stop him from criticizing and making demands of Baalke, however. 

Harbaugh and Baalke butted heads over style. Harbaugh was chaotic and confrontational, while Baalke wanted to be calm and analytical. 

Harbaugh lost faith in Baalke’s judgment after a couple specific personnel moves:

- when he refused to take Stanford FB/LB Owen Marecic, whom Harbaugh described as the “perfect football player”
- drafting A.J. Jenkins and LaMichael James who went on to be busts (Baalke felt Harbaugh gave up on Jenkins too quickly)
- Baalke letting veterans Dashon Goldson, Isaac Sopoaga, and Carlos Rogers leave in free agency after refusing pay-cuts
- Disagreement on trading Alex Smith. Harbaugh was not fully on-board with trading Smith, whom Baalke dealt for two 2nd round picks

However, if I were to include the more prominent coaches being omitted by this approach \[Belichick (NFL HC), Pete Carroll (college HC), Tomlin (DC), Harbaugh (ST), and Sean Payton (OC)\], the winning percentage would jump up across each of those categories.",6.0,minnesotavikings,t3_s8qqix,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2022-01-20T13:33:07Z,minnesotavikings,0.1693125
15555,102428,102428,Nijo32,"As the Vikings continue to identify and interview candidates for the vacant HC position, I was curious if there's any discernable difference in results based on a coach's previous coaching background. I compiled results for every coach hired in the last decade, tallying regular and postseason records, Super Bowl titles, and subjectively classifying a coach as a ""hit"" or ""bust"" based on record, expectations, perception, and nature of dismissal.

I've categorized the results in three ways:  
  
1.	Previous Coaching Job (OC, DC, etc.)  
2.	Area of Expertise (Offense, Defense, ST)  
3.	Whether or not the coach had previous head coach experience  
  
A few notes on the data's populations:

* I did not include interim coaches
* By not including coaches hired over a decade ago, some of the most notable current coaches are excluded, such as Bill Belichick, Mike Tomlin, John Harbaugh, Sean Payton, and Pete Carroll. I can see the value in either including or excluding these coaches, but ultimately opted to exclude them as the goal of this exercise is to evaluate the most recent hiring trends for NFL head coaches and their results. Because these successful coaches have been excluded, you'll notice that the total results have an overall losing record, and only four Super Bowl titles despite the period of ten years. These coaches have been employed for over a decade for a reason.
* When considering previous head coaching experience, I did not count high school, low-level college, or short-term interim head coaching roles

Given the shorter time period, take these results with a grain of salt (and certainly use caution in applying them to any one potential coaching candidate). I find some of the results surprising, while other trends make a good deal of sense. I'd be interested to hear others' thoughts, and will gladly answer any questions on my approach, as it's certainly limited in scope and could contain variables not being taken into account.",17.0,minnesotavikings,t3_s8qqix,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2022-01-20T13:25:10Z,minnesotavikings,0.0561491563243721

The Bears vs Packers rivalry is like an East Egg old money gentleman's rivalry. Decades of family's duking it out, each having the upper hand for a while. This tough back and forth created mutual hatred, but also mutual respect. Until the latest generation of families, where the heir to the Bears family fortune is losing his money while the Packers family heir is getting richer, and he is also sleeping with the Bears heir's wife and there is nothing he can do about it. It's a rivalry in memory only.

The Vikings are the new money tech billionaire hillbilly that moved to the block. Foreign cars parked on the lawn, making huge financial gains then blowing it. The Packers wife (Favre) moved in for a bit when she ran away from home.

Your EPA point is a good one, but I personally attach higher value to some of the routes the Hopkins did well on than some of the routes JJ was rated highly on. Specifically what sticks out to me is back shoulder fades-- an extremely difficult route to execute well. Outs are also something I consider high-difficulty but they both excel there. Slants and digs are important but not as impactful as curls, and I'd probably place deep cross and double moves in the same family as drags in that most of the time, you're being schemed open as much as you are earning your separation. Not a dig on those routes, just saying I don't think they carry the same weight.

Now with Hopkins, I felt he was creating a lot of the Arizona offense single-handedly, while Jefferson wasn't being doubled as often due to the presence of Thielen and even Irv, who imo are far superior to the second options in AZ this last year. Efficiency is awesome and JJ deserves points for it, but it isn't everything. Being able to move the sticks and being a consistently-available target for your QB is important too, and nuk did that.

Moving to a different angle, I consider Kirk to be a more accurate QB than Murray. Murray did have a very good deep ball this year, but overall I'd say Kirk (even when considering OL performance) is more accurate. so Hopkins coming down with a higher percentage of his targets than JJ impressed me. He had a *single drop* on 115 receptions, which is just bonkers. And while I don't believe that playing in the slot makes you a worse player, you mentioned being able to hang on the outside, and Jefferson played 30% more of his snaps in the slot than nuk did.

I don't think it's crazy to have JJ above him, but I couldn't objectively do it this year. Don't want to dive too hard into the tape angle because I'd be here for hours but I saw them both as impressive in different ways, so for me it came down to the stats when determining where to rank em.

And re:positional value, we had license to consider it but not to use it absolutely. I personally chose to consider positional value, but not to let it dominate my rankings. Relied a bit on gut, a bit on statistics, and a bit on tape to determine if I should consider positional value when deciding where to put a player.

Rivers and Ryan were never elite, always a solid tier behind Brady/Peyton etc., but they were still more than worth paying the market rate for quarterbacks.

The point is whether top ten QB production is worth paying the market rate for.  Cousins has put up top ten grades/passer rating/etc., things that typically (though not always) lead to offensive efficiency, and therefore, wins.

No one would ever suggest the Chargers screwed up by paying Phil Rivers or that the Falcons should have let Matt Ryan walk, so I really don't understand the logic that you shouldn't pay a QB with top ten stats like Kirk the current market rate.

This is just how much veteran quarterbacks cost today, even guys like Tannehill, Wentz, Goff, Garoppolo make above the 13% mark on average now. Brady can take a pay cut because his wife is one of the richest women in the world, so kind of a unique case.

Dalvin doesn’t have Peterson’s violence, won’t run people over or truck them into oblivion and won’t take four guys to drag him down, but he’s still arguably the best in the NFL at forcing missed tackles thanks to elite contact balance and an ability to force defenders to take poor tackling angles so they often bounce or slide off him.

Even like 5-10 years ago, very few QBs took up 12% or more of the cap. Like when Peyton Manning won in 2015, he was the 6th-highest-paid QB in the league and his cap hit was just 12% of the cap.

So I can’t help but wonder if there is some truth to it. You are right that he wasn’t convicted. The charges were dropped and we don’t know exactly why. But, there was no benefit to the accusers to press charges at all. For all we know, they could have dropped the charges because it was too traumatic. Obviously, I hope it isn’t true. 

What I would really appreciate is if Kwesi went in-depth about what research they did and clarified who they talked to. We have no reason to believe that the Vikings actually did any research outside of their interview with him. I know Kwesi claims they did. But he needs to be specific. When Dalvin Cook got drafted by us, Spielman to his credit, went at length about the research that went into Dalvin’s legal issue at FSU. And he did it all before trading up to grab him. And Dalvin’s issue wasn’t anywhere near as heinous as what Ingram is/was accused of. 

So until we get that clarification, I have no reason to believe anything the FO says about the work they did. But what makes this painful is that if the FO was dead set and confident about Ingram’s innocence. They used a 2nd round pick on him, when there was a really good chance he would have been available in the late 3rd or early 4th most likely because of this matter.

Trading a 2nd for Ngakoue who then got traded for a 3rd later that season. Trading a 5th for Vedvik, only to cut him weeks later. These were panic trades that he would make when a player would underperform or get hurt. 

But he has found good value for us. His 2015 draft is one of the best drafts the Vikings ever had which netted us 4 starters and 3 got 2nd contracts with the team. 2 of them ended up being All-Pros at some point. He drafted O’Neill in 2018 and he became one of the best RTs in the league.

26767,166331,166331,ZAKTMT,"Basically, they are operating under the assumptions that some franchises are desperate and not entirely smart. And if you look at the Stafford trade, it was surprising what the Lions got because in the eyes of many, Stafford and Cousins were seen as being in the same tier of QB. Obviously, Stafford is more talented but both have a history of choking in the big moments and against winning franchises. Plus, a team would probably extend him at the cap hit he has anyway. 

I don’t see us getting a first for Kirk. There are likely many in the league who do see that contract as a detriment. I think SKOR is promoting some wishful thinking. Or hoping that a team like the Rams of last season identifies Kirk as a missing piece and that they can win with him. Especially now that Stafford has made the NFCCG. A lot of people see the Browns as that kind of team since Kirk did run Stefanski’s offense a lot better (at least better than last year). And they have one of the most talented rosters in football (except the receivers, those are bad).

Honestly, until the Rodgers domino falls, all speculation about where Kirk could end up really doesn’t matter since everyone looking for a QB would rather have Rodgers.

No where, until right now, have you said anything that imply you've recanted that statement, but have twice posted that everyone else is wrong for not believing what you believe. Saying ""it's not a large gap"" doesn't mean you don't still believe that Chase is better. 

You're literally misrepresenting statistics to appear correct, but claim to want to be proven wrong. That's a take. Not a good take, but it's technically a take. 

I didn't edit that quote about the catch rates and drops. It's literally two sentences next to each other in the same paragraph. It was one cohesive thought, no mater how bad you want to pretend it wasn't. 

We can also talk about how you claim Jefferson is always running deep, and Chase is always running slants despite Jefferson being targeted deep on 20.4% of his targets while Chase was targeted deep on 23.4% of his targets. 

While we're dissecting these stats, why even mention Air Share yards in your other comment? What was the reasoning behind that in correlation to a player being a deep threat? Jefferson had more total air yards than Chase did and the Vikings threw less overall yards than the Bengals. Of course Jefferson had a higher air share than Chase. That's basic math, and has nothing to do with deep threats. Lets look at air yards per target, shall we? JJ averaged 11.95 air yards per target, Chase averaged 11.97. Which is oddly right in line with their average depth of target and 12 yards each. 

You really need to sit down and actually learn what these statistics are, instead of just spitting them out and hoping they'll prove you right.

Do people say ""No it's fine, the weather and the kicker, and Wilson is better than him and also did bad"" or do people say ""Kirk is dogshit. They never should have had to rely on a FG to win, Kirk should have gotten it done."" 

And I think there is a pretty clear cut answer to that question myself given as we beat the packers in something like 40 MPH winds, and Kirk got shit on for having a 14 attempt, 160 yard game, while they just just let run game handle it. But I'd like to hear what you think. 

And no, I'm not suggesting that Walsh shouldn't have made that kick. I'm suggesting that placing 100% of the blame on the Kicker as the majority of this sub does, is just pure insanity. People can't just say ""but but but, the weather!"" and think it's a valid reason for the offense not being able to find the endzone a single time. As I said before, it's easy to blame the guy that messes up the last play.

And yeah, Kirk will look worse when the only stats you pick are the ones that make him look worse. It's the same thing a lot of ""Kirk Stans"" do, but reverse. They would say: Kirk did better because he had more yards, a higher passer rating and a better completion %, all while facing a higher pressure rate. And you can talk about Jimmy's high% of first downs, and ignore than 6 of the 9 first downs were short of the sticks and came from YAC. Stats can be manipulated. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Kirk did better than Jimmy G. I'm saying they were equally dog shit. 

But we can nitpick stats all day, it's pretty irrelevant to my point if they were equal or if Jimmy was slightly better. I'm conceding that Kirk was solid butthole that game. This isn't a ""oh poor Kirk is taking heat when he shouldn't"" argument from me. No the oline didn't help, and the play calling was questionable, but that game is on Kirk's shoulders, and he deserves a large portion, if not the majority of the blame.

And as I already said, you can't scream weather for one person and ignore it for others. Walsh scored all of our points, and misses his 4th kick in crazy weather. But it's unforgivable, and we should all get the pitchforks and head over to his house. But weather for is a prefect excuse for why Teddy was bad. No, that doesn't fly for me. And the argument of ""well Wilson did the same"" isn't an excuse either. I'm not even trying to argue that teddy deserves all the blame, or even as much as Kirk deserves. Hell I've even specifically pointed out APs 2 yards a carry as being problematic. Yes the weather was a factor. Yes the Hawks defense was good. Those things can all be true while Teddy also had a terrible game. But this sub is so obsessed with how good he is as a person (and dont get me wrong, as far as human beings go, hes arguably one of the best in the league) that they refuse to accept any negative comments about his play. 

But let me ask you one last question. If Kirk had that statline in that game with Seattle, do you think this sub absolves him of all blame like they do with Teddy?

[This article](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/orlando-megachurch-pastors-keep-having-affairs-and-resigning-6551949) about then lead pastor stepping down after admitting to cheating on his wife suggests the Megachurch (It's specifically referred to as a mega church in multiple articles from the same time frame) has been around since at least May of 2013. A little more research will point you to the fact that the pastor who took over the duties as lead pastor was Don Cousins. 

>[The statement was first shared with the church's staff last Wednesday, followed by the rest of the congregation over the weekend. Filling in for Loveless on an interim basis is Don Cousins, the director of ministry for Discovery Church.](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/os-xpm-2013-05-06-os-discovery-church-pastor-admits-affair-20130506-story.html)

At that point Kirk was going into his second year as a 4th round pick and had made less than 900,000 dollars from his salary and signing bonus, so I don't quite understand how he could have afforded to build a mega church prior to May of 2013, or had the power to ""choose"" his father to fill the vacant lead pastor spot in May of 2013.

41624,270826,270826,xlccsylux,"I really like your approach of thinking and I think it makes sense at all. But cycling Rookie QBs is not that easy as it is in theory. You need good draft positions and it is not that easy to hit on QBs again and again. To cycle rookie QBs and reinvest the draft picks for your veteran QBs, you constanly have to hit on QBs. That is nearly impossible. Bears, Vikings and the Broncos are an example that it is not easy to find good/great QBS again and again. 

Your strategy works if you hit on QBs again and again and this will bring me to most important point imo. You need to hit on your draft picks. Excellent drafting is the most important factor for winning a SB. Look at the Bucs, they drafted great players over the last few years. They were maybe the best drafters in recent history. The Saints had one of the best rosters over the last few years, because they also made excellent choices in the draft. The Vikings made the championship game in 2017 because they had a tremendous draft in 2015 (Waynes,Kendricks,Hunter,Diggs,Harris). But failed to strengthen that roster in the drafts from 2016-2019.  The Seahawks didnt win shit the last couple of years, because they were not great at drafting anymore. Same with the Pats. They are now in trouble, because they have lost the magic in the draft in the recent years. 

You can let old and expensive players walk, when you are good at drafting, you do not need to overpay in FA. 

As a result, drafting is the most important key to make your team a contender in combonation with coaches who can develop the talent.
