I think a good way to help fix it is to give teams two exceptions. 

1.	If you only interview 1-2 candidates, the Rooney rule should not apply. 

Example: The Raiders shouldn’t have had to interview anyone else when they hired Gruden. They knew he was their guy all along—everyone knew. 

2.	Give teams an exception once every 3-5 rounds of coaching/GM hires. 

Example: If a team has started the interview process and candidate 3 blows them away, they can use an exception and hire their candidate, without having to do any additional interviews. 

Using this coaching search as an example, I’m glad the Raiders interviewed Demeco Ryans; he’s a good candidate and deserved it and for whatever reason, may not have received an interview without the rule.

Then Bo Jackson was so colossal as an athlete that I met my first band wagon friends in elementary. Always and only wore Raiders gear but didn’t take it serious as much as game is today. TV was way different . I don’t remember the tuck rule as much as the lead up to that game.  That’s the year I went all in just to see Gruden traded and ya know the rest. Won’t even talk about the SB run but I wanted to meet up with old friends so we bought KC Raider tickets for 62bucks each. We won and it was one of the greatest nights of laughs and drinks in my life. Our dumb ass thought we should come back every year. Well that ended in 2019.

The players did a great job tonight at just letting the refs play, the coaches were screaming, the fans were looking wide-eyed- THIS WAS SPORT at the highest level. I'm sure I'm not the only one who was overcome with ecstasy on that pass interference call - you know, the one where several flags all came down on the receiver like a big yellow bukkake? I don't know about you guys, but I'll be tuning in every Sunday wearing my black and white striped jersey, throwing flags around my apartment and screaming the calls in unison with these all-star officials at the top of my lungs.

7313,57731,57731,Flyzini,"Trading Mack was pretty much proven to be the right decision at the point it got to with him holding out, hasn't it? Regardless if we blew most of the picks paying an Edge QB money isn't easy to pull off. You need basically a rookie deal QB. Its a luxury to pay a guy like that, and we sucked affording had no such luxury.         
         
The Bears clowned around and gave him that massive deal, saw A. Rodgers make Mack invisible in the first playoff game ( he had like 1 tackle that game and no pressures/sacks because he plays a position that good coaches/QBs can gameplan around). They then had to restructure his deal the very next season to make the cap work. Now he is gone. I do give the Bears credit for having the Chargers take on the rest of the deal, but a 2nd and 6th pick has to hurt after what was given up.           
        
We were never ranked better than 25th on most metrics when Mack was here because we had holes everywhere. Taking a 17-22 million cap hit the next 5 years would have kept us in the same place. Multiple reports have proven we offered him deal that was very fair and he decided to not only hold out, but didn't even come to any team activities to be with his teammates regardless if would practice or not ( he still had a year left on his deal, we could have played hardball with him). He wanted out 100%, which as much as it hurts to say it was probably smart of him to move on from the dumpster fire we have been.

What you can count on it the top 5 ish QBS to have winning record as long as you have an average Defense and playmakers. You get a top defense and playermakers along with that stud QB= contender.

8687,65834,65834,HaploOfTheLabyrinth,"You say this like the Raiders not winning a playoff game has anything to do with Carr's play?

People are delusional if they think that QB play is why this team hasn't had any success in the last 7 years. The defense is why. 

Did anyone else see the tweet showing that Rodgers, Wilson, and Brees all have records well under .500 in games where their defense gives up more than 23 points per game? Only the GOAT had a winning record in games where the defense gave up that many points, and even Brady was still just barely .500. 

NO QB is having tons of success with the defense Carr has been saddled with. 

>Admittedly, Derek Carr is not prime Drew Brees. The problem is, there is no other QB that is considered elite that has had a defense allow anywhere near 26.5 ppg over seven years. So since so many of these QB’s have not had defenses as consistently bad as Carr’s with the Raiders, I figured I’d combine some of the worst defenses they had and see what a record over seven years would look like, and what the overall defense was and if it was as bad as the one the Raiders have had. So, the seven best QB’s that have played simultaneously with Carr at some point are as follows:
Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Patrick Mahomes, Ben Roethlisberger, and Matt Ryan. Yes, Matt Ryan. Apologies to Russell Wilson and Phillip Rivers, I said what I said. Now let’s see if combined, their defenses were anywhere near as bad as the 26.5 points per game Carr has allowed.

   >    Brady…worst defense, 2002 with 346 points allowed, 9-7 record.
          Manning…worst defense, 2001. 486 (!!!) points allowed, 6-10 record. No wonder Jim Mora wasn’t trying to              
          hear it.
    Rodgers…worst defense, TECHNICALLY it is 2013. That team allowed 428 points. The problem is, Rodgers only 
    played nine games. So I’m defaulting to his second-worst defense in 2008 that had 380 points allowed, 6-10 
    record.
    Brees…worst defense, 2015 with 476 points allowed, 7-9 record.
    Mahomes…worst defense, 2018 with 421 points allowed, 12-4 record. Insane.
    Roethlisberger…worst defense, 2013 with 370 points allowed. 8-8 record.
    Ryan…worst defense, 2013 with 443 points allowed. 4-12 record.

>First off, a couple of observations. The WORST full season defenses Brady and Roethlisberger have ever had in 37 combined NFL seasons as starting QB’s were STILL BETTER than Derek Carr’s best in 2017. Rodgers’ worst was just a single touchdown worse and that was his rookie year. Peyton Manning had a defense that allowed just eight points more than Carr did in 2020, but lost two more games. What a bum. Whatever…let’s tally those numbers up, carry the four, and we have a total of 2922 points. Over seven years, that’s an average of 417.4 points, or 26 points per game even. Which is STILL better than the 26.5 points per game Derek Carr’s defense has allowed his first seven years.

 
>So you take those seven great QB’s, and with a defense just 1/2 point better than Carr’s, they have a combined record of 52-60. Not very far at all from Carr’s supposedly terrible 47-63 record as a starter (he’s missed two games due to injury). And that’s with a semi-fluky season of Mahomes scoring 565 points while his team allowed 26.3 ppg and winning 12 games. Kind of like Carr’s 2016 season where he was able to offset a poor defense for a single year to win 12 games in his own right.

Same thing with requiring proof of vaccination to enroll at a school or to work at a medical facility that requires vaccination. 

Yes many states allow for a religious exemption to getting vaccinated (which is totally dumb and should be removed from all states, no ones fairy tales should allow them to infect others with a deadly virus) and the NFL would probably need to honor people if they claimed ""deeply held religious beliefs"" as the reason.

>You might have seen a claim online that said your employer or your coworkers cannot ask you whether you're vaccinated because of the HIPAA federal privacy law. So we're verifying, Is it a HIPAA violation for your employer to ask if you are vaccinated against COVID-19? Mark Landes, labor and employment attorney at Isaac Wiles, said the answer is pretty simple. ""The employer, the restaurants, your nail salon, your barber, they're all able to ask if you've been vaccinated. They're not covered by HIPAA. It's not a violation and you don't have to answer either,"" Landes explains. HIPAA only applies to specific health-related entities, such as insurance providers, doctors and hospitals. Landes also said that if you're applying for a job, you can be turned down based on your vaccination status. ""If the employer asks you if you've been vaccinated as part of the employment process and you say you've not been vaccinated, the employer can decide not to hire you on that basis. If they don't know anything about you, your medical status or religious status, they can't really discriminate on that basis because they don't know about it,"" Landes said.

>Ruggs was a prolific deep threat in college.

I don't think we watched the same bama teams then. Ruggs mostly got his on slants and other short routes and NOT on posts or other deep routes. He obviously caught those sometimes but most of his big plays were YAC.

Second,
Good QB's don't usually play for 7 years with THE WORST DEFENSE IN THE LEAGUE. Literally you could put Rodgers on this team and he would do about as good as Carr has done over the past year in WINS and PLAYOFF appearances. 

> Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Patrick Mahomes, Ben Roethlisberger, and Matt Ryan. Yes, Matt Ryan. Apologies to Russell Wilson and Phillip Rivers, I said what I said. Now let’s see if combined, their defenses were anywhere near as bad as the 26.5 points per game Carr has allowed.

> Brady…worst defense, 2002 with 346 points allowed, 9-7 record.
Manning…worst defense, 2001. 486 (!!!) points allowed, 6-10 record. No wonder Jim Mora wasn’t trying to hear it.
Rodgers…worst defense, TECHNICALLY it is 2013. That team allowed 428 points. The problem is, Rodgers only played nine games. So I’m defaulting to his second-worst defense in 2008 that had 380 points allowed, 6-10 record.
Brees…worst defense, 2015 with 476 points allowed, 7-9 record.
Mahomes…worst defense, 2018 with 421 points allowed, 12-4 record. Insane.
Roethlisberger…worst defense, 2013 with 370 points allowed. 8-8 record.
Ryan…worst defense, 2013 with 443 points allowed. 4-12 record.

> First off, a couple of observations. The WORST full season defenses Brady and Roethlisberger have ever had in 37 combined NFL seasons as starting QB’s were STILL BETTER than Derek Carr’s best in 2017. Rodgers’ worst was just a single touchdown worse and that was his rookie year. Peyton Manning had a defense that allowed just eight points more than Carr did in 2020, but lost two more games. What a bum. Whatever…let’s tally those numbers up, carry the four, and we have a total of 2922 points. Over seven years, that’s an average of 417.4 points, or 26 points per game even. Which is STILL better than the 26.5 points per game Derek Carr’s defense has allowed his first seven years.

 

>So you take those seven great QB’s, and with a defense just 1/2 point better than Carr’s, they have a combined record of 52-60. Not very far at all from Carr’s supposedly terrible 47-63 record as a starter (he’s missed two games due to injury). And that’s with a semi-fluky season of Mahomes scoring 565 points while his team allowed 26.3 ppg and winning 12 games. Kind of like Carr’s 2016 season where he was able to offset a poor defense for a single year to win 12 games in his own right.

8823,66092,66092,HaploOfTheLabyrinth,"Everyone is upset about the ""value"" of the pick but I have a different opinion. The Raiders have been BAAD for a longtime and need to guarantee that the 1st round picks we have are NOT busts. In order to do that they are taking guys that have high floors but maybe not the highest ceiling. This is a smart move for a team trying to rebuild the culture from one of losing into one of winning IMO. A bad team like the Raiders cannot afford to completely blow a 1st round pick and going with guys that will be solid starters, but maybe not superstars, is probably a good move to build a solid foundation. Once the team has a solid foundation of winning it can take bigger risks on 1st round players. 

Building a roster means you need to have production from the 1st round picks because they are good players for cheap money. Leatherwood will start and be a reliable player, which is what the team needs. 

JOK might be better, but he might also be a huge bust. Safety is generally not valued highly in the first round unless its a generational talent, which there really isn't this year. No one knows what the other teams boards look like and if Leatherwood would really have been around in the next round.

I am also basing this opinion on the idea that PG had the worst defensive staff in the league and was actively hindering the players on defense rather than putting them in a position to succeed. Abram and Arnette could look WORLDS better with Gus Bradley and Ron Milus. If those two 1st round picks start playing really well everyone's opinion of those picks will change.

As for Ruggs, obviously field stretching ability, but he made some damn good catches with defenders draped all over him. Problem was he wasn't big enough to be trusted with quick routes inside because he wasn't big enough to take a hit and still hold onto the ball (I'm assuming, at least. Big task for him from Gruden and Olson was to put on more muscle weight this offseason).

Both have looked crazy healthy this offseason, Ruggs put on like 18lbs. of muscle, and Edwards' playstyle throughout  camp and practices has been compared to Carr's old teammate Davante Adams.

>In another offseason move ahead of free agency, the Raiders restructured the contracts of left tackle Kolton Miller and running back Kenyan Drake to clear just over $14 million in cap space. The Raiders are now $34 million under the cap.

>Ingold, who scored the first NFL touchdown in Allegiant Stadium history and grew into a fan favorite over his three seasons with the Raiders, had his 2021 season cut short when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in Week 10 against the Kansas City Chiefs.

>“Gut-wrenching and heartbreaking” is how Ingold described his feelings upon being informed of the Raiders’ decision. “It feels like I’m going undrafted all over again.”

>While no doors are being closed for a return, at this point Ingold is expected to hit the open market next week.

>An undrafted free agent out of Wisconsin in 2019, Ingold won a roster spot as a fierce blocker and short-yardage runner who could also catch out of the backfield.

>Over three seasons he caught 28 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown and ran 15 times for 22 yards.

>But it was his role as a blocker and team leader that resonated in the locker room and with fans. At the time of his injury, Ingold was grading out as the second-best pass blocker among NFL fullbacks, according to Pro Football Focus.

>“It’s a tough circumstance that nobody can really control and I get it,” Ingold said. “Just have to lock in on what I can control and be the best Alec Ingold I can be.”

>With his future uncertain, Ingold is hoping for the best for the Raiders.

>“I wish the Raiders the best of luck,” he said. “I know all those guys in that building have a vision of what needs to happen to finish what we started. I’m really excited to see that manifest. My future is all about getting healthy and being a better football player after this ACL than before.”

>Ingold said the road to recovery is going well, and the goal is to be full-go by the time training camp opens.

>“I’m over three months post-operation now and crushing the rehab,” he said. “I’m excited to be fully cleared by training camp wherever that might be and take all of these lessons and hardships and turn it into a heck of a 2022 campaign.”",17.0,raiders,t3_tb8rgy,False,0.0,:24:,2022-03-10T15:05:57Z,raiders,0.0254325899136674

12657,102115,102115,MrAmericanIdiot,"Here’s a list of players I’d start looking into. The stars/above average of the team.  
  
QB: Derek Carr  
RB: Josh Jacobs, Kenyan Drake  
WR: Davante Adams, Hunter Renfrow  
TE: Darren Waller  
LT: Kolton Miller  
RG: Denzelle Good
  
DT: Johnathan Hankins  
DE: Chandler Jones, Maxx Crosby  
LB: Denzel Perryman  
CB: Trayvon Mullen, Rock Ya-Sin, Nate Hobbs  
S: Tre’von Moehrig  
  
K: Daniel Carlson  
P: AJ Cole  
  
Rookies to keep an eye on:  
  
G/C: Dylan Parham (3rd round)  
Per rumors, he will be competing with current center Andre James as the starting center.  
  
RB: Zamir White (4th round)  
He looks like he may be third on the depth chart. Speculation he could be Jacobs replacement next year since the Raiders did not pick up Jacobs’ 5th year option.  
  
Other story lines:  
  
2021 first round pick Alex Leatherwood was drafted to be the starting right tackle. He underwhelmed and got pushed to guard halfway through the season. Currently, the Raiders don’t have a defined right tackle. Leatherwood will be competing for the tackle spot again during camp, but there’s a big question mark at right tackle.  
  
The Raiders have been weak at linebacker for decades. But 2021 third round pick Divine Deablo showed he has great potential his rookie year when he did get on the field. Looking for him to make a jump this upcoming season.  
  
2021 third round pick Malcolm Koonce showed some flashes during last season as an edge rusher. Hoping he turns into a great rotational piece for Maxx and Chandler.",47.0,raiders,t3_uz7szz,False,0.0,:4:,2022-05-27T16:16:57Z,raiders,0.0560586069049505

I don't think people here who hate Carr ask themselves this enough. Are we going to draft someone? A lot of people said we should've taken a QB in this years draft. Lawrence and Wilson were unobtainable from a trading draft picks perspective, so then were left with trading up for Fields or Jones. Without speculating even about the draft capital required to trade, would Fields or Jones be better than Carr? Fields can't hit the same throws as Carr and neither guy can read the defense pre-snap as well as Carr. The only advantage to drafting a young guy is the price tag, IMO. As for free agents, maybe you could get a disgruntled Aaron Rodgers, but in that case you better be sure that the QB was the root of the problems and not any combination of the coaches, skill guys, o-line, or defense, otherwise you're right back where you started just with a different QB.

18500,147788,147788,Save2faBackupCodes,"I think the rule itself was fine. The problem was the interpretation of the play on January 19, 2002:

In the replay, you can clearly see that the ball had stopped its forward motion and was tucked into Tom Brady's non-throwing hand. According to NFL Rule 3, Section 22, Article 2, Note 2:

""When [an offensive] player is holding the ball to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of his arm starts a forward pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body. Also, if the player has tucked the ball into his body and then loses possession, it is a fumble.""

The moment the ball touched Brady's non-throwing hand, the ball ceased to be in the ""attempting to tuck"" stage and was in fact ""tucked into his body"" and should have resulted in a fumble. In addition, the call on the field was a fumble and since the replay overturned this call, it suggests that Walt Coleman thought he had indisputable evidence to overturn the call.

The fact that the replay clearly shows the ball tucked into the non-throwing hand and no longer in a forward motion, as well as the lack of indisputable evidence that would be needed to overturn a fumble as was called on the field, demonstrates a deep conspiracy that was set in motion to actively suppress the greatness of the Raiders.

We didn't tag Mack, because he wasn't eligible to be tagged. He was still under contract. His holdout was trying to get in front of the contract, so that he didn't get tagged. Nobody wants to play out the last year of their contract without another contract in place. If they get hurt in that last year (or in a tagged year) they could stand to lose millions.

I also don't know that Mark Davis has the cash flow to use the tag very often. If we tagged Carr, and he signed it, that would be a $40M check. If the salary cap doesn't expand again next year, let's call it $190M, that's 21% of your cap on one player.

Munford supported his team by moving inside from LT to LG but that likely negatively impacted his draft stock. If he had 2 consecutive seasons at LT and performed well, he probably would have been a mid-round pick (3rd to 5th).

I agree on the adjustment to RT. If he had played on the right side of the line, this would be an easier transition. Look at Parker for example, he's always looked better / more comfortable at LT than RT.

Gruden 2.0 was suspect at both scheme and play calling.

He stubbornly expected his players to execute without giving them help. Especially the OL. Gruden didn't have TEs or backs chip elite pass rushers. That's scheme to me.

But yea, his play calling was very predictable:

1. 1st down: 70+% run rate
2. Jacobs with anything other than 11 personnel was often a run
3. Ineffective in the red zone

**You can't expect your offense to win any given snap if the defense has a good idea what's coming, unless there's a big talent gap.**

Play action is a staple in the NFL. So are screens. Anything that punishes the DL for getting over-aggressive in the pass rush. We've run more PA and screens the past 2 games than it feels like we ran in the prior 5. Neither DEN nor PHI had a clear idea what was coming.

We gave Gruden plenty of time. He (or Mayock) did turn around the roster beginning with the 2019 offseason.

We may have dodged a $100MM bullet.

Lots of people have been saying this feels like 2002 all over again, for good reason.

I'll give Gruden 2.0 credit in terms of letting young guys play. But Gruden 2.0 was not an effective playcaller due to a blend of being too predictable and too stubborn.

2. With low usage of play-action

4. Without misdirections (e.g. screen passes) to punish opposing DL that are pinning their ears back and going after the QB

\#2, #3, and #4 made their 1st meaningful appearances of the season @ DEN, thanks to Olson and Carr. So basically Carr made it work even without playcalling that keeps opposing defenses honest and off-balance.

I still see red, and have for years, when people claim Carr is a checkdown QB and unwilling to sling it downfield. As I posted in another thread earlier this week, Carr's ""outburst"" in downfield production is easily misunderstood:

* Carr last trusted his weapons in 2016, when the offense went bananas
* He played hurt at times in 2017, had a horrific receiving corps in 2018 and 2 rookie tackles

Beasley was a UFA when he signed his contract in 2019.

If we extend Renfrow after his 3rd season, we're mitigating his financial risk due to career-threatening injury. So we hold leverage with Renfrow that the Bills lacked.

This is EXACTLY how you get a team-friendly deal, as I explained in detail here last week:

I believe given the above circumstances that we may be able to extend Renfrow for 4-yr / $20MM.

Derek Carr is literally the reason the coaching staff is the way it is. The Davis family holds Carr to a high regard and the deal was for any new head coach coming in  that Carr remains on the team. Carr is very well kept up to date with moves by the coaching staff and the Davis family themselves.

Carr also is not someone that just puts himself out there on social media in any regard unless he knows 100% what he is talking about. Every time he has made a statement on social media it has come Into fruition. I welcome anyone to try to find an instance where this is false.

1. He reminds me too much of Lane Kiffin and I’m not sure MD had the balls of his father to pull out the overhead projector if needed. That worries me. 

2. He is a wiz of an offensive mind, up there with McVay/Shanahan/LaFleur.

3. There’s a reason why NE has coveted him for 20 years. 

This move both worries me and excites me because it could go so well or so wrong. It’s one or the other. If he comes in with too much arrogance like did in Denver and starts making roster changes like the late Jon Gruden, it could fail miserably. If he comes in thinking he knows exactly what we need to do to get the offense moving efficiently and just highlights what’s already there, it will work wonderfully. We have the perfect pieces for this offense: dominant TE, shifty slot receiver, hard nosed RB, and a versatile/pass catching RB. Could use another WR and some help on the O-Line, but that can be solved in FA/draft.

**Las Vegas Raiders**  
**Preseason power ranking: No. 13**

**Injury to watch: Darren Waller, TE**  

Waller missed most of the second half of training camp with what was described as a hamstring issue, even as rumors floated that the 2020 Pro Bowl tight end was ""holding in,"" waiting for a contract extension. Only the 17th-highest-paid tight end in the NFL, Waller is a game-breaker when healthy but missed six games last season because of back and knee issues, and coach Josh McDaniels would not commit to Waller playing in the season opener. -- Paul Gutierrez

**The season will be a success if…**  
the defense can match the expected play of the offense.  

Yeah, you know all about quarterback Derek Carr's many options on offense, starting with new wide receiver Davante Adams, continuing with slot receiver Hunter Renfrow and moving through tight end Waller and running back Josh Jacobs. But the remade defense, under new coordinator Patrick Graham, has to show up and keep games manageable. Edge rushers Maxx Crosby and Chandler Jones will feast so long as the retooled secondary -- with new cornerbacks Rock Ya-Sin and Anthony Averett -- can cover -- Gutierrez

**Impact newcomer: Davante Adams, WR**  
Adams is the best receiver in the NFL, and rejoining his old Fresno State running mate in Carr -- along with a modern playcaller in Josh McDaniels -- is expected to pay off with another playoff appearance. The chemistry with Carr is real, and so is Adams' preternatural ability to get open and come down with the tough catch. The key, then, is a questionable offensive line giving Carr enough time to find Adams downfield. -- Gutierrez

**Fantasy breakout candidate: Derek Carr, QB**
Despite his previous reputation as a checkdown king, Carr recorded 142 deep-ball attempts over the past two seasons. He also managed a top-eight YPA and a top-12 true passer rating in back-to-back seasons. Reuniting with Adams and getting a healthy Darren Waller back figures to improve his efficiency and push his passing touchdown total above 30. -- Liz Loza

**Over or under 8.5 wins? Under**  
There's good reason for all the optimism, but ultimately the offensive line is a giant weakness and the division is too tough. They can improve from last season and still not have as many wins. -- Doug Kezirian

**Bold prediction for 2022:** Carr will throw a career-high 35 touchdown passes in McDaniels' offense.

In McDaniels' schemed pass game, Carr will be set up to attack open coverage voids and cut it loose on deep ball throws. The Raiders have multiple pass catchers who can get open with their route-running traits. -- Bowen",14.0,raiders,t3_x71ap4,False,0.0,:Logo_95-Present:,2022-09-05T23:44:45Z,raiders,-0.000109028434022

34389,244014,244014,grumpysky,"By Vincent Bonsignore Las Vegas Review-Journal
August 27, 2022 - 2:25 pm

One of the biggest issues facing the Raiders during training camp has been an unsettled offensive line.

At right tackle, four players have been competing for the starting job, and both right and left guard have featured various players auditioning for starting roles.

While the Raiders are closer today to finalizing a starting five and the four or five players behind them, to say it is a done deal would be presumptuous.

“There will be no big announcements today on that,” Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said on Saturday, a day after his club wrapped up the preseason and training camp. “There’s a lot to sort through.”

And not a whole lot of time to whittle their way through it.

The Raiders have until 1 p.m. Tuesday to decide on their 53-man roster — they currently have 80 players — and soon after they will have to make decisions on who is starting at what positions ahead of their season opener on Sept. 11 against the Chargers.

At this point, only Kolton Miller at left tackle and Andre James at center are in the starting lineup. Dylan Parham, John Simpson and Lester Cotton are in the running at both guard spots, and Jermaine Eluemunor, Alex Leatherwood, Thayer Munford and Brandon Parker are the contenders at right tackle.

Jackson Barton and whoever doesn’t land the starting right tackle position are candidates to be the swing tackle. “We feel like we do have some quality there,” McDaniels said.

Nevertheless, the offensive line was a mix of good and not-so-good during camp and preseason, and there remains the distinct possibility the Raiders will look outside their building to shore up some spots.

“We have a lot of things to discuss in the next so many days,” McDaniels said.

Leatherwood, the 17th overall pick in last year’s draft, remains an enigma. His inability to state a case for himself leaves him vulnerable. Everything is on the table, including the drastic measure of outright cutting him.

McDaniels said Leatherwood remains in the mix, but also added the Raiders believe they have quality options at his position. That leaves his spot on the roster in doubt.

“Having tough decisions to make because you feel like you’ve got a lot of guys competing for them is a good problem to have,” McDaniels said.

Further complicating the process are injuries to Parker and Munford that limited Parker to just one preseason game and Munford to two.

Parker is a candidate to start the season on the injured reserve list, but the Raiders are holding out hope he can return at some point during the season. To preserve his eligibility, he would have to be part of the 53-man roster by Tuesday’s deadline and then put on retrievable injured reserve soon after.

That means the Raiders would have to put someone on waivers they actually covet and hope they clear the waiver process in order to be re-signed to the roster once Parker is added to I.R.

In other words, preserving Parker’s eligibility could mean losing a player they believe worthy of a roster spot.

The extent of Munford’s injury has not been disclosed, although the hope is he doesn’t need to spend time on the injured list to start the season. When healthy, Munford is firmly in the running for a starting job.

Meanwhile, the Raiders have to sort through the multiple options they have at both guard spots after mixing and matching at those positions throughout camp and the preseason.

At some point, though, they have to make a final call.

“This is the part of the year where some of those decisions are going to have to settle in here,” McDaniels said. “We have a lot of tape to digest.”",25.0,raiders,t3_wzleb0,False,0.0,:Logo_95-Present:,2022-08-27T22:33:27Z,raiders,1.89581394935096e-08

Also, if Watson sues, there’s already a precedence of league winning in court. Brady fought the league, but his 4 game suspension was eventually upheld.

This coming from Florio is really shady as he likes to exaggerate what he hears. This was already reported previously and I think Florio is just talking out of his ass, again. I don’t think anybody knows and we’ll see when the decision is made.

""  What has kept the Raiders from going for a vet DB on the market? 

I personally agree with the notion that the Raiders need to sign a veteran defensive back to put in their locker room.

However, I also feel that this isn't as dire of a need as other  things that have already been addressed. The Raiders have spent a lot of  time picking up pieces to elevate the pass rush, as well as getting  veteran wide receivers in John Brown and Willie Snead. There are still  several veteran cornerbacks, such as Casey Hayward and Richard Sherman,  that are on the market, and I believe the Raiders will be able to snag a  good one when they're ready to strike.

The Raiders front office has consistently said that they are behind  their current secondary, and they just want to see improvement.

Obviously I think my boy Carr is way too low given his mostly excellent play this season; so is Tannehill, and Bridgewater and Hurts are too high. Personally my theory is you’re giving too much weight to touchdowns - Carr and Tannehill don’t throw many redzone TDs due to the design of their offense (they usually run it in there). To your credit you basically admitted that you value putting points on the board over putting your team in position to score but that necessarily values certain offenses differently.

Overall, not a bad model and it certainly holds up for top 5. Statistics sadly have limitations in this context because the best QBs are the ones who win games and that isn’t shown here at all.

For example, if you have two stud wideouts like Metcalf and Lockett I doubt even an elite TE is going to shine in that offense. They’ve built the scheme around the deep bombs to the wideouts. 

I’ll admit it’s a bit of a chicken and egg question - do the players inform the scheme or does the scheme inform the players? And it probably goes both ways. That being said there are probably some quality TEs in the “garbage” that would do better in different schemes.

Vegas to me is about glitz and glam, showmanship and kind of just a celebration of wealth that comes not from hard work but from dice rolls. That's not inherently bad at all, just not something I'd match with the Raiders culture. 

As far as the stadium itself, I loved the Oakland Coliseum. I personally don't know why anyone would want a ""nice stadium"". The weather was usually nice and that's mainly all I need out of a gameday. The tailgates and ability for fans to kind of create their own culture in that space because it wasn't all corporatized and controlled was really cool and something we don't have anymore.

So depending on who he talks to he may not be getting an accurate read on how that player is valued league wide.  For instance, maybe he’s scouting a corner and he talks to the Ravens and Patriots scouting departments.  They’ll both say something like this corner has trouble flipping his hips in man coverage so we gave him a 5th round grade.  And maybe that fits what Lance sees so that’s the projection he’ll give.

If he’s wanting a big pay raise, there’s less margin for error when it comes to building the roster so he’ll likely have to overcome more mistakes and mediocre play from his supporting cast.  If he doesn’t want a big raise and keeps his salary roughly the same (or slight increase but the same percent of the cap), that supporting cast can pick up those games where he’s a little off and squeak out some wins.

For me, that’s ultimately what the debate is.  I don’t know if we can build a complete roster around him if his cap hit increases after next year.  We have extensions due for Crosby, Waller, Renfrow, and Mullen soon too.  At what point is it worth taking a shot at a rookie QB and using that money to complete the team?

I don’t know exactly where I stand.  It would be hard as hell to find a QB of Carr’s quality in the draft, especially this year, but it’s hard to see some of these younger guys like Allen, Jackson, Mahomes, Burrow, and Herbert have great starts to their careers because their front office can stack talent around them and not want to get in on that too.",1.0,raiders,t3_ra9piu,False,0.0,:96:,2021-12-06T12:20:22Z,raiders,0.0963883868201921

those of you who say “just draft a QB.” With the past three drafts, the only two QBs who show potential to play better then Carr is Mac Jones and Joe Burrow.

Carr is a great QB on a shit team. This year definitely shouldn’t be one where he is looked down on.
