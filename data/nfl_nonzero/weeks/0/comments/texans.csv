That being said, I do have a bit of insight on the team. There are a few pieces on their defense that would be worth picking up.

AJ Terrell, who is rated as a top 5 CB last year, arguably the best in the league and is on the 3rd year of a rookie contract. Incredible young talent. Best available option IMO.

Richie Grant is coming off of a pretty productive rookie season as a safety. With Reid officially gone, I could see him as an immediate starter if we don't go for Kyle Hamilton. He really shines against the run, but is pretty solid in coverage as well.

Marlon Davidson is a young pass rusher that's an absolute animal, but had nagging ankle/knee injuries that caused him to miss a little bit of time. Not a super concerning injury history, but it's worth noting. Also got a pick 6 on Tom Brady, so that's pretty neat.

The Ravens took Kyle Hamilton with their number one pick passing on their biggest needs in pass rusher corner and offensive tackle. A safety that lacks elite athleticism and may not be able to put a cap on elite deep threat receivers, but hey, he‚Äôs tall!

They then picked up Tyler Linderbaum, a center in the first round! A first round center!? Many people question whether his athleticism will make up for his lack of height, weight and arm length and have success in the NFL.

With their third pick the Ravens select David Ojabo an athletic edge rusher out of Michigan. The only problem with drafting this athletic edge rusher is the fact that he‚Äôs coming off a torn Achilles. Returning from a torn Achilles is nothing like returning from a torn ACL. All this athleticism they hoped to gain from him could be permanently hampered due to losing the burst that a healthy Achilles gives you!!! Who knows if he‚Äôll return to his former athletic self.

The best case is top of the league pass rushing potential when you change his assignments to no longer playing conservative like he did at Georgia. 

Jameson Williams: While I‚Äôd rather have all of the above guys, there‚Äôs something in me that likes chaos and picking Jameson Williams here would have me really interested to see how other teams react and who they leave us at 13.

I asked if you thought OJ did it because the court can make a decision and we can still have an opinion despite their decision. He‚Äôs innocent until proven guilty. My opinion is still valid despite the verdict.

 I‚Äôll give you my logic. You don‚Äôt have to agree. I‚Äôm just doing the math. The likelihood that this case is made up by gold diggers and/or the Texans reduces with every new lawsuit. I asked you to look up people that were found innocent when they faced 16 different woman accusing them because it‚Äôs obvious you wouldn‚Äôt find that. 

If this many woman have vulgar claims of sexual assault against him, and there‚Äôs rumors that he‚Äôs going to claim they were consensual, it‚Äôs likely that most won‚Äôt have enough evidence other than their story. On individual basis most of those stories will be he said she said and not hold up.

My opinion is that if 16 people have cases, he visited way more than 16 woman. If he‚Äôs claiming consent, he was looking for prostitution. If he found women not interested in prostitution, I can have a negative opinion of him if he expected all of these massage therapists to be secret prostitutes looking for sex money. But the odds point away from that being ever case and my opinion on him is allowed to not ignore logic that the shear numbers point to his likely guilt.

Finding this many women likely not a strategy. The most likely situation is other woman seeing the media and saying the same thing happened to them. Either way you‚Äôre telling us that we should wait for the court to play out before we pass judgement, I don‚Äôt have to hold my opinion.

And within one game that turned out to not be the case and by season's end you saw people in national sports media talking about how we exceeded expectations and that Culley (who was an awful and completely clueless head coach and far more of a stop gap than Lovie likely is) was done dirty by being fired, even though that came off the back of him refusing to fire Tim Kelly who was an equally awful OC.

And, to be clear, I'm not saying that the Texans couldn't be a bad team this year. Mills could regress, Pep's offensive play calling could be bad, our rookies could be slow to get acclimated to NFL play, and so on and so on.

Obviously it all comes down to on fueld results, but it's honestly not possible to look at our offseason and say we didn't improve. Lovie should be better than Culley as HC, Pep should be an improvement over Tim Kelly's awful playcalling, we seemed to have potentially have had the best draft in franchise history since 2006, Mills should hopefully continue to develop, and almost every position group was improved one way or another.

Cons


- Bad clock management 

- Runs similar plays often, we used to have a play action shot play at midfield that we ran like every time, and it got predictable for defenses by then, or like the one RPO we run

- Nepotism, he‚Äôll play his favorite players over better ones

That being said, I think your points are valid, I think all of those options could be part of it but until I see what cause of action he sues under then it becomes difficult.

What I do know about Tony Buzbee is that he likes the spotlight and a show‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm interested to see if there is any supporting evidence to actually support him adding the Texans or if it‚Äôs optics.

20986,161254,161254,Wiseguy888,"I think an important point w/r/t the NDA to mention is the legal concept of respondeat superior (essentially, in short, that an employer is responsible for the actions of their employees **acting within the scope of their employment**). This is important because of the context. 

If the director of security was asked to give it to him by in house counsel then the Texans may have some responsibility if they knew the purpose. However, it is outside of the scope of their respective employment responsibilities (or you could at least make that argument) because the director of security isn‚Äôt in house counsel and in house counsel is there to represent the Texans and not Deshaun Watson in an individual capacity against any of these women. 

I have a feeling this won‚Äôt be imputed on the Texans. It seems like Deshaun probably showed this head of security this threatening message because he thought maybe he‚Äôs worried about safety and being threatened by anyone.

Negligence requires 4 things: (1) duty, (2) breach, (3) causation and (4) injury.

You need to first establish that the Texans had a duty to investigate (I don‚Äôt think you can easily establish that).

If you can establish that they did in fact have a duty, then you‚Äôd need to prove they breached that duty (probably easier to establish) and that such breach proximately caused the injury (likely easier to establish too).

I think you‚Äôre missing that the intent element *(... or in this case also the ‚Äúknowing‚Äù element)* is **not** derived from what the victim‚Äôs subjective thought is of the situation, legally... So, as you said, the distinction the other poster was trying to make between ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing‚Äù coerced is not a distinction made in law, but it is also not based on the victim‚Äôs state of mind either *from solely a legal standpoint*. In the court of public opinion, that **may** obviously be a different story. 

Not sure why anyone would downvote a discussion like this. 

In tort, sexual assault requires either intent (general or specific)/knowledge that such action may cause the harm and it proximately caused such harm. We‚Äôre operating under a specific set of facts and pleadings, which if IIRC, 20 of the suits are for IIED and Civil Assault while 2 of the cases allege sexual assault. 

FWIW, I do think he intentionally (or knowingly) did cause those actions so from that perspective, I think he would be considered a ‚Äúrapist‚Äù based on how we‚Äôre discussing it. The only issue is that despite him being a ‚Äúrapist‚Äù, he may have a legal out (by way of an affirmative defense).",2.0,texans,t3_ni2smw,False,0.0,:watson2:,2021-05-24T09:27:23Z,texans,0.0240893040150199
21121,161590,161590,Wiseguy888,"I‚Äôll start off by saying that I liked what you said about everything from a **non-legal** standpoint. I‚Äôm not going to completely dissect everything said, but I want to point out that in Texas criminal law, there is what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúmens rea‚Äù (guilty mind/mental intent) and ‚Äúactus reus‚Äù (guilty act). 

If you want to examine the TPC at all, which I doubt you will, go at it: https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/?link=PE (Sexual Coercion as a crime is 21.18 and Sexual Assault is 22.011). 

When reading and comprehending criminal statutes, you have to understand what is the mental state required to actually commit the said offense/criminal act. You also have to consider whether he requested for them to do the act, which appears to be at play, constituted gaining their consent. Currently, as of May 2021, it is still all *very* circumstantial. Being considered a ‚Äúrapist‚Äù is generally meant to describe someone in the criminal context (...yet expanded to be inclusive of civil cases) and he hasn‚Äôt been criminally charged or indicted. Despite that, he could clearly still be a rapist even if not charged criminally. The reality is that there is likely not enough evidence for charges to be brought or for him to ultimately be convicted with respect to sexual coercion or sexual assault unless new information comes to light, which seems unrealistic at this point. 

There is a stark difference between the examples you used and what occurred in the cases... You describe pointing a gun at someone‚Äôs head in the process of coercing someone. That is an intentional act. The offender had the mens rea of intentionally acting and pointing the gun to cause or coerce some act to occur. To insinuate, **legally**, that‚Äôs the same as ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù or ‚Äúrelational‚Äù coercion is simply incorrect. However, in the example of the alleged forced oral and any instance in which he guided someone‚Äôs hand to his crotch *could have* been coercive because of his intent. All of that is to say that him being a ‚Äúrapist‚Äù **may** not be true, *legally*, and is more complicated than that. 

**From a non-legal standpoint** and in taking off our lawyer thinking caps, I agree with you entirely that your actions may have broader consequences when you hold a position of power. However, you have to also consider that it is a subjective standard we‚Äôre discussing that is dependent on the eyes of the beholder. That being said, there are still instances in which the beholder is unreasonable and does not have clean hands...

Besides amazing restaurants, we also have world class museums and our zoo is too notch, but do skip the downtown aquarium.

Staying Downtown will provide decent transit and is walkable, the light rail runs from downtown, through the museum district to NRG. Downtown is also a fairly short distance to other great neighborhoods, Montrose, East Downtown, Heights, and Washington. All of those neighborhoods offer slightly different things depending on what you're into. The downside is downtown itself is a little dead since COVID, still a decent amount going on but not as lively as 2019.

A lot of people will recommend the Galleria, it is a massive mall with an ice rink. I would recommend skipping it unless shopping is your thing. 

Depending on your means, you may want to look into doing a [Level 9 tour of the space center](https://spacecenter.org/exhibits-and-experiences/level-9-tour/) you will need to book that in advance.

BOB wanted Deshaun to spread the ball out more, that's why he attempted to replace DHop with Brandon Cooks, Randall Cobb, and another pass-catching back in David Johnson. DHop has the best hands in the NFL but he also is terrible in YAC on most plays. Deshaun was often too locked in on getting the ball to DHOP, which locked down the playbook and limited what we could do offensively. The thing that is frustrating, is that BOB was right in that Deshaun is a good enough QB that giving him more solid targets actually made him better. Deshaun posted his best numbers that year. This is plan is exactly what the Patriots did for years with Brady, they were top spenders on WR despite having few household names. 

Like others have said, BOB was terrible at calculating player values. He did some combination of not valuing DHop high enough, David Johnson way too high, and not highly valuing draft picks.

And here comes the but.

Do we think he knows what exactly it takes to be a HC? does he know how to delegate his responsibilities, develop an off-season program, run training camp, run weekly practices, work with his coordinators to develop a strategy that helps both sides of our team?

But, Daboll has spent the majority of his career as a Patriot as well. And while the Bills are in great shape right now, I don't know if we can reasonably project that Daboll what kind of HC he is or personality.

The points here are based on roster construction of the Bills, something that Caserio is clearly in charge of. For all of the complaints about Bill O'Brien doing the Patriot Way he never followed their model. He continually invested picks in offensive weapons, continually downgraded the secondary, and rarely invested in the trenches. Honestly the only Patriot model he used was when he traded dhop to attempt to make a more well rounded WR corp, obviously he was poor at executing this plan. Honestly the only thing that BOB did that emulated BB was being an asshole and assuming total control if the team.

Daboll's offense is great, but we cant honestly put the rest of the success of the Bills on him, especially in terms of roster construction. 

To me, I'm more interested in getting an innovative mind that can get buy-in from the top down. Look at Vraebel's success in Tennessee, you despite him losing 3 offensive coordinators he has kept his momentum, he lets his people do their jobs and it frees him to manage the game like a HC should.

BOB would probably be a good HC if he could actually delegate and focus on just being a HC, let an OC run their offense and he can focus on overall strategy and in game decisions, but also who knows of that is actually in his nature every time he tried to delegate he immediately snatched it back and took it over himself.",2.0,nfl,t3_rucb6a,False,0.0,:Texans: Texans,2022-01-02T11:14:47Z,texans,0.0126443972908093

26561,205526,205526,italomacedocosta,"Whenever I am trying to decipher what people really wanna say, I use the strategy of trying to identify the ideas that people are trying to deny. That's what we do when we speak. we deny what is false as an effort to state what is true to ourselves.

So, for example, when David Culley says that: ""Right now, Deshaun is our starting QB and we're committed to him."" He's denying the fact that Deshaun is not a Texan, because He is a Texan. By definition, He's not lying.

However, when Trotter asks him if Deshaun is going to be the starting QB in the future, Culley changes his response to ""hopefully"". So, He can't deny that Deshaun might leave, and He sticks to the truth once again.

Additionally, Culley says that what happens outside the building doesn't matter to him. So, I think that He is talking about something that is not related to football at all. 

Speculation:

Considering that Easterby is a former character coach involved in previous allegations from other athletes (like Hopkins), I'm guessing it's either racism, or meddling with athletes' private lives (and racism in a way).

Trotter knows what it is. He mentioned that Deshaun's crew is chronicling it. So, there's evidence on what's going on. 

So, We should be ready for a gigantic move during the draft or after June 1st. Those are the two opportunities that Caserio has. Deshaun's value will drop with time. Caserio's gotta be quick and make a move.

Quick response to that quip: 


I think people might have forgotten, a few years ago, when the kneeling scandal was all the rage in the NFL. People were *outraged* to find out that some players would kneel before *every single game*. ::gasp::  

There is a very quirky similarity between kneeling, Christianity, Military Enthusiast, and the NFL. Go against one, and anyone who supports any of the others will ostracize you, your business, and anything associated with you. *Very Karen-esque.*. 

There are still very Christian Group oriented people, who still boycott the NFL, because some people would kneel, in protest over a young black man who was executed by a glorified security patrol. The same people who scream, ""NO SIR. Blue lives matter,"" anytime they even sniff a possible Black Lives Matter thought.

You're completely diminishing an area of the field because you're hyper focused on fumbling forward vs backwards rather than the fact that the literal rule is about being out of bounds behind the goal line, not the direction of the fumble. ""It is a safety: . . . The ball is out of bounds behind the goal line.""

And the section on touchback is in the same area, because, as the rule book says ""a touchback, while not a score, is included in this rule because, like scoring plays, it is a case of a ball that is dead on or behind a goal line."" Very clearly up front setting the precedent that the rule is related to the goal line.

Definition of a touchback: it is a touchback if the ball is dead on or behind the goal line a team is defending. Provided the impetus comes from an opponent

I know I'm pulling right from the rule book and the complaint is about the rule, but this is to show that the rule is very consistent because the ruling is about endzone possession, not the fumble rules, and the endzone, being behind the goal line, is a special place with special rules.
