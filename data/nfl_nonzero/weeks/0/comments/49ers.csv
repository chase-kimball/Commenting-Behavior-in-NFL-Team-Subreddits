I love Mac Jones, but I said it since the trade that I don't think this move was made for Mac Jones, and I don't think our front office leaks the way everyone seems to think it's leaking, with rumors flying left and right about who we are picking.

I think the biggest takeaway from everything that's recently happened was the fact that we scheduled basically scripted pro days with Fields and Lance because it's between the 2 of them, and Mac Jones rumors are just that, rumors to throw the Jets off our scent or anyone else that might sell the house to jump to #2.

I think Mac is going to be a top 15 QB in this league, but as much as I like him, I don't think it will be for us SOLEY because this team doesn't operate like this and no one would be mentioning his name a month before the draft took place. This Jones stuff was created to make the Jets second guess themselves and keep them away from the guy we want, which makes sense because we run the same offense and LaFleur could be feeding them information on what Kyle likes and who would work best in this offense.

The crazy part is I think we actually WANT the Jets to select Wilson and have wanted this all along. He plays off script more than anyone in the top 5 and I just don't see Kyle loving that trait. He's very talented, but look how both Ryan and then Rodgers had to change their games up to work in this type of offense. Both Fields and Lance have elite athletic traits, but they have shown the ability to operate within their schemes and listen to their coaches, sometimes almost to a fault. I think Kyle has zeroed in on Fields and Lance and this whole process was to stack them up against one another, with Beck working with both of them and feeding Kyle extra intel.

If I'm wrong and Mac is the guy, I'm going to be thrilled because I'm a HUGE fan of his, but I don't think this is the direction we're heading. I'm damn near 99% confident that this pick is going to be Fields or Lance simply because if it was Mac Jones, no one would know shit and we'd be hearing Fields name non stop as everyone speculates who we're taking.

When we look stupid in here for hyping a bust, we just move on to the next draft class and start making more uninformed predictions on prospects. NFL teams are the ones working 24/7 year round watching film, visiting prospects schools, talking to coaches/teammates/family members/professors/girlfriends and anyone else that can give them insight into the prospect. We just watch games and highlights and then act like we are now knowledgeable enough to become backseat drivers because we have NOTHING TO LOSE.

I hyped Quinnen Williams over Bosa, but guess who was right and who was wrong? Now what happens if I was right and Lynch was wrong? I get to say something stupid like ""I told you so!"" BUT Lynch is now on the hot seat because this is HIS JOB. Anyone sitting in here screaming for a prospect literally has NO CLUE what hell we are talking about. We don't have access to anything other than game film. No background reports, medical history, and no player access to determine if a QB is capable of learning a team's offense. We need to stop pretending like we can do a better job than someone like Kyle Shanahan, John Lynch and Adam Peters, who do this professionally and have way more resources than us.

All these forums, social media and everywhere else where draft talks take place become unbearable during draft time for EVERY sport because everyone has an opinion and this is their chance to beat their chest because there is no downside to being wrong.

Kyle Shanahan, John Lynch and Adam Peters know this is a franchise altering move and selection, maybe we should chill out and let them do what they believe is the best decision for the franchise going forward. Anyone still using Solomon Thomas over wAtSoN/mAHoMeS tHoUgH and then we took bEaThArD! are straight up acting ignorant.

1115,15529,15529,BKNas,"It's kind of crazy to me how many keep ignoring this, when the words have come from Kyle himself. He has to change up his whole offense because the staple plays of his current offense won't be as effective if the QB can run and the defense keys in on them on bootlegs and other plays that normally are more effective with pocket passers. He'd have to do what he did in Washington, and I don't think he wants to go that route UNLESS the QB is a dynamic pocket QB that can scramble when the play isn't there or when the pocket collapses. 

I think that's what he regrets most about Mahomes and Watson, because he didn't seem to recognize how effective both were from the pocket, with the athletic ability to do more. It's going to be interesting to see if Kyle believes any of these mobile QB's can get to that level where their pocket ability forces defenses to stay honest and not always worry about their legs. I don't see that in Lance, and that's not a negative in another offense, but Fields does have a chance to be another Watson type with more development.

So the question is do you go the safe route and take your prototypical QB in Mac Jones, who will most likely run this offense to perfection, but his upside is closer to Ryan/Cousins? Or do you take a chance on Fields and trust that you can develop him into a guy that has top 5 QB potential, but much more risk of not panning out?

1149,15582,15582,BKNas,"I completely agree. This league loves athletic freaks and this is why so many superstars fall out of the first round because teams rather shoot for the stars and then hope their coaches can teach athletic prospects how to play football. For every Josh Allen, there are tons of Jake Locker and EJ Manuel types that got drafted in the 1st solely because of athletic potential and many overlook the minimum skills a QB should have to succeed.

IMO Jones is one of the best pure pocket QB's since probably Matt Ryan. There have been other guys, but all had questionable traits like lack of leadership, weaker arms, bad pocket awareness, or just weren't fully dedicated to their craft, which you need to have if you're not a great athlete. If you aren't a great athlete you basically have to live in the film room to give yourself a leg up on the competition. This is the reason some guys put together HOF careers like Brady/Brees, and even Sherman on the other side of the ball, all because they were highly intelligent football junkies that knew what opposing teams were doing before the snap. 

Mac Jones seems to have that same high intelligence and obsessive drive that many greats have used to give them an edge. His feel for the game is pretty incredible. His top notch preparation allows him to always seem calm, cool and collected, no matter the situation. You won't find too much film of him panicking and it leading to a negative play. It's very hard to teach raw QB's how to manipulate defenders with subtle body movements and his eyes the way Jones already does. There are pro QB's that still struggle with stuff like this and Mac does it already after only starting for one season.

Buffalo switched to white facemasks last year, and it works in my opinion because they use white helmets.

3374,31491,31491,Caleb10E,"Some of Maiocco's points that stand out:

* Garoppolo wanted to avoid surgery, but his hand was forced after little to no improvement to his shoulder one month after the season. The surgery should ensure that Jimmy will be 100% for 2022 and beyond, but it means he's recovering during the start of free agency.

* Maiocco is no longer certain that there is a starting opportunity for Garoppolo available. Carolina and Seattle are two likely options, but it's unlikely that either of those teams would be willing to send draft picks to San Francisco and pay Garoppolo $25.5 million for one year while they have QBs like Darnold and Lock on their roster.

* *""The 49ers’ best option is to sit tight, wait for Garoppolo to get healthy and see if anything changes around the league where he might become more attractive to another team.""*

* Garoppolo has already said his public goodbyes after the NFCCG. Sudfeld getting a fully-guaranteed $2 million contract also indicates that he's to be Lance's backup. This could change if Jimmy is willing to come back with a pay cut, but that seems doubtful. *""Under his current contract, it does not make much sense to retain Garoppolo.""*

* Important bit for everybody complaining about our quiet free agency: *""If the 49ers had that $25 million cushion right now, it would not change their approach to free agency. They spent for cornerback Charvarius Ward. He was their big-ticket item. The remaining spots on the roster will be filled by lower-priced free agents and draft picks. There is no big rush to create that additional cap room because most of that money will be going to players already on the team.""*

* ***""Neither Garoppolo nor John Lynch nor Kyle Shanahan nor Paraag Marathe is to blame for this situation. Garoppolo was injured. He required surgery. A trade could not happen without a trade partner, and Garoppolo's inability to participate in the offseason program likely prompted some teams to pass.""***

* Maiocco believes that Lance will be starting for the 49ers in 2022, that Garoppolo will be playing elsewhere, that it's not likely the 49ers get anything in return for Garoppolo, but also -- after what we've already witnessed -- that anything can happen at this point.",104.0,49ers,t3_tk5prw,False,0.0,:navorrobowman: NaVorro Bowman,2022-03-22T10:36:38Z,49ers,0.0042887455456417

Yet San Francisco regretted all its blown chances:

• Incompletions on third and fourth downs from the Seattle 1 in the opening quarter.

• A fumble on a punt-return reverse botched by Arnaz Battle and Brandon Jones.

• Another fumble by Gore, when the 49ers finally dusted off the mothballed runner. It was forced by Jordan Babineaux at the Seattle 22 and returned 43 yards by Josh Wilson to set up Mare's first field goal of the final quarter.

• Davis having Smith's would-be touchdown pass zip through his hands and off his facemask in the end zone while down 17-14 late in the game.

I only watched two or three BYU games last year and my thoughts around him usually made me think he can make throws but his receivers were also usually open.

I'd wager you're right, he would have difficulty adjusting to NFL level defenses, it's possible he could but he hasn't shown that he can, but the good news is he can at least not miss wide open receivers and if our QB of two years ago could have hit wide open guys down the field we would have won a superbowl so maybe someone with these characteristics is someone that could excel in Shanny's system.

43 Greg Newsome II - Northwestern - I have no idea how to grade CBs and I'm taking a stab in the dark near enough knowing there's a bunch of round 2 CBs that we could get.  Newsome seems to have good potential and we could probably trade down a bit to get him.  

102 Davis Mills - QB - Stanford  - I love getting project QBs, it's a weakness of mine,  Davis Miles has a lot of potential and has shown barely any of it, he feels a bit like CJ to me with hopefully a higher ceiling and we all know how much Lynch likes Stanford guys.

He said he was the greatest route runner of all time, not the greatest receiver. Said he never felt like he had the physical tools to be dominant and worked extra hard during the off-season to perfect his cuts and catches. 

But he said in today’s NFL, receivers don’t focus as much on route running. There are route trees now, and it’s about getting to your spot on the correct coverage read. Even when the DB throws off your timing or positioning.

Definitely one of the better early Super Bowls, but given how many of those were blowouts, that’s not saying much. If you’re going by quality relative to other a Super Bowls of the era then fine, it’s pretty elite (though I would contend the next Pittsburgh victory in Super Bowl XIV was better — I believe that game still holds the record for lead changes in an SB).

Like I don’t know, imagine the exact same game happened today, but in the regular season — would people be getting **that** excited about a game where a team was down by 3 possessions with less than half a quarter to go, and never even had a possession with a chance to tie the game or take the lead at the end? You’ve got some great moments like the Smith drop, Swann’s catch, and Staubach’s close-but-not-too-close comeback, and it was a very high scoring game, but Dallas literally needed a miracle at the end of that game and didn’t get it.

Obviously that’s a flawed analogy since the historical context with Pittsburgh and Dallas playing to decide the dynasty of the decade is important.

What happened is that Buffalo finished one game ahead of Chicago for the championship (Buffalo undefeated, with Chicago’s one loss being to them). Chicago challenged them to a rematch, and Buffalo accepted under the condition that it would be an exhibition match that wouldn’t count towards the championship.

Chicago won the game, and then promptly scheduled ANOTHER two games (winning one and tying the other). Chicago then campaigned the league to include these games, which would tie them with Buffalo, and furthermore to give Chicago the championship by way of a tiebreaker.

But why would Chicago win the tiebreaker? Buffalo won the first matchup and Chicago won the second, so they split the series right? Well, the NFL applied a tiebreaker (made defunct as of 1933) that said that in a two-game series, the second game counts more than the first. This awarded Chicago the championship.

FWIW, several Buffalo players even left the team before their second game against Chicago presumably because they were under they were under the impression it was an exhibition game, and they still barely lost the game.

Here, WC refers to a game played in the wild card round and Div a game played in the divisional round. If there’s nothing after the year, then it’s a regular season game. I realized there’s a few ambiguities here because there’s a few divisional matchups (so the teams would have played twice in the year). For those cases, the game is listed as away team, home team (so Packers Lions 2015 would be the regular season game that Green Bay played at Detroit in 2015).

1. Seattle Arizona 2020
2. Bills Cardinals 2020

6884,54045,54045,Draconics,"Being strict about what constitutes a “dynasty”:

- 60s Packers: The Ice Bowl (in particular Starr’s sneak)
- 70s Steelers: The Immaculate Reception
- 80s Niners: The Catch
- 90s Cowboys: not as clear, Aikman to Harper in the 1992 NFCCG is a decent representative as another commenter suggested. You honestly might consider using the Herschel Walker Trade here as the “moment” that kickstarted the dynasty.
- 00s Patriots: The Tuck Rule (or probably Vinatieri’s kick in SB36 if you want a more positive play)
- 10s Patriots: Malcolm Butler’s interception — obviously the Patriots had a continuous run of success from the 00s through the 10s, but at this point, they hadn’t won a championship in 10 years, and this play saved a Super Bowl and ultimately led to what some would consider a second dynasty for New England.

I think these are the only truly well-accepted NFL dynasties (at least in the modern era). If you loosen the definition a little bit to include some teams that are not usually talked about as “dynasties”, but were nonetheless dominant teams for some period of time (i.e. went to/won multiple Super Bowls in a continuous stretch), you might include examples like

- 70s Cowboys: The Hail Mary
- 70s Raiders: (edit: I can’t believe I forgot to include them!) too many to choose from — The Holy Roller, The Sea of Hands, Ghost to the Post are the big 3 in my book. I’m not sure what Raiders fans consider to be the best (though the last 2 were in the playoffs so I’d imagine one of those.)
- Joe Gibbs Redskins: John Riggins’ TD run in SB17
- Favre Packers: Desmond Howard’s KR in SB31
- Elway Broncos: The Drive, or The Helicopter
- Greatest Show on Turf Rams: One Yard Short
- Big Ben Steelers: James Harrison or Santonio Holmes in SB43 (debatable since this came after their first SB win — if you’re looking for the “start” of a team’s success, it’s probably Randle-El to Ward in SB40) Edit: this spot really should be Big Ben’s near-miraculous shoestring tackle in the closing minutes of the Steelers’ playoff game against the Colts following a rare fumble by Jerome Bettis.
- LOB Seahawks: The Immaculate Deflection

I’d have also included the early 70s Dolphins (I’ve heard them referred to as a dynasty more often than these teams), but I honestly can’t think of a particularly iconic play for them besides Garo’s Gaffe in SB7 (and that’s hardly what you’re looking for).

The 00s Colts and 10s Broncos would also probably be fair inclusions in this list — maybe Marlin Jackson’s pick in the 2006 AFCCG for the Colts. Harder to pin down a moment for the Manning Broncos: you could go for one of Miller’s plays in SB50, but that came at the end of their run. I would consider Manning’s 24-0 comeback against San Diego in Week 6 of 2012: this felt like the week that really confirmed that Peyton was back and that the Broncos were a huge threat in the AFC (they went undefeated from then until the Mile High Miracle).

The Chiefs as of late might deserve a place in this second list as well, having been to 2 Super Bowls and won one just as the Rams, Seahawks, Colts, and Broncos did over the previous 20 years. It’s probably Wasp for them, if you want to include them.

The late 80s Giants also won 2 Super Bowls close to each other, but I’m not sure what would be the best play to take from that era. Maybe their fake punt or their GW FG against the Niners in the 1990 NFCCG?

Other really iconic plays for teams that came in the playoffs/a major moment, but not ones that were part of/led to a dynasty (or even, in most of these cases, a Super Bowl victory):

- The Minneapolis Miracle
- The Philly Special
- The Helmet Catch (the Giants did win 2 SBs, so you could plausibly include them in the last list… but they were always wildly inconsistent under Eli.)
- The Music City Miracle
- The Comeback (Bills), though Wide Right is unfortunately a more iconic play from that stretch
- Warner to Fitzgerald to take the lead in SB43 (despite ultimately losing)
- The Catch 2 and 3 (no bias!)
- Tracy Porter’s interception in SB44
- Beast Quake (kind of a weird one since you might consider this part of the Seahawks later success, but this was before Wilson or LOB so I am inclined not to.)
- The Mile High Miracle

Really, you could probably go on indefinitely with this exercise by relaxing what teams you’re considering more and more. If we stop caring about whether the play led to playoff success and just think about the most famous plays for each team generally, you have some other easy choices like the Miami Miracle and either of the Miracles in the Meadowlands. There’s also Gleason’s punt block, Winslow’s FG block in the Epic in Miami, etc.

Really, the key here would be for the Saints to drop a game, since even if we go 2-1 and MIN and PHI both win out, we would be fine since we have the H2H tiebreaker with them.

6934,54100,54100,Draconics,"It’s worth noting that even though we beat MIN and PHI, that might not matter much if we wind up in a 3 way tie which also includes NO, since H2H only matters if you beat every other team in the group you are tied with record-wise (or lost to all of them). Conference record will be the first tiebreaker in that case.

For example, suppose we only win against Houston and finish 9-8 with a 6-6 conference record. If the Vikings and/or Eagles win 2 of their next 3, we may or may not be in depending on NO. If NO wins out and finishes 10-7, then we would be the 7 seed since we beat both the Vikings and Eagles, so we would win any tiebreaker that is just SF + MIN and/or PHI. However, if the Saints finish 9-8, then the wins against MIN and PHI don’t matter. In this hypothetical, MIN and PHI would both have 7-5 conference records and would go in over the Niners.

The same goes for if we go 2-1. If just the Eagles and/or Vikings go 3-0 (and not the Saints) and finish with the same record, then we would have the tiebreaker by H2H. But if the Saints also win out, then we would be out, since at least one of MIN and PHI would have an 8-4 conference record, and the Saints would have a conference record at least as good as ours (depending on if we lose to the Rams or not), and then they would also have the SOV tiebreaker.

It’s kind of a weird system, and it’s pretty unfortunate for us that the Saints are in this race since we never played them, as that might potentially cause our H2H wins over other playoff contenders to not matter.

It is worth noting that MIN still has LAR and GB and PHI still has DAL though, so we’re still in a decent position.

Do you know how that works? It makes sense that Vikings would win that tiebreak since they would have the best conference record, but the Niners and Saints would have the same conference record, so it should go down to common games played. Since the Saints played the Titans, our common game record would go down to 2-4, and we’d lose that tiebreaker, right? So I don’t follow why we would hold the 7 seed in that scenario; let me know if I’m missing something.

Edit: I’m dumb, Saints are playing the Dolphins so even if they win our conference record would be better. In any case it does seem like our margin for error is lower than I thought since the Saints have the SOV tiebreaker with us, and could potentially win the common games one.

We lost Staley, but Williams is an upgrade. We lost Sherman (probably) and DeFo, but Sherman has lost a step anyways and Verrett played extremely well last year. Sherman was all-pro in 2019, but I distinctly remember there being few people saying he was a truly elite corner due to all the help he gets from our pass rush (and the usual zone corner criticism he gets). We also have some intriguing rookies at CB. DeFo is probably the one huge loss that hurts a lot, but (1) that hardly qualifies as a “a lot of players” and (2) we’re optimistic Kinlaw will take a leap. I agree Saleh is a huge loss, but there’s still great deal of continuity since we promoted from within for our new DC.

Besides those three, our “losses” last year were just injuries (and the previous commenter’s point assumed that the team was healthy). I would also say that our IOL is much improved, which was, along with Jimmy’s play in the fourth quarter and our lack of speed in the secondary, one of our biggest downfalls in the SB.

Edit: also lost Sanders, who made a big difference in 2019–but Aiyuk is a beast, even though I’m still a little worried about our WR3 spot.

It's very easy to pick apart ""advanced metrics"" to justify a narrative.

The fact of the matter, however, is that the Niners administration, top to bottom, believes so little in Jimmy's ability to carry this team to the future that they traded 3 first round picks to draft the fourth youngest QB in the history of the NFL in addition to being involved in almost every conversation for the last two years in terms of acquiring QBs via trade or free agency.

Additionally there were also reports in the offseason that we were trying to move him and **other teams** didn't want to pay the price. Because he's an overpaid, average QB that never sees the field regularly.

Sure, find me a stat that justifies this narrative that he's secretly amazing. When it comes down to it, we've tried our hardest to get away from him. You don't do that if anyone actually thinks he's a top 5 QB.

> What is a big-time throw?

>In its simplest terms, a big-time throw is on the highest end of both difficulty and value. While the value is easy to see statistically, the difficulty has more to do with passes that have a lower completion percentage the further the ball is thrown down the field. Therefore, the big-time throw is best described as a pass with excellent ball location and timing, generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window.

>The idea of the tight window can often bog people down as they ask, “Why do you want your quarterback to make riskier throws?” But it’s less about taking a risk and more about executing a pass that perhaps makes up for a deficiency on the offense. If a receiver can only create a tiny window of separation and the quarterback can put the ball in an optimum spot, he’s now created a big-play opportunity despite the receiver, not because of him. “Throwing receivers open” is a necessary skill at the NFL level, and big-time throws are just one way to capture it statistically. Sometimes difficult throws are necessary, because every offense will end up in unfavorable down-and-distance situations at times, and completing a regulation 3-yard out doesn’t help on 3rd-and-15.

>Furthermore, we may see big-time throws under heavy pressure, turning a negative play into a positive, making a tight-window throw in the red zone where all passing windows are compressed, or perhaps throwing the beautiful 50-yard bomb down the field with good ball location. Hitting receivers #InStride is also important and more difficult to achieve the further the ball is thrown down the field. Well-thrown downfield passes that allow for further catch-and-run opportunities fall into the big-time throw category.

>The levels of grading in the PFF system also allows for us to separate simple “catch opportunities” and “optimum throws.” Consider a 30-yard ‘go' route where the receiver has one step of separation. A quarterback can complete that pass with varying degrees of ball location, either hitting him perfectly in stride, hitting him on his frame for an easy catch, or underthrowing it just enough that the defender can get back in the play, but with the receiver still having the advantage. Allowing the receiver to catch and run is the important part of this scenario to achieve the big-time throw, while simply throwing a “catchable” pass may earn a positive, but it’s a step below optimum ball location.",8.0,49ers,t3_r56nr5,False,0.0,:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy,2021-11-29T17:41:17Z,49ers,0.0327392389241776

I really feel like Lynch and Shanahan think they're above dealing with rookie mistakes for some reason. It feels like they expect every rookie to come in guns blazing and not need development, and the moment they falter they're in the doghouse(unless you're named Dante Pettis). And that's if they get playing time at all.

This last draft was a straight up disaster for us.

* Trey Lance - Barely played, because Jimmy ""just wins"" and ""gives us the best chance"" as we sit at 3-5.  
* Aaron Banks - Apparently SO BAD that he can't play replace Brunskill at RG which Brunskill does not excel at(he's performed much better at tackle), and he isn't even active.  
* Trey Sermon - Barely played.
* Jaylon Moore - Still curious about this pick? We just signed Williams and Moore plays primarily on the left side. I'm assuming he was chosen as a developmental project to maybe replace McGlinchey at RT? I don't know, could just be a solid back up we want on the roster.  
* Lenoir - Solid player, makes rookie mistakes that he has to work out. Isn't getting a lot of playing time even with a completely decimated secondary.
* Hufanga - Killer attitude, and plays with fire. I feel like he's going to be a playmaker if we continue to develop him and give him a shot. Makes some mistakes, but what rookie doesn't?

9641,73385,73385,GoatShapedDestroyer,"This is going to be a watershed moment for the Niners on Sunday, I think.  

If Jimmy comes out on Sunday and loses, I really do think that's it for him.  That'd be 3 straight losses this year with Jimmy G as the starter(but people will argue about the Seahawks game like he wasn't awful and a big reason we lost) - it kills the narrative that ""he just wins."" I'm sure people will excuse it due to injury like that wasn't the reason we drafted a new QB at 3rd overall anyway.  Regardless, at 2-4 our playoff hopes would be quickly slipping away in a division with arguably the best team in the league(Cardinals) and another who look really fucking good(Rams).  

People will say that at 2-4 our season isn't over like it wouldn't take an *insane* rally and grind from the team to make a playoff run, and even then - how?  Our run game is pretty average and we are in a position to rely more heavily on our QB - is Jimmy G suddenly going to start lighting up the league out of nowhere and start making accurate passes outside the numbers and downfield?  How would we go from 2-4 to making a run when the first 6 games show we're clearly not in that place.

I keep hearing ""it's only 6 games"" and sure, that's true, but I can't see much changing between now and a few weeks from now with how sloppy and mediocre we look on offense.  What's changing between now and a few weeks?  We get Kittle and Jeff Wilson back?

If we win?  Honestly, don't even know at that point.  Best case scenario we start to put it together and we make a deep playoff run, which would defy my expectations pleasantly.

Worst thing that happens in my eyes: we stick with Jimmy and continue to have a mediocre season, miss the playoffs and basically just throw in the towel on developing Trey this season because Shanahan can't let go of the dream of running it back this year.  I 100% feel right now like we're operating with blinders on and there are red flags and warning signs all around us.  

I already was in the camp of letting go of Jimmy once we drafted Trey, and now I firmly believe that keeping Jimmy has actively hurt the team by forcing the admin to walk this weird fine line of ""Jimmy is the starter"" when it's so obvious he's not the guy that will get it done and we have a talented young prospect people are begging to see more of.  People complain about Trey not being ready when he could've been taking 1st team reps the entire offseason and *getting ready*.

I'm not nearly as ready to fire Shanahan and Lynch as a lot of people seem to be, but they have royally fucked up this QB situation and I sincerely believe it's going to cost us this season as a result.

9780,73624,73624,GoatShapedDestroyer,"I think people are having a hard time believing Shanahan and Lynch because their position is remarkably honest compared to the way rosters are handled in the NFL.  The Lynch admin very rarely leaks, and almost never leaks big.  When we do get information from them, it's usually pretty straightforward and is usually with intention.

So having said that, when I hear Kyle and John say they intend on keeping Jimmy for 2021 I believe them.  I think they are fully intending on having a rookie learn from Jimmy while adjusting to the NFL, shoring up flaws and getting prepared to take over the reigns.  If you watch the presser they did, this is essentially what they said.  In that presser they acknowledged that they are drafting a rookie QB, they intend on keeping Jimmy for 2021 and whoever they draft they're intending to be the future of the Niners - that was all explicitly stated.  They also acknowledged that it's hard to win with a quarterback that can't stay on the field and also used language to indicate that they'd be open to a trade at the right price.

That last part is what I want to key in on.  They have the cap room for 2021 right now to run it back with Jimmy and a loaded roster - I do think that the team can win a Super Bowl right now with Jimmy G under center I just think that Jimmy isn't the X factor to bring the offense to the next level and he very obviously has durability concerns.  Allegedly he was known in New England for being made of glass.  Regardless, he has a manageable salary right now and we've signed key pieces back to the team - we are not desperate at this moment for a change at QB like other teams picking at 3 would be.  This is why I believe they keep Jimmy unless they get an overpay at 1 or 2 - and that can totally happen to a QB needy team right before the beginning of the season if someone gets injured in camp or preseason.  That's when teams are desperate.  

I do think they are viewing this situation like Alex Smith/Pat Mahomes.  Look back at the Smith led Chiefs - they were killer.  Had great weapons, put up big points, Smith was performing very well - but they were missing Patrick Mahomes and then suddenly the offense looked unstoppable.  

So to wrap that all up, I think the situation is very fluid based on offers and who they draft.

Regardless of what fans think about Jimmy, the front office has looked into other options at QB via FA and trades and if they really had confidence in him as a long term solution they would have restructured his contract already to lower his cap hit.  

They see Jimmy as their best option *right now* both in terms of money and skill level, but their actions indicate they are considering moving on likely due to cost, availability and skill level.  They just spent a ton in free agency, will need to sign Warner next season, then Bosa, Deebo and Aiyuk are waiting in the wings to get paid.  Time and again it's been shown that QBs taking up sizable portions of a team's salary cap are a hindrance to winning a Super Bowl. 

Draft a rookie to develop, stick them onto a team with all of the best pieces you have to support them in all phases(bolstered offensive line, consistent weapons, great defense - sound familiar?) and play out their rookie deal for several years taking advantage of the fact that they're cheap.

EDIT: Just want to add the thought that the QB salary paradox is something that still boggles my mind.  Russel Wilson, for example, being pissed that the Seahawks can't field a competent offense while simultaneously demanding 35+ million a year and hamstring said team.  Same with Dak, Goff and other QBs wanting big pay days.  Are they deserving of that money?  Arguably yes, if a team is willing to pay that.  Ironically enough though paying your non-generational QB talents big contracts hurts your ability to make it to the big game.  Jimmy isn't being paid top dollar(anymore), but he still represents a significant cap hit and I would much rather spread that money around to players like Warner, Bosa, and Aiyuk that have already cemented themselves as cornerstones of the team.",4.0,49ers,t3_mbgzlm,False,0.0,:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy,2021-03-23T11:21:01Z,49ers,0.0466451783273106

I don't understand this?  Drafting a rookie QB makes total sense right now.  Jimmy is cheap to cut the next two years, we still haven't restructured him meaning we haven't committed to him long term.  We are reinforcing our offensive line right now with the Mack signing at Center and the potential signing of Taylor at right guard.  

We can draft a QB, have him sit for a year behind Jimmy, cut Jimmy going into 2022 to save cap space, sign Warner to an extension with that money and have a rookie QB ready and waiting with a year in the system ready to go behind a well oiled offensive line and an offense/defense mostly consisting of players signed to long term deals(Williams, Kittle, Juice, Warner, Mack etc) or people on their rookie contracts.

Makes too much sense now.  With Mack on a 1 year deal at 35 I'd expect them to draft a rookie guard or center as well.

Note: An accrued season, in the simplest terms, is a year in which a player spends at least six weeks on a team’s 53-man roster. There are other stipulations, but let’s keep it simple.
When a player is waived, their contract is not yet terminated. Instead, they go on the waiver wire, where teams can put in a claim for them. If a team claims them, then he joins the new team on his current contract. If no team claims him in a designated period (usually by noon of the next day), his contract is terminated and he becomes an unrestricted free agent.

If a player is released, their contract is terminated and they are free to sign anywhere immediately.

Once that time period is over if nobody claims them or offers them a contract I believe we can add them to our practice squad.",63.0,49ers,t3_pffr2d,False,0.0,:logotrophy: Quest for Six,2021-08-31T17:16:18Z,49ers,0.0044250939133126

Aiyuk's route concepts are down the field and more typical receiving concepts, not as much of the dump offs Kittle would get or the screens/sweeps/run actions with Deebo. 

Lance as a QB has already shown that he will push the ball further down the field, so chances are he will look to throw to Aiyuk a lot. Jimmy would not even target Aiyuk much and would take shorter distance throws to Kittle and Deebo. There is game film from the NFCCG that shows Aiyuk was open a lot deep down the field in the game, if only the QB actually attempted those passes.

Ravens: Electric running QB, run-first offense, decent defense.

Browns: Up and coming team with good young talent. They have been literal garbage most of their franchise, so joining them now would be fun.

Green Bay: Great QB, great passing attack with a solid running back. Defense is getting better. Plays in a frozen tundra.

Seahawks: Squirrely motherfucker of a QB who is the entire team. 

49ers: Hellacious defense and pass rush, with a very dynamic offense designed to let star plays run after the catch. (Bandwagon alert) 

Titans: Exotic smashmouth, ground and pound run game, with their beast of a RB just run through everyone. If you like tough, run people over kind of football.

Rams: Los Angeles, best DL player in the league, arguably best CB in the league. Innovative offense similar to the 49ers, up and coming RB, but more developed passing game. Supporting a LA team is pretty bandwagony tho. 

Chiefs: Everything is a videogame, just run around, throw exotic passes, receivers faster than literally everyone. Superstar offensive lineup. (Bandwagon alert) 

Tampa Bay: Great defense. Efficient offense lead by the smartest QB of all time. Not a crazy good offense, but harder to stop than people think. (Bandwagon alert) 

Buffalo: Pretty exciting QB lead by a young QB who has a big arm and can run around. Not as much of a run game. Plays in cold as hell Buffalo. Easily the best fanbase of all the teams I listed.

Kupp turns to the inside. The ref can see the defender's left hand on the side of Kupp. Often here is where a defender would tug the jersey.

Now, the ref's view is slightly blocked so he never sees a jersey actually stretch. HOWEVER....

In a normal case when the defender makes that pull, it pulls the receiver back and allows the defender to close the gap at the last second and make a play.

NOW... The Stafford pass was behind Kupp. So Kupp slowed to try and make the catch.

The ref here is not looking at the ball or where exactly it's thrown, just looking at the players.

When you put it all together, from the ref's perspective....

Sees receiver turn, sees hand ON the jersey, then sees the receiver suddenly slow and the defender suddenly close the gap and make a play. ASSUMES a hold/jersey pull and throws the flag.

15112,111960,111960,MeanReplacement9258,"Breer from the article: 

Count me among the few who think Trey Lance is going to be fine. The 49ers made it clear to both quarterbacks before doing Jimmy Garoppolo’s restructure that Lance was the starter, and that Kyle Shanahan planned to stick with him through any early bumps. And here’s the other thing—I think you’d be an absolute fool to think that the Niners have tipped their hand at all in how they’re going to deploy Lance. Here’s a good example to illustrate that for you: In the spring and summer of 2012, Washington, with Shanahan as coordinator, committed early to Robert Griffin III as starter, knowing he wasn’t ready to run the conventional Shanahan offense. In three preseason games, Griffin was 20-of-31 for 193 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed for 22 yards on five carries. It was enough to elicit headlines asking whether Griffin was the right quarterback for right now for that team, with fellow rookie Kirk Cousins outplaying him.
Then, they played the opener, Shanahan unleashed the offense he’d built for Griffin, and the rookie went 19-of-32 for 320 yards and two touchdowns, rushed for another 42 yards, Washington scored 40, and beat the Saints in the Superdome. The lesson you can take from that is that I wouldn’t judge Lance until we see exactly what Shanahan’s got dialed up for him. The idea will be, at first, to highlight Lance’s strengths, to buy him time to develop as a quarterback. That, by the way, might’ve worked with Griffin, if the relationship part of things didn’t go sideways at the end of the 2012 season. And I think, over time, it will work with Lance.",23.0,49ers,t3_x8joxn,False,0.0,:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers,2022-09-07T18:16:29Z,49ers,0.0004701374813835

- 1. You just never know. Look at 2019 49ers, no one (not even us) expected *that* kind of performance from a team that was optimistically expected to finish around .500.


- 2. Being a bad team is generally bad for development of young players, and the Jets are loaded with young talent that they need to develop for the future, so it would benefit them to be as competent as they can.


- 3. Moral and locker room presence is huge for a team, whether rebuilding or contending. Having a cool friendly veteran personality like Jimmy in the locker room is great for establishing team moral and culture for the future.

I'd strongly disagree there. There were stretches last season where he was the entire Niners offense, and carried us thru games that we otherwise would have lost, that's kind of the definition of a game changer.

And the fact that he did it without an MVP QB, while also taking the ball from behind the LOS or with very short passes. He's doing more of the work himself with an inferior supporting cast, and still producing elite numbers.

That brings me to the real problem. We just don’t do well here and with just one winning season since it opened it hasn’t had a chance to get any character or draw consistent excitement from the crowd. 

I must have been oblivious to the specialness of Candlestick tailgating because I feel I see plenty of energetic tailgating in blue lot 1.  I’m genuinely curious what is different.

Which one is it? The end result is we know Jimmy G has flashes but won’t go out and win you a Super Bowl if needed to be count on by his arm alone. This is what Mac Jones is, someone who is safe. This is what we passed up in the draft because there is no upside. That sustained top-tier Super Bowl winning QB status can not be achieved with this archetype. I don’t understand how so many people are touting Mac Jones as a miss by our FO when we already know what he is.

It doesn’t help that when he goes thru his progression he seems to find the open man a tad too late as well. I attribute that to just being a rookie.

Lance is going to have to deal with the pressures of getting thrown in the fire. He’s going to look bad at times and it’s going to generate headlines.

26826,178702,178702,ToePunchKick,"I don't think the S&C staff is entirely to blame.

Some of it is just luck.

Some of it is the players the team has acquired. A lot of guys had plenty of injury history to their name before putting on a Niners uniform, and then we all Pikachu-faced when they got hurt as Niners.

Bosa missed almost his whole final year in college.

Kinlaw had to bail on the Senior Bowl early due to knee tendinitis, then - shock of shocks - had to deal with knee tendinitis as a 49er.

Jalen Hurd ended his college career with a knee injury.

Deebo missed almost his entire junior season with a broken fibula. 

That's just a few names from recent drafts. Obviously, taking guys like Bosa and Deebo were worth it, and hopefully Kinlaw is too, but we should be under no illusions that we haven't been rolling the dice on the high-talent/questionable-health prospects.

Much the same in veteran acquisitions. Jason Verrett, Dee Ford, Jordan Reed... nobody gets to claim ignorance about the injury risks those guys were before becoming Niners. Weston Richburg missed almost his entire final season for the Giants. And let's not forget Jimmy Garoppolo himself managed all of 2 starts in New England before hurting something.

We may not be drafting Baalke's All-ACL teams anymore, but the Shanahan/Lynch era has absolutely involved taking on a higher than average amount of injury risk when building the roster (and they have [admitted this and are prioritizing durability more in draft prep](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/38950/how-the-san-francisco-49ers-altered-their-draft-approach-on-injuries)*). And it was worth it, because it turned a post-Tomsula dumpster fire of a franchise back into a yearly contender. But we can't plead ignorance when it bites us.

27596,182157,182157,TrumpBlowsDonkeyCock,"> Owners don't care. 

From following the NFL over 20 years it's easy to verify this. Some owners are very shortsighted and see injuries as a chance to replace a player with a cheaper rookie or journeyman. Other owners view superstar players as commodities and have often overpaid them to prevent them from using their leverage during CBA negotiations. 

There's no chance players get the league to walk away from artificial turf. It's not even the cost of maintenance, that's negligible when the NFL makes $12 billion per season and that's on a bad year! The players messed up years ago and the NFLPA has been weakened. Now it will take either a prolonged work stoppage or a viable competing league to get any meaningful concessions from owners.

Helmet-to-helmet on a QB wasn't a thing until Garcia's fourth year in SF, and even then, nobody cared. It wasn't called that much. Low hits on the QB weren't a thing until 2006, but that really hasn't been an emphasis until the last couple of years. Hell, the horsecollar tackle wasn't even banned until 2005, and ""defenseless receiver"" wasn't a thing until 2009 when the NFL started to receive pressure from Congress to do something about concussions. Given Jimmy's injury history, I'm not so sure he could cut it back then.

I hate to speculate, but I will say Jeff Garcia didn't have a great defense to help him out. He started most of 1999 after Steve got baptized on MNF. The 49ers were 30th in team defense that year, 28th the next. They were 9th in 2001 but slid back to 18th in 2002, 21st in 2003 all, while the locker room was melting down with the Owens/Garcia conflict and that, was also the same year Dennis Erickson took over Mooch was canned.",5.0,49ers,t3_rqz83c,False,0.0,:jerseyaway52: Patrick Willis,2021-12-29T12:23:16Z,49ers,-0.0678717810964638

Jeff wasn't bad... especially for someone who had some big shoes to fill. What's terrible is that these records haven't been beaten in today's NFL...

While former GM Mike Tannenbaum called him ""unconditionally supportive"" -- and he was fired by Johnson after the 2012 season -- other former staffers and ex-players provided a less flattering view of Johnson. They described a man easily influenced by those in his inner circle and by public sentiment. One former member of the organization said Johnson replaced ""good people"" after the playoff run and ""kept people not as qualified, but had his ear.""*

He started coaching in 1975 as an assistant, did a bunch of other gigs before being the head coach of the Browns, then going back to being an assistant before taking over the Patriots. The rest is history. 

Kyle is still very young. He started coaching in 2003, and he’s made very good progress given it’s his first HC job… go ahead fire him. There will be a line of teams waiting for the chance to hire him while we hire the next Chip Kelly. 

I’m willing to ride this shit out with him because the grass just isn’t greener on the other side. That doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be held accountable or he’s always going to be perfect, but despite the losses, the team has generally always been competitive even when their record isn’t great. 

The common theme with teams who fire their coaches every 2-3 years is they lose 10+ games a year before they fire the one they have and start looking for the next. Teams need continuity and firing Kyle isn’t the answer.

Let’s say you’re down 14 with just a 2 mins left (simplifying it down to assume in regulation no other scoring will happen). You score 2 TDs (the only way any of this is relevant). Here are the options for each one. Let’s assume a 2 pt conversion is 45% chance and an extra point is 100% (this just impacts rounding but assuming 100% makes it easier and only biases it against going for 2).

Option 1: extra points only: you go to overtime

Option 2: 2 pt conversions: 45% chance you make the first in which case you kick the extra point on the second and you win. 55% chance you miss. If you miss, you have another chance to redeem, another 45% chance. Miss both is 55% * 55% which is a 30% chance to lose. That nets 45% you win, 30% lose, 25% chance overtime - most coaches would take those odds over 100% overtime.

Where are you getting this data from?

See [this](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2021/insider/story/_/id/31113560/2021-nfl-draft-qb-class-do-stats-match-tape-trevor-lawrence-justin-fields-zach-wilson-others#accuracy). Unfortunately, it's a paywall but here's McShay's analysis:

>**McShay:** Simply put, Jones is an accurate quarterback. That Alabama scheme might have boosted his numbers here a little bit, but he just has great ball placement. Stanford's Mills jumps out a bit too, particularly impressing in the short range. He is getting a little bit of a push as we get closer to the draft. When he gets the ball out in rhythm and on time, he hits his spots, even though his mechanics are still inconsistent. And as a whole, he has been right there in the middle of the pack in most of these categories.

Jones also has a 60.9% (the highest amongst their peers) completion on his deep ball with Fields hitting 56.4%.  In addition to a higher QBR inside, outside the pocket, **and** under pressure and blitzed.

edit: the sample size used for the data provided is over the past 13 starts, so you can't really argue that they padded when there's an equal opportunity that all these QBs could do that.

I was arguing the tweet's point on what's mentioned here. Mac Jones, like Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields went to stacked schools, so in that regard... yes. My point is that I believe that they should be (or probably are) evaluated at some similar platform. In the NFL, it's very unlikely that a QB will have WRs that can get the same amount of separation/windows that they have in college.

Obviously, we have Trey Lance, who has a vast range of outcomes ranging from backup-caliber to top-10 QB and is playing the most valuable position.  

We have a new starting left guard (Aaron Banks), who was considered by many to be a questionable second-round draft pick last year and was not good in the very limited playing time he got last year (although he played at right guard last year with his natural position being left guard). Our starting center right now is Jake Brendel, who has been a career backup with very little snaps under his belt. Our right guard position is up in the air with the two candidates being Daniel Brunskill and rookie Spencer Burford. Brunskill is an underweight replacement-level guard who will get overwhelmed by any IDL who is remotely powerful. Burford is a college tackle who has great pass protection technique but also struggles against powerful rushers, which is not ideal for an interior offensive lineman.  

Our only options at strong safety right now are replacement-level players. Talanoa Hufanga is likely going to be our starting strong safety and while he's a good tackler and run defender, he isn't good in coverage due to his terrible athleticism. Our other two options are George Odum, who is mostly known for being a good special teamer and is unproven as a safety, and Tarvarius Moore, who has insane straight-line speed but bad tackling and instincts. Moore is also coming off of an achilles tear that caused him to miss all of last season.  

We are actually quite thin at IDL with a lot of unproven players. We have Arik Armstead, who is one of the better IDLs in the league.

Tua: He'll be in the same tier as Garoppolo and Mac Jones, and he will become the long-term starter. However, his lack of arm talent will always hold him back.

Jared Goff: He'll go back to being in the same tier as Garoppolo. I think the Lions will be too good to get Young or Stroud and Goff will be the starter for a few more years.

Jameis Winston: He'll become the franchise QB of the Saints. It was a small sample size, but he really did cut out the turnovers last season, and his upside is pretty good.

Daniel Jones: He'll improve and be in the same tier as Cousins and Tannehill. I think the Giants will give him a big contract if they can't get Young or Stroud, which will be a big mistake since I don't ever see him being better than Tannehill.

Darnold: He will be a bust and Corral will become the starter midway through the season.

Mariota: He will play like he did with the Titans and the Falcons will draft Young or Stroud.

30921,203517,203517,assassin349_,"I think we should take Dylan Parham if he's available at pick 61. He has great athleticism and good technique. The only concern with him is his play strength and anchor since he was like 285 pounds in college. However, at the Senior Bowl, he was around 315 pounds and it didn't seem like his anchor/strength was a weight there. If Parham isn't available at pick 61, then I think we should take a safety in this order: (1) Pitre, (2) Brisker, (3) Cine.  

I think center is a good option at pick 93 or 105. My pick here would be Cole Strange if he's available there. Alec Lindstrom would be my second choice at center if Strange is not available at this point in the draft.  

If we don't get Parham, then I think Ed Ingram at pick 134 would be nice. Ingram, unlike a lot of LSU offensive linemen, is actually a good athlete and he has good size too. He has a good anchor in pass protection and good run blocking. His pass protection technique and footwork needs some work though. I think his pass protection is serviceable and better than Daniel Brunskill on day 1 just because his anchor is better than Brunskill's.  

Luke Goedeke could be a nice pick with any of our day 3 picks. He played tackle in college. At tackle, he doesn't have any major weaknesses. He's pretty much a C/C+ in like every aspect I would say. He's got decent pass protection, especially compared to other day 3 prospects. His athleticism is good enough but not exceptional. You get the idea... However, this was all based on him playing at tackle. I think he could be a great guard. Playing at guard might hide his weaknesses more (for example, his arms are only 32 1/4 inches). At worst, he would probably be a really nice versatile 6th man who can play anywhere on the offensive line without getting demolished. His upside isn't that great, but I think he'll definitely be a solid player.  

Abraham Lucas could be interesting if he's available at pick 61. He played right tackle in college. He was a great pass protector. Right now, I would say that his pass protection is probably 3rd in the class behind Cross and Neal (so above Ekwonu). He has great technique and a good anchor. He'll be a good pass protector on day 1. However, his run blocking isn't that great. His testing numbers at the NFL Combine were really good though, indicating that he could become a good run blocker with some coaching. I know we have McGlinchey right now, but Lucas could be a good long-term option at right tackle. I think Lucas's pass protection will be better than McGlinchey's pass protection on day 1, and Lucas's run blocking should only get better and better with NFL coaching.",8.0,49ers,t3_u4m484,False,0.0,:treylance: Trey Lance,2022-04-16T00:06:49Z,49ers,0.0212688867829524

That's without Jimmy's salary next year since as you pointed out his contract is up. Well if we cut him this year we would free up an additional 23 million in cap space this year.   If we spend money of it that would roll over to next year making it a total of 46 million in cap space next year. If we keep Jimmy this year that space does not roll over leaving is with 23 million in cap space. For an example of this look at us the year before we did Jimmy's contract.

But ut even matters less when it's a one year deal because that's your cap hit that year. Mahomes has a 45 million a year contract and hasn't had a 45 million cap hit yet and you sign your players with cap space, not yearly avg. Likewise Jimmy is making 26 million this year. That's 7th in the league. Last year he was top 5 in cap hit. The year before he was top 5 in cap hit. Twi years before that he was number 1 in the league in cap hit. It's only one year he hasn't been a top 5 cap hit so no k don't care about his avg money and neither do the Panthers because they know that one of two things, either hes playing on his one year deal taking 23 million off their cap or he's going to negotiate an extension lowering his cap but locking him into a higher salary the next few years.

34818,231757,231757,dpcdomino,"I firmly believe the QB also helps the offensive line look better. Great QBs find a way to avoid pressure. Russell has always had really bad o-lines for example. Our line can be better but it is still top half (conservatively) in the league. Blaming Jimmy's shortcoming on a terrible o-line does not match up. 

Also defenses are paid money too and the d-line normally has some of the highest paid players in the league. If you are a big and fast dude, where do you think you would rather play: the position that lets you hit and pays more or the position that lays less and you are getting hit? This is minor but on the average, d-lines will be better than o-lines. Not to mention the college game does not produce NFL-game o-linemen these days. QBs have to play with this fact. Great QBs have to bail out the team when things go off schedule. 

Also big play ability also makes the o-line look better. Simple fact is those big plays make the o-line take less snaps and have less chance to look bad. The line will look better on a 10 play 75 yard drive than a 30 play 75 yard drive. D-lines earn their money and will make plays. Jimmy just lacks the big play ability to shorten the number of touches on an offense and spread the defense thin. 

Just look at Burrows. He thrives on the deep 1-on-1 throws to Chase and his line is utter trash. He bails out the offense. If you rely on a pocket passer these days, your team will be at a disadvantage.

I think you overestimate how much they care about raw physical tools at this stage of his career compared to leadership ability, ability to execute an offense, etc. His arm wasn't enough for the Colts to hang onto him after giving up a ton to get him the year before. I think they're similarly talented, and Jimmy is more desirable for his intangibles. Injury risk is fair.

Jimmy came through in the critical situations many times last season leading us deep into the playoffs, while Wentz crumbled against Jacksonville to miss the playoffs. These things matter.

My guess is Washington is the team rumored to have offered a 2nd, but we weren't sending Jimmy to that shitshow of an organization considering the history with Shanahan, Trent, etc. Just a guess though.

And I would not say it's great money-wise for Washington. He eats up nearly all of their remaining cap, the trade is being widely criticized for that specifically. Guaranteed Indy is ecstatic to see that money off their books.

We'll see what happens, but I think the reported interest in Jimmy from reputable sources is real.

If he’s cut, the Niners save a ton of cap space but the most likely landing spot for him becomes Seattle. He probably gets a lot more money to start in Seattle than he would as our backup (there’s no way we would entertain paying him $26M as a backup, we would wanna renegotiate) rendering that possibility completely moot. 

Of course, there remains a possibility that a team may lose its starter during training camp/ preseason.

I started with watching a super bowl highlight, which I think was Packers-Steelers, and watched the SB next year live. The game starts at 00.30AM on Monday for us, mind you.

By the next season I started getting into it a bit more, trying to figure out how the playoffs worked. By that time I kinda liked the Niners with Kaepernick and chose to follow that team. A friend started following Patriots but he switched to the Dolphins at some point. We both got into it more and more and actually play FF with friends, watch a games every weekend and setup a SB watch party every year! 

Also visited a game once (Dolphins-Jets) because MIA is easier to get to and much nicer weather-wise in October.

What I love the most is the depth of tactics and the ""reset"" of the game of every play. Every play you can switch everything up to keep it dynamic and try to outsmart your opponent. Coming from football (soccer for you weirdos) it was a nice change of pace as that game gets a bit boring down the stretch sometimes..

Trey showed he has the ability to go through his reads (limited sample) and we haven't even opened up his running capabilities yet. With his physical traits, you're going to have to keep a dedicated defender to contain him which will open up other guys on the field.

Let me be clear, I'm not a huge Jimmy supporter, but I am a math guy. 90% of 32 (assuming 32 starting QB's) is approximately 29 QB's. Assuming Jimmy is #30, that means there are only 2 QB's besides Jimmy not making those throws. The person I responded to (who I agree with) listed far more than 2 others not making those throws. 

Although I partially agree with your argument, let's be reasonable here. If you want people to take your arguments seriously present more feasible numbers.

He's a hard worker, doesn't take plays off, is a good locker room team mate, can hold his own in an interview, and hasn't been associated with any scandals.  He isn't elite but is the kind of solid contributor who does his job well enough to allow the players around him to shine.”

You'll like him, definite improvement over Sol Thomas.”

Has been moving well in the pocket and has avoided several would be sacks now they're bitching that he needs to spread the ball out and throw to other players.

• Gallman II didn't make it. Had a solid preseason. I bet you the Toots go after him... Fuck those guys. Mitchell has more of an impact all around and he's cheaper so it makes sense. Hopefully we can keep him around. 

~~• Sherfield didn't make it. That one hurts cuz dude balled out. Looks like we're giving Hurd the benefit of the doubt. I'm on the fence with this.~~

Edit: My bad. Sherfield is IN. 🤦‍♂️

• Griffith didn't make it. A part of me liked him over AlShaair. At least we got 2 picks out of Griffith so that's a plus.

A few other note worthy things they turned Marcell Harris into a LB. Which I think will work. Dude plays hard all the time. If memory serves me right he's the one that ripped the ball out of Lamar Jackson on that rainy game. Hufanga is a fucken stud and great to see him on the roster.
