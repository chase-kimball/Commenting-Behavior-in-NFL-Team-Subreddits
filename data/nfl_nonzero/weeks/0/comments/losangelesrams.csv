Small percentages of complications from the vaccine have been recorded, and I can‚Äôt make myself disregard the facts that I would be putting a vaccine in me that we have almost no history with for long term effects, for a virus that has almost no chance of causing serious problems in my case. 

I‚Äôve had covid in the past year, and got sick. Aches, fever, no taste/smell, no energy. I was strongly considering getting jabbed until they stated that the vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent transmission, or infection, but only makes symptoms milder once infected. 

Now I can‚Äôt see a reason for me to get this. I wanted to so I could see my parents instead of talking on the phone, but the jab won‚Äôt help with that apparently.

2087,35193,35193,CrashBandicoot2,"For intentional grounding, the QB has to be in the pocket (this is a relative area on the field that they start in behind their offensive line), they have to be close to being tackled, and they have to throw it in where clearly no eligible receiver (so can't throw it to only an offensive lineman) can reasonably catch the ball.

The idea is that you can't just throw it away to avoid a sack without some effort to run away.

Here's a few scenarios:

Scenario 1: The QB takes the snap, drops back and never moves, sees pressure, and throws it in the grass where the closest receiver is 10 yards away.
Result: Intentional Grounding because he never left the pocket and the pass was uncatchable. He made no effort to avoid the sack by running away, so penalty.

Scenario 2: The QB takes the snap, rolls out to his right, he's like 10 yards from where he started, now away from his offensive linemen, and he chucks the ball 30 rows into the stands.
Result: No flag. Even though the ball was completely uncatchable, he made an attempt to avoid the sack by running away and leaving the pocket.

Scenario 3: The QB takes the snap and immediately throws the ball on the ground to stop the clock via incomplete pass.
Result: No flag. This is actually a special exception in football given to teams to help manage the clock at the end of halves. You can also argue that they weren't close to being tackled yet.

13232,132492,132492,SpiralHornedUngulate,"While I would agree that it would be a tough road, if only look at accomplishments by age, there is a road map. 

Sean McVay has head coached 2 SuperBowls and won 1 by age 35. 

When Belicheck was 35, he was still a coordinator that would be fired from the Browns 10 years later. 

Belicheck made his name as the coach of the Patriots from 2000 until current.

It took Belicheck 10 years as a head coach to win his first Super Bowl. He was 49 years old. 

McVay has a win 14 years before Belicheck did and a 19 year head start as a head coach.

If you don‚Äôt recognize that he has the potential to be the goat just based on the time he may have left to coach, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. Will it happen? Who knows?

You‚Äôre absolutely right about our team. With the turbulence we‚Äôve seen at coach (Spagnuolo, Linihan, ughh), the McVay Rams are different. 

When we hired McVay I had 2 concerns:

1. Could he build a coaching staff at 30?

2. Can he lead men his age and older?

He knocked #1 out of the park hiring Wade as his DC. Fast forward to today and you see see a pretty impressive coaching tree after 6 years. 

As for 2, not only can he, he is a fucking master at it. He brought in players like Ramsey and OBJ who were viewed as cancers by their team, and their foundational members of our squad now. They are helping young players grow.

McVay is just special. He‚Äôs in a class of his own (I said what I said). He may go down as the best coach of all time if he can keep the momentum from his first 5 years for the next 40 lol.

Durant is an undersized corner with short arms and outstanding timed speed. He's smooth turning and running on the outside but projects best as a slot corner in the NFL because of his frame.

Outside of Von, and as much as I loved Von he did not add stats to the team. He brought leadership, yes but his play was the same we were getting from that position before he came to us. So for the leadership lost we gained it back with Wagner, except instead of having two leaders on the D-line we now have a leader at Middle Linebacker which was an area of weakness last year. We lost a decent CB in Williams but gain one right back in Hill. We kinda lost OBJ during a year when WR was a weakness as well.

Zero proof of that. What we do know is the Rams always spent to cap and regularly made huge splashes in free agency in St. Louis after Kroenke took over. In 2012 the Rams spent $98 million on the opening day of FA. In 2013 they signed $86 million over the first 6 days. It's not like the Rams magically started sucking when Kroenke took over. They sucked all though the mid and later single digit 2000s before he took over too. 

As for the rest, everything about what St. Louis did up to the Rams leaving was bullshit, and anyone who was in Kroenke's position would have bounced too. STL promised they would always maintain the EJD to be one of the top 8 stadiums in the league, not once did they honor that obligation. When Kroenke sued the city for it, an independent arbitrator sided with Kroenke and awarded the Rams $750 million. St. Louis just said ""fuck you we're not paying."" So he announced he was moving and STL puts a last minute proposal together that was complete balls. The stadium still wouldn't have been one of the top stadiums in the league as they were contractually obligated to provide. The governor was getting sued by state officials because the way they pushed the funding through was allegedly illegal, so the money officials were saying they were going to put up may not have even really been available. It called for the NFL to pay $100 million more than they agreed to, and it demanded that Kroenke shell out a quarter billion of his own money for a stadium he wouldn't own, and he'd have to share it with a soccer team.

Should we pay  him, yes. Because if you can recall  in the playoffs (where it matters), the dude was clutch. And you saw the impact he had on the Rams in the SB when he went down. Had he not gone down, he was probably going to be the MVP and the game wouldn't have been close. Also remind you, we were razor thin in the SB at WR (woods, obj, higbee, tutu) were all out..

17602,159439,159439,WilliamBillPatterson,"It‚Äôs the offseason, and as we await a DONALD decision (retirement/extension), deal with the loss of Woody, and wait to see if Bobby Wagner is coming to town; I decided to make a mock draft because 1. I‚Äôm bored at work & 2. I haven‚Äôt seen any mocks yet. So, this is my best shot at a mock draft W/O trades, keep in mind I drafted these players based on a couple different websites stating where these players were pegged to get picked up.   
  
**3.104- Luke Fortner C/G, Kentucky**  
Fortner is a multi-year starter with some of the most extensive experience at all three interior positions you'll see in the draft class, although last year he played strictly center. He's played at least 600 snaps at each of left guard, center and right guard. In those 3 years as a starter, Luke only allowed 5 sacks. The Rams have a hole at RG with Corbett leaving, and although I doubt Fortner starts at that position, he can provide versatility on the line if an injury hits.   
  
**4.142- Cordale Flott CB, LSU**  
Who the hell is playing across from Ramsey? Deayon, Long, and Rochell are who we have after Ramsey. I think Rochell wins the starting job with Long in the nickel but the Rams need more depth. Cordale Flott is a versatile athlete with the ability to play as a nickel defender or as an outside cornerback. He has excellent height and length that serves well in both positions. Flott started at nickel for the LSU defense, where he was able to show off his fluid athleticism and quick feet. His issue is he is very undersized at 160 and will be a priority to get that weight up in the NFL.   
  
**5.175- Pierre Strong Jr. RB, South Dakota State University**   
I know we have a 3 headed monster with Akers, Henderson, & Michel with Funk at #4. But Henderson is going to be a FA in 2023 and we don‚Äôt know if the Rams will bring Sony back. Pierre Strong Jr. exploded onto the scene last year with SDSU rushing for 1,673 yards and 18 touchdowns. During his 4 years at SDSU Pierre averaged over 7 yards per carry and can work his way as a backup to Akers.   
  
**6.211- Logan Bruss T, Wisconsin**  
  
Surprised that this guy has a 6th/7th  round grade. Logan Bruss is another guy that can come in and be a depth piece. With losing Whitworth and Havenstein getting older we need a guy that we can step in be a start if needed. Alaric Jackson has shown promise, but it would be nice to have options. In 29 games at Wisconsin, Bruss only allowed 1 sack which is damn good for the Big Ten  
  
**6.212- Matt Araiza P, San Diego State**  
The best punter in the draft, I have a hard time gauging where a punter would go so I had the Rams getting him in the 6th. We get the best punter in college to replace Hekker. Simple as that.   
  
**6.218- Carson Wells EDGE, Colorado**  
Rams lost Okoronkwo and Miller & Terrell Lewis can‚Äôt stay healthy so Rams need to add some much need depth. Carson Wells doesn‚Äôt pop off the charts with this stats, but some his strengths include  
‚Ä¢	Has shown outstanding versatility, flashing in coverage, run defense, and pass rushing.  
‚Ä¢	Plenty of experience: he started 34 games during his time at CU.  
‚Ä¢	Stepped up as a team leader and centerpiece of the defense when Nate Landman went down with injury.  
  
**7.238 Kendrick Duncan S, Louisville**   
Kendrick is a lengthy safety at 6‚Äô3 that can come in on 3rd  and long or prevent packages but would mostly be a special teams contributer. One of the key areas of this is Duncan‚Äôs versatility in the secondary. During his career for Georgia Southern and Louisville, he has occupied several alignments. In addition to playing as a free safety and in the box, Duncan has also seen snaps as a slot and outside cornerback.  
  
**7.253 Cameron Latu TE, Alabama**  
Cameron Latu was a touchdown machine in the redzone for Alabama accounting for 8 TDs last year. The Rams are thin at TE however I think they will be fine rolling out with Higbee, Hopkins, and Blanton and whatever the hell Jacob Harris is going to be. Cameron Latu will mostly  likely be promoted to practice squad but would nice to have a developmental TE in house.

Having the Bills as the opener will set the tone and gives us and idea how the Rams will stack up against the AFC early on.  


i like having the Niners early since we are presumably going to play against Trey Lance, I'd rather play a new QB early in the season rather than later.  Good chance to stack up W's in division.  Plus I believe we'll have an answer to containing Deebo after an offseason of watching film.  


Bye is a touch early but what can you do.   


Post Bye Week until Week 18 is going to be gauntlet.  Out of the 10 opponents, 8 are playoff caliber, 1 being borderline (Saints) and the Seahawks being the only opponent not playoff Caliber.  


Having Green Bay in December is a bad break but maybe weather won't be as bad then.

I don't think this requires much of an explanation




Defense: A

The run defense was shaky, but came through when they absolutely had to on that last drive. Aside from that big play to Chase on the Bengals' first FG drive, the pass defense was decent. Pass rush dominated the second half and pretty much single handedly kept us in the game




Special teams: Meh?

Hekker's first punt was a dud, then his next couple were pretty good. Powell couldn't really get much going in the return game, but didn't lose us yards or fumble. On the one hand, Hekker's botched hold on the second PAT sucked cause it cost us points, but on the other hand, it was actually really important because it forced us to be aggressive on that last drive and not simply play for OT

BTW, Fournette had just finished 6th in the NFL in scrimmage yards the year prior and was signed by a team that had finished bottom 10 in rush yds/game. Brady wanted AB just as much as AB wanted Brady.

The calculation that Snead and McVay make with regards to early picks is pretty simple: will a player in the mid to low 20s of the 1st or 2nd round provide the amount of production that a Matthew Stafford or a Von Miller or a Jalen Ramsey will?  Let‚Äôs be honest, 98+% of the time, the answer to that question is ‚Äúno‚Äù. So rather than playing the lottery, go spend that capital on proven players.

Second: go get players in the late rounds and DEVELOP them. Think about guys like Troy Reeder or David Long. Beginning of the year? Liabilities across the board. Now? Those are two solid, reliable players who this team has come to depend on. The ability of this coaching staff to take guys and turn them into role players is astonishing and the fact that they don‚Äôt get credit for it is criminal.

Lastly, don‚Äôt overpay and don‚Äôt get overly attached. Let guys walk and always assume they can be replaced. The return? Comp. picks and a salary cap that completely undermines the ‚Äúfuture mortgaging‚Äù narrative. Case in point: the $40 million in cap space that we‚Äôre getting this off-season thanks to no longer worrying about Goff, Gurley, etc.
