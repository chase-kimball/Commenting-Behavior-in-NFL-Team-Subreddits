There defense was absolutely massive in helping them go as far as they did. Joe is amazing yes but he didn’t do it all by himself.

My point is that you need more then just a great QB to do well in the playoffs. You need depth if we were to do a trade for Watson it would cost so much for a roster that isn’t talented enough to go far.

8599,73645,73645,Instagrimm,"The DC saga has been wild to say the least.

1. Riding high on The Dark Knight trilogy while Marvel kickstarts the MCU.

2. Release The Green Lantern in hopes of starting its own universe. Movie flops.

3. Start it over AGAIN, this time with Man of Steel and Zack Snyder running the show.

4. Rush the DCEU to get to Justice League, with some moderate success (mainly Wonder Woman).

5. Justice League doesn't perform well. Somehow, Aquaman does very well and Shazam is moderately successful. 

6. This all puts DC in an odd spot. Its DCEU is doing OK but its biggest tentpole, Justice League, did not. 

7. The recent movies with the non-Batman and Superman characters, get sequels, but who knows who is cast as Batman and Superman at this point.

8. This whole time, we get TWO unrelated Batman continuities in Joker and The Batman, both doing very well. That's not even mentioning the tons of TV shows such as the Arrowverse and Gotham.

9. So, while these outside-the-DCEU projects are made, other ""kinda"" DCEU projects are made with The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker. 

10. Fans petition to get The Justice League: Snyder-cut released which also gets positive attention.

11. Newer films are made such as Flashpoint and Batgirl that ARE in the DCEU, but are trying a multiverse thing with Michael Keaton as Batman. Then, Batgirl gets canned by the WB-Discovery merger. The Flash movie still seems to be on to release despite Ezra Miller's many shenanigans.

12. Now, Ben Affleck is rumored to be in Aquaman 2, even though originally, it was going to be Keaton. 



Just typing this out has made me more confused at the state of DC.

He is not only reverting back to pre-COVID policies, but he's removing THAT as well. People at my wife's office used to telework 3 days a week prior to COVID. Now, state employees can do 1-2 days remote and that has to be approved by a Cabinet member, higher on the food chain than the original head of the individual departments and teams.

My wife was supposed to telework permanently and her team has been amazingly productive with it in place. We live an hour away from the capitol; others on her team do as well. We knew the risk when we moved, and when the administration changed, that something like this could happen.

Few months ago, with this admin, she signed a year-long agreement to telework for a full year so we assumed we had at least that amount of time. This governor is basically ripping that up and reverting old pre-COVID telework policies for state employees to ""get back to work"" (the email is the most condescending bullshit thing I've ever seen). 

Our plan is for her to either find a medical exemption or take maternity leave early and look for a new job in the meantime as when this policy is in place, she'll be 8 months pregnant. We imagine a lot of other state employees will look for jobs elsewhere too.

Government jobs are not the best with pay, but having telework policies was a big advantage over the private sector. This will cause a lot of turnover.

* Terrible drafting.  For instance:  JJ Arcega-Whiteside instead of DK Metcalf.  Zero Pro Bowlers selected since drafts in 2013
* Selection of this coach with zero play-calling experience, because he wanted a ""yes man"".  That's why we got Doug, who wasn't going to push any buttons and whose deficiencies as a coach were laid bare after Frank Reich and John DeFillipo left, and why we have Sirianni now.
* Our salary cap mess now
* Retaining aging players like Peters for too long
* Wasting capital on oft-injured players like Jackson

Another point - combining a brand new QB with a brand new coach is another blunder.

15971,140425,140425,PleasantParfait48,"All this Matt Araiza stuff has me super triggered (TW, mention of SA) because I was raped, by a football player at a frat house my freshman year of college. It happened at Wabash College (if you're from Indiana or nearby you might know that school) in the cold dorm at the Beta Theta Pi house.

The guy who raped me was my ""date"" that evening. We were wasted. I was having a great time with him. I wanted to make out. I got in bed with him so that we could keep kissing. I figured he'd feel me up. He started to undress me and I tried to get out of bed. He pinned me down. I told him ""no"" many times. He kept pushing. Finally, he forced himself inside me and the act lasted about 5 minutes.

That 5 minutes literally scarred me my entire adult life. I've suffered from panic attacks, flashbacks and anxiety. I've worked for the past 15 years to untangle myself from the trauma he inflicted on me.

Ultimately, through therapy, I moved to forgive the person who assaulted me. Not because he deserved it, but because I did.

It takes a lot of cognitive dissonance for me to enjoy football. As much as I love the game, I feel like the prevailing culture is inherently mysogynistic. Which is ironic considering nearly 50% of NFL fans are women. 

I can't explain how hard it is to love this game but then come online (not just reddit but all sports media, twitter, etc) and have a bevvy of people blaming the women who were assaulted and excusing the behavior of the players that committed assault...

I don't think Press is a great choice for OC.

""Mobile"" quarterbacks get to be quarterbacks because they are amazingly good, transcendent athletes. In high school (and to a lesser extent in college) it doesn't matter if they are not a great passer. Being a great athlete is enough to win games, and they'll win them on the ground. Coaches don't have a reason to teach them to be great pocket passers, because they don't need that skill to win games.

In the NFL, eventually, you *have* to develop ability to pass from the pocket. Bail-and-escape isn't going to work like it did in high school and college, because instead of being the best athlete on the field, the mobile QB is now one of many of the best athletes on the field, and keeping plays alive by running won't work sustainably. Running has to become one of many ""tools in the toolbelt"" of the QB. Josh Allen and Mahomes are definitely examples of athletes with this as one of their many tools.

All this rambling to say - I do think you're right. I just think it's unlikely Hurts has been pushed to really hone his pocket passing by coaches.

Dude threw for 330 yards, 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Bills scored 36 points on offense. You know who didn't get it done? Their elite defense - the exact tool you are claiming we need to be successful with Hurts.

I love Hurts. I think he's mentally tough, he's a fighter, and he's got a great attitude. He's a good leader. I think he has potential.

If anything, the argument could be that perhaps Hurts has the potential to improve, as Allen did between his first and second years, and again between his second and third years. Allen was able to improve upon things that were a **major** concern before he was drafted, including accuracy and timing.

T.J. Edwards has been disruptive. He nearly had a diving pick on a Hurts near the right sideline.


3) Haason Reddick made his presence felt, reading a toss to Miles Sanders and blowing the play up in the backfield. Fellow linebacker Patrick Johnson ""sacked"" Hurts later in the session.


4) A good day for WR/return hopeful Britain Covey, the 25-year old rookie out of Utah. He made an impressive catch during 1-on-1s, extending his arms to snare a pass with Josiah Scott in coverage. Also scored on a slant during red zone team drills on a pass from Sinnett.

I just think we shouldn't ignore covid antibodies for the discussion of life past covid.  It's an important factor and calling me ""anti-vax"" for questioning things is laughable.

Yes, vaccines have good, lasting protection but both Pfizer & J&J are saying you may need boosters to their initial shots.

Dallas had just denied the Eagles the opportunity for a Lombardi three-peat previous week in overtime in which a controversial holding penalty was called on the would-be game-winning TD from Hurts to DeVonta Smith. Stafford drops back to pass, throws pick 6 and is face planted 2 whole seconds after the whistle by Micah Parsons in a brutal helmet-to-helmet hit. No flag. Cowboys win. Stafford is denied ring #2 before his retirement.

Enter Doug Pederson and Trevor Lawrence. Both started the season in the hot seat, but rallied from an 0-3 start to finish 12-5 and storm through Baltimore and Cincy in the early rounds before blowing out the 16-1 Bills in the AFC Championship game 38-10. Super Bowl time. Dak fumbles the first snap of the game. It’s returned for a touchdown. He throws a pick 6 that’s called back, Trevor’s first 2 TD drives end in field goals due to tick tack OPI’s. But the cowboys just keep fucking up over and over again that no ref interference can rectify. Dak’s 3rd pick is called back yet again, but throws another on the very next snap that can’t be called back. Dallas’ “intimidating” defense totally shits the bed, 2011 Saints style as the Jags pile on Marshawn-Style beastquake run after the other. One such run gets stopped on the 1. Doug goes for the Philly Special while up 48-14 to complete the 50 burger. Jerry Jones has a heart attack and fires McCarthy from his hospital bed and throws his piss pan at him as he’s walking out the door. Doug/Jags lose the Super Bowl by 1 point to the Eagles the next year.

Regardless of what names you or I call each other over the Internet it’s clear that Hurts will be the starter for this year and the next.

Hey everyone, birds fan here!  I'm sure a few of us have come around and offered insight, but figured I have some spare time and if you have any questions/want my opinion on Dougie P, feel free to ask.  If you have some time, the Eagles production manager/writer Fran Duffy is fantastic at breaking down X's and O's and does All 22 analysis after every game and they're definitely worth watching if you want to get a general sense of Doug's scheme. We also have Ike Reese (former player) do some All 22 as well. You can find them on the [Eagles YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/eagles/playlists?view=1&sort=dd&flow=grid) (though I wish there was an easy way to sort for just the All 22, but here's the [Eagles Gameplan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnZ8pcEZ_qfgNwg36vofuNauIG2NtAnVO) playlist).

During the '17 season, people really only talked about RPO's and how he ran them a bunch/etc, but another concept he runs, and is really a staple in his offense, is the the 3 level stretch/flood concept.  He uses it a lot, my most memorable one was the [Alshon Jeffery catch before Jake Elliott's 61 yard game winner](https://youtu.be/urJwLn79EVE?t=403) in 2017.  Torrey Smith goes on a Go, Agholor is in the flat and draws a defender and leaves just enough room for Jeffery to make the catch.  You'll also see a lot of mesh concept, and a lot of variety in the screen game.

Maybe one of the most important things is getting a guy that the players will love and will keep the room together.  He can be very aggressive if he thinks his players can convert.  That '17 year he was the most aggressive coach on 4th down and you start to see that change a ton in the NFL.",7.0,jaguars,t3_sl6euy,False,0.0,fly eagles fly,2022-02-05T14:45:14Z,eagles,-0.0182759688538159

They were also about to lose both Sproles and DJax as returners, and there wasn't anybody on the roster offering anything dynamic in that area. Jefferson wasn't going to give anything as a returner (and hasn't), while JR had a college background of being explosive at that, if inconsistent.

Injuries have cooled the hype around the former second-round pick. It’s fair to assume he will be in the market to prove himself for a more significant contract and Philadelphia may be willing to take a chance on him, similar to when they signed Alshon Jeffery to a one-year deal in 2017 before extending him.

I think he started to have success this year when they emphasized the run; I also have to wonder if they simplified the reads and offense a little bit, too.

I think he suffers by comparison to Allen and Mahomes and Murray, who were stars as rookies. That's the expectation now, that there shouldn't be any learning curve for young QBs, and when there is one, people start wondering what's wrong. 

My main concerns are that there's balls where JH gets the ball to the right spot, but its late (TB INT), or the ball hangs when going deep. That's what I think of when people say Hurts ""can't make NFL throws."" What's frustrating is that he's inconsistent - there's times where he hits those throws beautifully, so it's not like the Detmer brothers where you know they just don't have the arm to gun it downfield. 

I think they're taking the right approach of working with him in the offseason on a lot of these things and seeing where he is come 2022, but I'd also feel better if we got a midround QB to start developing, too, in case he plateaus in his development.
