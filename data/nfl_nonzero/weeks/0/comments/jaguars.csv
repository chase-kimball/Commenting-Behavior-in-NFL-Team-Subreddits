The biggest thing to me is something that a lot of people don’t thing about which is stuff to do at the stadium. In Jacksonville they built a stadium that was too big for the market so a lot of areas have been repurposed into hang out areas (bud zone, deck) so you can just buy a nosebleed ticket and hang out in the stadium or meet up with people who are sitting in a different section. I live in Charlotte now and really threw people off the first time I went to the game and asked what else there was to do. They were just like …watch the game, which is understandable. 

Heinz field is almost as bad as Carolina but the history of the team makes up for the older feeling stadium. Plus they give out free hot chocolate when it’s cold.

How is Jacksonville ever going to be able to sell a potential free agent on it being a winning culture when we pack it in when shit isn't easy after the first half of the season? This is a new era, and I for one am happy this team treated preseason games with urgency and intensity and are not packing it in halfway through. We have too much on the line and too much to develop (that honestly won't develop on its own, by half assing it the rest of the way) to just sit a 2nd year player out because of wear and tear on his body.

This is not easy since Stanford’s offense relies on the offensive line to do a lot of different types of things in the power running game. Despite our line being terrible and not working together at all, he was still the co pac-12 freshman of the year. 

In 2018, he balled out. The line improved and Walker just destroyed people. Particularly, the line was much better in pass pro as a whole, but walker did great work to keep KJ Costello upright when he went the second most season passing yards in school history.
He made all-pac 12 first team and was going to be a top 10 pick, but he literally couldn’t declare for the draft because he was a sophomore. The next year he suffered an unfortunate injury in the first game and decided to return for a final year for a variety of reasons. Had he declared in 2019, barring injury, he would have gone alongside Bechton and Wills, and all of those other tackles people are upset we don’t have. As it stands he opted out due to COVID and worked his ass off to come back in just as good if not better shape than he left in.

The team he ""gave up"" on? The front office gave up on the team a long time before that. Throwing money at QBs that weren't worth half their price tags while ignoring or pushing aside the key players in the 2017 defense that led the team to an AFC championship game.

6 pro bowlers in 2017. How many of them got extensions? Zero, unless you could Ramsey's 5th year rookie option. Earlier in the year he had asked for an extension - ask to be paid what he was worth. At that point, he was the best DB of his draft class. Perhaps the best player of his draft class. Certainly the best play the Jags had drafted in years. Players like Goff, Wentz and Elliot from his class had all gotten paid. Ramsey? He was making under for million as perhaps the best cornerback in the league.

Throw on top of that Ngakoue, a good friend of his and perhaps the best DE from his craft class (29.5 sacks in three seasons) getting pushed to the side when he held out for an extention.

He also voiced that he had MAJOR disagreements, as did man defensive players, with the system. They had some of the best corners in the NFL, and they were playing zone instead on man defense.

On top of all of that, the way Marrone acted during the game where Ramsey sealed the deal with leaving - the way a head coach stormed to the bench where Ramsey was sitting cooling down after their argument to apparently continue to berate Ramsey?

Bevel is new to this team and players. They need time to develop as well. Even Deshaun Watson only managed 4 wins last year.

But like we saw in New England, it was majority Brady that led to their dynastic success; put him on another team and they win the Super Bowl while the greatest coach in league history misses the playoffs. 

And so it will be with Trevor Lawrence.

22359,164536,164536,Tmac719,"I have 2 concerns with Trevor Lawrence, 1 Im thinking will be fixed over time but the other Im not too sure.  So the fixable one is him just seeing everything a little too late.  The only thing he's consistent about this year is throwing the ball late.   Its nice to see he's recognizing the plays but he never throws the WR open, he's always throwing when the WR becomes open and then they're no longer open.  Now, Im not too concerned because as he adjusts to the speed of the NFL I think this will also improve.

&#x200B;

The arm talent is what currently worries me.  He throws a lot of passes that are behind the WR, way over their heads on in the dirt.  His accuracy is worrisome and maybe this improves once his field vision does.  But it is frustrating to have a QB like Minshew who DID see plays develop very quick to now this.  Minshew had the ball in the air when our WRs were making cuts.  sure his arm strength wasnt the best but he made up for it by his ability to know where he was going with the ball quickly.

I'd also like to see Lawrence not so flat footed in the pocket.

If he's smelly due to prolonged poor hygiene (not showering daily or every other day, not washing bed sheets, towels, not brushing teeth), it's harder to fix and you might have to start fresh with new clothes/sheets and throwing away old ones.

I had a roommate who had awful hygiene. You could smell his room even with his door closed. I could smell him in my own closed bedroom when he would pass by in the hallway. Unfortunately, the smell permeated into all his clothes, all his sheets, and his spot on the couch he sat on. His negligence allowed the smell to grow stronger and more powerful that even when he did shower or wash his clothes, it had 0 effect. 

I let him borrow a bath towel for a single use one time. He returned it after giving it a wash and it still smelled. I washed it again, still bad. Washed it one more time out of hope. Nope, still bad, so I threw it away.

Unfortunately, if a person's hygiene gets real bad, they usually don't even notice it because it's been a slow progression for them and their nose has gotten used to it at each progression.

I think it's all circumstantial. Everyone on Detroit hated Matt Patricia.

The locker room is a close-knit group.

Going to disagree, I think Urban Meyer lost a good chunk of the locker room when he did not fly home with the team after a loss and then the tape released of him putting his hand down the pants of that girl. I don't the players cared about the girl so much as the partying after a loss.

It's very very hard to win a championship, so when you are to do so, you try your best to retain that team and you reasonably mortgage the future to see if you can get the back to back. 

Sure, the Eagles haven't made it back to the Superbowl, but they made it to the playoffs the following two years. It's not Howie's fault that Wentz would be hurt both times and unable to play in the 2019 and 2020 playoffs(ok, he started in 2020, but got concussed in the 1st quarter).

He needs to improve his accuracy and his footwork has gotten sloppier as the season has gone on. He also needs to lead guys better too at times.

If anything he needs to not check down as much and gamble more on deep throws. He was chucking it deep earlier in the year more, but I think he's lost trust in his guys to make a play downfield.

(well, assuming you don't already live here lol) [Here](https://i.imgur.com/4u9zooA.jpg) is a link to the official Jaguars parking map that I've modified a bit to show where I normally park to tailgate and my route of walking to the stadium. [This](https://i.imgur.com/AZCTZTO.png) photo shows a satellite view of the lot itself with an arrow where the actual entrance is located ([Here is another angle of entrance](https://i.imgur.com/8fwbOFe.jpg)) It costs $25 to park here and is generally a solid lot. It opens at 9 am and starts to really start filling up around 10:30 or so, though given the Jags performance the parking volume can vary quite a bit. There are also portapotties at this lot located along the street side about halfway down the lot. Of note: I believe all official Jags lots only accept credit card / cashless payments now, so make sure you've got that with you.

The Jaguars general rules for parking and tailgating can be found here: [https://www.jaguars.com/stadium/parking](https://www.jaguars.com/stadium/parking) though some of the lines apply more to parking on a regular paved lot with lines. Lot S where I normally park is a little looser with the regs.

Unfortunately both myself and my friend who normally host the subreddit tailgate will not be able to attend this game, so I won't have my big set up this weekend. I'd definitely suggest making a post here around Friday/Saturday timeframe and see if anyone is interested in meeting up if that is your intent. Otherwise, I've had luck just chatting with random folks walking by and inviting them over for a drink/bite of food.

You play him at RT or you trade him, imo. Supposedly, he had been working out from both sides, and by now, he's had long enough to try to get acclimated to the right side. We must remember, last year was the first football he's played in two years, first he was injured, then COVID opt out. So he was probably beyond rusty.

If anyone moves to OG, it's Taylor. He's not redeemable at RT, but he seems to have many attributes of a guard, such as run blocking plus it would cut back on penalties by not forcing him to take on EDGE rushers who are much faster than him. I understand he may not want to, but at this point, he is who he is at RT, and that may be the only way he could start.

Guards and tackles have much different skill sets and much different builds.

He's definitely not the prototypical thumper LB you'd like to have in a 3-4. He had a tendency to run himself out of the play, he was probably adjusting to the new scheme and thinking too much instead of reacting and making the play.

> Finally, a third advantage of DVOA is that normalization makes our comparisons of current teams and players to past teams and players (going back to 1985) more accurate than those based on traditional statistics like wins or total yards, as well as those based on more sophisticated metrics that aren't normalized (e.g., expected points added, passer rating differential, etc.). For instance, which Denver Broncos team had the better offense: the 2013 edition with Peyton Manning, or the 1998 club led by Terrell Davis? Going by total yardage (7,317 vs. 6,092) or even yards per play (6.3 vs. 5.9), it's not even a contest. The 2013 team were clearly better. However, this ignores the fact that the average NFL offense was much more pass-oriented, and thus more efficient, in 2013 than in 1998. If we take the difference in offensive environment into account by using DVOA, it turns out that the 1998 Broncos offense was slightly better relative to the rest of the league (34.5% to 33.5%).

FO only shares their methodology a.k.a. an outline of the logic used for calculating it. What they don't share are the specifics of how that logic is applied, which is the important piece if we're talking about recreating it. 

From [FO's article on DVOA:](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/methods#DVOA)

> We then expand upon that basic idea with a more complicated system of “success points,” improved over the past few years with a lot of mathematics and a bit of trial and error. A successful play is worth one point; an unsuccessful play, zero points with fractional points in between [...] 

> Every single play run in the NFL gets a “success value” based on this system, and then that number gets compared to the average success values of plays in similar situations for all players, **adjusted for a number of variables**.

FO provides a pretty good background of DVOA's main variables being considered, but the unknowns in the exact ""number of variables"" is enough to make DVOA pretty much impossible to reverse-engineer. Even if we had a full list of these variables, we still don't know how/why/when they're ""adjusted"", or to what degree.

&nbsp;

Despite probably being incredibly difficult, it's technically still possible to get a *loose approximation* of DVOA values themselves, or at least the DVOA ranks.

32380,218224,218224,fonebone819,"Hi all - wanted to tell a story and share some pics of my visit to TIAA Bank last month.  First, I am fan since the beginning, living in the Northeast.  It's been a bucket list item to see a game (not yet), and see a concert at Daily's Place (checking this off in May...).  

My girl friend lives just outside of Jax, and is well aware of my obsession with the team.  The first time I visited, she took me over.  Going over the Hart (?) Bridge was cool, as I had seen it online a bunch of times.  We parked, took a few photos with the jaguar, then decided to walk around the stadium.  It was all fenced off of course, but I was just happy to be there.  As we get around the back, the fence opens up, and I see a loading dock overhead door open...  I get closer and can see down the tunnel to the field...  so I look at my gf and say, let's go in.  We start in, and see a SB XXXIX painting, ""Stand United"" on a wall, the visitors locker room door, etc.  

As we get out to the field, it's all dirt, but what do I care, I'm on the field!!  I have to say, it looks smaller than I expected, but, whatever.  I take pics of the Pride of the Jaguars, pools, video boards, etc...  I take it all in.

After 10-15 minutes, we decide to head back out. As we are walking up the ramp, we hear a noise, look up, and the door is closing! We both look at each other, like ""oh f---"".  I grab her hand and start running for the door.  I had forgotten she was wearing flip flops, so I had to slow down a bit.  We were both laughing the whole time, but I kept thinking the scene in movies where someone is running to get out and has to slide under a closing door... 🤣.  

We make it out with no real issue, and as we stop to catch our breath, we look back and the door starts going back up... 🤔  We figure it was someone's way to tell us our time was up...

You say the hires ok lets see

Gus Bradley: great human being but was statistically one of the worst HCs of all time

Urban Meyer: great HC in college but apparently lied to Shad about knowing the NFL game. And flamed out and left the team in complete chaos. Arguably the worst HC in history, Shad believed every lie. Also apparently was so focused on Urban being the coach that he basically interviewed guys like Bienemy, Daboll and Leftwhich for fluff.

Tom coughlin: he had the right idea with the EVP but coughlin ruled with an iron fist, alienated and sent away the best players with prioritizing Bortles contract over Ramsey and Ngakuoe and handing unjustified fines. I will simply put it like this: do you think owners like Robert Kraft, the Rooneys, Jerry Jones and Mickey Loomis wouldve taken 2 years to find out about the behavior Coughlin had?

I dont live in Jacksonville so the argument of “hes building stuff around the stadium” doesny affect me.

Ok i will out it like this

- 2017 season we were done with Bortles and selected a RB who was anlocker room cancer and isnt on the team anywhere. Mahomes, Watson were there. (Personally wanted Jamal adams)

- CJ henderson lasted 1.5 years with the team before being traded, argument can be made that CJ Henderson doesnt like playing football and didnt even want to come to the jags and was STILL SELECTED. and even isnt playing with the panthers being burried on the bench, and when he plays he gets toasted. K’lavon Chaisson might be our worst player and one of the worst LBs in the NFL. (Again skipping on OL and TE as a need). A blind spider monkey couldve done a better job than the GM at the time.

- Fowler was a reach at 3rd overall and missed his rookie year due to injuries, he never played to his billing of 3rd overall. (Wanted Brandon scherff)

- Luke Joeckel might be one of the worst bust of the 2010s of all the NFL. Called the safest selection and was one of the worst Offensive linemen constantly in the league. (Wanted Lane Johnson)

- justin blackmon was selected 5 overall and was out of the league due to problems with alcohol. (I wasnt paying attention to the draft at the time as indo now andndont remember who i wanted)

- jags traded up for gabbert (when they had David Garrard playing absolutely fine at the time) he was selected between JJWatt and Tyron Smith, 2 potential hall of famers. Gabbert turned into one of the most disliked players in jags history pointing balme at everyone except him and was horrendous.

does our roster have issues? yes aboslutely but Urban has said he had power in roster construction. He selected Etienne in the draft (he has publicly stated he wanted the WR from UF that went to the giants), cut Collin Johnson (who had upside and moments in his rookie year) in favor of Tavon Austin and Treadwell and has constantly seemed to like Hyde more than James Robinson.

Also what has he shown that he is doing a good job. He constantly deflects blame to his assistants and cordinators with his ""i dont micro manage"" shtick. The jags are constantly over coached and out schemed to the point that we are the pick up game for opposing teams. It gets to a point that I actually have to ask... What does Urban actually do? this isnt college in which you can CEO your way to a championship with just recruiting. This is the big boys, coaches have to micromanage at least to a point man.

Do you think Mike TOmlin, Bill Belichik, Sean Mcvay, Kyle Shanahan, Andy Reid, or any other top NFL HC would:

\- Sign a retired QB who hasnt been in the NFL for 10 years to play a position he has never played? (Tim Tebow fiasco, also if you want a TE o i dont know, sign a TE)

\-Constantly deflect blame to his assistants because he didnt know which players were in the game? 

\- Not know who was in key situations in games?! Every coach knows who is in the line up every single play.

\- Not be able to move the freaking ball on offense

\- Have his team week after week look worse and worse with out solutions

\- Not board a plane back home from a heartbreaking loss to go ""catch up with friends"".

\- Deny rumors of college jobs the second they appear (Tomlin took those rumors to the shed and Urban let them fester for 2-3 days and gave a monotone awnser)

\- He constantly doesnt know who is in games at key situations many times and when asked he throws the coordinators and position coaches under the bus saying he doesnt micromanage. Do you really think Bill Belichik, Sean Mcvay, Andy Reid and Mike Tomlin dont know who is on the field for every single play? Also him delegating so much... what does he actually do here? He has shown me he doesnt know/understand the NFL game/META if you will

\- The whole ohio bar incident is still damning, not only did he not board the team planeafter a gut wrenching loss, he couldve used the time to check on the team, speak to coaches, etc. He stayed and got CAUGHT on a bar with a college girl. EVERY SINGLE former coach and player said ""what the actual fuck, that was wrong and very unprofesionall for not boarding the team plane (not even mentioning the bar incident)"" but then the weak ass attempt of him to say ""sorry"" was cringe as hell for the team.

\- penalties, miscomunication, bad play selection, and unpreparedness each and every week is on him. The Jags go down 14-0 every single week and look bad in the first 20 plays.

\- I will stand by this that Urban had major power in roster descicions, Wingard starting, releasing Collin Johnson in favor of Tavon austin and Treadwell, signing Tebow (if you need a TE i dont know.. sign an ACTUAL tight end), giving Minshew major starter reps in training camp, limiting Trevors reps with the starters, only to trade him after 6 weeks later.

\- I still truly believe he talked to USC when the job got open but due to the timing of the NFL season didnt dare to jump ship 2 weeks into the season. I will not be shocked if he Bobby Petrino's the jags in week 15 to go to Notre Dame or OU saying ""this is my dream job"" or some bull shit

What has he shown to say, give him one more year.

4. Dan Arnold looked nice for 2 practices with the team. A long week with him could be more impactfull, oj the topic of TEs, farrel nice blocking

5. WR, CB and both lines look like the biggest needs next off season.

6. They need to find a way to get more pass rush. Burrow looked wayyy more comfortable at times. Also just me stop dropping Allen, drop Chaisson who did more of that in college.

I often wonder what Myles could have been if we didn't change his position every year.  He started out playing one of Gus Bradley's fake positions, moved to early-down SAM/third-down MIKE, then moved to full-time MIKE, then moved to WILL, then moved to ILB in a 3-4.  It's hard to demand consistency from someone when there's no consistency around him.  Hopefully he finds it on his next team.

42536,271877,271877,sandypecker,"So last night I had my first Trevor Lawrence Dream. 

It was set in what sometimes resembled a high-school gymnasium and other times a mega stadium.  I was watching the Jags play the Titans from a set of double doors, the kind you entered to go to a high-school basketball game.   

The pregame was insane and the stadium/gym was packed. The first drive started and Trevor was instantly sacked. You can tell he was under pressure and seeing ghosts. He eventually had a limp left wrist as it must have sprained. Everyone was disappointed as it looked like we had a bust on our hands. 

A couple plays later it was 3rd and goal. Trevor took the snap dropped back, ran to the right to avoid pressure. As he was sacked he threw the ball into the corner of the end zone. This ball was caught by a girl I went to high-school with, Ashley. Her 5'4"" ass straight up mossed a titans DB. Trevor was knocked to the ground against the side of the gymnasium wall, under the patted matts you used to run into in gym class. I reached out to help him up and said ""good job Trevor!"" He said ""this isn't like college, it's a lot faster!"" We both laughed and he ran away, passed the visual field of my dream barrier I assume? 

I ran up to section 408 to celebrate with my fellow ticket holders and to tell them I touched Trevor. The score ended up 32-30 Titans winning. Then I remember the score  jumping to 41-40 jags winning, we all celebrated and it was glorious! Urban Meyer and Trevor Lawrence started their reign with a victory over the Tits!

In the NFL? Because NFL coaches have talked about this several times before because this scenario always comes up. They talk about how it's not easily doable-- especially in a single offseason. Can they do it with lots of practice and repetition? Ya, sure. It's not common for a reason.

I totally agree with your last point about Little though. Don't move an already good OT inside to guard just because you have a hole at guard. It's better to have good depth/competition at tackle.

We saw some of that in the offseason with position groups. However, due to his previous health issues and change in coaching style, I think he's lost a big part of what previously brought him success. 

It's like a job where they bring in consultants who change everything you do in an effort to do better, but you lose the thing that's actually brought you success to that point. 

Can things change? I don't know.

This isn't to say it's the only issue Urban is facing. He's still a rookie NFL coach and he's still making other mistakes. But, I think it's a big part of it.

45528,284740,284740,thomastehbest,"Yes! So jury selection is an art form with many different theories of how to select a jury. Voir dire is Similar to how an NFL team might draft a player. 

The most used tactic right now is more of a jury de-selection. Your goal would be to find a jury of people that will at least consider the evidence and any reasonable doubts you can show. To that end you want to strike anyone thats automatically biased against your cause. So defense will ask questions like: who here has lost a loved one to a DUI accident? Who belongs to MADD? Etc. You want to get rid of the ones that feel very strongly against DUI or lost someone to accidents. State will ask questions like who hates cops, who here was unfairly blamed for a crime they didn’t commit? There are a ton of other factors to look for depending on the case. 

The other method of jury selection is to basically trial your case at jury selection and basically get all of your points out to the jury without a single witness ever testifying.

For instance I could say who here drinks coffee? How many cups does it take your Mr A to feel caffeinated? How about you Ms. B? See everyone here has a different tolerance when it comes to coffee. Same is true with beer. For instance it may take me 8-9 beers before I’m drunk. 

To answer your question: yes an attorney can ask every member of the jury panel if they are a raiders fan. Good information to know. Either side can rehabilitate a panel member by asking if the persons views would cause them to be biased and unable to make a decision based on the evidence presented at trial. So even if they are a raiders fan they can still be unbiased. 

Both sides will get strikes for cause and those they can use on anyone as they see fit (as long as it’s not a discriminatory reason like the state is striking every black juror).",43.0,nfl,t3_ql9tjz,False,0.0,:Jaguars: Jaguars,2021-11-02T15:30:50Z,jaguars,0.0155455287837924

Basically, he would drop back too deep into pressure. Mahomes created the problems with the offense. 

I'm with you on mcdaniels. 

Also agreed on Moore. Mccarthy is known to do basically nothing and only has ever been a good coach because he rides elite QB talent to success. Yeah, I said it. 

Leftwich is right up there with Moore for me. Everything coming out of the TB camp says he runs the offense, and Brady calls him one of the brightest offensive minds he's ever talked to. That's very high praise considering who Brady has worked with over the years. I'd be all in on Leftwich or Moore.

Daboll is struggling because he's starting a scout team O-line and a mediocre RB, so the offense is by far the most one-dimensional in the league. The fact that they're not a bottom tier offense says a lot to me. 

Agreed on Mcdaniels. Patricia 2.0 imo. 

Pederson is probably a good candidate. I would argue he did very well in spite of Howie Roseman's borderline incompetence, and his teams always seemed to be above expectations, outside of his last year when they were injured to hell and back. He isn't my first choice, but he's 3rd to Leftwich and Moore, imo.

Former GM Dave Caldwell basically did no pre-draft interviews with CJ. Reports came out that the Jags literally never talked to him.

The Jags draft board was Henderson/Chaisson/Jeudy so none of that would have worked out really. And you can bet that 76 and 117 would have been used on a backup guard and a slow safety or something equally dumb.

He was drafted by NO but he didn't like taking a backseat while MT ~~and Kamara~~ and developed. The Patriots were interested and were offering a FRP so the Saints took it.

Cooks was set to be extended as his rookie deal was expiring. The Rams were offering a first and it was another win-win as NE could avoid the extension and net another FRP. This was a sign-and-trade deal as the Rams gave him an extension.

However, the Rams window with Goff started to close and the cap-man was coming around to collect. After HOU unloaded Deandre they need a WR1 and Cooks was Available as a contract offload situation.

With the exception of James Robinson who's being underused by the playcaller due to long yardage situations, that's just a patently false statement.

\-The OL is performing at a higher level this year than last year  
\-CJ Henderson was on IR for a lot of 2020 and is playing like a starter this year

So, your completely fabricated point is basically just lies.

As for his impact thus far, let's see...

\-Ownership made the most concrete investment in the city since he bought the team and we have a practice facility and some major real estate projects approved that were contingent on the Jaguars  
\-100% perfect attendance in OTAs which is unheard of for a rookie HC taking over a 1 win team  
\-Defense gave up 37 points in Week 1 then 23 in Week 2 which is a major improvement. Offensive penalties went down as well and overall meshing was up. This is a clear indicator that the ship from Week 1 was righted.  
\-Rookie QB and 3 Free Agents voted Team Captains by players. Indicates the quality and character of the locker room and the new additions.  
\-OLB Josh Allen who had a stellar rookie year but a poor second year marred by injury already has 2 sacks on the season.

Of course not! Right now, the issue with the Jags offense is pretty simple. The play-caller is calling situations that encourage Trevor to make the big play and not focus on the shorter plays.

49614,301575,301575,younghorse_,"**""They're trying to copy Bill.""**  
Not inherently. Matt Patricia is one of the people they point to for this, but Matt was very unlike Bill. Where Belichick was dismissive, Patricia was confrontational. His focus on ""toughness"" was very different from the cerebral style of Belichick. McDaniels and O'Brien both portray themselves as assholes but are vastly different in personality. In fact, there hasn't been a former Patriot coach who's done a BB impression at all. This refrain makes no sense.

**""They don't have Brady.""**  
Belichick is a defense and ST focused coach. He generally leaves the offense alone. His culture, coaching style, and football IQ lead to excellence on the field as long as the roster matches. Matt Cassell went 11-5 once with the Pats. The Cam Newton year was a down-year where the Pats deliberately didn't infuse extra talent in the roster in order make a push in 2021. This argument is tricky because there's 20 years of evidence that Brady was successful so it's hard to say.

**""They try to force the culture too quickly.""**  
This one probably has the most accuracy, tbh. The coaches from Bill's tree are very used to success. There's a chance they are a lot more demanding and a lot less patient which can cause those issues. There may also be an insistence on roster control that certain owners may not always sign off on. 

To me, the true answer is that a good HC is usually never the best coordinator, but the best coach. An HC's job is to basically be the executive of the coaching staff and the ""Director"" of the team in terms of gameplay. Guys who can motivate a team, get the best of out players, make the right adjustments and substitutions, and best prepare the team are the good HCs.

**LOTS of talk about Urban wanting out / not having the right mindset to coach at this level**  
This is actually not true. There's been a lot of people who are getting their takes off about it but there have been ZERO reports of Urban wanting out. There have also been zero *reports* of his mindset. There have, however, been some reports of an anger issue directed at his coaching staff which is different.

Not defending anything about the situation. But this is ""old news"" and Urban still got a cushy analyst gig and coaching gig so its way past the point of anything being done about it. 

  
**Made a rookie QB throw 50+ times in his first game, didn’t even try to establish the run**  
Boneheaded holding penalties on a poorly prepared offensive line led to Bevell sending out passing plays. After a poor defensive showing and a couple *really bad* turnovers by our rookie QB, we were down too many points to try running a whole bunch. 

  
\-**Defense looks suspect at best against a bottom tier Texans offense**  
Defense was 1-15 last year and had a horrific habit of allowing 30+ points. Keep many of those players, completely change the scheme, have a DL position coach calling plays to Myles Jack at MLB isn't a recipe for success no matter the offense. It will take time to gel and I'll expect a night-and-day difference by Week 5

  
**Questionable roster decisions i.e. cutting Wilson to start Wingard over Cisco?**  
No answer for cutting Wilson. It seemed to be about scheme plus camp performance. Wingard over Cisco was all about pitch count for a guy who was coming off an ACL in college. Would hate to have Cisco get hurt in Week 1 and be out just like one of our other rookies.

49661,301624,301624,younghorse_,"**What Can Be Fixed this Year**: A lot, honestly. Trevor will naturally get better. With the exception of Mac Jones great accuracy (in a dink/dunk scheme) Trevor was by far the most impressive rookie QB to play Week 1. The OL *did* have some consistency issues in camp with COVID designations and what-not. There's not a way to get better other than to get more reps and communicate. The lining up issue seems to be a domino effect and it actually seems like AJ Cann is THE problem on the line. Shatley plays well enough to slide Linder to RG if thats something Urban wants to try.

Robinson/Hyde will get more opportunities in the next few games. As HC himself said, you can't run the ball on 1st and 20 and when you're down 3 scores, its hard to trust the run game when you're just trying to get momentum. We all hate Carlos Hyde, but he had a couple really good runs.

The defensive front actually did well to stop the run over all 4 quarters. Tyrod's scrambling and great mobility is what killed us on that end. The Kyler Murrays will have an easier time vs us than the Tannehill types. Rookie Tyson Campbell needs to turn his head more and make a play on the ball. He was a raw prospect who will get better. Cisco was apparently on a pitch count despite his ACL not being an issue in camp. By Week 5 at latest he should be the tried and true starter

**What Can't Be Fixed this Year:** Well, our linebacker room isn't great and our secondary is a little too young. Shaq Griffin seems a little out of his element as a leader on defense and was burned more times than I'm comfortable with. More reps, more cohesion, MORE ADJUSTMENTS will be what we need. That is going to be a season-long project. Assuming we maintain our cap room and pick high next year, I anticipate a far better defense.

MJJ is one of the most reliable receivers and has marked 9 receiving TDs in 2 consecutive seasons. He rejoins OC Bevell and will likely be a reliable target for young Trevor.

Worst Signing: **Jamal Agnew, WR, 3 Year $14.25m**

Agnew is an elite punt returner but a less than great wide receiver. He came into the league as a returner and CB but the Lions gave him reps at WR instead. Paying nearly $5m for a punt returner when we have plenty of potential already on the roster. 

Most Underrated: **Roy Robertson-Harris, DT 3 Year $23.4m**

The Doyle fiasco didn't have a major impact on the Jags in free agency nor with player morale, at least publicly.

The Tebow signing was a bigger story for the national media than the team itself. There were no major public posts or announcements other than a routine signing. He is currently taking reps at TE5 in camp and is likely a PS stash piece. The Hyde signing isn't really questionable. He played in Jax before and played for Urban and he's a reliable backup RB and 3rd down piece.

Lastly, the ""first round pick on a RB"" negates the fact that ETN was a dual threat RB who played the bulk of his college career with the QB drafted 1OA.
