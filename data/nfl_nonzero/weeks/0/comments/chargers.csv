2013 Seahawks - If they were the #1 team in the NFL that season I would argue that the Saints/49ers/Broncos were all top 5 teams that year.

2014 Patriots - Ravens were a really good team that overcame injury and were hot in the playoffs. Seahawks were defending SB champs and a juggernaut.

2015 Broncos - Pats/Panthers were really tough teams.

2016 Pats - They had a very easy path to the SB between HFA and getting to play pretty meh Texans and Steelers teams. Falcons save them though.

2017 Eagles - HFA the entire way against pretty manageable opponents in the Falcons/Vikings. The Pats were a tough matchup but that defense was also pretty depleted by the Super Bowl.

2018 Patriots - All 3 teams they beat won 12 games or more in the regular season. Beat the Mahomes/Reid Chiefs in Arrowhead.

2019 Chiefs - They had a pretty easy path to the Super Bowl with the Texans/Titans at home but they beat a very good 49ers team that was the clear class of the NFC that year.

Nakobe Dean #17 on Georgia is also a STUD at LB who can play sideline to sideline and be valuable providing pressure in blitzes.

They would have been stuck in a lame duck (in regards to new stadium not associated to a school) city with no leverage since the Raiders and Rams would have occupied LA. People forget, the NFL is a business. Eventually the Spanos will sell and the team being in LA with a new stadium venue increases their value and quite honestly this past season was great with our fambase. First time I've felt true home games in a long long time and I've had season tix since 2004 with my family. 

Let's also not forget the constant interference our politicians did throughout the years and especially Measure C. Also the blatant lies our politicians did that Faulconer didn't silence such as, ""Measure C will tax the citizens of SD!"" No. It would have taxed tourists. Are our potholes and homeless issues fixed? Nope. Hoteliers are still making their money though. Maybe Faulconer didn't interfere with the lies because he immediately announced SoccorCity as soon as the Bolts left. Chargers even offered to pay for overruns on their Measure C. Here is some info on it.

""The last Measure C guaranteed the Chargers would pay for cost over runs for the stadium (written into the measure). 

This measure C has no private money or mechanism to pay for cost over runs. Ultimately, that means the tax payers pay them.""

""They have since admitted there was no real money and it would have required another election even that hadn't been lying. But it's irrelevant because Ron Roberts has already confessed he was lying about County money.""

‐----------------------

The vote could not have been county since City money and County money are two separate pots. Sadly, I had too many co-workers who live in SD city who could vote say they would vote no thanks to Petco Park screwing our tax payers over pretty good in the early 2000s with overruns. 

I was very upset when the Bolts moved but at the same time I understood why. I followed that stadium saga from being a young teenager until when they moved. I remember my dad explaining it to me as a 14 year old in 2004 how if we won a Superbowl it would help convince all to build the new stadium. I decided I wasn't going to let inept politicians and a businessman ruin what I love doing with my family every fall. StubHub was a fun tailgate and unique stadium but constsntly being over ran sucked. Us moving to SoFi has really reinvigorated myself and family with loving the whole experience. Home field advantage. Fun tailgating. Big stadium. It takes us back to the prime years at the Q. 

Also, I live in Oceanside and the stadium is 1.5 hours away so for most San Diegans I would guess its 2 hours away. I work in San Diego city and it takes me about 30-35 minutes to get to downtown on a Sunday. 

Also, the Chargers did offer in 2004 and 2006 to build the complete stadium by themselves just for a discounted price on the Mission Valley land. SD said no. I believe 28/32 teams rent a stadium so please don't come at me with the rental rebuttle

&#x200B;

People who don't know Shawn Merriman's career like to blame performance enhancing drugs for Merriman's decline. Wrong. It was Jeff Fisher and Kevin Mawae. In 2007 the Titans were an extremely dirty team. Vince Young handed the ball off and ran into Shawn Merriman. Both were standing upright when they collided. Somehow Young got hurt for a few plays. Jeff Fisher called a hit on Shawn Merriman. First the Titans had their TE do an in motion crack back block on Merriman. Then Fisher had Kevin Mawae and David Stewart mug Merriman down field, extremely far away from the play. This mugging tore Merriman's knee. Merriman stupidly decided not to get surgery until training camp the next season. When he came back he was putting too much weight and pressure on his opposite knee to make up for his hurt knee and then that one was injured. He was never the same after Mawae and Stewart mugged him.  


There used to be a video of the coaches film which showed just how dirty it was called ""more flowers"" on YouTube. I can't find it now.   


Mawae has apologized to Merriman but fuckkkkk him for ruining my favorite players career over your pussy QB.

I'm not going to let an incompetent city and owner ruin my family tradition and fun. When the move finally happened I saw it coming from a mile away. 

Measure C was going to be all tourist tax money buy our politicians lied about it and Faulconer did nothing to set them straight. The Chargers filed with the courts to need a 50% vote rather than a 66% vote but when they only got 43% of the vote they dropped the case since it was pointless. 

Also if you follow Nielsen TV ratings, the Chargers kept about 64% of their viewership. They are still the #1 draw by a long shot. Salties will try to say it's hate watching but there are not 150,000 people spending their entire Sunday afternoons hate watching.

Beer, liquor, and food was already expensive before the inflation started hitting this year. Throw a $5 in there at least to help everyone and all the clubs.

So if someone today would say about a Jewish person that they have a big nose that would be conceived as extremely racist, because there is simply no other reason to say it than to point to the racist stereotypes of Jews.

What Gruden wrote seems very similar to me. From what I read ""rubber lips"" is not a common saying in the US at all, or is it? If it isn't, then I don't see why you would point out a black person's lips other than to evoke that racist imagery of black people. Then he also called him Dumboriss instead of DeMaurice which, in combination with the lips thing, makes it seem like he is making fun of his name also for racist reasons (black people choosing unusual names for their children).

Rountree III offers a reliable approach to the position and an effective NFL build to endure the wear and tear of carries against pro defenders, but he’s a one-speed runner whose ability to create chunks after contact appears to only be modest. Rountree III doesn’t offer a lot of value in the passing game and therefore his ability to serve as a niche back appears to be limited as well. Rountree III has been a staple of the Missouri offensive backfield for the past four seasons; he leaves for the NFL with nearly 746 carries under his belt. He’ll be able to handle high workloads in a pinch, but his effectiveness will prompt an NFL team to have more dynamic options on hand in order to ensure more explosive plays in the running game.

Rodgers was amazing on the deep ball. Carr is still a Good QB, but not quite Rodgers level, so Adams may be overthrown a little more often.

Waller is Waller and will always take some targets.

It was part (along with the JC Jackson signing, obviously) of what moved Michael Davis to the likely CB4 going into training camp. The previous CB1 going into 2021.

The fact that Davis has been getting a lot of first team reps on the outside, versus ASJ, is a VERY good sign. Davis was disappointing last year, but coaches have said the whole time it's gonna be a competition - they wouldn't be giving him those reps if he didn't earn it. So Davis & ASJ or Callahan starting on the outside, with ASJ/Callahan in the slot looks like a much better proposition than it would going into training camp.

Once JC gets back, that DB grouping should be scary from a talent and versatility perspective.

The fact that Bitcoin was basically a proof of concept project, that then became THE cryptocurrency, shows that a vast majority of boosters are not interested in it for it's intended purposes and its special properties for that purpose (like giving the ability to people in 3rd world countries access to some sort of banking that traditional banks won't service). It's already outgrown it's capabilities, but it can't be moved away from because it is entrenched as THE bitcoin, and it's making them too much money.

And those same boosters will say it is the currency of the future, and then treat is like a speculative asset.

There's nothing wrong with trading assets, it's just people need to realize you can lose with regular stocks, and bitcoin, but if you lose - you'll lose your house a lot faster with bitcoin than even an aggressive stock portfolio.

When it's clear that a significant majority of cryptocurrency stuff out there is a scam, it's a bad thing, it makes it hard to take it seriously, and it becomes a joke. The problem is that there are some legitimate people who are into it out there, but essentially they end up unwittingly giving cover for the grifters.

And it's massive carbon footprint basically makes any small positives for it completely irrelevant. Who needs a currency for the future when the future is the world on fire?

I think we just differ on how we use “smart”. You, within the context of football, use it in the sense of how much football someone knows. I think of it as the ability to learn football at fast rate. 

If Person A took French for four years he wouldn’t be smarter than Person B who just started. By the time Person B reaches the four year mark, they might be more proficient than where Person A was at that point in their French journey. 

To say one is smarter than the other at this point is unfair as Justin is only in his second year. Rivers sat behind Brees for his first two so he wasn’t adjusting at the line at that point either.

I know I’ve came across as a far-right, Jesus loving, die hard pro-lifer. I’m really not. I have a lot of Republican viewpoints, and a lot of Democratic viewpoints. Being mostly pro-life just so happens to be one of my Republican viewpoints.

I’m not religious, and I’m not at all against recreational sex. But if there’s so little trust in foster care systems and condoms and birth-control, then why aren’t we innovating there to make those options more safe instead of investing in the one way that the child doesn’t get to have a life. 

A sperm cell finished into nothing that will make a baby has virtually no chance of making a baby anyways. What are the chances, like 1 out of 40 million? A sperm cell that has fertilized an egg and has become a fetus has a 90% of being a baby. HUGE difference.

And yes, men should handle just as much responsibility as women do. However, I don’t think your suggestion is very ethical.

As much as I have argued for pro-life viewpoints, I completely agree that it shouldn’t be regulated. You are ultimately right that you can’t force your lifestyle on to other people.

That mindset is what leads to people celebrating abortions like birthdays, and ripping apart fetus graveyards. That’s what leads people to see getting an abortion as a statement of women’s rights and not a denial of life.

You have to consider these stats in context of each other along with the film and other intangible factors. Yes herbert has marginally worse efficiency stats in several key ways but when you look at the volume of both qbs and where that volume largely came from I think you get a slightly better idea of why herbert is imo better than dak. Even if his numbers were only very slightly better in terms of volume when you look at where that volume was being produced you can see how much running up the score in those specific games helps dak's argument as, if you just take his volume stats at face value, yes he would seem to be a better qb but when you consider how much of that volume actually mattered you can see why herbert is so highly valued. To me, Herbert's volume in context of his still very good efficiency in addition to his record tell me that he was asked to do more for his team to put them in a position to win than dak was.

Not to mention the film and stuff like that where most film analysts I've seen seem to rate herbert extremely highly and his physical traits are obviously superior so you kinda have to take into context how much that opens up the playbook even if that isn't super visible to fans. That's not to say stats are useless or anything like that but part of the beauty of football is how much of it isn't really objectively quantifiable so imo any discussion of how good a qb is where you don't consider how they look on film and the specific contexts of individual games misses a large part of the equation.",1.0,nfl,t3_wueppx,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-08-21T22:06:34Z,chargers,0.1342306181947997
13612,75936,75936,JSchnizzle,"Imo it's worth noting that a lot of dak's numbers came from beating up on shitty nfc east teams and running up the score, not to say that herbert didn't benefit either as the chargers did play the nfc east this year but dak put up a huge amount of his volume stats against really shitty teams late in the season or when the games didn't really matter anymore for at least one of the teams or just against teams that were just not very good last year. Like obviously I'm a very casual fan and I'm a chargers fan so I can't know for sure but the cowboys were putting up 40 and 50 burgers against teams like the commies when they were already out of the playoffs, the eagles who I think already locked up their playoff spot in week 18, and the falcons. Imo even if dak slightly edges out herbert in the vast majority of statistical categories that difference is more than made up for by how much of those stats come from shitting all over significantly worse opposition. Not to mention stuff like epa where herbert significantly outrank dak which imo demonstrates just how much he carried that chargers roster even if it seemed very talented last year when you just look at the names.

Not to mention herbert just has more highlight reel plays and significantly better arm. Imo it's kind of hard to quantify exactly what it is that makes herbert significantly better beyond like ""just watch his games bruv"" and like look at what teams they played when most of those stats were accumulated. Herbert's highest scoring games last season were nailbiters where they literally came down to the final couple drives and he had to singlehandedly drag his team kicking and screaming to wins whereas dak's highest volume games in terms of scoring were in games where the cowboys blew out the other team and imo a lot of his numbers were ""empty numbers"" in a similar sense to how we view garbage time stats from the losing qb.",1.0,nfl,t3_wueppx,False,1.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-08-21T20:23:43Z,chargers,-0.0512203702781761

Context matters and herbert was dragging his teams to victory and any game he was off they lost. If herbert threw 4 ints in a game his team would've let up 50 points for sure. Stats get talked about so often because they are one of few relatively objective ways to measure an individual players performance in a game where the team matters so much.

Ok Mr. AP Calculus, then how do you explain what happened to the Chargers vs. the Chiefs?

A lot of coaching comes down to making smart bets that ideally will give your team a slight edge. For example, during the game-planning process, a team might notice that its opponent plays Cover-3 on a high percentage of early downs. So when they are putting together their call sheet for early downs, they’re going to want to include route concepts that beat Cover-3. Does that mean they’re definitely going to get a high percentage of Cover-3 on early downs in that specific game? Of course not.

No one strategy is going to work 100 percent of the time (or anywhere close to that). Staley went into the Chiefs game with a plan. He knew the strength of his team was Justin Herbert and a top-five offense. He knew that his defense ranked 26th, according to TruMedia’s Expected Points Added (EPA) per drive metric. It was unlikely that they were going to consistently stop Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Tyreek Hill and the Chiefs’ offense for the entire game. He made the assessment that his team needed to score touchdowns, not field goals. He was not reckless about it. The publicly available models backed his decisions. It was a perfectly reasonable approach. And he explained it well.

Did it work out? No. The Chargers went 2-for-5 on fourth downs and twice failed to convert inside the Kansas City 6-yard line. Some might argue that Staley should have learned his lesson and stopped going for it after he failed once or twice. But that would have been a mistake. The third failed fourth-down attempt had nothing to do with the first or second ones. The Chargers went into the game with multiple fourth-down calls that they liked and a well-conceived plan. It didn’t work out. That’s football.

The most common mistake we can make when analyzing these decisions is hindsight bias. As Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner wrote in “Superforecasting”, “Once we know the outcome of something, that knowledge skews our perception of what we thought before we knew the outcome.”

Going into Thursday night’s game, the Chargers ranked second in EPA on fourth downs. In other words, Staley’s aggressiveness on fourth downs had helped the Chargers all season. The only team that had benefited more from going for it on fourth down was the Ravens.

If there was a way to know beforehand whether the fourth-down attempt was going to be successful, that would make life a lot easier, and the decisions would be simple. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Coaches have to make decisions based on the information they have at the time. And we should judge their decisions through that lens.",1.0,chargers,t3_rlgg3j,False,0.0,"Herbert, the Chosen One",2021-12-21T09:06:02Z,chargers,-8.816259642092152e-06

*In December, when Herbert rolled deep to his right and calmly heaved a deep ball that traveled 61.2 air yards (per NFL Next Gen Stats) across the field for a Jalen Guyton touchdown against the Bengals, I texted a screenshot of the play to a high-ranking NFL source.*  
  
*""You'll become less and less surprised as the game goes,"" the source said. ""He'll be the best QB in the game.""*  
  
*The following week, Herbert rolled out to his right and made perhaps the play of the year, throwing the ball 63.8 air yards -- via NFL Next Gen Stats tracking -- while being tackled from behind to hit Guyton in stride for a score against the Giants.*

*Winning helps in the voting, which explains Herbert's standing. The two quarterbacks ahead of him are coming off the Super Bowl, while Herbert's Chargers fell short of the playoffs. But he probably won't be outside the top five for long. Consider that his 65.6 QBR last season was No. 3 in the NFL, behind only Rodgers and Brady.*  
  
*""When you're that talented physically and you're smart, it's mind-boggling,"" a longtime NFL coordinator said. ""Adding his strength and power, he's hard to tackle, all of that; and he's seeing things for another season so will have a better understanding.""*  
  
*Since entering the league in 2020, Herbert has the second-most completions (839) and attempts (1,267), along with the third-most passing yards (9350). He also ranks fifth in passing touchdowns (69), and his 25 completions gaining 40 or more yards trail only Stafford.*

*Long unheralded in Green Bay, Linsley was a catalyst for the Chargers after signing a five-year, $62.5 million deal in free agency in 2021. The Chargers believe Linsley was worth every cent as a calming force for quarterback Justin Herbert.*

*Here's the best way to quantify Linsley's value: The Chargers ranked fourth in the NFL in expected points added at 116.4, a sizable jump from the previous year's 14th-ranked EPA (99.42). Internally, the Chargers credit Linsley as a big part of that jump.*  
  
*""I think for what they do, he's the best center because he's so smart and instinctive that he makes life easier for Herbert,"" said a high-ranking NFL official unaffiliated with the team. ""He might not be able to overpower like other guards and centers, but his technique is top notch, and you're going to play a clean game with him offensively.""*  
  
*His command of the offense shows up. The Chargers had three delay of game penalties all year, and Linsley had just six total penalties all season. And he allowed zero sacks on 1,013 snaps to go along with a 95.9% pass block win rate (fifth among centers).*",5.0,chargers,t3_vvv86d,False,0.0,Felipe Rios,2022-07-10T15:51:49Z,chargers,0.0016178994679017

James bounced back in 2021 with 117 tackles (tied for third among defensive backs), two sacks, two interceptions and three forced fumbles in 15 games. But he still had a few minor issues, including a hamstring injury and a separated shoulder. Offseason shoulder surgery hasn't stopped the Chargers from rightly making James a centerpiece of the defense, though.*

*The elder Bosa didn't earn enough top-three votes for a higher ranking, but he appeared on every single ballot. In five healthy seasons, Bosa has won Defensive Rookie of the Year and made four Pro Bowls. And he just produced his fourth double-digit-sack season (10.5) and a career-high seven forced fumbles in 2021.*  
  
*""He always has a plan. He's setting up his moves for later in the game, and he's got great technique,"" an NFL personnel evaluator said. ""He's just a classic edge rusher. He's a nightmare for a tackle because of the way he keeps you guessing.""*  
  
*Bosa was double-teamed on 23% of his pass rushes last year, but that rate could decline with the arrival of Khalil Mack in Los Angeles via an offseason trade. That means potentially even more production for Bosa in 2022.*

*""Six sacks in \[seven\] games is pretty good,"" an NFL scouting coordinator said.*

*Evaluators say you can't overstate the impact of Mack playing alongside bookend Joey Bosa, and how the two can challenge each other. The Chargers acquired Mack in an offseason trade with Chicago.*

15158,85986,85986,LedZepp42,"from his nfl draft profile: 

&#x200B;

Overview  
Interior lineman who plays with heavy hands to pop and separate for an early advantage, but heavy feet that prevent him from doing enough with it. He can handle some of the heavy lifting, but not all. Ogbonnia will flash as a one-technique or tilted nose but lacks the pad level and parking brake to hold it down as a 3-4 nose. He has very average quickness and does not profile as a mismatch defender. He is not an NFL pass-rush threat. He had splashy moments at the Senior Bowl and has a shot as a backup 4-3 nose but could offer some position flexibility for teams running varied fronts.  
Strengths           
Dense body type with proportional limbs and thickness.  
Good worker with high football character.  
Talented shot-putter with explosive hips.  
Length and strength to set an edge and spill the run.  
Fires punch through blocker's pads for point-of-attack separation.  
Slides and swims into the A-gap for quick win.  
Uses forceful rip power through the edge as rusher.  
Possesses adequate bull-rush potential.  
Weaknesses         
Just a single season as a full-time starter.  
Struggles to maintain lowered pad level.  
Early movements are too elongated.  
Lacks agility and plays with heavy feet.  
Base fails to stay rooted to the ground.  
Has trouble maintaining balance on the move.  
Fairly easy to elude if he finds the pocket.",29.0,chargers,t3_ufh9nc,False,0.0,13,2022-04-30T13:44:10Z,chargers,0.0200158571881334

Pittsburgh fans are great but there are always some idiots especially when you attend a playoff game and the Steelers win. Pittsburgh fans are great until their team wins, lol.  Cinci fans were great. 

Cleveland and Miami fans are good. The dog pound guys are hardcore about their Browns but no to bad. Although I was in Cleveland when they were bad, it may be different now. One of the Cleveland games was the 1 in 1-15, now that was a painful experience. 

I have never seen anyone drink as much as the Bills fans at a tailgate. Because of that there are always some idiots, especially when one fan in the stands was swearing so much around kids in our direction he ended up getting kicked out by the sheriff.

Titans fans were awesome and some of the nicest I have ever met. 

The amount of Rams, Raiders and Broncos fans in Qualcomm when I was there made the game feel like it was an away game.  But at least there you have enough like minded people to offset the other teams fans. Hope to get to SoFi when travel becomes possible.

20640,110125,110125,Orgasmo3000,"Yes, Tom Telesco is going into his 10th (& final contracted year) as General Manager or GM. 

The team's budget is determined by ""the cap"". This is the total amount of money teams are allowed to spend on NFL players in a given year. This number is set by the NFL HQ and is the same for all teams. Teams can be under the cap, but they cannot be over the cap. Unused money can roll over to the following season.  

If a team is over the cap, they either need to renegotiate player contracts or let players go (even if they're good players) in order to bring their team budget under the cap. A good website for figuring this out is called OverTheCap.com.

No, being drafted doesn't guarantee playing in games. Think of the draft as a really long job hiring process. Job recruiters (i.e. team scouts) travel the country all year looking for the best applicants (college football players) for the job openings (football positions) they have. The ones they like best, they call for an initial interview. This interview is the draft. 

Basically, each team's GM and Head Coach is telling each player they draft ""OK, you've impressed us. Now prove you can do the samething at a higher level & we'll give you the job, but you'll have competition (from veteran players & undrafted free agents) & you're going to have to fight to prove yourself.""

So starts rookie minicamp, Organized Team Activities (OTAs) & training camp.  All these 3 combine to form one long probationary period of on-the-job training. The players who stand out from the rest are chosen to be part of the 53-person roster. They got the job. They may not be a starter (i.e. guaranteed to play), but they're officially on the team.

Those who spent the entire training camp with the team only to be cut, do not make the team. (Usually these are undrafted free agents or veteran players. If a team cuts a recently drafted player, the team's scouts didn't do their job very well, so that's not likely to happen.) Thus, they have even less of a guarantee to play with that team. They may make it onto the practice squad (think of it as an apprenticeship or paid internship), with a hope of being elevated to the team though, so they still have a shot at playing games.

Spiller is a frenetic runner who is faster than his timed speed; his potential as a rusher/receiver threat was worth a fourth-round pick. The Chargers signed veterans on the defensive line this offseason, but Ogbonnia was too good of a value to ignore in the fifth. Salyer played guard and tackle for Georgia, adding more power and versatility on the line.

If you watched us last season you would see we blew most of those games because of he would go into prevent when the last drive was happening and it would almost always end badly.

The Holy Grail of Chargers hats. I was able to snipe this one from Poshmark last year and I didn't have to pay out the ass for it. It's a 9Forty stretch. It doesn't fit the greatest (growing my hair out) but it'll be in my collection for a long time.

The circus tent on the end was an impulse buy when I first got into hats. Got it from Mercari and it's probably the worst $20 I've ever spent. It doesn't even fit so it just sits on the shelf. It's a Gridiron Reebok and has 14 panels.

The black on black is another one I wear a lot. It's my only standard 59Fifty so I'm trying to get used to the look but I enjoy it.

24022,127959,127959,SandyEggoChargers,"Here is another article (which I've pasted the contents below in case of a region lock on this one):

https://www.al.com/highschoolsports/2021/08/tonight-was-special-philip-rivers-starts-hs-coaching-career-as-st-michael-downs-mcintosh.html

Longtime NFL quarterback Philip Rivers is in the win column as a high school football head coach.

Coaching his first official game at St. Michael Catholic after a prolific 17-year pro football career, Rivers watched the Cardinals score 27 points in the first quarter and cruise to a 49-0 victory of undermanned McIntosh on Thursday at Fairhope Municipal Stadium.

“It was a good win,” Rivers said. “We did some things that were a little sloppy that I’m probably glad they happened now. We can clean them up and the boys can see, ‘Hey, that’s not going to cut it in region play.’ But all in all, we had a lot of different guys touch the ball. All the wideouts touched the ball. We ran it well. It’s a good start, but we have a long way to go.”

For Rivers, it was a true family affair. His dad, former Athens and Decatur High coach Steve, and mom Joan were in the stands. His brother, Stephen, is on his staff. His two sons, too young to play on the varsity just yet, were on the sidelines spotting the ball.


“Tonight was special,” he said. “I’m looking over and Dad is standing on the track. Mom is in the stands. My boys are spotting the ball. My brother is here coaching. I have nephews and daughters and nieces running around. It was that kind of night, just thinking ‘Wow, what has happened in 25 years.’ Then it was really all about the boys. I told them I was excited to watch them play, and I really was. They had a different approach than they did last week because they knew it would count.”

There were some obvious differences in Thursday’s game and what Rivers has experienced for the past two decades. First, because his team led 42-0 at the half, both coaches agreed to play a pair of six-minute quarters in the second half with a running clock. That resulted in two McIntosh offensive possessions and none for the Cardinals.

Also, Rivers stopped at one point to joke with reporters, who were covering the game on the sideline instead of in an NFL stadium press box.

“Hey, you guys can just walk through the coach’s box?” he asked jokingly. “That’s new.”

He had plenty of time to relax in this game.

Six different players scored for St. Michael. Ezra Sexton scored the first two TDs on runs of 11 and 6 yards. Bray Green scored on a 35-yard end around. Josh Murphy threw a pair of short touchdown passes – 2 yards to Calvin Caron and 1 yard to Micah Farrell. Martin Corte scored on a 22-yard run, and Zachary Taylor returned a fumble 55 yards for the final score. Taylor’s return was the only time a St. Michael player touched the ball in the second half.


“Anytime you win 49-0, it’s good,” Rivers said. “I think we know what is ahead. We are going to play two top 10 teams in 4A in the next few weeks, starting with Jackson next week. We know what’s coming. As a young program growing, to have a game scheduled like this – no disrespect to McIntosh – but as we continue to grow this thing, those aren’t games we are going to play.”

St. Michael hosts Class 4A No. 10 Jackson next Thursday, then travels to Mobile to play No. 3 Williamson on Sept. 10.

McIntosh was called for 10 penalties, while St. Michael was not flagged. The Cardinal defense forced three turnovers and held the Demons to just 28 yards rushing on 26 carries. Nine McIntosh running plays went for a loss of yards. The longest gain of the night was 14 yards. The Demons were 2-of-7 through the air for minus-2 yards.

Despite the lopsided matchup, Rivers still reflected on the significance of the moment and on high school football in general.

“After playing 50 something college games and 250 something NFL games – those Thursday and Friday nights in high school, being around it at Decatur High growing up and playing, they are some of my favorite memories,” he said. “They are in the top 10. I can think of a handful right now. It’s awesome. I’m trying to remind these kids of that because most of them aren’t going to play beyond high school football. We have a handful that can play at the next level and want to, and I want them to want to. But I also want them to appreciate experiences like this. You won a football game. Be excited. It’s awesome, and I’m enjoying the heck out of it.”

Not trying to be an ass here but can you explain this to me? These are two things I have read/heard about the vaccine: 

1. The vaccine does not prevent you from contracting the virus

2. The vaccine does not prevent you from spreading the virus if you contract it, symptomatic or otherwise.

Murray, I initially was very excited thinking that his side line to side line tackling and play making on OK was going to translate to the NFL and possibly have a Luke Kuechly type presence in the middle of our defense for years to come. I would just be happy if he could just settle into a solid starter position at this point.  
And Slater, I was absolutely thrilled to see the chargers have Slater slide to them and them not try and get to fancy or outthink themselves. I think realizing they have the real deal with Herbert and putting the pieces around him to keep up on the field and upright should continue to be the focus until the line is 5 completely high level Oline men.",1.0,chargers,t3_u9fjv7,False,0.0,Bolt Gang or Dont Bang,2022-04-22T15:22:58Z,chargers,0.025933952

My friend (raiders fan), however, did end up going and was sitting front row on the visitors sideline (by the chargers benches). I printed and sent him the photo and asked him to try and get Herbert (or any player really) to sign it.  After the game, he waved over and gave it to a chargers employee and basically said something like “it would make my friend’s life if you got Herbert to sign this”. The guy laughed, took it, and came back around 20 minutes later with a signature while cleaning up the benches, etc. [This is the photo my friend sent from the hotel, so I wasn’t totally positive it was Herbert’s.](https://i.imgur.com/JG3On4m.jpg). He mailed it to me and after comparing it online, it looks like it’s the real deal 😂 

I don’t have proof that my friend (or the chargers employee) didn’t forge it, but I’m gonna choose to believe it’s real and get it framed.  People will now come to my house and see a framed autographed photo of my butt on the wall.  Just a funny story I thought you guys might enjoy lmao

Edit: I had originally posted this on Twitter but deleted it because I received backlash from some chargers fans who said “I could get in trouble” for posting it and that “it isn’t real”, but I just wanted to share the story with somebody because I thought it was funny. 🤷‍♀️ I may end up deleting it here too if I get any threats of legal backlash.

They were also worst in the NFL on 3rd down because early down runs often left short yardage and 3rd and short was like a give me for 2-3 yards by the RB.

I think the reason a lot of Chargers fans are really hype is the improvement against the run and players that can run Staleys scheme.

26825,147714,147714,TheRealPort,"Takeaways from this game:

-	Run defense is a very serious issue for a lot of reasons, but the best we can hope for this year is the players we have getting healthy and becoming more comfortable in the scheme. And better tackling. We just don’t have the players we need right now.

-	Offense was ass today, lucky they didn’t get shut out. Herbo looked totally off, from the throws to decision-making. All the dropped passes didn’t help either. Run game got dominated. Our weak early down play calling got exposed in the first half. It seemed like Lombardi tried to switch it up in the second half but offense couldn’t get anything going. Either way, it’s still way too conservative considering the weapons we have.

-	I’m sick of Vizcaino. At least Badgely made his PAT’s. I get we’re trying to avoid another Koo or Lambo situation, but they weren’t this bad. There’s gotta be somebody else.

Burrow is a great young quarterback that I'm excited to see grow into a pro bowl player. He has not ""easily"" been the better QB

Burrow's main stats on the season: 640 passing yards, 70.7 completion percentage, 7 TDs, 4 INTs. Let's even include wins 2-1 on the season. 

Herbert's main stats: 956 yards, 69.8%, 6 TDs, 3 INTs, 2-1 record. 

They are very close to each other in a few categories.  Completion %, TDs, and INTs. Completely even in wins. Herbert has over 300 yards more passing.

Then there are more advanced stats that show Herbert is tied with Derek Carr as the best 3rd and 4th down QBs with a grade of 90.3, per PFF.

ESPN QBR Ranking has Herbert at 54.8 (16th) and Burrow at 41.2 (24th)

1. Derwin James and Justin Herbert are essentially the heart and soul of our team. Other names to watch out for are Rayshawn Slater, Keenan Allen, Austin Ekeler, Mike Williams, Joey Bosa, Kyzer White, Justin Jones, Asante Samuel

2. The future looks incredible. Almost all Super Bowl winning teams, barring Tom Brady teams, have a QB on the rookie wage scale leading them. Herbie has the talent and now the coach to help us get a lot better. Brandon Staley seems legit as the HC for a long time. We have tons of stars on both sides of the ball, an OL I can actually believe in for the first time since the late 2000s, innovative scheme, and aggressive mindset.

27920,155253,155253,TrueJP,"TLDR: Last year, teams could dictate the terms of key moments on both sides of the ball because our personnel was still comprised of players meant to fit previous coaches' schemes, not Staley's. This is unlikely to be the case in 2022.


I think you're asking if the defense will implement scheme changes away from the lighter boxes and heavy DB sets of last year. Of course you may also be asking about the scheme change from Bradley's Seattle defense to Staley's Fangio-inspired, Rams defense.

In either case the answer is the same: last year's personnel matched Bradley's defense, not Staley's. There were two issues here.

First, we didn't have the versatility from our personnel. Staley uses a lot of disguised fronts which have to be equally effective against run or pass. The idea is that you rely on post snap rotation to confuse the opposing offense. In theory you don't even need world beaters, just versatility; equally good, run v pass, a bunch of hybrid safeties and LBs. Last year we had too many traditional position players. CBs who couldn't stop the run. LBs who could defend the pass. It didn't matter how well we disguised our front because opposing offenses could count on even our run heavy sets being ineffectual due to personnel. And in those obvious running downs, they could either ram it down or throat or exploit or LBs. That shouldn't be the case this year given our additions.

Second, we consistently failed to control the line of scrimmage, especially in the later downs. Particularly in influencing what part of the line would be contested. 

Teams would just double Bosa and throw or run away from Derwin/ASJ, exploiting our lack of depth and neutralizing our best defensive players. There was too much relative safety in too many parts of the field.

I'd also add, we had a similar problem offensively. For us, the right side of our O line suffered via lack of talent and injuries. The Raiders game showed just how much influence a single weak spot (RT) can have in limiting options offensively. 

Overall, there's reason to expect this Chargers team will be very different than previous years.

I'll admit it's still an open question whether Staley's system works without a generational DL player to disrupt the point of attack. He had prime Mack (Bears, in Fangios D) and AD (Rams). Bosa and Mack may not be enough if either has lost a step or gets injured. But, this doesn't seem as likely and they're not the only additions.

On offense, there is concern that Telesco has a history of blowing his offensive line selections. But, these were almost exclusively later round picks (he's been open about not valuing early round offensive linemen). Staley has influenced him these past two drafts and that's worked out so far (Slater). I believe it's reasonable to expect this continues.

Lastly, are injuries and our cursed luck. I'd refer you to the ""All-In,"" YT docuseries the team puts out, for both. It gives a good accounting of how Staley is completely changing the team culture and organizational structure. It also gets into the recovery programs he's implemented.

30220,164229,164229,WyldeBolt,"A combination of bad luck, shitting the bed, overachieving and running into a superior opponent, or not capitalizing on windows of opportunity. 

The 1979 Chargers shat the bed in the Divisional Round against a Houston Oilers team that was missing like half their starters, including Earl Campbell, to injuries. Fouts also threw 5 ints, although there's rumors that the Oilers coaching staff stole Coryell's hand signals for the offense. Another fact about this particular Chargers team that also rubs salt in the wound was that during the regular season, they would defeat the Rams and Steelers 40-16 and 35-7, respectively. Both of those teams would go on to play in that year's Super Bowl (Super Bowl XIV). The first window is open. 

The 1980 Chargers lost at home in the AFC Championship game to the Wild Card Oakland Raiders, who would then go on to handily defeat the Eagles in Super Bowl XV. 

The 1981 postseason was the one that featured both the Miracle in Miami and the Freezer Bowl. Star DE Fred Dean also got traded to the 49ers during the season, so their already-shaky defense got even worse. 

1982 was a strike-shortened season. They made the playoffs, but lost in the divisional round to the Dolphins. 

Leading up to the 1983 Draft, Dan Fouts had a contract dispute, and the team almost traded him along with additional first round picks to the Colts for the chance to draft John Elway, but it turned out that the team was not really serious about the trade; they simply leverage in the contract negotiations. Fouts would get an extension and remain with the team until his retirement in 1988. We all know what happens with Elway. The window ends up slamming shut, and the Chargers would not make the playoffs again until 1992. 

ETA: Fouts also missed 6 games in '83, supposedly due to getting shot in the arm. The story goes, that he and possibly a teammate or two (either Chuck Muncie, Hank Bauer, and/or Doug Wilkerson, it always changes) went to a woman's condo to ""party,"" only for the woman's husband to come home early. Obviously upset, due to the lack of an invite, the enraged husband would then shoot Fouts in the arm. The San Diego police then supposedly covered it up, due to the amount of drugs that were found, and to spare Fouts the embarrassment. To this day, Fouts vehemently denies that this happened. 


'92 to '96 was the Bobby Ross and Stan Humphries era. They made the playoffs 3 times, made it all the way to Super Bowl XXIX after the '94 season, only to get curb stomped by Steve Young, Ricky Watters, and Jerry Rice. Honestly, these teams were not in the same class as the Bills, and probably not have done well against the NFC teams, either, as shown by Super Bowl XXIX. The window opened, but only a tiny bit. 

2004, they make the playoffs, and this is when the window start to break back open. Despite trading for Philip Rivers, the fire is lit under Drew Brees' ass and he plays well. Antonio Gates breaks out, and we're all reminded for the next 14 years that he was a college basketball player. Nate Kaeding shits the bed (this would become a recurring theme) in the Wild Card round vs the Jets. Even if they had won, I am doubtful that they would've beaten that year's Steelers or Patriots teams. 

2005, despite defeating a Colts team in Week 15 that was, up until that point, undefeated, LT would suffer injuries, and they would drop the final two games, and miss the playoffs. Drew Brees also suffers his shoulder injury in the final game of the season vs the Broncos, resulting in him departing in free agency. Who knows if they do damage in the playffs, maybe they do. 

2006, enter Philip Rivers. Now THIS was certainly the most disappointing season. The window is wide open again. 14-2. Probably the most complete team in Chargers history. LT breaking records. And then Divisional Round vs the Patriots happens. It's not just Marlon McCree fumbling a pick or Nate Kaeding being Nate Kaeding. Eric Parker was muffing punts. Marty decided to stop running LT in the second half. Rivers threw 3 picks. A shit show all around. Also doesn't help that after the game, a bunch of Patriots players (supposedly led by Ellis Hobbs) decide to do Shawne Merriman's Light's Out dance on the midfield logo. Fuck Ellis Hobbs. Had they held onto the lead and defeated the Patriots, the AFC Championship game would've taken place in San Diego and they would've played either the Ravens, or Colts, with the latter being a much more favorable matchup. They would've easily defeated the Bears in that year's Super Bowl, let's be honest here. 

ETA: Tensions between Marty Schottenheimer and then-GM AJ Smith would finally come to a head, with Marty losing the power struggle. He gets replaced with Norv Turner. For all his talent at drafting and finding UDFAs, AJ was definitely not a people person. Smith being a hard-ass GM will end up biting him in the ass later

2007, they make it to the AFC Championship game, but with LT, Rivers, Antonio Gates, and Shawne Merriman all playing injured, they can't defeat the then-undefeated Patriots. They did play them close, though, losing 21-12. Maybe a healthy roster gets them past the Patriots, and possibly a Super Bowl victory. 

2008, their defense takes a massing dive with Shawne Merriman missing the whole year due to his ACL injury (and not being the same player, afterwards), and with Antonio Cromartie playing with injuries. They barely make the playoffs with an 8-8 record. Win the Wild Card round vs the Colts, but lose to the eventual Super Bowl champion Steelers in the next round. They were clearly not the best team in the conference that year, but the window is still open

2009, despite a rocky start, they finish 13-3 and get the 2nd Seed in that year's playoffs. Lose at home in the Divisional Round vs the Jets, with Nate Kaeding missing kicks (again) and Shonn Greene running wild. LT's last game as a Charger. Also, keep in mind, from 2004 to 2009, they would have a 28-8 record against their divisional rivals, including a 13-game winning streak against the Raiders, starting from the 2003 season. This kind of success vs the rest of the AFC West would change at the turn of the century. 

2010, this is the ""1st in Offense and Defense but missed the playoffs"" season. Of course, we all know that bad special teams inflated those stats and contributed to them missing the playoffs; at least 4 games were lost due to bad coverage, blocked kicks, missed FGs, etc. Winning at least one of them would've put them in the playoffs. It also didn't help that they would get their shit kicked in Week 16 vs a Bengals teams that would finish 4-12. Maybe this team would've defeated the Jets, Patriots or Steelers that year? They played that 14-2 Patriots team close in the regular season, losing mainly in part to (you guessed it) bad special teams. 

ETA: Pro Bowl Left Tackle Marcus McNeil and breakout WR Vincent Jackson both had contract disputes with the team, and had lengthy holdouts that would last well into the 2010 season, mostly due to AJ Smith's stubbornness. 

2011, they finish with an 8-8 record and in a three-way tie with the Broncos and Raiders, only for the Broncos to win the division due to tiebreakers. This was also the year where Rivers fumbled a snap in FG range (contrary to popular belief, it was NOT a kneeldown) vs the Chiefs on Halloween night, which resulted in a loss. They also lost one game vs the Broncos by 3 points during Tebowmania. Had one of those games gone their way, they'd be in the playoffs. Dunno if they would've gotten past that year's Pats team with Gronk breaking records, although they did handily defeat that year's Ravens team. This is where I believe their window of opportunity shuts, pretty much for good for the rest of the decade. 

ETA: All-Pro Guard Kris Dielman and Marcus McNeil both suffer career-ending injuries during this season. The Chargers would then struggle put together another high-quality offensive line for the rest of Rivers' tenure as the Chargers starting QB. 

2012, Peyton joins the Broncos. 2013, Andy Reid joins the Chiefs, with both Alex Smith and Patrick Mahomes starting at QB up until now. They've only made the playoffs twice during this span, and would suffer losing seasons for the first time since 2003. 2012, they finish 7-9, despite a 3-1 start, with both Norv Turner and AJ Smith getting fired at the season's end. 2013 had a wild card berth, due to a rejuvinated Rivers and rookie Keenan Allen, but also a lot of luck and tiebreakers. They win in the first round vs the Bengals, but lose to the Peyton-led Broncos. There were flashes in 2014, but ended up losing out towards the end of the season and missing the playoffs entirely. There were rumors that Rivers suffered a back injury early in the season vs the Jets, affecting his play down the stretch, and severe enough to where almost considered retiring after the season. 2015 and 2016 were a shitshow, with relocation discussions going on, Eric Weddle's antics, and a struggling Melvin Gordon. The rest of the AFC West takes advantage of this. 2017, they move to LA, start 0-4, but rebound. They were in contention for winning the division in 2018, but ended up with a Wild Card berth. They lose to the Patriots (again). Losing record in 2019, with it being Rivers' last season as a Charger. 

That being said, there's some hope in the Herbert era. The team is finally in a position to cash in on an all-world QB whose on a rookie contract. The past two seasons, they've invested in oline (signing Corely Linsley and Matt Feiler as FAs and drafting Rashawn Slater), as well some defensive help (trading for Khalil Mack, signing JC Jackson, among other additions). Hopefully this actually translates to post-season success, but the AFC West looks to be way tougher, certainly not like the mid to late 2000s.",40.0,nfl,t3_vxbrsj,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-07-12T15:19:24Z,chargers,0.0073222103432216

30251,164281,164281,WyldeBolt,"Basically here are the main points that I saw and remembered:

1. Weddle ***HIMSELF*** was the one himself who said, during the 2015 preseason that if he was not signed to an extension by the end of that summer, he and his representation would cease all negotiations with the team and consider that season to be his last. This was after Telesco himself said that he and his agent spoke, but did not want to pay him a third contract at his asking rate (which already amongst the top safety salaries in the league), but were open for a more favorable price, or to revisit once the season ended. So for him to go on and say that the Chargers were the ones who discarded makes no sense, given that he and his agents were the ones who walked away from negotiations completely. 

2. After that, Weddle's agent throughout the season would completely trash Brandon Flowers on Twitter, saying that he sucked and that he didn't deserve an extension. A few years after this, the same agent did an AMA on r/nfl, and did a 180, and refused to trash or criticize the team, which makes me believe that he was just acting as a mouthpiece for his client. 

3. We have the halftime show incident with his daughter. Weddle claims it was unfair that he got fined for skipping out on halftime meetings to watch his daughter, even though BOTH Mike Scifres and Antonio Gates watched their kids and didn't get fined. Both of them also insinuated in later interviews Weddle knew what he was doing and expected to get fined (most likely because he was in ""I ran out of fucks to give"" mode at that point), and were confused as to why he would complain about it. Which brings me to the next point. 

4. He only brought up the fine weeks after happened, when he got placed on IR (supposedly against his wishes), and according to his agent, he might've tried ""blackmailing"" the team by saying he was going to go public with news of the fine if they placed him on IR, and they basically called his bluff on it. 

5. After the season ended and he was still meeting with other teams, he apparently got really upset when it was announced that Gates got an extension and he didn't, and either to the SDUT or BleacherReport, he called Gates a ""cheater"" and didn't deserve an extension (he got suspended for PEDs earlier in the season) and went on a mini NiceGuy^TM rant. This was probably influenced by Gates' comments from Point 3.

Mini-note: There were also stories where he threw Rivers under the bus after a loss at press conferences, and instances where he made fun of Jason Verrett's injuries, but I haven't been able to corroborate these. 

7. When King Dunlap got released because of injuries, in 2016, he sent out a really passive-aggressive Tweet saying that the Chargers always ""tossed legends aside"" or something to that effect, even though the context was completely different. 

8. When the team moved to LA, he tried getting a bunch of San Diegans to become Ravens fans, only to delete his Tweets when people pointed out the irony. 

9. When Derwin James got drafted, he liked a bunch of Tweets from his fans, saying that Derwin would never be an All-Pro or as good a safety as him because ""he lacked intelligence and leadership qualities"" 

10. He suspiciously did not freak out when the Ravens ended up releasing him due to declining play, and was rumored to be in danger of getting cut by the Rams before retiring the first time. 

11. Of course, there's the incident of calling out Telesco, unprompted, right after winning the Super Bowl, where even former teammates like Shawne Merriman criticized him for doing so.",6.0,chargers,t3_tpdsx6,False,0.0,Chargers,2022-03-27T18:35:05Z,chargers,0.0298786667366997

I’m getting that dude in my team. And did just that and was pretty much love at first site. 

From that point I looked him up and was floored by how good he was. I made a point to see how many games or highlights I could see for the following season and I was off.

33160,192019,192019,bt3k,"If you want an actual answer to your question is that we moderate pretty closely to our published rules.  Some other reasons are:

\-Low-effort memes. Sure, not all memes are removed, but at least put some effort into your shitposts and you'll be rewarded if you put at least an ounce of creativity into it.

\-Threads that are addressed by a mega-thread. Same as posts when there is a Gameday/Postgame thread. We'll be doing this until the end of time and we feel strongly about it so don't go chasing waterfalls. Stick to the rivers and the lakes like you're used to.

\-Discussion about players that have zero connection or chance of joining the Chargers. If only you knew how many ""What if we traded a 20th round pick for Jalen Ramsey and sign him for a five hundred year contract and pay him in olive garden breadsticks?"" type of posts are removed on the daily. This also includes wild speculation about situations that will never exist. No, we will not be trading up to the #1 spot. Sounds crazy, but there have been threads.

\-""How many of you followed the team from San Diego and why are you still a fan"" Every. Damn. Week.

\-Threads that really shouldn't be threads. i.e. ""I think we'll win the Super Bowl"" <eom>. Cool story Gary. I hope so too.

There are probably more but the majority of them fall within these. Hate us if you must, but I hope you understand how much inane bullshit gets posted as we get more popular, which just increases the threshold for what is considered a quality post. And despite what some people say, you probably actually want to see quality posts on the sub and not an unmoderated wasteland. We've tried it before. There's pain behind these eyes, trust me.

If you have a post removed, just modmail us and ask us why. More often than not if you're not an asshole in modmail and have a genuine concern, the md who took it down will tell you why. There's usually a reason. Or you know, create more threads like this I guess. Or complain to my manager. They'll take it out of my paycheck.

The same as they've done enough homework to have a sense of who may or may not fall, they also likely have a sense of what players will still be available post-draft and what players may or may not get cut post-draft.

Not IDL in Round 1 because the value isn't there. Jordan Davis isn't Vita Vea. Beyond not offering much value on 3rd down, he only averages 23 snaps/game and doesn't seem to have the stamina to be on the field that much. DeMarvin Leal on the other hand is a tweener whose best fit seems to be inside where he can't stop the run. But Travis Jones is a Day 2 prospect who can push the pocket on 3rd down, take on double teams, and shed blocks well enough to play gap and a half.

The player I want to spotlight for pick #17 is David Ojabo (Edge, Michigan). The knocks against him are that he's raw (new to football) and still learning how to play the run, but the very things that make him so exciting as a prospect make those shortcomings less of a concern. Despite being raw he's an advanced pass rusher, specifically a speed rusher (I think speed is the perfect pairing for Bosa and Nwosu). And the reason he is so advanced is because he was able to pick up rush moves by merely watching how fellow Wolverines Frank Clark, Josh Uche, and Kwity Paye praciticed using their hands ([Dane Brugler and Lance Zierlein discuss him in this podcast at 52:25](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4PEsOaaPqoD4AcoZhySS9I?si=69be499c061949c2)).

I understand that teams needing tackles doesn't mean they'll draft them. I'm not saying the 14 team OT-needy teams between #13 and #47 will each draft an OT, I'm saying that chances are that some will, and, given the importance of the position, the odds of them doing so increase if there are so many starter-level players available later than usual like you're suggesting. Say the Chargers go Horn at #13 and there are only a handful of OT's they'd be comfortable taking in round 2, that's a huge risk to bank on one of those players falling to us, given the many variables at play, including someone trading ahead of us considering how obvious our need is.

Lol I do follow the draft. My point isn't that you can only find starters in the first round, but it is less likely.  If the Patriots knew what they were getting in Tom Brady, if the Seahawks knew what they were getting in Richard Sherman, both players would've been drafted a lot sooner. Players are drafted in the first round because teams believe they're more likely to become starters and difference makers than those drafted later. The players drafted later aren't incapable of becoming starters, but they come with more question marks that cast more doubt on their projection, amounting to more risk when you spend assets on them. My point is that the longer you neglect a need, the more risk you take on. We've already neglected LT for years, and now it's more important than ever given the window we have with Herbert on a rookie deal and the ""glaring hole"" we have at the position.

36113,206128,206128,djs7372,"Well first look at the LT position vs CB. LT's are on the field for 100% of the offensive snaps, and need to do everything a LT is asked to do, and have to matchup with whoever's lined up across from them. Whereas CB's can be shuffled in and out, and can be moved around to get the best matchup according to their skillset, so their deficiencies are easier to hide, especially in a matchup-based defense like Staley's. Furthermore, CB is an easier position to develop and find talent late at (i.e. Carlton Davis, James Bradberry, and Xavien Howard who were drafted in round 2; and JC Jackson, Chris Harris Jr., and Michael Davis who were all undrafted). And while poor CB play leads to first downs and touchdowns, poor LT play leads to hits on the QB, and an injury at QB is far more costly than giving up a few more yards and points per game.

So for both the options at OT and CB in round 2, they will be available to us generally because they're riskier/come with more question marks/don't project as well to the NFL as their first round-graded counterparts. But given everything I mentioned above, taking that risk at LT is less likely to be successful and would prove more costly if unsuccessful than taking that risk at CB.

**But some 2nd round CB options are... (I didn't mention Asante Samuel or Eric Stokes just because I think they're less likely to fall to us, but they're viable candidates as well)**

- Ifeatu Melifonwu and Tyson Campbell who are both very physically gifted but are more raw and require more coaching than some of the other guys I'll mention.
- Paulson Adebo from Stanford who had been projected as a first round pick like Walker Little and has had a lot of ball production in college, but he played better in 2018 than 2019 before opting out in 2020.
- Aaron Robinson who played mostly at nickel, but has experience playing outside and, at 5'11, has the size to play outside in the NFL, but he's inconsistent at press coverage.

That said, I think even a safety like Jevon Holland is on the table at #47 and could be a better value because there are a number of other promising CB prospects in this class.

It's not the same for LT's, and if one does make it to the open market, then you're paying $20M+ for him. It's important to have a good defense, but this team will only go as far as Herbert takes us. Protecting him is paramount, and we're lucky to be picking in the early teens in a draft where the 3rd and 4th options at OT have 1st round grades. Yes, Tyson Campbell isn't as good a prospect as Jaycee Horn, but Liam Eichenberg isn't as good as Darrisaw either and who's to say we wouldn't have to settle for someone even less talented if we wait until round 2.

* He’s excited about Tillery as an interior pass rusher and matchup problem for IOL
* Expressed some optimism about Adderley's traits, versatility, and how he sees the field but wasn’t nearly as enthusiastic about Adderley as he was about Tillery
* Said he would like to add a safety in the draft
* Wants corners that can play man-to-man in press and off coverage
* He was more open ended about adding another edge player, whether in the draft or a free agent
* Likes Michael Davis’s potential, feels like he’s at the beginning of his development
* Alluded to Bulaga being managed similarly to Andrew Whitworth with the Rams to keep him healthy
* Happy with our receiving corps, including TE’s and RB’s
* Wants Mike Williams to get more work between the numbers.
* Likes where the RB room stands
* He expects Aboushi to compete for a starting role
* Prioritizes TE's ability to impact the passing game
* When evaluating OT's, he prioritizes 1on1 pass protection

Every single damn season I truly truly believe we can and will win the super bowl. We are always so good and on the cusp. It hurts to see us lose because it's _always_ a close game. I've been saying recently that Chargers are must-see football because it's never over until the clock hits 00:00 in the fourth quarter. A lot of times it's not in our favor, sure, but it always seems like a warzone on the field. We do win a lot of games, too, and they are so so sweet.

While he did say this, I feel like these comments are taken a bit out of context (which, ironically, he goes on to address, and pretty much states that the medias reaction towards him is to highlight the negatives).

The specific context of this line was in an attempt to make the interviewers understand that while Brady did extend the olive branch to him, he still was only sought out by Brady because of his talent and what he had to offer the team. Says many times how good Brady is. 

I’m not defending AB here but a large part of the podcast was him emphasizing that the media takes him out of context. 

Now I will also say that his method of making people understand his mindset is very roundabout and a lot of potential “out of context” quotes come out of his mouth that are really convoluted attempts to make people try and understand a meaning that is entirely different.",7.0,nfl,t3_ryhmz8,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-01-07T17:38:54Z,chargers,0.0015571829279102

Los Angeles is a transplant city so there’s going to be fans for a ton of different teams, and sadly Raiders and 49ers fans make up a huge portion of these fans at the moment. The Rams and Chargers aren’t the most popular NFL team or sports team in general in LA, at least not yet. 

However, the Chargers have the most potential when it comes to picking up new fans. We have a charismatic, elite young QB for the next 15+ years and a lot of really young elite pieces who are going to make our team really exciting. Plus our marketing and social media teams are the best in sports, which in today’s day and age, will 100% help to bring in younger fans. The Rams on the other hand, have an old QB and a lot of their top level talent are getting older too. Not to mention, their shitty cap situation and no high end picks for the foreseeable future. They sacrificed everything for one Super Bowl win and their future doesn’t look too bright. The Chargers are gonna be contenders for a really long time and are gonna start to pull away from the Rams, and if they make a handful of Super Bowls and win a couple it’ll be over.

The closer we get, the more convinced I am that Carolina will do something else with the 6 pick, and that takes the pressure off Atlanta.

I also think the saints just need cheaper talent now with their cap craziness and they seem to think they can just bolster the roster around a hopefully healthy Winston. They need a WR bad, hell they might need to draft a couple.

The Steelers at 20 are clearly interested in Willis, so he will go if still available.

*Guard:* Oday Aboushi tore his ACL in week 5. He played well to that point, but depth behind him is a concern. Missing him and Bulaga on the right side last season made things tough for Herbert and Ekeler at times. Would like to see this addressed, likely in the draft.

*Defensive Tackle:* While this was addressed in free agency, I would not be shocked to see a mid round draft pick spent on this position still. Austin Johnson’s contract inicates he and Day are presumed starters, but depth is still badly needed here.

*Cornerback:* J.C. Jackson is an awesome signing for a shutdown CB1, but while Asante Samuel Jr. showed promise, Michael Davis struggled last season. Now, letting him play CB3 as opposed to juggling 1/2 duties with Samuel and Chris Harris Jr. may be enough to help him out, but the depth behind them is not in great shape. And Harris is gone now. Would like to see some draft capital used here, but with few picks in the early rounds, it may have to wait until day 3.

*Wide Receiver:* I don’t necessarily agree that this is much of a need, but I’m mentioning it after seeing discussion on r/chargers about this position. Namely, fans have a love/hate relationship with Jalen Guyton, who many argue is basically just a guy that can run verticals and occasionally get free down field for a bomb. I’m not mad at that for a WR4 personally, but more versatility is always welcome.

43695,248974,248974,omnimater,"**Positions of Need & Potential Targets:**

*TE:*

Jared Cook and Donald Parham exceeded my expectations, at least through my casual on film eye test. Cook is a free agent, and an elder statesman in the league. Parham was a restricted free agent and has been tendered. Tre’ McKitty, despite my homer wishes from drafting him in dynasty, does not look like too much so far aside from a depth blocking TE. A good Tight End could really seal the deal on making this a top tier offense.

*Possible FA Targets:*

We picked up Gerald Everett since I began this portion, but I’m not so sure an additional move isn’t made through the draft.

*Draft TE Targets:*

Trey McBride; Colorado State: The dude tops PFF’s TE draft rankings after a great season, has a basketball background which we all love for our TEs. He had 109 yards of his team’s 110 receiving yards in a game against Toledo. Even when everyone knew he was the guy to stop, they couldn’t. His stock seems to be rising but he may still be there for a mid-to-late 1st round selection. (Chargers at 17) But is fixing this position more important than defensive woes so early in the draft?

Later Round highlights: Isaiah Likely, Greg DulcichI believe the best TE solution for us is to sign a discount veteran (we’ve since gotten Everett on a good deal, discussed in the Additions section) alongside a draft pick in the 3rd or 4th, or 2 discount vets. I wouldn’t be surprised if McKitty ends up cut. Also wouldn’t be surprised if he gets a lot of playing time out of nowhere, it’s hard to know when a rookie sees the field so little. Obviously, the fan in me wants to swing for the fences with McBride Round 1, but that is only an option if the holes on defense are addressed almost entirely through free agency, which we currently are on a good track for. Otherwise, let’s move on to the next position group of need, another big early round need.

&#x200B;

*LB:*

Yo we got Khalil Mack I’m happy nevermind. [Here watch this sick highlight video instead of worrying about Kenneth Murray not being good enough at MLB.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUxn4fpXDy8)

In all seriousness, this is a position I expect to see multiple day 2 and 3 picks spent on. The depth is bad, and starting talent is not any better for our ILB positions. Drue Tranquill has done very well, but is not a standout talent. Kenneth Murray has been mediocre.  

*T:*

With Bryan Bulaga cut, Telesco and Staley DESPERATELY need to find a starting option at RT that is not Storm Norton. Who’s still out there? As of writing:

*Free Agents:*

Duane Brown showed his age last season in Seattle, cooling the market for the 37 year old. He has been relatively healthy, but his performance declined sharply in 2021, allowing 8 sacks at left tackle, tying him for 6th most. He is rarely penalized though. A 1 or 2 year deal may be possible if the Chargers staff thinks he hasn’t just aged out of his top level play completely, but so far there is no buzz at all that I have seen about a possible signing here.

Eric Fisher came off an achilles injury to have one of his worst seasons in his career after being picked up by the Colts. Maybe some value to be had another year removed from that injury, but he’s reportedly trying for bigtime money, as well as being a LT most recently. Unlikely in my opinion.

&#x200B;

*Draft Prospects:*

The picture isn’t clear yet, but there seems to be a lot of talent at OT in the first few rounds of the draft, potentially with many taken in the first round. Not being a scout, I’ll list the top prospects here:

Evan Neal, OT/G, Alabama

Ikem Ekwonu, OT, N.C. State

Charles Cross, OT, Mississippi State

Trevor Penning, OT, Northern Iowa

Tyler Smith, OT, Tulsa

Nick Petit-Frere, OT, Ohio State (This guy’s last name is literally little brother in french. I learned that when trying to find the pronunciation, and having learned that, and having shared it with you, I’m just going to let you figure out how to pronounce it in what is likely your most stereotypical french accent.)

43696,248975,248975,omnimater,"Already Signed:

Khalil Mack OLB: A 2022 2nd and a 2023 6th is a small steal of a price to pay for a top of the league pass rusher to pair with your other top of the league pass rusher. We have loads of cap space, and can re-sign him in a way that lightens this year’s cap load (probably have by the time of posting, I hope I remember to update this). I love this trade. Our defense was the weak point. Let’s fix it.

JC Jackson CB: Jackson will certainly help fix it! A fantastic signing of an elite Corner skilled at both man and zone coverage. He got PAID, signing a 5 year deal worth up to $82.5 Million with $40 Million guaranteed. We had plenty of cap space entering the offseason and it has been great as a fan to see this money used aggressively and smartly. A true number one corner was a need. This allows Asante Samuel Jr. to develop under less pressure after a promising rookie season.

Sebastian Joseph-Day DT: Joseph gets a 3 yr deal worth up to $24 Million with $15 Million of that guaranteed. He might have the easiest free agency team change ever as he doesn’t have to move at all or get used to a new stadium. He comes over from the Rams after 3 seasons, though 2021 was a season marred by a pectoral injury that limited him to 7 regular season games and the Super Bowl. That said, he reunites with Brandon Staley, who had been the Rams defensive Coordinator just 2 years ago in 2020. More scheme familiarity for a defense that has gone through a huge scheme change. (See Defensive and Coaching Reviews for further explanation)

Austin Johnson DT: As of writing the details of Johnson’s contract have not been made public. He’s a 5 year vet previously with the Titans for 4 years then the Giants last season. He’s a solid run stopping nose tackle, a skillset very much needed on our defense. He started all 17 last season for the Giants, racking up 90 tackles, 4.5 sacks, and 8 QB hits.

Gerald Everett TE: Everett gets a 2yr/$12mil deal with $8 million guaranteed to replace Jared Cook as our top TE presumably. Donald Parham is still likely to see significant play alongside Everett, or perhaps another TE addition down the line, but I like taking the chance on an inexpensive, athletic TE.

*Others to mention:*

  
Josh Harris LS: 4yr up to 5.6 Million, 1.92 Million guaranteed.  
  
Chase Daniel QB: Re-signed for 1yr up to 2 million, 1.12 guaranteed.   
  
Jalen Guyton WR: Tendered for 1yr 895,000. He had a solid campaign last season as our WR3/4 with 448yds and 3TDs. Herbert seems to like him, he performs well on the field, and is well liked by the fans. He’s likely to slip to our WR4 or even 5. Expect him to be overtaken by Josh Palmer, a 3rd rd rookie who finished with very similar numbers and got more snaps in the latter half of the season, as Guyton’s snaps decreased and as he dealt with an injury from week 15.  
  
Donald Parham TE: Tendered for 1yr 895,000. Watching the games last season, it felt like Parham was constantly making clutch catches and was developing into a major offensive weapon. The truth though, is that he had 27 targets for 20 receptions, 190 yards and 3 TDs on the season. Very respectable, if typical TE2, which is what he appears to be for our roster again. I would not be surprised if another draft pick is used on this position still, potentially bumping Parham down.  
  
Storm Norton OT: Tendered for 1yr 895,000. This is keeping depth at the position. Norton started basically all last season after Bryan Bulaga got injured in week 1. Norton got his ass kicked all year. Most notably against Maxx Crosby in week 18, but he got pushed around all season by whoever lined up across from him. He allowed 9 sacks, tied for 2nd most in the league. He’s a serviceable backup, but the skills don’t match the name unfortunately. We’ll see the Chargers add a tackle to start over him on the right side, with Slater on the left",7.0,nfl,t3_tohk4i,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers :Jaguars: Jaguars,2022-03-26T01:19:10Z,chargers,-0.000270242317919
43697,248976,248976,omnimater,"**Free Agency**

Losses:

Uchenna Nwosu is so far the only major loss in free agency. As an OLB/DE, he played decently well for us, being used primarily rotationally until this past season, where he saw much more action. His highlight of the season came against Cincinnati where he logged two sacks, including a forced fumble and recovery. He goes to Seattle on a 2yr $19 million deal with $10.5 million guaranteed. However, due to limited career production this is actually a safe deal for Seattle, who has a 1yr out option. I personally will miss him, as I always liked him and his awesome name, but this was an expected loss, and I can’t complain about Khalil Mack as a replacement. Here’s hoping he is a very successful Seahawk.

Side Note- New Seahawks DC Clint Hurt has a background not just of the Seattle Scheme defense, but also the Vic Fangio 3-4 schemes. Nwosu now has play experience in both, making this a smart signing with little downside.

Oh boy. I’ve been debating hard over how to talk about this game. Part of me is still so heartbroken over it that I want to just leave a grumpy salty remark and skip it. I really thought that would be my approach.

But I cannot do that disservice to what was one of the greatest, most dramatic and crazy games I have ever witnessed. Probably the greatest, most dramatic and crazy. I can’t think of anything like this, (I was delivering pizza for the Falcons-Pats 28-3 SB year, and got off shift just as overtime started, and walked in the door of my buddy’s house just as the confetti dropped. Can you believe that? Timed it perfectly. Wrong.) so I’m going to say it is. Which is why it hurts so much more!

Ok, let’s begin the pain. Despite a FANTASTIC punch-out by Nassir Adderly, the Raiders maintain possession and get a field goal on drive 1. Adderly absolutely came in clutch though, preventing the touchdown. Our first drive goes nowhere, then Andre Roberts fumbles on a punt return. Hunter Renfrow cashes in that second chance moments later, for a 10-0 lead.   
Austin Ekeler barreled in for our first score on the very next drive, then another one a drive later, his 20th TD, and Chargers lead 14-10. But it took Carr and the Raiders 7 plays and barely over a minute to get 75 yards downfield for another TD to respond. OH WAIT, that’s because Chris Harris Jr. was called for a PI in the end zone, a 41 yard mistake in coverage of Zay “Nude Brawler” Jones of all people. This was a game heavy on Charger penalties, with 10 penalties for a total of 108 yards, the most penalty yardage all year. A big disadvantage to have for the most important game of the season.

The second half opened with a Charger drive capped off with a missed field goal (been a sec) from Dustin Hopkins. He was pretty consistent for us this season after arriving from Washington, and this one was 51 yards. I can’t be too mad. Just disappointed. Oh! I almost forgot! Staley called the most bizarre 4th down attempt most of us have seen; from our own 18 yard line in the 3rd quarter down 17-14. It failed, and Vegas got the best starting field position one could ask for: ALREADY IN THE RED ZONE. Baffling. It was a rough 3rd quarter for us, and the 4th didn’t start any better, with a 2nd TD from Renfrow, and Casey Heyward grabbing a pick for Vegas on the following drive while Herbert was running from pressure. There was a lot of that actually, as Maxx Crosby played with Storm Norton like play-doh. Miraculously only 3 sacks; Herbert has great movement in the pocket, but he was pressured basically every drop back.

It’s 29-14 Vegas leading, 4:35 on the clock, 4th and 21! Somehow, Herbert fires a missile straight to Josh Palmer at the goal line for a spectacular score, keeping us alive against all odds. [I highly recommend a look at ESPN’s Win Probability chart on their page for this game here](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326600). Absurdity. We’d made it 75 yards down the field to score, but it took 2 4th down attempts to do so. That’s too many, you can’t count on that, especially not longer distances like 6 and freaking 21. Our defense manages to hold the Raiders down, but it’s a long field for our last attempt for a scoring drive to Win or tie. It took 19 plays, 2 minutes, and THREE CONVERSIONS OF FOURTH AND TEN (One by penalty, thanks Raiders Safety Roderic Teamer) to get 83 yards downfield for yet another Mike Williams TD catch. Oh as time expired. Yeah, we scored by the skin of our teeth. As in that last play was snapped with 0:05 left after an overturned incomplete pass that Jalen Guyton managed to hang onto and roll out of bounds with. What a crazy finish Except it’s not over, and every NFL fan has creamed their pants.

I really don’t have to address this because we all remember it consuming the whole final week of NFL media, but it’s important. The Steelers’ own overtime win earlier in the afternoon had left a weird door open in this playoff hunt: if the Raiders and Chargers tied they both got into the playoffs. The internet swarmed with all kinds of speculation and theories on tie-based shenanigans. Even going so far as to suggest both teams just kneel out the whole game. But when it came to the teams and their fans, it was quickly brushed off as the game began. They are here to play, and they are playing to win. But then they actually tied from a miraculous comeback in the fourth. How do you proceed?

The Raiders drove down, and flashbacks of the Chiefs played behind my eyelids. But they were held to a field goal. There’s still a chance. It took a fourth and 9 conversion bomb to Williams to get downfield for a responding field goal. 4:30 left, 32-32 and the clock is ticking down. Once they hit about midfield, the Raiders focus turns to just chewing clock on the ground trying to get downfield as much as they can. The drive definitely had the look of “If we get close enough for an attempt at a kick, great. If not, we’re still in the playoffs anyway. Let’s wrap this up.”

And then Brandon Staley calls Charger timeout at 0:38 left with Vegas at the LA 39. The most controversial timeout of the year, without question. We’ll never truly know why it was called, or what the Raiders would have done if it hadn’t. According to some players, they would have just let the clock run and the tie happen. Others say they would have let it run and just tried the kick from further back. But the clock stopped. Supposedly because, “We needed to get in the right grouping. We felt like they were going to run the ball, so we wanted to get our best 11 personnel run defense in, make that substitution so we could get a play where we would deepen the field goal.” But as the world immediately noted, that substitution that stopped the clock and may have encouraged the Raiders to actually run a play allowed 10 yards on the run. You know how it goes, I wrote up until the stockade, there’s not much interesting about this hanging. Season over. In dramatic fashion. Hope you took your blood pressure meds beforehand. All I had was alcohol.

Let’s talk about a thriller instead; one of the games that is behind the push for overtime to ensure possession for both offenses. It’s also one of the games that put the most focus on Staley’s 4th down calls. By now, he had the reputation for it, and was being judged on that tendency. Andre Roberts brought the opening kickoff back all the way inside the KC 25, just for the offense to not finish the job, and fail on 4th and goal as well. “The quickest way to win a game like that is to score touchdowns not field goals, especially considering who's on the other side.” That was Brandon Staley after the game, defending the decision to try for the TD and not easily go up 3-0. This has been a heated topic around the league, especially after this game, and even among Charger fans. Most are behind Staley and the aggressive attitude on 4th downs, and I generally am as well. But points are points. And the fact of the matter is that this game went to overtime. An extra field goal means a win. So failing twice in this scenario in the first half alone is a BAD look, and not great for morale on the field, I would think.  


This was a fun, even matchup. Both teams had the big plays on offense we all tuned in for. Both teams made dumb mistakes. Way more interesting to see than to read, so I’ll see you in Week 16 after you watch these…

*Week 16: Chargers @ Houston Texans: L 29-41*  


This was the actual most embarrassing loss of the season. Week 18 might have been the most overall painful considering the circumstances. But if this game had been a win, which everyone in the nation thought was surefire, week 18 wouldn’t have mattered. Instead, fucking Rex Burkhead had his way with our covid-ravaged roster. Joey Bosa, Austin Ekeler, Mike Williams, and Corey Linsley were all out for this game, among others. Davis Mills honestly just looked good this week, and was aided by facing a team with major missing pieces and a brutal demoralizing loss the prior week.

But there is no excuse for any rush defense allowing Rex Burkhead 149 Yards and 2 TDs on 22 carries. I’m shocked this guy is still on a team, and we’re out here making him look like a pro-bowler. Herbert struggled, underthrowing Josh Palmer deep downfield in tight coverage for an interception that gave the Texans the drive to take the lead late in the 2nd. And he tossed a pick 6 during the late comeback attempt, missing Jared Cook by a mile. This may have been Cook's fault, he ran a curl that Herbert seemed to think was going to be a corner route. We’ll never truly know. Either way, this was a stunning embarrassment of a loss that no one saw coming.

Respect to Davis Mills though. Everyone just kind of counted him out as a lame duck QB for a franchise in the toilet and moved on, but he actually showed development and skill last season. Kind of weird that many media people will say “He was the best Rookie QB other than Mac Jones,” but then will not ever talk about him at all besides that, still writing him off. Shoutout to Texans fans with the underrated QB to look forward to. Alright, enough of other teams, it’s the Chargers time to shine damn it. On to week 17.

*Week 17: Chargers vs. Denver Broncos: W 34-13*  


The Chargers were whole again this week as the many who had been out due to covid the previous week returned. Also this game was Drew Lock, not Teddy Bridgewater. Makes things a little easier (sorry Seattle?). Surprisingly, Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams were held in check, with neither having much production. Only Courtland Sutton and Noah Fant were able to give our D a challenge. Denver was able to move the ball, but was unable to finish for the first half, walking off for the half with a field goal to make it 3-17. The Chargers did have 3 scores in that first half yes, but honestly hadn’t looked that great, as the other 3 possessions were 3-and-out. All or nothing baby.

The second half had more but less meaningful scoring, as LA increased their lead, and Denver got what garbage points they could. Andre Roberts got a 101yd Return TD to start off the 4th quarter, coming right off of Denver’s second field goal. 27-6. [Justin Herbert broke the Chargers Single Season Passing TD Record with this strike to Mike Williams.](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx62LemUntqApkMqcGgMfv0OeyGpQaIxS8) It was his 35th TD of the season, and the last score of the game, well on the Chargers’ side. 

Sorry Noah Fant, it was just too late to matter.

This game was a lot like the Giants game, where the Broncos seemed to know this late in the year that, especially with their backup QB on the field, they weren’t at the same competitive level anymore. Just something I felt like I could see in the highlight film from time to time. Guys not pushing as hard, prioritizing the body for next year and the like. At 7-8 coming in, they were not technically out, but definitely a longer shot. In my book though, great payback, and a win that we desperately needed after the Texans loss. From here, it was win and in, right? Oh if only it were so simple.

This game started off quiet, with not much to speak of besides a Joey Bosa strip sack on Cousins and a big run by Alexander Mattison in the 1st quarter. The Vikings did go up 3 immediately into the 2nd, but Breshad Breeland gave up a pretty egregious DPI while trying to cover Mike Williams on the following drive. 3-3. There were a total of 9 penalties between both teams by 6:00 left in the 2nd. Not exactly a clean game. First play after going down 6-3, Justin Herbert throws a pass just behind Keenan Allen over the middle in tight coverage, and LB Eric Kendricks makes the pick. Oops. Kirk Cousins fires a laser straight through the secondary to Tyler Conklin on the following drive. TD. Down 13-3 with 2 minutes left in the half. In a game where I think most Charger fans thought would show that we were legit, but also that the Vikings were frauds (their season had been rocky, at 4-5). The vibes were negative. But a fast, 8 play, 75yd drive on the back of two more MIN defensive penalties led to a TD rush from rookie Larry Rountree. Suddenly it's 13-10 going into half and you can see the swagger immediately in the offense upon return from the locker room. The 2nd half opening drive began with a 22yd dart to Keenan Allen, and ended 9 plays later with a TD catch by Austin Ekeler where Herbert threaded a needle through extremely tight double coverage. Everyone touched the ball on this drive basically. Parham, Cook, Williams. The whole offense was humming. And then the next Charger drive was a weak 5 plays and 8 yards. Cool. And after a 3 and out to start their half, our defense folded again, specifically Chris Harris Jr. who on 3rd and 10 was called for an 11yd DPI on Justin Jefferson. With Tyler Conklin nabbing a second score, it was now 20-17 Vikings. And again on the next drive the defense caved, with a 12 play, 7 minute possession to start the final quarter only ended by a Dalvin Cook score. The Chargers fought hard for 12 plays on offense, only to come out with a field goal at 4:36 in the 4th putting the score to 27-20. We never saw possession again. The Vikings never scored again. Our defense let the Vikings play keep-away for four and a half minutes down one score. Embarrassing. Our defense truly let our offense down this week, who kept up despite only ever really having positive momentum for a brief stretch in the middle of the game. To this point in the year, in my eyes, this loss hurt the most. It felt the most in reach. The most disappointing.

*Week 11: Chargers vs. Pittsburgh Steelers: W 41-37*  


Three defensive penalties on the opening drive would assist Big Busted Ben and the Steelers in marching 13 plays downfield to notch a field goal. You know what beat the Chargers Defense in 2021? Well everything really, but do you want to know what really beat it? Rushing the ball and dink and dunk passing. Hey, that’s convenient because that’s ALL the 2021 Steelers could do! A match made in heaven. Well, Offense, we’re putting all our chips on you again, good luck. AKA: [Hey Herbert go be awesome.](https://i.etsystatic.com/19231471/r/il/5d9e6d/3053631140/il_570xN.3053631140_48i6.jpg)  


And while Herbert was undoubtedly awesome, putting up 30/41 for 382-3-1 in addition to another 90yds on the ground, it was Austin Ekeler’s day to shine. 50 yards and 2 TDs on the ground, 65 yards and 2 TDs through the air. This was a fun game to watch with all the scoring of course, but our defense even made the Steelers look entertaining. But their performance early in the game was the bare minimum required to keep us just barely ahead in this shootout. Charger wins are rarely comfortable, and despite having a lead most of the day, and watching a fantastic offensive spectacle take place, we certainly did not feel comfortable today. Especially when a late 4th quarter interception leads to a tied ball game. But this [backyard casual TD pass to Mike Williams for the game’s final score](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxXgH74jD5Wc_WUV8TT4pQW63Rdatb6ODm) makes it all better. God I can’t believe they got in the playoffs over us.

*Week 12: Chargers @ Denver Broncos: L 13-28*  
		

New candidate for the most embarrassing loss of the season is here! Our offense just couldn’t manage anything, and Drew Lock wasn’t in the game long enough for our defense to be any help here. Javonte Williams and Melvin Gordon are a strong combo against a glaring weakness. But honestly, Denver had very little offensive production. They had three scoring drives, and the rest were pretty underwhelming, topping out at 32yds. “What about their 4th score?” I hear you ask, having already seen the final. Well a Denver CB named Patrick Surtain II seems to be pretty damn good, picking off Herbert twice, taking the second for 6. The Chargers were somehow just never in this game. Denver’s defense was just too much. And ours was not enough to make up for it against a mediocre offense. I want to stop talking about this game now.

*Week 13: Chargers @ Cincinnati Bengals: W 41-22*  
		

It's the opening drive, 4th and goal from the 4. What do you do? If your answer is “Give Herbert the ball and watch,” then you’re ready to be a Charger fan. That laser to Keenan Allen was just the way to cap off a drive that returner Andre Roberts had set up at midfield. Uchenna Nwosu nails Burrow for a strip sack to get the ball back for a field goal, and then Jamar Chase bobbles up a deep bomb right back to CB Michael Davis. Back to back turnovers for Cincinnati, back to back responding scores for the Chargers, including Allen’s 2nd TD on the day, setting up 16-0. That’s just the first quarter.

This game looks like a blowout on the final, and in a way it was, kind of in the way that like a cat plays with its food. LA went up 24-0 in the second, only for it to be 24-22 halfway through the third after the team just fell asleep for a while and the Bengals came alive. And then Joe Mixon coughed up a fumble, Tevaughn Campbell scooped it up and took it for 6, and the game was over. Well, not yet. We still wanted more points. And we would get them, adding 10 before the game was out for a total of 17 unanswered. Our defense got to look good against a bad O-line, with 6 sacks, 2 FF and 2 Interceptions. Obviously we weren’t perfect, this game should never have gotten back to so close after such a huge lead, but this was a statement win in a matchup of the 2 rising electric offenses in the AFC. And that is proof that statements are meaningless (actually that proof is the Cleveland Browns) as the loser got to go to a SB. Good run Cincy, honestly, much love.

*Week 14: Chargers vs. New York Giants: W 37-21*  


There’s not a whole lot to say here, other than the final score lies by making the Giants look respectable. [Mike Glennon](https://cdn.barstoolsports.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/06/Screen-Shot-2017-03-06-at-9.16.02-AM.png) was starting for them, so, I mean, they never had a chance. With about 9 minutes left in the 4th quarter, the score was 37-7, so plenty of garbage time points here too. Our offense looked good, but didn’t really have to step on the gas too hard. Our defense did as well, but against one of the league’s worst offenses run by a backup QB. Oh and Keenan Allen was out due to Covid this week. I’m just going to move on to week 15. K? K.

This game was ugly. I mean, you can tell that by the final score. But the Ravens didn’t exactly look great either. Kyzir White managed 2 interceptions off Lamar Jackson, who was also sacked 3 times. Baltimore ran our D into the ground over the course of the game with their rotating backs of Murray, Bell, and Freeman, each of which found the end zone, alongside Lamar Jackson’s rushing ability. Oh and to make things worse, those 6 points were not two separate field goals, but 1 TD with (say it with me class) yet another missed PAT from Tristan Vizcaino. And other than that touchdown (which was on a 2 play drive from the Baltimore 27yd line so, kinda handed to us) our offense never got anything going at all. Our longest drive was 38 yards. Let’s just move on from a loss that was so completely crushing that you can hardly even analyze, and come out of the other side of the bye week strong. At 4-2, we were still tied for the top of the AFC West with the Raiders.

*Week 7: Bye*  


I would like to dedicate this time to thank Tom Telesco and Brandon Staley for FINALLY removing Tristan Vizcaino from the team like the tumor he was. His replacement, Dustin Hopkins came in and was consistent for us, missing two PATs (I almost wish I could know the count Vizcaino would have racked up) and only missing 2 field goal attempts, both from 50+ yards, over the rest of the season.  
  
*Week 8: Chargers vs. New England Patriots: L 24-27*  


This game was won and lost on defense for both teams. It was lost by a weak showing from the Chargers, only 4 QB hits all game with 1 sack from Jerry Tillery. Our safeties in James and Adderly were able to force and recover a fumble, but our offense couldn’t make anything of it. Why? Because while Belichick played conservative on offense, his defense was stout, with former Charger Adrian Phillips getting 2 INTs off Herbert and bringing one back for 6. The Chargers led the game through most of the first half, with the score at 14-13 at halftime. But the discipline of those Bill Belichick defenses gave our overall young offense a hard time, and the Pats were more than happy to lean on their ground and short pass games to eat up the clock. I think this game really is that simple in the end. See? I said I’d shorten these up.

*Week 9: Chargers @ Philadelphia Eagles: W 27-24*  


Nothing like a game against the Eagles to get you back on track right? Philly’s defense against the pass to this point really hadn’t been great. This was also as Philly was transitioning to a more run-centric offense. Our defense was in a bind as not only were we in the bottom of the league in rush defense, but also both Michael Davis and Asante Samuel Jr. were out for this game with injuries. Honestly these teams are very similar, having gone through coaching changes prior to the season, being largely younger on the field, building their identities. But there is one thing that tips scales like no other in the NFL: star QBs. And let’s face it, Justin Herbert is in another league compared to fellow JH-QB Jalen Hurts. Herbert put up an impressive 356-2 with an extra score on the ground. TE Donald Parham scored his 3rd and final TD of the season this week.  


Should this game have been so close though? The Chargers failed 2 4th down attempts in the first half, the first on the PHI 2 yard line, and the second on the PHI 27 yard line. 6 points gone. Following the second failed attempt, Philly managed a field goal to put them up 10-7 at half. The second half is a back and forth for the lead or tie. Culminating in a 4th and 1 on the PHI 28, 1:45 left to play, tied at 24. Again Staley keeps the offense out instead of taking a 45yd field goal attempt. Fortunately, Herbert is successful in his QB sneak, and Hopkins nails the 29yd field goal with :02 remaining moments later, and the Chargers come out on top. But why? Probably because Hopkins had missed a PAT earlier in the game, despite being fairly solid throughout the season so far (Hopkins honestly wasn’t that bad with Washington, a surprising cut given his tenure with their team looking back now. He had missed 2 XPs and 2 FGs before being cut, only 1 in the week before his release in a game where Washington was being blown out by KC). It worked out for the Chargers to get the win, but for me this is the first point where the 4th down aggression is questionable, and may negatively be impacting the team’s chance to win.

Mahomes opened this game slipping between our defenders, rushing for 22 yards on their first drive, seemingly moving our defense to his will…. Until a tipped ball off the hands of the hands of Chiefs 2017 UFA Marcus Kemp (the play-by-play read M Kemp, so I had to look this guy up - I thought Matt - anyway I learned this from his team website page’s google result, but if you click on that, you get [error 404](https://www.chiefs.com/team/players-roster/marcus-kemp/), so I’m guessing he got cut lol) led to a spectacular interception catch by Asante Samuel Jr. (Are you noticing a pattern? Well too bad he never has another INT all season.) The Chargers offense just couldn’t get going in the 1st quarter, opening with a 3 and out, and netting just 53 yards before the 2nd quarter. However a Tyreek Hill fumble late in the first and a Clyde Edwards-Helaire fumble on their very next drive, both lead to Herbert TDs to Allen and Ekeler. Suddenly it’s 14-0 halfway through the 2nd quarter, despite Vizcaino missing the PAT of the first score. The Chiefs only manage a field goal due to a false start penalty stalling their drive, and the half ends quietly 14-3.

The second half is a different game. A Kansas City team that had so far been more a victim of themselves than our defense (not that our D wasn’t good in the first half) found its balance and hit the gas in the second half. The Chiefs would find the end-zone on their next three possessions, while the Chargers struggled to keep up, with a punt, a TD catch by Mike Williams, and a field goal to match with. It’s tied at 24 with 1:50 in the 4th when [Mahomes launches a bomb downfield on 3rd and 8, only to be intercepted by Safety Alohi Gilman.](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx5Fh5En7LfWdA6M50zI4I_Q1d-TZNJwR5) The Chargers make it downfield again, Mike Williams gets another TD, Tristan Vizcaino misses another PAT, and with 0:32 left on the clock, the Chiefs get the ball back down 6. Our defense held up, allowing only one play of any gain (a classic Mahomes 21yd scramble and 5yd defensive holding on that same play; there were plenty of defensive penalties this game). A huge win that puts the [Chargers as the lead dogs in the West](http://sportige.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Big-Balls-Chargers-e1544779189168.jpg).

*Week 4: Chargers vs. Las Vegas Raiders: W 28-14*

So much for 3-0 suckas! The Chargers went into Vegas on a Monday night and ran the table. Donald Parham capped off the 12 play, 7 minute opening drive with a receiving TD. Let’s see the following drives: Punt, Punt, Punt, Turnover on downs, Punt, Punt, Turnover on downs, Punt, Punt. For a full 15 minutes of play, there was a total of 59 yards between BOTH teams. That includes a Raiders 3-and-out for -8 yards on the drive. [Talk about a snoozefest.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/89/31/7a89313173554546370fa636cbf4f3df.png) But the Chargers came back to life as we neared half, with back-to-back touchdown passes from Justin Herbert. The half ended with the Raiders still in a coma and the Chargers up 21-0.

The second half flipped, with back-to-back Raider TD drives and Chargers forced punt drives through the 3rd quarter making it 21-14. But Dan Carlson’s missed 52yd field goal turned the momentum in the 4th. The Chargers ground game kicked in to run out the clock, with Ekeler adding another score, but it was Derwin James picking Carr off on his way to Waller with 3:22 to go that was the backbreaker. A Raiders down 14 2-minute drill goes nowhere, and now, at 3-1, the Chargers are on top of the AFC West… or at least tied for it.

*Week 5: Chargers vs. Cleveland Browns: W 47-42*

While former Sheldon High School Fishing Club President Justin Patrick Herbert had picked up where his record setting rookie campaign left off, this was the real debut of the gun show. However, Cleveland came in with at-the-time the #1 ranked rushing attack in the league behind Chubb and Hunt. And that put on display the Charger’s difficulties defending the run from the opening drive. Combined, the Brown’s backfield would rack up 222 yards and 3 TDs on the day, opening up our defense for Baker to pick apart for 300 yds and 2 TDs of his own. But it was the opposite story on the other side of the ball where Herbert took command (no not that “take command”) of this game with 398 yds and 4 TDs through the air, and another TD on the ground. Austin Ekeler wasn’t racking up the yards (as if 119 total from scrimmage is mundane), but had a nose for the endzone with 3 TDs of his own, 2 on the ground and one from Herbie.

But this game wasn’t just an even shootout, oh no, in classic Charger fashion, it was a desperate comeback with 26 of those 47 points being scored in the last 12 minutes of game clock. The Chargers offense was clicking. [Check out this sick bomb to Mike Williams for example.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxEvG27_H_U7pF_M3APL_7cvSX6MrSiPjz) Our D couldn’t hold the Browns off though, especially on the ground. I swear every Browns highlight play is either rushing or play action. Also, Austin Ekeler had a rare fumble, and Vizcaino had a not so rare missed PAT (what about this pattern, have you noticed this one?). But 20-13 at half isn’t too terrible of a hole to dig out of, but boy did Cleveland make us fight for it. But the 4th quarter is of course the highlight. It opens with Cleveland up 27-21 with possession. They proceed to have a 3 and out drive, followed by FIVE STRAIGHT TD DRIVES between both teams; this streak would of course be murdered in it’s peak by TRISTAN VIZCAINO MISSING YET ANOTHER PAT. But it’s fine, everything is fine as the Browns finally falter against our defense, and Herbert leads a 48 yd TD drive in 30 seconds to reclaim the lead.

This game was insane and super fun. Cleveland was viewed then as a rising power in the league, so a lot of pride came with this win. Which is why week 6 hurt as bad as it did.

43705,248984,248984,omnimater,"**Season Recap:**

*Week 1: Chargers @ Washington Football Team (Commanders): W 20-16*

The Chargers started off strong on offense with Ekeler punching in a 3yd TD to cap off the opening drive. This game showed from the get go that Mike Williams was a serious piece in this offense and that the coaches seemed to have seen something in 6th round pick Larry Rountree. Rookie Asante Samuel Jr. is called for a huge PI to start the 2nd quarter on a deep shot to Dyami Brown. Our defense holds the Football Team to a field goal keeping things 7-6. Despite being contained by the Washington D to an extent, you could tell this offense was legit. Herbert looked great, no matter who was on the receiving end. This is when most fans learned Jalen Guyton’s name for the first time. That said, we couldn’t punch in the TDs in the red zone, being held to 3 field goals in the first half. Washington was struggling on offense, especially as starting QB Ryan Fitzpatrick was injured halfway into the second quarter. Taylor Heinicke in for relief, couldn’t take over the first drive in, but came back to close the half with a field goal, and open the 3rd quarter with a TD drive with fantastic passes to Mclaurin and Logan Thomas (TD). Suddenly the Chargers went from up 13-6 to down 13-16. Our offense leads a nice downfield drive, marching down the field in 11 plays to the Washington 9. Then Herbert is hit as he throws and a pass which lands just shy of the feet of intended receiver Jared Cook in the end zone is ruled a fumble through the end zone and a turnover? Very stupid call that I don’t understand how it could have been made as both the arm and the ball were moving forward. But I digress; congrats to Montez Sweat on the FF i guess. Our defense in the second half dissolved and Heinicke looked like a savior in Washington… until the drive stalled at midfield and Dustin Hopkins missed the 51yd field goal. But as soon as we hit the red zone on offense is when things fall apart again, this time an interception from the Washington 20 by William Jackson. However the very next play Kyzir White forces a fumble from Antonio Gibson, recovered by Kenneth Murray for the Chargers. A chaotic 12 seconds of game clock for sure. Follow it up with a TD catch from Mike Williams, and the Chargers go up 20-16 and are able to hold up on defense after that fumble. Herbert looked phenomenal against what at the time was thought to be one of the better rising defenses. Though Bryan Bulaga was lost halfway through this game, and his replacement at RT Storm Norton, let’s just say wasn’t as good as his name, and will be discussed elsewhere.

I’ll have to shorten the rest of these recaps going forward, as that was far too long, but I wanted to keep week 1 long for a reason. People say you can’t take too much away from week 1 (especially in the fantasy world), but this felt like the average, baseline Charger game of 2021. Reviewing the game, it was very similar to what I recall seeing and feeling about Chargers games late in the season. I found myself wishing that I could see more difference and change in the offensive strategy between week 1 and the latter weeks of the season. I found myself wondering if the team's intermittent success was perhaps due not to a lack of talent on the field, but a lack of variety in offensive play calling. And of course, the defense disappointed often, though this was perhaps an outing of average or slightly above. For more on these thoughts, see my reviews of Head Coach Brandon Staley, OC Joe Lombardi and DC Renaldo Hill as well as some of the players mentioned here, particularly Jalen Guyton, Larry Rountree, and Josh Palmer. There you’ll see the accuracy (or lack thereof) of those feelings. Now, on to week 2.

*Week 2: Chargers vs. Dallas Cowboys: L 17-20*

The Cowboys offense came out hot this game, marching downfield to open 7-0. This was followed by traded picks between both teams, with Diggs picking off Herbert and Rookie Asante Samuel Jr. flashing with an interception of Prescott. Samuel also had a nice end zone pass breakup on the first drive. However the first quarter ended 14-3 with the Chargers having given up 178 total yards already. But the 2nd quarter is a new quarter as the offense fights its way to a Mike Williams TD and an Ekeler 2pt conversion. The rest of this quarter goes by without scores as both teams’ defenses seem to catch up. That is until a sequence that begins with a roughing the kicker penalty against Dallas on a LA punt, granting LA a new set of downs, which leads to a doink by Vizcaino from 44yds off the left upright in his tie attempt. Dallas, now in possession with 3 seconds in the half, runs a pass play that goes to Ceedee Lamb, who Kenneth Murray completely whiffs the tackle against, and is nearly a TD play, with Lamb tossing a lateral to Elliot who is knocked out AT THE 1! Yikes, ugly for both teams, but especially LA. Vizcaino did end up tying the game at 14 in the 3rd with a 32 yd kick. Donald Parham’s first touchdown of the season gets called back on a Jared Cook hold, right after Jim Nantz credits a first down catch on a 3rd & 6 (according to broadcast, espn says 3rd and 5?) to Jalen Guyton, even though it was actually rookie Josh Palmer. 15, 5, what’s the difference? Okay, I did say this would be shorter. No time to talk about Herbert’s second interception, this time in the end zone. Pollard and Elliot continue to run all over the Chargers terrible run D, combining for 198 rushing yards and 2 TDs on the day, but in the 4th quarter both teams are kept out of the end zone, exchanging field goals for the rest of the afternoon until Greg Zurlein hits the walkoff to end the game.

While Staley is a defensive minded HC, he played quarterback in college, so your concern in that regard is moot (also since you are essentially implying that you expect Staley to be worse than Anthony Lynn which is pretty unlikely considering just how bad Lynn was), and then you say that a sophomore slump is common, which serves as no evidence at all.
