133,298,298,09-24-11,"When your GM has the ability to draft Garrett Wilson, AVT and Breece Hall in double digit selections, the “prospect hugging” becomes easier to recognize. It become more necessary when you realize a veteran QB will count higher against the cap over the next two years on top of Quinnen, AVT extensions and then Garrett, Sauce and Breece the year after. We will need cheap rookie deals to keep the band together. 

I’m not anti-Rodgers by any means, but you should be able to understand why fans are weary on sending over two firsts.

137,314,314,09-24-11,"1. To reiterate, then either define the rule or remove it entirely. Your stance is to let the subreddit roam free then so be it. The rules here are rarely enforced overall. There are constantly posts not related to the Jets, memes on game day, and jersey posts not mandated to the game thread. One of my pain points with the low effort posts thing, is that it is one example of rules not being followed and that is the bigger issue. 

2/3 I know it’s not a premium website and it doesn’t always have to be game film. Myself, I’ve posted salary cap breakdowns that take 20-30 minutes to write up, not just “we’ve sucked for a long time we need Rodgers” posts. Others have posted original art. I feel like I’m not asking for much here lol what I’m tired of seeing is a reiteration of a stale talking point. As far as driving away the regular users, it won’t happen.

138,315,315,09-24-11,"A few things: 

1.  If the answer from mods is to downvote/hide, then just remove the rule for “low effort/duplicate posts”. It’s almost never enforced and you yourself just said that hide and downvote is the answer. Fine, then have the rules reflect what the sub is supposed to do. Remove the low effort rule entirely. 

2. I feel this way because it is the same questions or topics being discussed with little effort with no new flavor of discussion. I especially feel this way due to the lack of effort. If fans posted in depth self post content about player reviews, contracts, game film, etc that is different because there is quality and effort being put into the discussion and that’s what makes Reddit, and sometimes r/nyjets a great place. 

3. You are saying that removing low effort posts won’t improve the quality of the posts. Disagree. I think when people have their low effort posts removed; they will be persuaded to bring low effort comments to the daily thread or the QB thread. And if it stops the low effort content all together, then so be it. 

4. I wouldn’t actually be in favor of banning gossip tweets. That’s limiting content. I was half kidding in my original comment.

13851,99397,99397,NannigarCire,"Actually I’m coming back because one thing you said here kept bothering me more than the others- “brady is number 10 and Fitzpatrick is #2”, this statement misses the point. You can’t make a bad player good. The product of the NFL would be worse if they tried to. Fitzpatrick given the volume of passes he takes, is unsurprising to be ahead of Brady because he’s a worse player. He’s more likely to throw into tight coverage where holdings and DPIs are happening, more likely to get hit during a play to get unnecessary roughness, he’s a worse player. Brady isn’t going to get more calls because he doesn’t play like shit. Even if it was the other way around, where Brady gets more calls that wouldn’t prove that the league does anything to tip the scales. It’s not actually refuting the concept. The idea and the reason why this point is so bothersome and wrong to me- is whether players are qualitatively (not quantitatively) getting favorable calls in situations where lesser players would not. Does Tom Brady on 3rd and 6 throwing to Wes Welker from the slot on an out route get the holding call when the safety makes a ticky-tacky hip touch while the patriots are up 3 late in the 3rd? When comparing it to all similar qualitative situations, are those calls even or is there a pattern towards particular players getting the calls? Who are those players, and what is their relationship to the league brand?

13853,99399,99399,NannigarCire,"the view of it as a scripted contest would require that but not a view of moderate favoritism. like you don't need more than regular exposure to specific players and personalities to do that. i also don't agree that the nfl would've loved to have sanchez and rex and hard knocks in the superbowl imo- it's arguing they are creating narratives for the sake of narratives instead of creating positive reciprocal relationships with those that forward the brand. And the Jets are not even close to one of the major teams that do that. I think it's either misguided or a misunderstanding of what i'm saying. Like it's almost undeniable when watching QBs that the ones with more tenure, exposure, and popularity get better calls than the ones that don't have any of those. 

i brought up the WWE metaphor because its a fully scripted show but the script is 100% earned by the people involved. You don't just win Championships because they decide it, you build up loyalty within the brand, show your skill and talent as an exciting actor in the ring, and then get rewarded for it with better matches, better stories, better etc. The NFL can't do that, that's impossible for them. But they can tell the refs to protect their biggest assets like Brady, Peyton, Brees, Mahomes, etc. They can't make them play well, but they can choose to be more loose with holding calls not just for certain teams but also for certain matchups. Like the NFL can request the refs to keep the flags only for the most egregious calls in marquee matchups on primetime if they want to. Or for whatever leads to the highest scoring game. They're doing what they perceive as being good for the brand and it's marketing. There's nothing to suggest they can't. The risk/reward factor is intangible, it's unclear- because other sports exist but not all of them are even nearly the cultural product likely because partially a missing compelling narrative that is culturally bigger than the game being played.

It's essentially what they do when they change the rules to make it better for QBs and the passing game, they're not focused on some internal competitive fairness- they're deciding based on what they think makes the game more marketable and expands its cultural relevance. Peyton was the main lobbyer for this version of the game and he was a massive brand ambassador for the NFL.

>And now that there is so much gambling involved , it would be a federal crime that would put a lot of people in jail.

i'm sorry to accuse you of this, but this particular statement is a little naive considering how illegal insider trading is but how regular it is. It's likely that the majority of the owners involved in the league even do some insider trading through all sorts of dark accounts, along with many other illegal things. 

The idea of ""making things a little more exciting"" on the field, is even lower effort than that. There's a relevant quote from Chomsky that's sort of related here- where he's talking to a BBC interviewer and they ask him- ""you think i'm being told by my superiors what to write?"" and he says, no of course not. that's ridiculous, its likely that your thoughts are your own but your viewpoint is one that already aligns to the position they want. The filter happened when you got the job. There's no need for anyone to be directed, they've already chosen people who understand the point.

Because this leads me to something i don't personally understand too well- how were the referees able to strike? I've participated in a lot of labor organizing so usually strikes are based on leverage. But what is a referees leverage exactly? Like it seems to be a pretty high demand job with a lot of potential replacements who (if not all thrown in at once) would probably ease in without much issue. It pays well (200k per season) and there's tons of potential guys who can and want to do it. The guys who aren't on the field in sports are about as replaceable as the guys in the arts, where no matter how well trained you are from juliard or berkeley, they'll find someone else to put in the spot with ease.

13856,99406,99406,NannigarCire,"alright so under the new context maybe its unnecessary for me to do the stat analysis i wanted to do BUT i still did a little bit of it because i wanted to really make my point- the thing for Adams vs Cooper is that the game Adams plays is one that doesn't impact defenses compared to the way Cooper plays. Adams is a very heavy underneath receiver who mostly works his best in the short game compared to all the other all-time great WRs who are intermediate players + have some amount of deep threat to them. Like you mentioned Adams being doubled etc but this is only important if Adams was going for deep routes, which isn't really his thing. It's a very ideological statement on my part because there is no objective point to make here, but IMO a legit top WR should be playing the big boy game of intermediate + deep ball profeciency and Adams is a short yardage specialist more-so. He's like a powered-up slot receiver. Like his two killer seasons with Green Bay had 60% and 67% of his targets either short or behind the line of scrimmage. Whereas like Julio never went past 47% of his targets in that area. Cooper's also usually below 50% in the area, although in 2020 he had like 60% in the area, which was the season where Dak got hurt early and Dalton+Ben Dinucci became QBs so that explains that. Davante plays a much different game than the all-timers is what i'm getting at, and i'm guessing you don't disagree


*i'd like to go even more in depth by breaking down the variance +luck aspect of adams vs other top WRs but..downloading this data from PFF is impossible bc its too many columns

But anyway, in relevance to Carr- i did a long dive into Carr and the thing with him is that although he had weapons they were not in the areas he is best at. Carr is a short-passing specialist, his best seasons were when his best players had average depth of targets before the first down marker (Waller at around 8.something + Renfrow at 6.something) and then supporting targets that went deep (Agholor, Ruggs, Zay). His bad seasons are when his top targets have their average depth of targets deeper down the field (both Crabtree/Cooper were above 10+). Davante should've been another one of these short yardage guys, but for some reason McDaniels decided to send Davante way deeper than he normally goes this year. In the last two years with GB Davante's ADOT was 9.7 and 8.7, but with the Raiders this year it was 12.8 which is his career high. So the thing with Carr is that he was in a talent mismatch by being asked to throw farther a lot more often than he's supposed to.

But i think in any case the thing i wanted to deep dive onto isn't going to be a disagreeable point, however i do think Amari is very valuable to a level that isn't much worse than Adams because he is an intermediate/deep receiver that opens up the rest of the offense. Whereas Adams, because he's not really that type of player, doesn't have the same overall impact on the offensive scheme + defensive reaction. Adams skills will get him a lot more counting stats though, in the right situations. Honestly i'd be curious to see what his volume is when he's in an offense that has other targets because i think given his speciality he wouldn't get the heavy usage he has received since 2018.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10shocp,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-02-04T18:58:03Z,nyjets,0.0282955181502271

13861,99414,99414,NannigarCire,"sorry ot throw myself into this conversation but it's a pretty good discussion. I want to add that Davante has faced very weak target competition throughout his career. As a third year receiver playing alongside Jordy's penultimate Packers year, he was a distant second. But in most of his high performing seasons he's been far and away the only true target on that offense and way above the guys around him, and he's not exactly the most talented NFL WR. Looking at the guys on those teams from 2018 onwards, i don't even think some of them would've been able to start on the Jets teams. The ghost of graham? Allen Lazard? Equanemous St. Brown? 

also just can't imagine putting Davante on the all-timer scale. Davante was never dominant like Julio, so it feels very box score heavy to say he's the best WR at any point in the NFL. It's sort of like arguing Diggs as the best WR because he once led the NFL too, but neither Diggs nor Adams are so scary that defenses have to totally adjust for them the way they have for Julio, Calvin, and now Chase and Jefferson. Davante and Cooper are both hall of very good players for very different reasons, and to bring it full circle Cooper's had a lot more competition for targets and with a significantly downgraded QB. Carr isn't a guy who forces the ball to his man the way Rodgers does, and he had few opportunities with Prescott or Watson. Plus on the Cowboys his target competition was way harder than anything Davante has had to compete with. Amari's still young enough to have that big blowout year that his career hasn't given him yet too if he gets the entire season with Watson next year.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10shocp,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-02-04T00:00:28Z,nyjets,0.0001222558809358

That's the thing about reddit. it fucking sucks to post high quality content here. There is no payoff. And reddit's functionality with the upvotes/downvotes acting as agree/disagree just make having more interesting conversations really difficult here. Even when i did the Zach Wilson or Mike White breakdown, the majority of posts relish the content (which is appreciated) but there is no back and forth- very few users here can actually talk to you about the topic when you go into depth. And as much as i like being right, actually discussing something on the level that i want to discuss it- is the whole reason why i would personally post it. Partly praise, partly to garner discussion.

The payoff is very low. And unless your goal is to be picked up by some low-end blog that will expect you to churn out high quality content to legitimize their website, there is very little to gain. You just do it for yourself. And i don't think raising the standard for what counts as a post will change that.

The reason better journalists are reliable is because they only put stuff out if they are generally sure or have someone with an actual inside track on it feed them information.

It's one thing to see the Hackett hiring and go ""Aaron Rodgers inbound"". Anyone of us could put that together, but it's still just speculation and a rumor based on almost nothing. 

It's another thing to have Rodgers's agent back channel that Rodgers would not be opposed to playing for the Jets, even if it's just to signal to the Jets that maybe they should call if they haven't, or if it's just a ploy to get Rodgers a better deal from the Packers.
