Owners aren’t logical. They want a franchise QB as soon as possible because that’s not only the most important position in sports, but a franchise QB sells jerseys, tickets, puts butts in seats, and single-handedly changes the trajectory of success for your franchise.

You don’t call them franchise receivers or edge rushers or running backs. You call them franchise QBs. 

Kyle Shanahan gave up 3 first rounders for an FCS project. 
The Broncos gave up major capital for an older Wilson.
The Browns gave up 3 first rounders and a guaranteed contract to a potential sex offender who they knew would do very little this year due to a suspension.

You also have to remember that these are already rich guys who invest in sports for fun and to make more money. 

People aren’t clamoring to come see if Ridder pans out. 
People will clamor to see Lamar play though. 

Just has to come down to if the cost is worth the investment in someone like Lamar.
