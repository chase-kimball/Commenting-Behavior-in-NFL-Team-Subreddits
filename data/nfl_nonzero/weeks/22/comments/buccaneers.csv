Beyond that I went into this mock assuming A.) we cut Lenny and Smith B.) we bring Stinnie back to compete with Hainsey/Goedeke for LG and C.) we sign a vet QB to be the starter next year. 

R1: 19 - Trade. Sent 19 to the Vikings for  pick 23, 87, 160 and a 2024 *fourth. I thought about staying here for Witherspoon, but ultimately I felt that we have a lot of needs at a lot of positions without a lot of cap or picks so I moved down. 

R1: 23 - Broderick Jones, OT UGA. Smith replacement. He’s a great athlete and was a solid starter for the Dawgs. 

R2: 50 - Keion White, EDGE GT. He had an excellent senior bowl and has a size/speed combo that would let us use him all over the DL. 

R3: 82 - Sean Tucker, RB Syracuse. He had a down year compared to expectations for sure, but he has an endearing twitter (check it out sometime) and a three down skill set. I think he could be a great 2 or 1B with White with 1A upside. I especially love that a Tucker/White backfield leaves us with two backs with good size, speed, and pass catching ability. It keeps teams from keying in on what we're trying to do offensively based on which RB is in the game (Martin/Sims, Lenny/Rojo, this entire year). 

R3: 87 - Jaquelin Roy, IDL LSU. He's a good athlete that could contribute as a member of the IDL rotation early on. He offers some theoretical pass rush upside if he can become a full time player next to Vita. This hopefully stops the carousel of Vita Vea adjacent vets that we pay 10 million for 5 million dollars worth of production. 

R4: 121 - Trey Palmer, WR Nebraska. He has a case of the drops, but he has good size and speed and managed to produce despite the drops. The way I see it, there's a 0% chance we get 17 games out of Mike/Godwin/Gage, so drafting a guy with good tools who can develop and serve as an injury fill in can't hurt. 

R5: 155 - Trey Dean III, S Florida. I realized it was the fifth round and I hadn't touched the secondary. 

R5: 160 - Mekhi Garner, CB LSU. See above. 

R5: 175 - Deuce Vaughn, RB Kansas State. I almost took him at both of the above picks, but I just couldn't pass on him here. Is he tiny? Yes. Is he an absolute baller? Also yes. He could be our starting punt returner day 1, push Tucker and White for snaps between the 20s, and has the receiving chops to make some 2RB sets very very interesting if we have a creative OC. 

R6: 196 - Luke Schoonmaker, TE Michigan. Kieft is more of a FB than true TE, and Schoonmaker has the size/receiving skills to be a versatile TE2 behind Otton (assuming we move on from Brate). 

R7: 232 - Carlton Martial, LB Troy. BPA. 

R7: 238 - Cameron Mitchell, CB Northwestern. BPA. 

R7: 253 - Max Duggan, QB TCU. I was stoked he was here. Duggan is likely never a full time NFL starter, but he is mobile and a team leader. Watch the guts he played with while clearly hurting against both Michigan and UGA during TCU's playoff run. I think he could be a solid back-up for a long long time just based on those intangibles. I also think he could push Trask for the QB2 job or become our new Ryan Griffin that looks great in the preseason against future car-salesmen and accountants.",3.0,buccaneers,t3_10v60zi,False,0.0,OldBucsShip,2023-02-06T09:06:11Z,buccaneers,0.0130882740162037

Hooker will be a 25 year old rookie. He’ll also miss most of the season with his ACL injury. Unless he comes in late in the year and steals the starting job from Trask or whoever AND balls the absolute fuck out, we’re replacing him in 2024 with another rookie QB. Not to mention that he’s more or less the textbook example of a system QB. Not that many QBs looked good against the Dawgs this year, but Hooker and Tennessee absolutely collapsed when guys weren’t running 15 yards open past DBs. 

As far as secondary, our only two good DBs currently on the roster are the oft injured CD3 and Winfield. We desperately need more corners if Dean walks and need depth regardless of what happens with SMB. 

I actually don’t hate the Bijan pick like a lot of others here, in large part because the emphasis on OL and Washington means we can actually get some mileage out of him.

6448,49021,49021,Fbgotschman,"Interesting mock. I have serious doubts we go with Edge as our 1st pick. Even given the need. If we trade at all I think we try to trade to secure an OL (whether a LT or a LG). I love the Darnell pick. I get what everyone is saying about Cade but when you have a guy with his measurables, the upside is too great to pass up if he’s available here. I have doubts that Hendon will fall low enough for us but if he’s there in the 3rd he’s a must get. And I’m not sold Trask isn’t the guy yet. 

What’s interesting to me is that you have us waiting until round 5 to get a corner knowing we are likely going to have to replace 2/3 DBs due to free agency. I like Riley moss and I think he’s a little underrated in the draft but I think we’re gonna have to try to get someone sooner to replace SMB, Edwards, or Dean. 

To’o To’o will be a steal that low. But only if we let Lavonte David walk. We have decent guys to step in behind him so replenishing that depth would be nice. If we resign, pass on the LB need to a future draft. 

Lastly, idk if you have Stockholm syndrome and want to watch Donovan smith get 65 holding calls again next year, or if you are just high on TJ bass but we HAVE to get a replacement for that clown. I hope we try to offload him in some way but we’ve got to get an upgrade if we don’t plan on wasting Godwin and M1K3’s careers.

We know this year is going to be rough anyway because we are in cap hell, So go ahead and give Trask the year to see what he does. Use this year's draft on as many OL, DL, and CB as we can get. 

In 2024, if Trask did well, we don't need a quarterback. If he didn't, we will have a very high pick to be able to draft one. We only ask Evans and David to sit through one bad year, maybe two while the rookie QB does rookie things.

Looking at other positions, if David is one of your ""keep at all costs"" guys, I'm okay letting White walk. Might need a cheap FA there for a year. Still have our safeties for now.

IMO, Succop can go and be replaced with the kid we always have in camp. Camarda isn't going anywhere.

Rachaad White is the truth, and we have Vaughn there too. Wouldn't hate getting a more fullback type guy, but Kieft might be able to do some of that.

At WR, you let Julio and Perriman walk. Miller you can resign cheap. Deven Thompkins is staying. Bring back Cyril Grayson. Could potentially even trade Godwin. Gage is under contract for two more years, though I might cut him depending on the cap ramifications. He's overpaid and way injury prone.

Otton and Kieft look pretty good at TE. Might have to let Brate go for cap.

11322,74923,74923,Kreynard54,"Expounding upon the OC position and why Lefty was a major issue. I can sum it up in one quote.

“Play action doesnt work when the running game isnt working.”

We know this to be factually inaccurate. Theirs been tons of statistical analysis done. On top of that when the team rarely did run play action they were 4th best in the NFL.  

Our receivers were covered 65% of all plays. Highest in the league including the Chargers. Simply put, he did not scheme guys open on play calls. There was made little to no adjustments. 

Injuries happen, its on the coaching staff to be productive with what you have. Leftwich didnt have the ability nor the interest in growing/challenging his frame of thought.   

Bad run play design, we consistently pulled tackles loke Donovan Smith who clearly isnt built for that. We consistently ran at players we had no business running at. Poor fundamentals on who should block
Who, none of it was good and players would constantly make mistakes on who their assignment was. Thats mainly coaching to work out those kinks. 

Bad redzone designs- Bradys throwaway interception against the cowboys is the epitome of how poorly designed our offense was. Why in gods name would be have our top 2 receivers, tight end, and running back, run to the same spot in the endzone. It legitimately made no sense and tons of our play calling was like this. 

Simply put, this is because Arians understood how to put players in a position to make plays, Leftwich did not. Thats why he redlined the game plans and was hoping Leftwich would learn it. He obviously did not, doubled down on his ineptitude and is paying the price for it.",6.0,buccaneers,t3_10wun9l,False,0.0,:RedJersey69: Nice,2023-02-08T08:23:57Z,buccaneers,0.000984885461066

> So yesterday after the Day of Accountability saw several Bucs assistants retire or get fired, a curious name seemed to have survived the bloodletting.

> At least for the time being.

> That name is Keith Armstrong, the Bucs’ special teams coach. And unfortunately for Armstrong and more so the Bucs, the special teams since he’s been with Tampa Bay have been anything but special.

> Rich Gosselin, former Chiefs and Cowboys beat man for the Kansas City Star and the Dallas Morning News, as well as a former NFL columnist, has long had annual special teams rankings each year that are lauded for research and accuracy by NFL types, including Bill Belicheat.

> Since Armstrong came on board with the Bucs in 2019, the Bucs’ special teams have never been ranked higher than 22nd.

> In 2021,Gosselin ranked the Bucs’ special teams at 29th. In 2020, they ranked 22nd. In 2019, the Bucs special teams were ranked by Gosselin dead-last in the NFL, No. 32.

> This really isn’t anything new for Armstrong. In his last two seasons with Atlanta, Armstrong’s special teams struggled as well. In 2018, Gosselin had the Dixie Chicks at No. 20. In 2017, Gosselin’s numbers had Atlanta at No. 22.

> (Gosselin’s previous special teams breakdowns are stashed behind a paywall at the Dallas Morning News.)

> So in the past five seasons (not counting the 2022 season), none of Armstrong’s special teams were ranked higher than No. 20.

..it would be kind funny and cool if this doesn't happen and he ends up retiring as a Buccaneer 

It's very cool that he won the SB with us, he is literally a Buccaneers legend, I am so glad this didn't turn out shit.

It wasn't like a ""rental"" or whatever. Like, Kawhi won a chip with Raptors and he doesn't feel like a Raptors legend. 

Messi is in PSG and unless he wins the Champions League, it doesn't feel like he's a ""PSG legend"", Mbappe and Neymar seem bigger PSG legends than him.

Same with other greats that changed the teams they are known for in many other sports.

But Brady? I really think we can say that Brady was a Buccaneer with a capital B. It wasn't a ""oh he went to retire"". Just like LeBron and the Lakers... Brady is a Buccaneer. It's a bonafide fact.

He will still have to pay taxes on that income and hacked/stolen funds in crypto are not able to be written off via the IRS. This is at least true for on chain funds.. I'm not sure how custodial funds work in this situation. The bigger piece is Brady's money there is likely with FTX US which is solvent but going through a process so it may be some time before he sees it. This is a plus for Brady although he cannot access it. 

Plus - regarding FTX credit.. I have to wonder if that is in equity which is written down to worthless now (much better for his taxes) or the FTT token itself (which his income would show as the higher amount and if he has access to sell then that's when he would realize gains/losses. So I'm sure Brady has better lawyers than me but it's not that simple to assume he won't be left holding a potentially 7 or low 8 figure bag that comes out of his bigger pockets later. They could realistically make the claim that he never actually held any of the BTC/ETH if that was the credit because Sam was taking in customer deposits to pump FTT and never even bought the BTC/ETH in the first place.

So while you are correct that he didn't invest his entire net worth or 60% of it into FTX.. he still absolutely is going to take a hit financially and reputationally. Like I'm sure that he won't be doing advertisements for Well Fargo or Bank of America (or any financial service) anytime soon.

Add to that the class action lawsuits that people like Brady, Shaq, etc. are receiving for being involved in failed crypto projects as well as fines from the SEC (Kim K), and it rolls up to not being a nothingburger. 

However, I think the OP comment that he lost a ton of money.. he still lost $20m and will have to pay taxes on top of that (most likely) and going through the bankruptcy process and additional legal/tort fees are going to be a bitch as well.

Is that to the degree of Brady and Kraft’s relationship? I can’t say for sure, but I’d most certainly say “probably not.” Still, I don’t get the sense that Brady wants to stick the Glazers, Licht, and his (former) teammates with a giant cap hit that is the direct result of his departure. He can do a “make good,” as one final act on his way out.

So, could the Bucs and the Patriots work out some sort of deal, where the Bucs get their cap savings and Kraft gets his moment with Brady? Who knows. I personally don’t think its needed, because he’ll have far bigger moments like being inducted to the Patriots Hall of Fame, and of course, Canton.
