2558,34758,34758,DaBlakMayne,"Mock draft I just did:

**R1P4: C.J. Stroud, QB (Ohio State):** He's 6'3 and 218 lbs and is our QB for the future. He's at his most comfortable in the pocket and has a great IQ along with a good touch on his passes. Downside is that he gets ansty under pressure but our OL improvements should hopefully be able to counter that for the most part. 

**R2P35: Kelee Ringo, CB (Georgia):** Considered the most athletic corner in the class, this is a Ballard pick for sure. He's 6'2, 205 lbs and allegedly runs a 4.35-4.4 forty. His ceiling is high but his floor is a bit low. He's pretty raw and is easily fooled by offenses along with having issues with changes in direction. I think having him learn behind some of our DBs (assuming Gilmore comes back) would be a huge help for him to eventually start full time. But even if Gilmore is out, Kelee is projected to be a day one starter but there will be growing pains 

**R3P79: Byron Young, EDGE (Tennessee):** Is it a Colts draft without us picking a slightly undersized but athletic DE? Standing at 6'3 and 245 lbs, he'd be added to our pass rushing corps, most likely replacing Lewis and Banogu. He has long arms, is explosive and can play a variety of spots on the line. His downside is the fact that he's a bit undersized and needs to improve his strength. He's also stiff in the hips

**R4P106: Andrew Vorhees, OG (USC):** He's 6'6, 320 lbs and hopefully the answer to our issue at RG. He can hold his own against the bigger pass rushers by himself and is especially talented in the run game, he will move you if he gets his hands on you. His flaw is that due to his size, he can get beat by speedier defenders and because he's tall, he sometimes stands too upright when getting out of his stance. But he should shore up the line and keep Stroud from panicking along with giving JT all the space he needs to punch through the LOS. 

**R5P140: Rakim Jarrett, WR (Maryland):** He's 6'0 and 200 lbs. His big selling point is his high IQ, he can play anywhere as a receiver and knows where he needs to be once the play starts. He's also good at getting yards after catching due to him being hard to bring down. He however doesn't have good separation speed so he's not the ideal person to use for vertical plays, he's more of a short to mid route guy which could be great in the redzone but he may be limited to a slot role with us. 

**R6P181: Kenny McIntosh, HB (Georgia):** He's 6'1 and 210 lbs. He's a late round pick so why not take a shot? He's a dual threat HB and can play a role in the passing game that we currently are lacking without Hines granted Jackson has done a solid job overall.  He would be a special teamer to start out for sure but he could easily start making his way into the rotations on third downs and such. This also helps us in 2024 when all our current RBs are free agents, one less player we'll have to worry about. Let it be known that I 100% think we extend JT before 2024 but the backup role will be wide open. 

**R7P223: Kei'Trel Clark, CB (Louisville):** He's a hybrid CB who can play both slot and outside and is 5'10 and 180 lbs. It wouldn't surprise me if Kenny Moore gets traded before the deadline. We will need someone to potentially fill in that spot. I'm not saying Clark will immediately start but he could be in the rotation. He can play press and cover decently enough. He's also competitive and a bit of a daredevil who sometimes plays the ball instead of the person to try and get a pick (both a pro and a con).",6.0,colts,t3_10v60yg,False,0.0,Andrew Luck,2023-02-06T13:53:29Z,colts,0.0152788747204146

I‚Äôve started a YouTube channel, and this is easily my favorite video so far. Andrew Luck is the player who got me into football, and it was really fun going through all of his games, and watching each of his touchdowns dozens of times.

In total, this video took about 25-30 hours to create, with over 8 hours dedicated to deciding the order of the plays!

‚ÄúThe Colts‚Äô process has been an interesting one, and, honestly, I can‚Äôt wait to hear more detail on what it was like when it‚Äôs over. The first round of interviews, which were done over Zoom, were run by Ballard, with vice chair Carlie Irsay-Gordon (Jim‚Äôs daughter), director of team development Brian Decker and PR and HR staffers involved. The second round, done in person, has brought in more people such as Dodds into the loop and incorporated the owner in a big way.

That, I think, is part of why it‚Äôs worked this way‚Äîthe virtual interviews almost served as a preliminary round, with the real interviews happening with a whittled-down group of seven.

As for how those went? Well, they were long (12 hours or so) and involved (Irsay got one-on-one time with each candidate). They were also creative, with one person informed of the process calling it 30% football, 30% leadership, 40% other stuff. And so it seems like if the Colts are going to replace, rather than promote, Jeff Saturday, they‚Äôll have done more than enough homework in getting themselves there.

The other thing that I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs interesting? Every candidate coming out of there, or at least the second-rounders, sincerely seem to think they absolutely crushed it. I‚Äôve heard that Rams DC Raheem Morris, Bengals OC Brian Callahan and Lions DC Aaron Glenn did well, with Eagles OC Shane Steichen having gotten the last crack at it over the weekend.

There is background here, too, that‚Äôs worth noting. Callahan is close with Peyton Manning (he was with Manning in Denver), and Manning‚Äôs word still carries a lot of weight with the Irsays; and Callahan‚Äôs dad, Bill, was on the coaching staff at Wisconsin when Ballard was a receiver there in the early 1990s. Morris‚Äôs ties to Indy are logical ones, too‚ÄîDC Gus Bradley (whom Indy‚Äôs blocked from leaving) was with Morris in Tampa from 2006 to ‚Äô08; and Ballard‚Äôs NFL upbringing in Chicago was with former Bucs people (Jerry Angelo, Lovie Smith).

So we‚Äôll see where it goes. And, again, I‚Äôm excited to dig in to how it will have all played out in the aftermath.‚Äù",29.0,colts,t3_10vaemq,False,0.0,Big-Q,2023-02-06T11:13:50Z,colts,0.0365522829919746
