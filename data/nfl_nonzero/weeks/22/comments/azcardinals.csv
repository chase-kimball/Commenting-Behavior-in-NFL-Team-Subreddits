474,5113,5113,808Cardinals,"We have a lot of holes (CB, DT, Edge, IOL, Center, maybe WR) and need to sign some FA players on limited cap who will accept to come to this team (probably need to overpay). I feel that we will target the CBs and D’Aron Payne in FA since the edge and IOL are kind of not the top end.

I love Will Anderson, but if we can get some damn good capital and have MO hit home run blue chip players, it would turn the team around faster than the lone “possible” generational pass rusher. For example, look at how Myles Garrett’s career gone during his time with the Browns; he is a perennial pro bowler now and puts up stats, but the Browns are not winning significantly per say. If say MO can turnaround the Oline with picks like Skoronski, Acuila, and Schimdt (with the Carolina’s trade) would you take it? 

I am concerned we are going to waste Anderson’s career (or not be able to resign him) if we do not rebuild the roster fast enough.

**Overall Regular Season Record**: 169-100-2

Probably my best year of picking games ever, which is funny because I feel like I know less about these teams than you in years past but have instead mostly gone with what felt most likely. Anyway, for the last game I'll give a prediction for how the game goes in addition to the final score. Hope everyone has a blast and enjoys the game! 


__**Super Bowl LVII ~~Script~~ Prediction**__

**1st Quarter**

Chiefs get the ball first and drive all the way down the field only to end up settling for a field goal. Eagles also have a long opening drive that extends into the early 2nd quarter, but after 15 minutes the Eagles are threatening in the red zone. 


*Score 3-0 Chiefs*


**2nd Quarter**

Jalen Hurts finds Devonta Smith in the end zone to give the Eagles the lead a minute into the quarter. The teams trade 3-and-outs but when the Eagles punt back to the Chiefs, the infamous KC special teams that has been an issue all season rears its ugly head as they fumble the return back to the Eagles. Hurts leads them to a quick score as he throws a TD to Goedert. With time winding down in the half Mahomes leads the Chiefs down the field and finds MVS with mere seconds left in the half to cut into the deficit. 


*Score: 14-10 Eagles*


**Halftime**

Everyone will either comment that this is the best or the worst halftime show in years, maybe even both takes will come in at the same time. Also for the game there won't be many memorable commercials (just a few that get a chuckle or get a sigh) except Burger King will reveal that their jingle was in fact a mind control experiment that passed with flying colors. ""You rule"" is a lie; ""they rule (the world)""  


**3rd Quarter**

Eagles start hot in the second half with a TD drive that includes a 4th-and-1 where they line up for the Hurts sneak but reveal the long con and Hurts completes a jump pass to AJ Brown. Gainwell continues his impressive postseason run as he's the one to score the rushing TD. Chiefs have a promising drive but the Eagles pass rush comes in clutch and forces the punt. After getting the ball back, the Chiefs score a quick TD when McKinnon catches a shovel pass from Mahomes. However the Eagles stop the 2-point conversation attempt. 


*Score: 21-16 Eagles*


**4th Quarter**

Eagles offense continues to stall as Chris Jones comes up with a huge 3rd down stop to force a punt. Mahomes and Kelce work their magic and they connect several times en route to the go ahead TD with 6 minutes left. This time they do get the 2-point conversion as Toney scores on an end-around. Hurts then has his legacy drive, including a clutch 4th down scramble and completion to AJ Brown. Elliott hits the 34 yard field goal with 1:10 left to tie it and the Chiefs out of timeouts. However Mahomes calmly leads the Chiefs into FG range as Butker hits the game-winner from 49 yards as time expires.

15141,135623,135623,TJeffersonsBlackKid,"Kylers contract was negotiated by Steve Keim and Erik Burkhardt who are both drunken idiots and the laughingstock of the league at their positions. Rumor in the Cardinals headquarters is that Kylers camp out in the clause to squeeze out extra money though this has never been proven. Still, it’s not like coherent minds are putting these items together.

Regarding the Cardinals, Keim consistently put together decent free agents, shit draft, and no depth. Every team has injuries but not every team was having to start who the Cardinals were having to start.

Here’s a list of the Cardinals offensive starters who missed significant time due to injuries/suspension:

Kyler Murray

Zach Ertz

DeAndre Hopkins

James Connor

Hollywood Brown

TJ Humphries

Rodney Hudson

Justin Pugh

In addition to these injuries, we started 10 different o-line combinations and 14 different players on that o-line. Kelvin Beachum started every game so effectively the 4 other positions were filled by 13 different starters. We went down to our FIFTH string guard at one point, starting Rasheed fucking Coward for three games. Coward was a defensive tackle who became an offensive tackle who filled in at guard for us due to our situation.

Every team has injuries but not every team has Steve Keim dealing with depth. Keim does not believe that line depth matters and believes it is not something to budget for.

The remains of this squad and bringing a new system to a QB who can’t walk practice until the seasons already started is the challenge. Also Nuk understandably wants to leave.

Even still, the idea of anyone shying away from a head coaching job anywhere is pure horseshit. Maybe Bidwell is being too apprehensive or not offering enough or both.

16032,147323,147323,UserInAtl,"Realistically the Cardinals will go where Murray does. If he goes back to the MVP levels of last season we are probably fine. Otherwise the roster is pretty much terrible, especially if Hop leaves. Probably not as bad as r/nfl makes it out to be but way worse than this sub, who tends to massively overrate players, especially if they are from ASU or white.

If we draft #3 we are probably fine with Allen, and whoever we pick in the DLine. Not top 10 but good. CB is pretty weak. Wilson could keep developing but Murphy is a slot guy and we have a gaping CB1 hole. The rest of our secondary is good though. Unfortunately Safety is more of a luxury position though. Simmons is inconsistent and Collins is fine but pretty overrated by this sub. Hes definitely a stater but your not even thinking about him when talking top LBs, but I also disagree that he is behind schedule.

Our Oline is pretty poor. Hump is expensive but probably our best lineman. When Pugh isn't busy being injured he is total garbage. Hudson retired unofficially last year and Jones has potential but he is best at Humps position. Beechum is a starting quality guy though. The rest aren't even worth mentioning. Probaly depth at best but you don't want any of them actually playing 

Ertz is fine but aging. He is probably hitting the wall sooner or later and McBride did fine. Trending in the right direction but I dont think you build your offense off of him next year. Maybe in 2 or 3 though. Connor is good but our line can't open holes so it doesn't really matter tbh. Our WR group outside of Hop is probably bottom 10. We wildly over rate Wesley. Great depth but he isnt a starter. Dortch isn't a WR 1 either.

Really, if Murray comes back strong were probably 1 or 2 good drafts from competing (especiallyif he can get outside of the pocket and take pressure off of our terrible OLine which will take a bit to fix).

I'm aware that Italian food is highly regionalized. More of a commentary on the perceptions of the Italian or ""Mediterranean"" diet, etc. I know they love their butter up north, etc. The difference between Italian and American waistlines lies less in what they eat, and more in how they eat it, how much, less stressful lifestyles, more walking, etc.

I always laugh at the ""Mediterranean diet is healthier"" oversimplification stuff, not only because the regionality of Italian cuisine, not to mention every other country in the region, but also because it's an abstraction that doesn't really exist commonly anymore outside of pre-industrialized peasant farmers and fishermen from 50+ years ago in certain parts of the Mediterranean. The average Spaniard, Italian, or Greek is a lot more likely nowadays to be indulging unhealthy amounts of fried sardines dipped in mayonnaise, or gyros and souvlaki with lots of fries and a soda than to be eating lentil salad with beets and some barley bread and a couple of grilled anchovies or whatever in this day and age.",2.0,nfl,t3_10x3zrq,False,0.0,:Cardinals: Cardinals ,2023-02-08T15:53:12Z,azcardinals,-0.0573839167892932
