490,8267,8267,Actual-Manager-4814,"Has it been confirmed that players felt like he got it handed to him this year?

I don't pay a ton of attention to those kinds of reports, but I definitely noticed during the Bears game the team looked so disinterested with Trey. I remember thinking watching that game live that he was on the ground all game and nobody was picking him up. It literally reminded me of the Any Given Sunday scene when Jamie Foxx loses his helmet in the rain and one of his teammates kicks it away from him. Obviously it wasn't quite that bad, but a stark contrast to anytime Jimmy or Brock go down. Usually a lineman or three are running over to pick those two up. 

Nothing from his interviews screams primadonna, but I can see how they'd feel a certain way about him. He didn't seem prepared. I doubt he was running plays as designed, and was relying too much on making something happen with his legs, which even when he succeeded he still seemed to get the cold shoulder. It's got to be frustrating when you've put in the work and you're doing your job and your QB is just playing backyard ball. Especially when the offense is predicated on precision. 

I think he's a good dude. Hopefully he matures as a QB. Still hoping Brock gets the job but if Trey makes some leaps and bounds he could be scary.",6.0,49ers,t3_10x81sw,False,0.0,:jerseyaway20: Garrison Hearst,2023-02-08T14:40:50Z,49ers,-0.035418964643485
491,8274,8274,Actual-Manager-4814,"Ravens had the 12th best defense that year. Seattle was 1, and we were 2. They were 10th in offense and we were 11th. 

They were one of the only teams to win a Superbowl without a single digit ranking on either side of the ball. You are right, though, Giants were worse in 2007, being 15 and 16 on offense and defense respectively (the only other team to not have a single digit ranking). That team was arguably worse than 2012 Ravens, but their defense was severely underrated in 2007. Given how badly they manhandled what was considered the best offense in league history, I think they overcame a weaker regular season performance to finish as one of the premier defenses in the league. In 2011 the Giants were 9th in offense and 24th in defense, which was another great opportunity for us but again, it's about when you get hot. 

The Patriots were never outside of the top 10 in at least one category in each of their SB wins. Their ""worst"" team was probably in 2001 when they were 7th on offense and 6th on defense, and probably their second worst was in 2003 when they were ranked 16th on offense, but they were still first in defense.

The only QB's to overcome not having a top 10 defense were Elway, Brees, and both Mannings. So we'll want to keep our defense intact, unless we hope to get Arch in a few years /s.

There's entire neighborhoods, communities, and states where playing the sport isn't even possible for lower income people. So you'd only have a smaller preselected group who could even qualify in the first place doing that sport.



It would be impressive to be something like the best at equestrian, the best at archery, the best at figure skating, etc. But to then label those people the best *athletes*? That's something else.

10841,78990,78990,HawkofDarkness,"Excellent question.

I would think it's the scheme except the injury situation is not QB specific, and Shanahan's other teams as OC (the Falcons, Browns, Washington aside from the RG3 situation) didn't suffer the same level of injuries. It's only when he came here that it started to become a thing.


In truth, we've been talking about the injury situation *for a decade*. Here is an article going over this issue: https://www.knbr.com/2022/10/16/the-49ers-decade-long-injury-woes-defy-explanation/


For the QB position specifically there hasn't been one starting QB that hasn't suffered a season ending injury since 2012. Alex Smith, Colin Kaepernick, Blaine Gabbert, Brian Hoyer, CJ Beathard, Jimmy G, Nick Mullens, Trey Lance, Brock Purdy, all have received devastating injuries once or multiple times which have taken them out, with Smith being the least severe (serious concussion which kept him in the protocol and allowed Kap to assume control of the team).


This all under multiple coaches and regimes.


The injuries outside of the QB have even been more numerous and we've talked about that issue for years. The only common denominator with everything is that all of this only started happening once we moved to Levi's stadium, since previous to that we didn't have these types of injury issues. Remember that 2014 season where half the Niners team were lost for the season due to injuries or retired, which was wildly considered the craziest off-season for a team of all time? Happened when we moved to Levi's.


I wrote 5 years ago that Levi's stadium was cursed citing numerous examples of these injuries over the years and people laughed at: https://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/7g7igj/its_time_to_understand_and_acknowledge_this_levis/

23124,160899,160899,SoKrat3s,">and you are blaming the defense.

On multiple occasions where the Chicago offense was about to walk off the field after a 3rd down the defense committed stupid penalties that gave them a free first down an extended the drive.  Then, on multiple occasions they gave up a completely blown coverage which allowed a wide open WR for a free score.  The defense turned a 49ers lead into a 49ers deficit.  

>He scored 10 points

In the mud bowl Jimmy Garoppolo led the offense to 6 points in 59 minutes.  

Trey Lance also isn't supposed to be the entire offense.  Elijah Mitchell got hurt in the second quarter.  Jeff Wilson came in and was horrible 9-22-2.4 YPC.  Deebo, who only got 2 carries in the second half, also fumbled away a redzone possession earlier in the game.  George Kittle didn't do anything either... because yet again he wasn't healthy for a Trey Lance start.  

Trey was 8/13, 62%, 121 yds,  9.3 YPA, 92.2 Rating before the defense blew the lead.  If the defense doesn't give up those scores, the 49ers have the lead, and Trey Lance isn't throwing the ball one more time in the 4th quarter (like how Fields didn't).  

>also had a horrible training camp again

Counting training camp stats is about the dumbest thing someone can do.  No QB is focused on completion% in training camp.  They are learning new plays, often with a bunch of new players, working on all sorts of things.  They aren't merely simulating games in all these throws, they are specifically working through a number of different things.  

Counting training camp stats is worse than counting spring training stats for a pitcher learning a new pitch.

>Lance had all the chances to beat out jimmy g last season. If he came out against Arizona and played as well as Brock did against the bucks, he would’ve never seen the bench again. 

Trey being notified late on a week 5 Friday with no practice isn't the same situation as Brock already playing for nearly an entire game, getting comfortable in the offense, having an entire week to study with a gameplan and practice with all the other starters.  

You are trying to imply those are two are identical situations when they aren't.  

* Nothing about the preparation for those games is the same. 
* The opponent wasn't the same
    * Arizona was on the road, against the #1 defense in the NFL at the time.  
    * TB was at home against a league average defense.  
* And the surrounding talent pool wasn't the same.  
    * wk 5 2021: 
        * B.Aiyuk still had troubles separating & was in the doghouse.                          
        * Mitchell was the starting RB, but that position was still highly inconsistent.  
        * Mitchell only ran the ball 9 times in that game.  
        * Kittle was not available for that game.
        * Leaving Lance with no security blankets and only 1 good target.  That one good target (Deebo) dropped 2 of 9 targets (22.2%)         
    * wk 14 vs TB
        * Purdy had an incredibly safe and reliable security blanket in G.Kittle.  
        * He had a secondary security blanket for throws underneath to CMC
        * He had a reliable All-Pro starting RB
        * He third and fourth really good receiving option in Deebo and the good version of Aiyuk.  

Nothing about the two situations were the same.

Jimmy's first ACL tear was from a scramble down the field, he tried to turn upfield for more yards, stuck his foot in the ground to pivot, and tore his ACL.  That has nothing to do with scheme.  

His initial high ankle sprain in 2020 occurred when a Jets defender fell on the back of his foot.  He simply reinjured it later in the season.  Not really scheme related.  

In 2021 his thumb got jammed up in a passing attempt (similar to R.Wilson).  Nothing extremely unusual about that play or hit.  

In 2022 the Dolphins did have a free rusher off the left side.  But Jimmy saw him.  Jimmy refused to throw the ball away or take the sack.  Instead, with the defender already in his face trying to tackle him, he makes a really confusing attempt to run for it, and gets tackled from behind.  

One of his biggest problems that nobody talks about his his refusal to throw the ball away.  While the 49ers haven't been sack leaders, Jimmy G still takes more hits than he should because he refuses to throw it away.  

The Trey Lance injury isn't a scheme issue.  Trey looked right at the two defenders and chose not to slide.  His belief that he can just truck every defender out there is what caused his injury.

>They refuse to acknowledge that scheme played any part in any of the 4 QB injuries they had this year.

* Trey Lance made the decision to keep the ball and run.  He looked straight at two defenders and decided not to slide.  Are mobile QBs more prone to injury?  Sure.  Nobody disputes that.  But Allen, Hurts, & Jackson all run nearly the exact same play Lance got hurt on.  
* Jimmy Garoppolo had a defender in his face and decided with his complete lack of mobility that running for it was better than stepping up into the pocket or just taking the sack.  He also could have thrown the ball away, but if you actually knew anything about him you would know he refuses to do that.  He has just 22 throwaways in 1561 dropbacks since 2018. 
* Scheme didn't force Purdy to hold onto the ball on the play he got hurt on.  He's actually admitted himself that he should have released it sooner.  You also have ""experts"" at the ringer who attack Shanahan, completely ignorant to the situation that the ""backup TE"" is actually a pass blocking specialist.  Just because someone isn't out there catching 100 passes a year that doesn't mean they aren't normally a proficient blocker.  The scheme was for the pass-blocking specialist to give just a small window, and there is a small window to throw on that play.  And nearly every team in the league has 2 TE sets where the better pass catcher isn't the primary blocking TE.  So again, that isn't scheme.
* There wasn't anything wrong with the scheme on the play Johnson got hurt on.  The RG (Burford) & RT (McGlinchey) both had 1-on-1 blocks.  Burford just gets beat by his man 1-on-1.  That happens sometimes.  It wasn't poor scheme.  It was a great pass rush win for Suh.  

You say all this but it just displays a really poor knowledge of what actually happened on these plays.  Not knowing the 49ers players I get.  But not knowing Suh just happened to win a 1-on-1 battle with the RG, that's inexcusable.  

>and his chief critique all year that he holds the ball too long
