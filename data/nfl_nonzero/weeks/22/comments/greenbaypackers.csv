Dudes mentioned in the earlier comment like Barry, Pettine, Menenga, Mo Drayton are all great examples, but there‚Äôs also guys like: 

- Amari Rodgers who returned punts too long even though Kesean Nixon clearly was a far more dynamic and fantastic returner
- WR‚Äôs who sat behind Sammy Watkins like Toure and Doubs even though Watkins was terrible all season and younger guys clearly gave more spark in the offense 
- Ford beating out Savage took until late in the season even though Ford immediately showed he was better until Savage got that wake-up call being benched
- Guys on the D line rotation who were clearly outperforming some of the vets like Wyatt and Slayton, but never saw significant snaps until Lowry went down and the season was basically over

He‚Äôs got a little bit of that McVay in him where he likes to set it and forget it at the beginning of the season and then just go with it no matter what. There‚Äôs also a little bit to be said about how his slow to give up on people can be a good thing, like how Mike McDaniel said that LaFleur not giving up on him was one of the best things another person had ever done for him and his career. Some guys work out over time but I don‚Äôt know that Matt ever is willing to accept that sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work out.

Guys like Hacket and Pettine weren‚Äôt particularly great coordinators, but they both have HC experience and I think they probably alleviated and guided Matt more as he grew into the role and it made the team run more efficiently, but now that they‚Äôre gone Matt needs to sink or swim and right now he‚Äôs floundering without having some older guidance, which isn‚Äôt what you want in a head coach",32.0,nfl,t3_10ttd4x,False,0.0,:Packers: Packers,2023-02-04T19:10:20Z,greenbaypackers,0.1585490097736625

The Packers as a whole didn't have enough to make the playoffs this year even with everything going our way the last few weeks, so to even go on a deep run next year would be a massive win whether or not Rodgers has an even better result somewhere else.
