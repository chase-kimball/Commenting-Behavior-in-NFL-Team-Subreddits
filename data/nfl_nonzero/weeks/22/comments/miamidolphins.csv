Hold on now. Something just doesn't feel right about that. There has to be a more successful modern coach. 

- .641 regular season win rate

- .568 post season

- 1 Ring

- 3(about to be 4) SB appearances.

If he wins next week, I could see giving him that spot. But I feel like there has to be a ""modern era""(I'm assuming this means salary cap era, so '94 onwards?) that has a better resume than that.

Hell just looking at current coaches real quick and Tomlin stacks up.

- .636 regular season win rate

- .471 playoffs

- 1 Ring

- 2 Appearances

8 years less of coaching, but the only major difference is playoff record(21-16 vs. 8-9). And that only came with Mahomes. Prior to Mahomes being his starter, Andy was 12-14 in the playoffs.

6255,45892,45892,Cidolfus,"I know I'm more down on Gesicki than most, but I really think that this is a case of buyer beware. Gesicki's career best receiving season was 2021 when he was force fed the ball (a whopping 112 targets) and even then he still only had 780 receiving yards. His career high touchdowns is six, which is good but not great. For a guy who should be a size mismatch and a nightmare to defend especially in the red zone, his production never matches expectation, even when we've made him a primary target in the passing game.

Gesicki has all the physical tools and he's by all reports a great teammate, but he's never lived up to his potential and I'm not convinced that a change in scenery helps him. He's not just an underwhelming blocker, he's among the worst blockers of all the tight ends in the league. He's not a great route runner and his in-game speed doesn't live up to his great combine performance. He gets absolutely terrible separation (consistently among the worst in the entire league), and despite his size he's not that dominant on contested catches (47.0% across his career and only 20% this past season).

If a team can get away with paying him $7- or $8 million per year, they'll probably be happy with what he brings to the table, but for a guy who's so one dimensional he needs to be in a very specific role (big slot in a spread offense) to excel, he's putting up numbers that don't pop for a number two receiver and not worth the big bucks at TE.",57.0,nfl,t3_10tmzgf,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2023-02-04T13:11:33Z,miamidolphins,0.0468574742313125

The inverse of that is Tom Brady having the lowest time to throw in 2020-21 despite having an elite Bucs OL because of how quickly he gets rid of the ball, not because the OL doesn't give him time.
