321,3368,3368,2ChainzTalib,"Starting out with my all time favorite football player, number 27. The Smiling Assassin. One of the most feared hitters to play the game. 

From his Hall of Fame entry:

>The Denver Broncos selected Steve Atwater out of Arkansas in the first round, 20th choice overall, of the 1989 NFL Draft. A hard-hitting and instinctive safety, Atwater played in 167 games during his 11-season career.

>He made an immediate impact at free safety in his rookie season. Atwater recorded 129 total tackles (2nd most on the team) to help turn around a Denver defense that ranked 20th in points allowed the previous year to become the NFL’s stingiest unit in 1989 that allowed the fewest points in the league. The Broncos finished that season with the AFC’s best record at 11-5 and a berth in Super Bowl XXIV.

>Atwater was voted to the first of eight Pro Bowls following the 1990 season and earned first-team All-Pro recognition for the first of two straight years (1991-92).

>In 1997, he was an integral part of the Broncos’ championship season that was capped by the franchise’s first Super Bowl title. Atwater contributed 83 tackles (61 solo), one sack, two interceptions, eight passes defensed, and two fumble recoveries as Denver finished 12-4. His strong play continued throughout the postseason. He added 15 tackles (10 solo), one sack, a forced fumble, and five passes defensed in four playoff games.

>Atwater played his final season with the Broncos in 1998 and he helped lead them to a second straight Super Bowl victory. That year he recorded one interception, seven passes defensed, and racked up 55 solo tackles 30 assisted tackles. He had four tackles, three assists and two passes defensed in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Atlanta Falcons.

>In all, Atwater, recorded 24 interceptions which he returned for 408 yards and a touchdown, added five sacks, and registered more than 1,000 tackles. He was named to the NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 1990s.

25815,157606,157606,iSamurai,">	Besides the head coach and play-caller, there isn’t a more important member of the coaching staff than an offensive line coach.

>This is for a multitude of reasons, but just on the surface level, there isn’t a coaching position teaching more players on the field at once. Being able to communicate and teach a multitude of different players isn’t an easy task.

>Nearly half of the offensive players on the field are taught directly by the offensive line coach, making the responsibility he has even more vital to the team’s success. No two people learn the same way, and how players use technique across the offensive line is vastly different depending on the position. For example, an offensive guard’s responsibilities are entirely different than offensive tackles.

>To go along with that, the offensive line is a very tough position group to teach in today’s NFL. While the saying goes, “everything starts up front” applies to all levels of football, the college game and NFL game are vastly different — what these players are asked to do at the collegiate level often doesn’t correlate easily to the NFL. Pairing that with how NFL practices are becoming more and more strict regarding how much physical contact is allowed — it makes it increasingly difficult to prepare players at a position like the offensive line, where contact is inherently part of everything they’re supposed to do.

>Offensive line coaches are also tasked with how to block and counter against all of the exotic looks various defensive coordinators throw at them throughout the season. While blocking may look the same to the average fan, this could not be further from the truth. Depending on the look the defense is giving them and the play the offensive coordinator is running — blocking responsibilities change down to down.

>Because of how difficult the job is now and is increasingly becoming, the value of having a really good coach to both prepare the starters and develop the newcomers, despite the difficulties, is indispensable to any staff in the league.

Russ injured his finger 10/7/2022 against the Rams. Despite this usually being a 6-8 week injury, he came back in, like 4 and was obviously not right yet, so throw out his first games back.

- 19.3 Completions on 29.9 attempts
- 221 yds./game
- 2.14 TDs and .4 Ints.
- **15 touchdowns** and 3 Ints. - which is an *insane* *5-1* TD/Int. Ratio
