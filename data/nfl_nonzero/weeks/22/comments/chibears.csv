If the numbers are outrageous and it’s clear the two sides won’t see eye to eye, the Bengals could go the route taken by multiple teams in recent seasons and deal the receiver for a top draft pick and start the cycle over with a rookie receiver.... The Bengals can also choose to bank on Higgins reporting this year and playing, then deal with extensions and franchise tags (or potential tag and trade) in 2024. The parallels to the Bates situation are almost too many to believe. Maybe Burrow takes less and says give that money to Higgins so the weapons stay together.

36) New York Giants

Original pick: Breece Hall, RB (NYJ traded up)
New pick: Braxton Jones, OT

The way this re-draft worked out, the Giants didn't get an offensive tackle with either of their picks in the top seven. Jones played better than Evan Neal this season, anyway. In fact, Jones -- whom the Bears drafted in the fifth round -- had the best pass block win rate of any rookie tackle (92.8%) and was second in run block win rate (78.7%). -- Jordan Raanan


39) Chicago Bears
Original pick: Kyler Gordon, CB
New pick: Jaquan Brisker, S

The versatile safety was Chicago's most impactful rookie -- it landed him with its pick at No. 48 -- and showed early signs of becoming a mainstay in the secondary. Brisker stood out on a defense that struggled, particularly with its pass rush. He led the Bears with four sacks, becoming only the second defensive back in the past 10 seasons to do so, and was second in team tackles (104). Perhaps Brisker's biggest contribution came via the resurgence of Eddie Jackson in his move back to free safety while the rookie played up in the box, in the slot and was called on to blitz. -- Courtney Cronin

48) Chicago Bears (via LAC)
Original pick: Jaquan Brisker, S
New pick: Skyy Moore, WR

The receiving corps around quarterback Justin Fields lacked considerably in 2022. An ankle injury forced Darnell Mooney to miss the final five games and he finished as the leading receiver, with 493 yards and two touchdowns. Moore was far down the depth chart in Kansas City due to an abundance of playmakers around Patrick Mahomes, but he still had more catches (22) than six Bears receivers. His 250 receiving yards would have ranked third in Chicago. Addressing the wide receiver position in the draft could have saved the Bears from sending their own second-round pick to Pittsburgh for Chase Claypool at the deadline. -- Courtney Cronin

51) Philadelphia Eagles
Original pick: Cam Jurgens, C
New pick: Kyler Gordon, CB

Gordon had three interceptions, six passes defended and 71 tackles for the Bears this season. He would be a good option if the Eagles lost James Bradberry in free agency this offseason. Jurgens was drafted as Philadelphia's potential replacement for Jason Kelce, but he played 31 offensive snaps this season. -- Tim McManus",27.0,chibears,t3_10w9f4x,False,0.0,Deep Dish,2023-02-07T12:41:12Z,chibears,-0.0006569355564624

> WRs outside the first round will have less production. This is incredibly obvious

It's not about less production.  People don't realize how little production rookie WRs in general produce, 1st round or not.  


> First round picks are generally more talented. That's why they're picked first.

My post goes into how it's not just the first round, it's everyone outside of the top 10ish.  WRs drafted 12th to 32nd have a 25% chance of putting up 650+ yards.  

It's not incredibly obvious.  For example on the Chiefs sub you consistently see people saying the Chiefs should let Juju walk and just draft someone in the late 1st or 2nd.  My stats say that's a bad idea.  There's a wide misconception about rookie WR production.  People see players like Pickens and Amon-Ra being selected later in the draft and assume they can do the same.

Now maybe it's obvious to you, it's clearly not obvious to a lot of people.

Not sure what you looked at to say he's a bad passer. Was it his stats and only seeing his running highlights? 

The bears passed the ball 1/3 of the time. Which means most times he's around 20 throws for a whole game. You're not going to be putting up the yardage numbers other qbs are if you are throwing that little.

But to get an idea of what he can do is take the stretch from when bears trusted him and opened the playbook to until the game before he basically was beaten to a pulp and had to be taken out (week 7 to week 16), he had over a 68% completion and 7th in CPOE (basically, he's making the type of completions only 6 other qbs are making over avg). So he's taking chances and pushing the ball downfield and is being accurate with them.

Unless you're watching his film, You aren't going to see the big dropped pass plays that should have been easy huge plays, see him working in and around the pocket, seeing him read the field, etc. 

Again, he needs to make improvements. He needs to work on the short quick game and pulling thr trigger when he makes the right read. He gets a second year in the same offense, for once.

This year, Higgins put up similar numbers to last year, while starting a couple of games and leaving them early, as well as missing games straight out. 

So, when brown and Higgins had same target numbers, they put up similar stats, although brown had more TDs. But at the same time, brown was the only real WR the titans had so him.getting better TD numbers isn't surprising.

So, again, I think Brown is a better WR, comparing Higgins to him just isn't fair,  when Brown was the only main guy for titans.

Brown busted out this year due to

Remember, Nick Siriani’s intro press conference was a disaster. Like, so bad. Now he’s coaching in the Super Bowl. 

Small anecdote, when the Bears revealed their current throwbacks George was so proud of them, talked about the 1930s throwback, completely unaware of the fact that this was an era where the league was segregated (thanks in part to his namesake) and it really rubbed players the wrong way. 

When he found out, he could have just dismissed it or said, “oh it’s just history and heritage it’s not about that” but instead he met with the players to learn and understand their perspective. That type of humility and willingness to understand others (from a wildly wealthy family and the most powerful person in the organization) goes a long way with me. 

The Bears now have a black CEO, black GM, black assistant GM, and a black QB, all of whom are incredibly qualified, mind you, but that’s a pretty rare setup in the NFL. Both from the outside and from stories I’ve heard, he was just genuinely sheltered and ignorant, but once he learned more about the players’ perspectives, the team’s history and reputation in regards to race, but he genuinely wanted to learn and understand and change the way he conducts business to create opportunities for more diversity in NFL upper management. 

I don’t think he’s perfect at all. By contrast though he’s way better than his predecessor pretty much across the board. And I genuinely think he wants to learn and get better. He wanted a football guy at CEO. He wants a coach who wins. He wants to find and empower the right people. 

Maybe he’s dumb. Maybe he’s just awkward like the rest of his family. But since he took over things have slowly improved on a lot of levels.

I’ve followed the NFL long enough to trust my intuition on these things. I find I’m right more often than wrong at tracking rumors. Honestly I think they might have moved on sooner but it’s really, really ballsy and career-defining to move on from a reigning MVP, let alone a back to back MVP. So the team did what they needed to do to keep him, but left themselves an out this year. 

Trading a reigning MVP vs trading an aging QB who missed the playoffs *feels* a lot different. I think people underestimate that a GM position is a job, and these folks sometimes make professional decisions instead of necessarily the best decision. If they’re going to do it, this is the season where it’s justified on several levels (and fans are sick of it too; there will be way less pushback than a year ago).

Rodgers said at one point last season that he would understand if they were eliminated from the playoffs and the team wanted to start Love to see what they have. There have been reports that the Jets are interested, and rumors the Packers are at least taking calls. And Rodgers was his typical passive aggressive self last week on McAffee’s show, saying something along the lines of, “I haven’t made my decision yet but apparently there are people making some moves anyway” with respect to the Packers front office, who he clearly does not get along with. 

I think starting from about mid-season last year there’s been enough steadily building drumbeat about him being done in GB that I think it is definitely a strong possibility. 

The thing about his contract is that if they’re going to move on, it has to be this year. They can trade him now, but if they don’t then they have to keep him for 2 seasons. I forget the exact structure but it basically sets them up to trade or commit multiple years.
