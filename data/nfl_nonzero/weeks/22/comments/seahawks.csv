As SEAinLA said, taking a LB in the 2nd is hardly a reach. I know analysts/commentators/random people on the internet have stressed positional value to death over the past few years, but the other side of that is that it's possible to get one of the best prospects at a position later.

EDGE1, QB1, DT1, will all be gone in the top 5. CB1 will probably be gone in the top 10. ILB/MLB1 might be there at 20 and ILB2 might be there at 37. Compare that to taking something like the 7th EDGE and the positional value starts to be neutralized.
