But I do think it was ""close"", wasn't by all that much. The Broncos D held teams to 19 fewer points than the Patriots D over the 16 games. The Broncos were #1 in yards, the Patriots were #9 in yards. IMO that is pretty close, though clearly the Denver D was better. 

IMO the 2015 Broncos D isn't as great as many think. The Seahawks were arguably better, #1 in points and #2 in yards. I think one reason people think it is better than it was is because the Denver offense was pretty anemic, so it stands out by comparison. The Denver D was a lot better than the Denver O, whereas with say the Patriots, the O was very good, even better than the D.

But you can't apply bandaids forever, so  the 16 (now 17) game schedule tells us who those units were.

For example, of the five seasons that Brady and Manning met in the playoffs, in four of those years - 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2013 - Brady had  a much better defense on his side than did Manning. The only time Manning had the better D was in 2015, and that was close - the Broncos were #4 and the Patriots were #10, just  a point separating each other.

This makes sense too, because after all, Brady had defensive genius Bill Belichick designing his defenses, and Manning, well did not, LOL.

As a football fan for over 40 years of my life, I can never remember actively wanting a quarterback to leave our team -  yet at the same time - still believed in him that he could become very good someday. Often when you want someone to leave your team, you just hope they go away. Not the case with Jared. 

Best I can describe it, it was just a matter of timing. Many of us knew he was going to be great; it was just another year or so away from being the QB to get us over the hump and WIN us a SB. Stafford was ready and available at just the right time. And we were able to give him what he wasn't able to have in Detroit. 

One of these days we will look back at this trade and think how odd it was that it seemed to work perfectly for everyone involved. Sure Goff will be around a lot longer than Stafford will; and watching him light defenses up long after Stafford retires, will sting a bit. But ultimately it was the right decision for all.

I'm so happy for him in Detroit as are a lot of us Rams fans. It doesn't hurt the Detroit fans are so accommodating and excited to see Stafford be successful with us; that it shouldn't surprise many people that a lot of Rams fans consider the Lions their second team now.",6.0,nfl,t3_10uf4d4,False,0.0,:Rams: Rams,2023-02-05T16:56:05Z,losangelesrams,0.0662432923679488

When he scorched the league in 2018 it was all McVay somehow even though Goff was out there throwing passes. McVay definitely saved Goff, but Goff also saved himself. He did it again in Detroit this year, but once again he’s seen as a product of the system he’s in for everyone who already decided he’s bad. 

Even Trevor Lawrence looked like ass with Urban Meyer last year and now suddenly he’s a super star again because people’s confirmation bias told them that he SHOULD be good. It had nothing to do with Peterson coming in and building a successful offense around him to those people.
