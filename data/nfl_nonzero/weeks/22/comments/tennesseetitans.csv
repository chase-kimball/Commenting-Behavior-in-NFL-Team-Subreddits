1784,18416,18416,Bieber_hole_69,"Only real way to restructure him and lower cap hit with a year left on the deal is to extend him as far as I can see. The 2021 restructure to fit Julio under the cap did enough damage to future cap that he'll be on the cap through 2025 due to void years regardless. I'm also pretty sure Tannehill does not want to play on a lame-duck contract in 2023.

I'm sure there's a middle-ground to be reached for both sides that gets Tannehill on a manageable deal while giving him future security in return. The cap should also continue to go up, so his salary at current rate would look better in 2024 than it does now.

If he was extended through 2025 and you converted $20,000,000 of his 2023 base salary to a signing bonus, it would lower his cap hit for 2023 by by a bit over $13,000,000. That deal, along with cutting Dupree, Lewan, Woods, Cunningham, Bullock, and Jamarco Jones pre-6/1, and also with a Simmons extension probably puts us at around $45,000,000 in cap space heading into free agency.

There's something to be said about getting above-average QB play for $30,000,000 or so against the cap that Tannehill can provide. Derek Carr and Daniel Jones may be getting upwards of $40,000,000/yr after this off-season. You would also have to tie the cap down with guarantees further into the future with any free-agent/trade candidate QB than you would with a Tannehill extension. It provides more flexibility for the near future than bringing in an outside QB would.

If the team is not in love with one of the QBs in this draft to trade up, I think the best solution to the QB situation is probably to just extend Tannehill and keep him through 2024. You can reassess in the draft next year. His salary and a rookie's salary wouldn't be prohibitive to have together in 2024 if you wanted to draft someone and try to get out of a Tannehill's extension for 2025. But all in all, if Tannehill's gonna be the QB in 2023, it's probably best for both sides to extend him.

Edit: Also looking into other restructure and extension candidates, with a Landry restructure and a Henry extension you can probably free close to another $15M in cap space. We could easily be sitting with around $55,000,000 to work with come March if that's the route Carthon and Vrabel want to take for a re-tooling of the roster. It also does not tie us down to the Tannehill/Henry offensive core for longer than 2024, and could still be worked around if they want to move on after 2023 instead.

And if you wanted to get *really* bold with it and expect Tannehill, Henry, and Landry to be on the team in 2025 with salaries comparable to what they get now, with salary-to-bonus conversions and all the previously listed moves you can get to around $70,000,000 in cap space. The only issue obviously being you can't move-on from any of those guys before 2026 without some dead money to work around...but if they think both guys aren't going to seriously decline and we can't find upgrades through the draft or free agency at better value...why not? Trimming the fat with the cap casualties previously listed doesn't make this team much worse than it already was, none of those guys were significant contributors and missed most of the season, (aside from Bullock, but he's too expensive for a kicker of his caliber.)

1787,18419,18419,Bieber_hole_69,"No matter who was calling plays last year down the stretch it was going to be a disaster. There's no play calls or designs to get around the personnel problems when you have to start the worst tackle pair in the league, the smallest lineman in the league at left guard, the worst receiver group in the league, and have a backup at QB for several games. By the end of the season we had one Day 1 starter left on the o-line, and he was a third round rookie. Anybody calling plays for that offense once the injuries started pouring in was going to crash and burn.

If Vrabel had any inkling that Kelly may be a decent OC or the future at that spot, why burn him with those personnel problems? The offense was going to be bottom-five regardless of play-caller, and we'd be having the same ""Fire Kelly"" chants we had with Downing by January if it was him calling the plays.

Why not just let Downing go down with the ship for the last month or two of the season instead? The issues inherent to the offensive struggles were the roster, that wasn't changing if you fire the OC mid-season. Kelly could be the next Andy f'n Reid for all we know and he would have still looked like shit calling plays in December when Daley was giving free shots on Dobbs less than two seconds into his dropback.

In a way it's kind of like Bowen in 2020, nobody was going to look good calling that defense because of the talent deficiencies. If he was named DC for that year he would have been burned and possibly never recovered. Give him great talent to work with the next year and suddenly he's a revelation as the DC.

Chris Harris is a slam-dunk home run hire. Washington’s secondary improved tremendously during his tenure there. He’s a rising star in coaching and will be a DC sooner rather than later, 2025 by the latest. Getting him as PGC also allows Vrabel and Bown to focus on what they know best, the front-seven, and allow an expert in the backend to help out in a much needed way.

Part of me wonders if the Harris hire isn’t also looking forward to a not-too-distant future where Bowen is getting a HC opportunity in the next season or two as well.

We should have the confirmation Harris is coming here as PGC in the next week or so. It hasn't been confirmed by Harris himself, but reports from insiders were that he was pretty much locked in to choose the Titans over the Bears, who also offered him a PGC role.

Edit: I guess there could be one more DC opening in the coming days, Lou Anarumo is a finalist for the Cardinals HC job. If he gets hired there then the Bengals have a DC opening. Harris does not have any connection with the Bengals current staff AFAIK, so I wouldn't be too worried about it. If he did interview there though, it would further delay the Titans' ability to finalize the coaching staff. Anarumo has been with the Bengals for as long as Zac Taylor has been the HC there, I would expect an internal promotion if Anarumo gets the Cardinals job, especially this late in the cycle.

Point being I guess is that Tyrod is a journeyman backup now, not a journeyman/bridge starter. Brissett, Bridgewater, and Dalton fit the bill more as journeyman starters that teams keep recycling to plug-and-play or use as an insurance option. They've all at least started the majority of games for a team in the last two years.

With Taylor's recent injury history as well, if you go into a season with him as the starter you're not gonna feel great about him physically being able to start the entire season.

It seemed like this year there just weren't going to be enough DC openings to get every guy that probably deserved one a shot, especially with Fangio coming back to fill one and Flores back in the mix too. That was at least how it seemed in January when Harris came to the agreement with us...then suddenly the 49ers and Texans have openings and are interviewing outside candidates.

The internal/obvious assistant pool for DCs that both Ryans and San Fran will be pulling from are the same. Kris Kocurek is apparently staying in San Fran now, so Ryans may have to look outside his previous staff for a DC.

Based on current reports it seems that Steve Wilks is the favorite in San Fran, so that's at least a good sign that we could still keep Harris. It really seems like it's just Houston left, but they do have a limited candidate pool. Reports are the Texans are also interested in Cory Undlin and Marquand Manuel, the former of which he has experience with from San Fran and the latter who is a Saleh guy.

If they have a guy they love, Willis and Tannehill are not keeping them from going up to get him.

That being said though, the more I think about it the more I question if Willis is even on the roster next year. They clearly do not think he's good enough to win games as a backup unless he shows tons of improvement in camp. That means you've just gotta keep three QBs and have Willis as a developmental project on the bottom of the roster. He's not going to make it through waivers to get on the PS, *somebody* is going to take a flier on him regardless of how bad he looked last year. IIRC outside of weeks when Mariota had the nerve injury in 2018 we've never kept three QBs on the roster while Vrabel has been the HC, and even then that was like for one single week.

We'd need to trade up to 2nd overall at a minimum (both Caleb and Drake are already being evaluated as likely better QB's than any in this draft class which means they will likely both be off the board after the 2nd overall pick with caleb more or less guaranteed to go 1st overall even if he doesn't play next year)... also keep in mind that would mean we are settling for whichever the 1st overall team didn't take, so probably Drake Maye. 

that would take 2x 1sts and a 2nd... normally to trade up, offering an even trade deal,  however given that both picks will likely be QB's which are the most valuable player a team can have, both picks could end up costing whichever team wants it much more. It isn't unreasonable to expect 3x- 4x 1st round picks, supposing that either of the top 2 teams want to trade them in the first place which is fairly rare (this year only the bears are interested in trading down the Texans likely aren't) 

In essence if you want to play the trade up game, it is then in our best interest to this year attempt to trade out of our draft picks for picks next year. Given the state of our roster, this is tantamount to tanking... but would help pay some of the draft debt next year. 

You'd also want to do this to increase the odds of a lower overall pick next year (thus decreasing the cost to move up) and to decrease the amount of time it takes to get a 1st round pick in the future to give your QB actual weapons to make the most of their talent.

On top of that there are several other significant reasons. Several of the key players to the Titans SB run were later traded to the Ravens (McNair, Mason, and Rolle off the top of my head). That really pissed off Titans fans and further stoked the rivalry. The Titans were irrelevant for awhile in the early to mid 2010s but still every time when we played the Ravens there was just an air of hate. When Tannehill and Henry came on the scene we were relevant again. Slapping the Ravens in Lamars MVP season, in Baltimore, in the playoffs, really kicked it back off. We didn't just squeak out with a win, we beat them like the Ratbirds they are.
