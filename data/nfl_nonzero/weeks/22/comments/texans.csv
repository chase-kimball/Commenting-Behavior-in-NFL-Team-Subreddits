13444,102850,102850,Nectorist,"Alex Smith still elevated an already-terrible KC team. He had a career revival under good coaching, but that KC team wasn‚Äôt good before he arrived by any means.

I said the Seahawks hadn‚Äôt had a winning season since 2007. They still went 7-9 in 2010 and were lucky to play in a horrible division that year. 

Wentz had MVP-caliber play with his time on the Eagles then and Foles got extremely hot for a short playoff run. That team doesn‚Äôt win without either of them playing at a high level.

You can get a great QB via trade or free agency, yeah, but at the moment what QB is going to come to Houston? What free agent or trade-available QB is out there right now for Houston to acquire? Burrow, Hurts, and Herbert are in line for massive extensions, Mahomes is extended. Josh Allen is extended. Lawrence is on lock with the Jags for a few years, same with Fields with Chicago. These high-level talents just aren‚Äôt there and are being locked down right now. If anyone could just grab a good QB then they‚Äôd do it. 

If everyone could just find a guy in free agency or use a low draft pick to find their QB of the future then everyone would be doing it and no one would ever draft a QB high. QBs picked in later rounds perform worse on average. Guys like Young and Stroud project highly enough to have the ability to turn around a rebuild. Do you think Cincinnati regrets getting Burrow and building around him after? Or Miami? Or the Chargers? Or the Bills? Now, that‚Äôs not to say that all those teams have done a perfect job, but there is a certain floor with them now that they have good QBs in place. 

There is 0 reason to hold off on a QB while viable prospects are in the draft. This is far from a Malik Willis situation.

13445,102851,102851,Nectorist,"The Chiefs had pro bowl QB Alex Smith before getting Mahomes, not just some nobody. If we actually want to look further at that, they went 2-14 before trading for Alex Smith, who immediately took them to an 11-5 record. Yeah, Mahomes stepped into a good situation, but that was because the Chiefs already had a winning QB that they had built around.

The Seahawks hadn‚Äôt had a winning season since 2007 (when they were led by pro bowler Matt Hasselback) before getting Russell Wilson in 2012. 

Nick Foles had a great playoff run, but otherwise has been a backup QB. That whole Eagles season was marked by Wentz performing at an MVP level (that he never replicated after his injury).

The Saints had gone 3-13 the year before acquiring Drew Brees and went 10-6 the year after getting him.

The Buccaneers had been a perennially losing franchise before acquiring Brady, the greatest QB of all time.

When the Rams got Jared Goff the franchise had previously been mediocre and his first season they went 3-13, but a year later they made the playoffs. Acquiring Stafford was done after they had already built a strong roster around Goff, so Stafford was traded for as a massive upgrade.

The Bengals is literally the perfect example of why you build around a QB. They hadn‚Äôt made the playoffs since 2015 when Burrow was drafted and they had gone 2-14 the season before. Within two seasons of acquiring him they‚Äôre in the Super Bowl despite everyone projecting them to have a terrible year. They got their QB, gave him some weapons, made the Super Bowl in his second year, and are now one of the top teams in the NFL.

All of these examples you‚Äôre bringing are of consistently losing franchises being able to elevate themselves to the playoffs after doing one of three things:
1) Aggressively trading for a QB
2) Drafting and developing a QB for the future
3) Signing a high-level QB in free agency

None of these teams were consistently making the playoffs despite bad QB play and were just in need of a small push over the line with a good QB. They were all terrible situations that were able to be turned around after acquiring a good QB. Good QB play immediately elevated these teams and they were able to go fill in the gaps in free agency or through the draft. Us sitting on our hands and refusing to take a QB until it‚Äôs just the right time will just mean that we will continuously put ourselves out of reach of having any success.",3.0,texans,t3_10tn24o,False,0.0,:zerotwo1:,2023-02-04T18:35:54Z,texans,0.0177123032575839
13446,102852,102852,Nectorist,"‚Äúgrabbing an aging Peyton Manning‚Äù he literally won an MVP season with them while throwing 55 touchdowns and 5400 yards. They aggressively acquired one of the greatest QBs of all time and won a Super Bowl. however, despite still retaining a strong roster, they spent the next 6 or so years not going out to acquire a QB again. They only did so this season

Andrew Luck retired in 2018, back when a strong core still surrounded him. Again, instead of answering the QB question, Indy just kicked the can down the road and now have to blow up their roster and tank so they can grab a QB

Cam has been gone from the Panthers for a while, and instead of just being aggressive in the draft and getting their guy, they‚Äôve had several losing seasons with a not-horrible roster in a terrible division because, again, they haven‚Äôt settled their QB issue

This is all to show that a) QB is the most important position and b) the idea of just waiting for ‚Äúthe right guy‚Äù endlessly and using stop gaps in between isn‚Äôt a winning strategy. You‚Äôre going to run into a situation where you‚Äôre not good enough to win big, but not bad enough to play poorly enough to have a high draft pick. A guy like Carter or Anderson might raise our ceiling enough to win us a couple of extra games, but what happens when the QB issue still isn‚Äôt resolved? We gamble on far less certain players like Levis or Richardson? We gamble that we‚Äôll be bad enough to pick high again in 2024 (we won‚Äôt be)?

13447,102853,102853,Nectorist,"Bryce Young is probably the exact opposite type of prospect that Jamarcus Russell was. Concerns for Young come in at size and injury proneness. Jamarcus was huge with a strong arm, but couldn‚Äôt not process the game at an pro level, had a horrible work ethic, and was a poor decision-maker (all of these are things Young excels are).

There are maybe a few more comparisons with Stroud and Jamarcus to be made, but again their concerns are different. Stroud struggles to create out of structure and was blessed by great receivers but is an accurate playmaker and can read coverage well. Most of Jamarcus‚Äôs hype was around his frame and strong arm, which if anything is maybe closer to what you hear talked about with Will Levis (although again, major differences between how those two are perceived and projected).

Before draft, trade Cooks, a 2024 2nd and 2024 4th to Cincy for Tee Higgins. Also sign general depth throughout the O line, D line, and LBs.

**Pick 12** - Plan A- either have a Myles Murphy, Peter Skoronski or a similar elite top ten talent fall to us

Plan B - still have Anthony Richardson on the board and then trade the pick down to the Commies, Bucs or Seahawks for an extra 2nd. Then with our pick now in the late teens, take one of the remaining top three WRs or Van Ness.

Plan C - Draft Quentin Johnson at WR or one of the CBs

**Pick 33** - Trenton Simpson. Doubt he falls this far, but DeMeco loves his linebackers. If we got an extra second from a pick 12 trade, grab Luke Musgrave at TE

**Pick 65** - Tank Dell. Hometown hero. Don't care if he's our second WR of the night. Make our WR room 4-5 deep.

**Pick 73** - Luke Wypler -C- We should sign a new center before the draft, but if we don't we desperately need a one. And if we do, never say no to OL depth

**Pick 101** - Byron Young - further shore up the D line

**Pick 133** - Tyjae Spears - Quality RB depth to go with Pierce
