Taking a QB early in the first will be costly and set back rebuilding the team as a whole. 

Building the team in this draft, while riding with Stidham is likely to be the equivalent of tanking. 

A rookie QB either won't start in 2023 or won't win in 2023, as the draft capital was raided and the team still isn't good. That's a year of your cheap rookie QB gone, but wait, now you don't have your high draft pick in 2024, in a stronger QB class. If you hit a HR with the QB, maybe you feel good about the direction you're heading, but you don't have a choice because you can't draft someone else. Maybe McDaniels makes it to 2024. Maybe 2023 is so bad that he doesn't. Then your new QB gets to learn a new offense with a new HC and OC. Sound like a familiar cycle?

By punting 2023, you essentially provide McDaniels with another year of protection with 2024 being the make or break year, as the big contracts are all ending and the roster should reflect what McZieg wants and feels they need to win. 

It makes the most sense long term, but I don't think anyone in the building has the patience to actually do this right and we're going to see another disappointment of a season that results in winning just enough to not have a premium first pick.",2.0,raiders,t3_10scbs8,False,0.0,:projector:,2023-02-03T02:19:42Z,raiders,0.0074880382214552

They would have easily went to the playoffs if their receivers didnt drop every ball thrown their way this year or stopped getting hurt.   


An average defense is not hard to build, just dont pay 15 mil/year to shitty players. Scheming is way more important. And the oline is legit a RT and some depth away from being average which again is all is needed there which can easily be picked up in FA. Joe burrow went to the championship twice in a row with a bottom 5 oline. its important but not needing a top 10 important. And i said top 5 defense not top 10. Defense gets less and less important every year as the league leans more towards an offensive game. As long as we have somewhere in the 15ish range we will be fine. Add Rogers and we are a playoff team immediately. Worst case we give up a first rounder this and next year but i have a feeling it will be cheaper than that, the Jets are our biggest competition to getting him, and they cant out bid us, they have worse picks and less money

Im not saying they are going to keep him, but the chance of a trade is looking bleaker every day and most likely hes just going to be cut.

Carr mid-convo: That was spur of the moment so that came from the heart. No that was uh, I was having fun with it man it's just been such a crazy time and why and how everything went down. So I'm just trying to have have fun with it. I mean, just even getting invited back here, you know for this week was funny. So, I've just been having fun with everything.


Q: Are you are you through the emotional part yet?  Have you processed it and kind of moved on? Or like where are you in that? 

A: You know, I have so much love for so many people that I've spent so much, I mean we spent so many years together. We've spent so many years together you know, we've had so many discussions and I've grown a lot, through a lot of hard times, a lot of fun times with you guys. You know, and with my friends, and with people in the building, and so I don't think that hurt from not being around them will ever go away, because I love them. But the excitement of what's next, I think is something that is kind of more where I'm at now, you know. I don't think, I'm not sitting there dwelling on it anymore, you know. And I don't wish any ill will for anybody or anything. I definitely won't be the Raiders quarterback that goes away and bashes the new one. You know that won't be me. So, I wish nothing but the best for this place and the people running it and everything.


Q: You've spent a lot of recent years under speculations, especially about what's next, which has to get old right? What was that like and are you ready to turn the page from that particular aspect?

A: Yeah, I mean a lot of it when, I'll say this you know depending on who the coach was and all those kind of things, they definitely let me know how they felt. And so although there was speculation, I didn't never worry about it because I knew where I stood, you know? Now this situation was different, and you know it is what it is. We both move on and I think it's fresh. I think it's good for everybody. I think it's good for me, you know, to move on with my family. But I'll always be a Raider, you know. I'll come back in 10, 15 years and come and take my boys to games and all that stuff. Yeah it'll be fun for me. Maybe the kids sit in the black hole for once.


Q: You control the narrative. What are you looking for in your next team?

A: I mean I just want to win. And so there's a lot of teams that, you know, want to win. And I'm just looking for teams that have made that decision consistentl, that they'll continually choose to do whatever it takes to, you know, put a winning program out there. You know, for me that's what I want, to win, win a championship, you know. And so that's at the forefront of my mind. It's not money, it's not this, it's not that, you know. I just want to, you know, I've thrown for the yards, I have the records, I've done the pro bowls, it's fun, and I'm thankful for all this, but as you guys know, it's not at all why I do it, you know. I want to win a championship and so that's on the forefront. That doesn't guarantee whoever I go to, we can automatically do it. But I'm just, you 
know, place where I have my best chance possible. It's nice having a no trade, because I can take my time, I can be patient. I'll never close the door, could be a trade, it could be I'm released, I don't I don't care about the optics of it. Like, who cares and I can control that, you know. I'm not just going to accept the trade because it looks better. I don't care about that, you know. I'm gonna make the best decision for me and my family. And it was actually nice I was talking to Peyton about it today, when he was released you know and he's like, man he's like it's kind of surreal in the moment, you're like wow, you can't even believe it. You know, but then you just go to the next place and you can move on. You do your best there and no it's nice to hear that from someone who I think is the best man to play the game, is someone I always looked up to and, you know, he's one of those guys that'll go down as one of the greatest ever. So to hear him say that, to hear him say I've been through that too, it's it's nice to hear it.


Q: It sounds like February 15th, it may not happen by this...

A: What's happening? I mean it could, you know. I just I'm doing my due diligence and I would love to talk to all the teams and figure it out myself. I'd love to do that and figure that out, and so we'll see but I'm not closing the door. Just saying I'll do whatever I can do that's best for my family.


Q: You still haven't gotten the ability to do that?

A: I have not.


Q: Have you heard discussions about that and where do you put those things?

A: I mean that's for them to talk about. I'm just abiding by the rules, you know. If it gets to that date, then it gets to that date, you know. And then I'll be able to talk to all my friends.


Q: They definitely haven't come to you with a trade to say yes or no to yet? 

A: I would let Dave talk about that, you know. I would say that there's definitely options that I have, and that I would let Dave speak on that because he's really, you know he wants to kind of be centered around what he's doing and so I don't want to put his business out there or anybody else. I don't think that would be best for me.


Q: It seemed like you're in a good place now, was there was there anger? How did that emotion kind of come through?

A: There was definitely anger yeah. Especially, you know, for certain situations. But like I said, I think I tried to say it best you can in a tweet, right? You know, I'm thankful for everyone that wants me to give me the platform to speak. I'm thankful for everyone that reached out and saying hey why don't you tell your side you know there's always two sides to a story. I said I'm thankful for that but it's not going to do anything, you know? It's not going to make me feel better. It's not gonna, it may give some people some insight and then open some eyes, you know. But for me, it doesn't doesn't help anything and I have nothing but respect for these guys and love for everyone here. So I don't plan on ever really talking about it unless I get crazy and write a book someday.


Q: Are you gonna take a moment Sunday to look around Allegiant? Is that going to be a thing?

A: Oh yeah. I'm going to enjoy it absolutely. I mean part of the first team to ever play here, you know. And that'll mean something to anybody down there 60 years when I'm really old, you know. When they bring us back for some reason and, you know, I think it'll be it'll be a cool moment. Seeing some of the Raider fans here today, you know when I started walking out, I mean I just got goosebumps because they're wearing the jerseys and it brings tears to your eyes because you love them so much and you pour your heart out to try and give them some memories, you know. And so it'll be cool. So yeah I mean I'll enjoy it but I'm not gonna save any grass or take it home or anything like that.",12.0,raiders,t3_10sdnlc,False,0.0,:Raider_Dave:,2023-02-03T01:38:34Z,raiders,0.0044619147448627

From arranging his contract in the first place, to his actual 2 game benching.  This is stuff rarely seen in the league but these are the two making these poor choices (I’m not talking about actually moving on from Carr as being one of their poor choices).  All this and not having any real solid idea of where this vision goes next, ie; Brady, Rogers, Stidham, or Stroud.

If they had spent time after the Saints, or even the Pittsburg game actually shopping Carr around, then we might already have a actual QB in line to start next year, but they didn’t even do that.  Really poor team/player/staff managing.  They even could have signed DC to a one year deal in the first place.  This would have helped decide what they tell us now, that they needed to see if DC would be their QB for the future.  Very idiotic to think if your not sure DC is the guy, why sign him to the deal they made for him???

Nothing these two have done in this ugly situation has shown the fans that there is any real direction they are trying to move to.

I think the biggest bit of noise was when Adams referred to “this play book is like trying to read Mandarin”.  Not much was said in regards to that.  Carr was the best at calming the media down with saying such things.  I think one poignant moment was our LB, Blake Martinez retires mid season???   

You may say that McDaniels didn’t lose the locker room but I look at it as he had a strangle hold on the locker room.  A lot of this will come to light as soon as Carr finds a new home and is safely away from this toxic coach.

Agree if it is a rebuild and they miss stated their intent last year then there are many indicators (Jones signing a glaring one) they are going about this the wrong way.

I can’t believe that anyone who manages any group of people could think they will all respond to the same approach of coaching or leading.  That’s just not possible to bring the best out of each individual.  Some need atta boys while others need a kick in the ass.

McDaniels has not changed regardless of what he tells us.  These are the same traits that labeled him a terrible head coach.  

I know coaches need time to develop there personnel and team but in a full cycle (draft, FA, season) there are no real noticeable improvements (this duo has shown poor choices throughout).  It is easier to replace a coach than a starting QB.

To your point about DBs, I think the Ruggs at #12 decision is even worse if you consider that they had to know they could probably wait at WR... but didn't want to because they knew they were going DB at #19 and I think they thought they couldn't justify a DB at #12.

43202,293551,293551,similar222,"A way to statistically quantify Carr's impact on the Rams game is to look at expected points added per play, which you can find on football reference in the full play by play. https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202212080ram.htm#all_pbp

So for example, the red zone pick, statistically speaking, the expected points before that play of the next score of the game was +4.0 points for the Raiders (EPB = 4.0). The expected points after the play of the next score was +0.280 points for the Rams (EPA = -0.280). So the expected points added by that play was -4.280 for us.

So now let's look at the second half pass plays:
- Incomplete pass on 1st down, -1.23 expected points
- 4 yard scramble on 3rd & 5, -1.16 points
- Incomplete pass on 3rd & short, -1.94 expected points
- 7 yard completion on 2nd & 9, +0.23 expected points
- Incomplete pass on 1st down, -0.55 expected points
- (Giving him credit for the QB sneak), 4th & 2 conversion, +2.19 expected points
- Incomplete pass on 2nd down, -0.7 points
- 4 yard pass on 3rd & 7, -0.72 points

Add up the 2nd half plays where Carr was asked to do something and the result of those plays was -3.98. That hurts when you end up losing by 1. The cumulative impact of his poor second performance was roughly equal to the impact of that horrible red zone INT.

Uh no. I called it a desperation INT. You apparently chose not to read the adjective. That entire paragraph was agreeing with you that those last two drives were not his fault. I was only making the case that the four drives prior to that were his opportunities.

> Outside of the Hail Mary, Carr threw what 5 or 6 passes in the ENTIRE second half. In a Southern California dome no less.

I did detail each of these drives so don't act like I'm ignoring that. Counting up the play totals that I stated, our first three drives of the second half (our only drives in the first 26 minutes of the half), technically yes, 6 pass attempts, plus a scramble. 7 pass plays compared to 10 run plays, which, contrary to your conspiracy theory, is quite reasonable with a two score lead against an opponent that hasn't been able to score. In those 7 pass plays we gained 15 yards and 0 first downs. The running game was doing its job (4.8 yards per carry in those drives plus a first down), but the 2 yards per pass play killed those drives. If Carr had done anything with those plays, we'd have had more plays overall in the half.

As for the drive where we really did take the air out of the ball with 3 minutes left, was it right to call 3 run plays, trying to protect a 6 point lead late, after the Rams offense had finally shown some life? Hindsight says no because they ultimately punted (to the 2 yard line, notably), but they did gain 9 yards on the first 2 of those runs before unfortunately getting stuffed on 3rd & 1. To paint the second half pass/run ratio decision as McDaniels sabotage is just blind hatred.

> Then you look at how good McDaniels coached against the 49ers for 4 quarters for once this season and you see intent. How can anyone not see this??

Players often rally in the week after a huge change. For example it's common for teams to play above themselves for an interim coach in their first game before falling back to earth in later weeks.

Next drive: 4 plays (2 pass plays), 1 incompletion, 1 scramble short of the first on 3rd & 5

Next drive: 3 plays (1 pass play), 1 incompletion on 3rd & 2

Next drive: (starting in Rams territory): 10 plays (4 pass plays), 2-4 for 11 yards and 1 successful QB sneak on 4th down

After that, all runs on the next drive, to your point, then the desperation INT on the final drive.

So basically, 5 drives between late 2nd quarter and early 4th quarter, he had chances to help us get points and didn't. We basically had 3 points in the bag before the INT and 3 points is all we ended up with total on those 5 drives.

So first of all, if next year's draft is better than this year's draft, you can't be all that confident that there will even be a better player available at 29 this year than at our 2nd next year. Or, if you just look straight at the draft value chart, pick 29 is worth 640 points. If we suck next year as many are expecting, let's say we have the 10th pick, then pick 42 that we're giving back is worth 480 points.  So now the total value is only 160 points. That's the equivalent of a late 3rd rounder. So if you actually think about it, yes getting a 2nd round pick and not giving a pick back is better.

Consider also, remember when we traded Mack, everyone kept thinking of it as we got two 1st round picks. But we also gave up a 2nd round pick. And the Bears ended up with a much better record than us, in part because they had Mack. The highest of our 1st round picks ended up being #19 (second half of round 1) with which we took Damon Arnette, who probably would have still been available at #43 (first half of round 2), which was the pick we gave back to Chicago. All in all when you took the draft value chart for all the picks traded in that deal, the net result was as if we had just traded for a single #17 pick, which is way worse than what we spent to get Mack in the first place.

2. McZ in their second year are under pressure to win. Yes, they could theoretically get buy-off from MD to tank and buy time to rebuild, (for some reason I will never understand, that's what Reggie McKenzie did), but that seems particularly unlikely, not just because of #1, but also because of MD's vocal frustration with visiting fans filling the stands.
3. The roster is very imbalanced in terms of stars and scrubs, with little in-between. And the stars are signed for quite a long time. Crosby, Miller, Adams, Waller, Renfrow... so to truly tank we would likely be trading a bunch of those guys, but the dead cap makes doing so less appealing, I can't see us trading more than 2 of them at the most.
