Modern Christianity doesn‚Äôt align with my worldview. Regardless of what the Bible says, it‚Äôs pretty clear that the church has been used to organize hate against many marginalized groups in America. 

A lot of charitable giving being funneled back into hate groups is a HUGE issue for me. It‚Äôs not like the education sector is taking your donation money and funneling it back into anti-Muslim hate groups consistently. They‚Äôre buying school supplies and shit.

>Religious giving accounts for 32 percent of all U.S. charitable giving, the study found, but that number may underestimate the influence that religious belief has on charity. The study used a narrow definition of ‚Äúreligious giving‚Äù that does not include donations to faith-based nonprofits that provide human services, such as Catholic hospitals or universities.

**New pick:** [Zion Johnson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4247347/zion-johnson), G

The Chargers needed to address their offensive line and did so with the selection of Johnson. He was a Day 1 starter, and despite expected rookie growing pains, proved he will be a capable -- if not outstanding -- anchor on the right side in protecting quarterback [Justin Herbert](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert). It was tempting to select another playmaker for Herbert to target here, but the best already are off the board. -- *Lindsey Thiry*

27. [Tampa Bay Buccaneers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers)

**Original pick:** [Devin Lloyd](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4243256/devin-lloyd), ILB (JAX traded up)  
**New pick:** [Jamaree Salyer](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4379412/jamaree-salyer), OT

The Bucs ultimately traded out of this spot and used it on two picks in the second round: defensive tackle [Logan Hall](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360189/logan-hall) and offensive tackle [Luke Goedeke](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4380507/luke-goedeke). Their thinking in prioritizing offensive line help wasn't wrong. Goedeke, however, just wasn't the right pick -- he allowed five sacks while playing left guard. Salyer, a sixth-round pick last April, was thrust into the Chargers' starting left tackle role in Week 4 for [Rashawn Slater](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242283/rashawn-slater), and as L.A. general manager Tom Telesco said: ""He saved us this year."" Salyer's versatility could have helped the Bucs not only at left guard but when [Tristan Wirfs](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240589/tristan-wirfs) and [Donovan Smith](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2582147/donovan-smith) were out with injuries, giving quarterback [Tom Brady](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady) a cleaner pocket. -- *Jenna Laine*",46.0,chargers,t3_10w64kp,False,0.0,Felipe Rios,2023-02-07T10:31:30Z,chargers,0.0055472019681997

[**Nolan Smith**](https://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/106309/nolan-smith)**, OLB, Georgia**

The Chargers have multiple options here, but the front seven is a big problem. L.A. allowed 5.9 yards per play (29th). A [torn pectoral muscle](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/34924191/sources-georgia-lb-nolan-smith-torn-pec-season) in late October ended Smith's season, but the 6-3 senior posted 11.5 sacks in his career while, like most Georgia defenders, working in a heavy rotation. He is a versatile linebacker who is comfortable standing up or playing with his hand down and has the first-step quickness to stun blockers while also being agile enough to play in space as an off-ball linebacker. That's perfect for the Chargers' base 3-4 scheme and today's NFL.

Smith, just 235 pounds during the season, will need to add strength, but his ability to quickly get into the backfield gives the Chargers a long-term pass-rusher opposite [Joey Bosa](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051389/joey-bosa). And in the meantime, he can help in space at linebacker when Bosa and [Khalil Mack](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16710/khalil-mack) drop down to defensive end.

[**Siaki Ika**](https://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/106341/siaki-ika)**, DT, Baylor**

Los Angeles went edge rusher in Round 1 and tries to fix the run defense with Ika -- the draft's best nose tackle -- here. He is massive (6-4 and 358 pounds) and fits the modern nose tackle projection with his size, power, length and surprising quickness when allowed to rush the passer.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a confession as so much as so much as it is the sad story of my fandom;

The long story short is nobody in my family aside from my brother consumed football content, I finally started learning after my brother taught me about it and I decided my team would be the Chargers because my neighbor (who is the person I watch every single game with, with the exception of home games) would be screaming and hollering every Sunday and even in a few cases had the police called for being so fuckin‚Äô loud because the neighbors below thought he was getting murdered. With all that being said a 5th Grader me befriended the neighbor and on November 5th, 2014 @ 10:00 AM I officially became a Chargers fan.

For the next 3 Hours I watched as my newly acquired team lost 0-37 to the Miami Dolphins. I figured if the lows felt that low than surely the highs would feel so high (Ive never been more wrong about something in my life) so against the friendly advice of my brother: ‚ÄúYou can still pick a different team!‚Äù I stuck with the Bolts ever since!

Plus, getting a high quality DE prospect can benefit us with both of them on the field.  Who are they gonna double team with Bosa/Mack splitting opposite sides, SJD in the middle, and a stud rookie flying up on the outside.

Long story short, it helps keep our star edge rushers healthier, it gives us an insurance policy, makes our pass/run defense stronger, and it gives us a path into the future.

I do think we‚Äôll take a DT, but probably later.

Keenan is getting older, Mike is getting older, and I need someone who can come in and immediately create chemistry with Herbert who can grow with him for the foreseeable future.  Not saying that a FA WR is incapable of doing that, but typically when guys have been in the league for x amount of years, they don‚Äôt really develop anymore.  They are who they are.  Sometimes that‚Äôs a great thing, but in this situation we NEED to draft someone.  It‚Äôs also cheaper to draft a stud than sign a stud.  So far the only WR I‚Äôd take over Flowers is JSN.  He‚Äôs easily the best WR in this class and it isn‚Äôt really close imo.  I‚Äôm not sure how our front office views them tho, and again, I think Addison is a phenomenal WR.

There‚Äôs a ton of high ceiling TE prospects this year too, so it‚Äôs a good time to take our guy.  I‚Äôm 100% expecting it to either be the 1st or 2nd round, but with our WR room doing what it did, I‚Äôm leaning towards a TE in the 2nd.

As far as Addison, you‚Äôre gonna hate my take but yes the speed matters.  I think Addison is a great player and if we draft him I‚Äôd be ecstatic but he doesn‚Äôt have nearly the same physicality that Diggs has and, despite being a great downfield route runner, he routinely gets caught from behind by PAC 12 DBs.  We. Need. Speed.  Imo Zay Flowers is the better fit for our needs.  He‚Äôs like Chris Olave with better RAC ability.
