And here is where I have to push back, because intentionality matters. And it matters a lot. 

And that’s really the big failure of the church imo and why I often don’t support donations to religious institutions. 

>The National Christian Foundation passed along $56 million from anonymous individuals to nearly two dozen anti-LGBT and anti-Muslim hate groups over the last three years on record.

Modern Christianity doesn’t align with my worldview. Regardless of what the Bible says, it’s pretty clear that the church has been used to organize hate against many marginalized groups in America. 

A lot of charitable giving being funneled back into hate groups is a HUGE issue for me. It’s not like the education sector is taking your donation money and funneling it back into anti-Muslim hate groups consistently. They’re buying school supplies and shit.

One thing I’ll give credit to the church for is it leads to more engagement from its members with things like food drives or other opportunities to volunteer.

>And in 2016 religious institutions received more than twice as much charitable giving, $122.94 billion, as any other industry in the nonprofit sector. The next-highest category, education, received $59.77 billion in contributions.

>Religious giving accounts for 32 percent of all U.S. charitable giving, the study found, but that number may underestimate the influence that religious belief has on charity. The study used a narrow definition of “religious giving” that does not include donations to faith-based nonprofits that provide human services, such as Catholic hospitals or universities.

>Some studies, using a more expansive definition of “religious giving,” have estimated that faith motivates as much as 75 percent of all charity in the United States.

**New pick:** [Zion Johnson](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4247347/zion-johnson), G

The Chargers needed to address their offensive line and did so with the selection of Johnson. He was a Day 1 starter, and despite expected rookie growing pains, proved he will be a capable -- if not outstanding -- anchor on the right side in protecting quarterback [Justin Herbert](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert). It was tempting to select another playmaker for Herbert to target here, but the best already are off the board. -- *Lindsey Thiry*

27. [Tampa Bay Buccaneers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers)

**Original pick:** [Devin Lloyd](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4243256/devin-lloyd), ILB (JAX traded up)  
**New pick:** [Jamaree Salyer](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4379412/jamaree-salyer), OT

The Bucs ultimately traded out of this spot and used it on two picks in the second round: defensive tackle [Logan Hall](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360189/logan-hall) and offensive tackle [Luke Goedeke](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4380507/luke-goedeke). Their thinking in prioritizing offensive line help wasn't wrong. Goedeke, however, just wasn't the right pick -- he allowed five sacks while playing left guard. Salyer, a sixth-round pick last April, was thrust into the Chargers' starting left tackle role in Week 4 for [Rashawn Slater](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242283/rashawn-slater), and as L.A. general manager Tom Telesco said: ""He saved us this year."" Salyer's versatility could have helped the Bucs not only at left guard but when [Tristan Wirfs](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240589/tristan-wirfs) and [Donovan Smith](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2582147/donovan-smith) were out with injuries, giving quarterback [Tom Brady](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady) a cleaner pocket. -- *Jenna Laine*",46.0,chargers,t3_10w64kp,False,0.0,Felipe Rios,2023-02-07T10:31:30Z,chargers,0.0055472019681997

[**Nolan Smith**](https://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/106309/nolan-smith)**, OLB, Georgia**

The Chargers have multiple options here, but the front seven is a big problem. L.A. allowed 5.9 yards per play (29th). A [torn pectoral muscle](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/34924191/sources-georgia-lb-nolan-smith-torn-pec-season) in late October ended Smith's season, but the 6-3 senior posted 11.5 sacks in his career while, like most Georgia defenders, working in a heavy rotation. He is a versatile linebacker who is comfortable standing up or playing with his hand down and has the first-step quickness to stun blockers while also being agile enough to play in space as an off-ball linebacker. That's perfect for the Chargers' base 3-4 scheme and today's NFL.

Smith, just 235 pounds during the season, will need to add strength, but his ability to quickly get into the backfield gives the Chargers a long-term pass-rusher opposite [Joey Bosa](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051389/joey-bosa). And in the meantime, he can help in space at linebacker when Bosa and [Khalil Mack](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16710/khalil-mack) drop down to defensive end.

[**Siaki Ika**](https://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/106341/siaki-ika)**, DT, Baylor**

Los Angeles went edge rusher in Round 1 and tries to fix the run defense with Ika -- the draft's best nose tackle -- here. He is massive (6-4 and 358 pounds) and fits the modern nose tackle projection with his size, power, length and surprising quickness when allowed to rush the passer.

I don’t know if this is a confession as so much as so much as it is the sad story of my fandom;

The long story short is nobody in my family aside from my brother consumed football content, I finally started learning after my brother taught me about it and I decided my team would be the Chargers because my neighbor (who is the person I watch every single game with, with the exception of home games) would be screaming and hollering every Sunday and even in a few cases had the police called for being so fuckin’ loud because the neighbors below thought he was getting murdered. With all that being said a 5th Grader me befriended the neighbor and on November 5th, 2014 @ 10:00 AM I officially became a Chargers fan.

For the next 3 Hours I watched as my newly acquired team lost 0-37 to the Miami Dolphins. I figured if the lows felt that low than surely the highs would feel so high (Ive never been more wrong about something in my life) so against the friendly advice of my brother: “You can still pick a different team!” I stuck with the Bolts ever since!

We've passed up on great players because they didn't fit the culture.

I agree with us taking another offensive lineman later in the draft but edge rusher is a NEED not a want.

We need another stud in there to be able to develop behind 2 of the best DEs in the league for when/if one of them gets hurt.  Plus, getting a high quality DE prospect can benefit us with both of them on the field.  Who are they gonna double team with Bosa/Mack splitting opposite sides, SJD in the middle, and a stud rookie flying up on the outside.

Long story short, it helps keep our star edge rushers healthier, it gives us an insurance policy, makes our pass/run defense stronger, and it gives us a path into the future.

I do think we’ll take a DT, but probably later.  The difference between a 2nd round DT and a 5th or 6th round DT is pretty big, but not even close to as big as that drop off for a DE.",3.0,chargers,t3_10xacht,False,0.0,This Team Nukes my Mental Health,2023-02-08T18:21:40Z,chargers,-0.0162055790126323

49248,286706,286706,xool420,"Nah I’m not about signing Chark.  A FA WR does not fix our current issues.  Keenan is getting older, Mike is getting older, and I need someone who can come in and immediately create chemistry with Herbert who can grow with him for the foreseeable future.  Not saying that a FA WR is incapable of doing that, but typically when guys have been in the league for x amount of years, they don’t really develop anymore.  They are who they are.  Sometimes that’s a great thing, but in this situation we NEED to draft someone.  It’s also cheaper to draft a stud than sign a stud.  So far the only WR I’d take over Flowers is JSN.  He’s easily the best WR in this class and it isn’t really close imo.  I’m not sure how our front office views them tho, and again, I think Addison is a phenomenal WR.

I could very easily be convinced for Washington in R1 and Tyler Scott in R2 tho",1.0,chargers,t3_10snrip,False,0.0,This Team Nukes my Mental Health,2023-02-04T12:40:44Z,chargers,0.060991493678581
49249,286707,286707,xool420,"Ya, definitely need to see how FA plays out first but I’m with you that a franchise TE is a very important role we need to fill for the long term.  There’s a ton of high ceiling TE prospects this year too, so it’s a good time to take our guy.  I’m 100% expecting it to either be the 1st or 2nd round, but with our WR room doing what it did, I’m leaning towards a TE in the 2nd.

As far as Addison, you’re gonna hate my take but yes the speed matters.  I think Addison is a great player and if we draft him I’d be ecstatic but he doesn’t have nearly the same physicality that Diggs has and, despite being a great downfield route runner, he routinely gets caught from behind by PAC 12 DBs.  We. Need. Speed.  Imo Zay Flowers is the better fit for our needs.  He’s like Chris Olave with better RAC ability.

We need speed in the WR room and I’m really over kicking the can down the road.  I want Zay Flowers at 21.  He would be electric with Herbert.  I’d also love to take a guy in the 5th or later that can compete for a roster spot.
