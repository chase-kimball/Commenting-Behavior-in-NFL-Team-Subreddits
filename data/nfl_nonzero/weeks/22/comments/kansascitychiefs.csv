I mean take a look at us and Mahomes. We traded away Tyreek and let Honeybadger walk to free up cap space to remain competitive. It absolutely did not stop us from competing, and would lend credibility to the idea that you can win past the rookie contract - which is true. But also we had to hit player after player the last two drafts with some of the best two year drafts in their league. Plus we got guys like Travis and Juju taking discounts. That's a lot to ask for any team and we barely got by the Bengals.

Veach had a great article written about him that after he took over, one of the first things he started doing was preparing for the 5 year window where we'd have to extend Mahomes.

Edit: If you want some light reading, I think the Ringer summed it up best https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/11/20/20974656/pass-interference-rule-deandre-hopkins-marlon-humphries-reversal-overturn-penalty 

Creating more reviewable things and wading into subjectivity land looks appealing but really doesn't solve anything. And just gets everyone more mad.

* KCK and KCMO have different mayors and city halls. In all effects, they are separate cities.
* The stadium is in KCMO. 
* Downtown, Power and Light, Westport, the Plaza, WW1 Museum, Nelson Atkins, etc are all in KCMO. The Legends, Children's Mercy (Sporting KC's park), and the Speedway are in KCK.

15963,116011,116011,KeegoTheWise,"KCMO and KCK are two different cities that share a metropolitan area. The rough timeline of it goes something like:

1. Missouri incorporates a city called Kansas (officially named “the city of Kansas” but colloquially known as “Kansas City”), named after the Kansas river that feeds into the Missouri river near where the city was founded

2. Couple decades pass and the US establishes the Territory of Kansas to the west of MO, named after the same river

3. Couple more decades pass and that territory is admitted into the union as the State of Kansas

4. Couple more decades pass, a civil war is fought, then Kansas (the MO city) experiences a massive population boom and subsequent infrastructure expansion. To capitalize on this, Kansas (the state) incorporates five neighboring townships into “Kansas City, Kansas” in an effort to trick some of the people moving out west into moving to their state instead

5. Couple decades pass and Kansas (the city in MO) officially adds “City” to the end of their name to help differentiate it from the neighboring state (making its official name “the city of Kansas City, MO”)

So it’s probably even dumber than you thought, what with the official name saying “city” twice and the fact that the city in Kansas was technically “Kansas City” *before* the city it’s named after.

Personally I think there's value in refreshing the OC role every few years not to be stale, but on the other hand,  how can you argue against being the #1 offense of the past 5 years under Bieniemy even with a rotating cast of players (obviously besides Mahomes/Kelce)? 

But I am also a big believer in Bieniemy. I just think Kafka could have filled his shoes as OC very competently (while being younger and thus a potential Reid replacement with their timelines matching better). Instead,  with Kafka leaving,  there's just much more uncertainty about the medium-term future of the Chiefs coaching.

22060,150046,150046,Moose4KU,"I think you're misinterpreting. 

The OC position under Andy Reid has been a lot like Sean McVay's or Shannahan's. The expectation is that you work a few years in the role, oversee a very successful offense,  and you go on to a head coaching role where you can apply your skills knowledge.  That's how it worked for Andy in Philly, and how it was from Doug Pederson and Matt Nagy. Meanwhile, the QB coach would be getting groomed to step in once that OC was hired. 

This hit a roadblock with Bieniemy. Kafka had already basically finished his role as QB coach,  and everything was in line for him to become the next OC once Bieniemy became a head coach.  In fact, the Chiefs even blocked Kafka from interviewing for external roles and kept giving him promotions (giving him the ""passing game coordinator"" in 2020),  until he reached the point where he wasn't allowed to be blocked anymore without becoming the OC. But since Bieniemy still hadn't been hired, Kafka had to go elsewhere.

Basically, we had groomed Kafka for 5 years to be the next OC, and since Bieniemy was never hired,  Kafka left KC and all that grooming was wasted. Reporters talked very glowingly about Kafka and how highly thought of he is, even floating the idea that he would be the heir to Reid after retires, so it just stings for KC fans because we had to let him leave.",7.0,nfl,t3_10wfngd,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2023-02-07T16:59:59Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0087556517424727

From my end, I’ve made a conscious effort to try and be cordial/wholesome/respectful with the gifs I make, in the hopes that at least in a small way I can try to affect discourse to be more positive. I’ve done this with most of our opponents. 

I realize that it’s naive and even arrogant to think I could affect sentiment among fanbases any noticeable way, but I’ve taken a “every little bit helps… hopefully” approach.

I feel like spending time on NFL reddit is more fun when people aren’t isolating themselves in their own echo chambers, parroting tired talking points by media or twitter hacks, or straw-manning other teams or subs with the worst examples of their opponents. I much prefer when there’s a back and forth, when fanbases have fun with each other. You see different content, perspectives, and generally experience less toxicity.

The only time I’ve really gone in hard on shit talking is when other fanbases have met me with hostility. Or when it’s the Raiders, because I can’t stress this enough, fuck the raiders.

But of course, I think all the other things that other people are saying here, like the connective tissue between organizations, and lack of historic destiny-altering matchups, are much more to do with the current  positive (or at least neutral) sentiment between fan bases than my dumb gifs.

In regards to camp, there are usually 2 training camp days per year reserved exclusively for STMs (Season Ticket Members). The players tend to sign more autographs at these in my experience.  

You have access to Draft Fest, which in years past is a party at Arrowhead draft weekend just for STMs. They fly in the 1st/2nd round picks and introduce them to the fans. It’s a lot of fun. 

You receive a gift each year before the season starts. Last year it was a golden football celebrating the 50th anniversary of Arrowhead. 

You also have access to exclusive STM prizes on Chiefs Kingdom Rewards (like holding the flag before the game, VIP passes to camp/Draft Fest etc), and your points roll over each year which doesn’t happen for non STMs. 

For me, all of the perks have been well worth it. But you have to know how to work the rewards program and pay attention to the emails you receive during the season. My kids have met a ton of players, hung out in the locker room, had all inclusive VIP access at Draft Fest and Camp, stood on the field during the anthem at the AFCCG, etc. They’ve already had countless memories that will last a lifetime.

Back in Arizona where Butker hurt his ankle and Justin Reid had to kick...Butker gets hurt on the shit turf again, and the game comes down to Justin Reid having to make a kick...and he makes a game winning fg/xp. 

Mahomes ankle, mahomes ankle, mahomes ankle...the game comes down to Mahomes scrambling to superman dive where he gets the touchdown/first down by just the tip. 

Wrs all injured or not at 100%, we need Kelce, and the game winning drive is like 4 crucial Kelce catches (see also: Cooper Kupp). 

Chiefs needing a drive late, announcers talking about how the Chiefs haven't had the big play, and are really missing Tyreek Hill...and then promptly Mahomes hits MVS/Toney for a bomb 70 yard touchdown

With everyone in Chiefs Kingdom dreading Carl Cheffers... Cheffers, under pressure to not display that known anti-Chiefs bias, ends up being extra nice to us to cover his tracks. 

Travis or Jason Kelce is immediately injured and misses the whole game, thus ruining their 45 segments, mentions, cgi renders, interviews, cutaways to mom, etc., as they basically don't get to play this game against each other. 

Forgotten, undervalued, punchline to KC fans...Clyde Edwards Helaire, ends up playing a big part in the game. 

Skyy Moore muffs a punt, giving everyone in KC a heart attack. But we end up recovering it, or there's a penalty on the eagles that negates the play. 

A chiefs O-lineman gets hurt and as a backup comes in, we all collectively have PTSD flashbacks. But the backup plays well and becomes the story of the game as he is repeatedly targeted by the Eagles but keeps stonewalling. 

Without Hardman, and after Toney's inevitable injury, Skyy Moore steps in to run those jet sweep/tap pass/orbit motion plays, and the rookie who has yet to score an NFL TD, ends up scoring a key TD, the first of his career.
