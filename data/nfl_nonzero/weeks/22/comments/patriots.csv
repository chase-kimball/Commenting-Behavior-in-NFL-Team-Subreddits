Agree with most of it.

I’d think BB will trade back if possible, and I’m ok with it.  I actually like Mims in the mid rounds as a prospect, all the other wr’s seem to have faults , mainly size, though I still think Tank Dell would be cool af to have here.

Some of the projected top tackles are likely going to be guards in the NFL, so I’m leery of any of the mocks/draft boards right now.

This is a stacked RB and TE draft, I’m hoping we can come out with one of each.  Mo Ibrahim is an older back, he’s projected to go late, I think if he’s there in the 6th he could be a home run, Jamhyr Gibbs also in the 2nd/3rd could be awesome (I keep seeing Kamara comps for him, that excites me)

Darnell Washington is a mammoth TE I’d be excited for, also a mean blocker.  

Regarding safeties, I’d like to see one of the AL safeties Brian Branch and Jordan Battle both seem like good coverage safeties, though Branch will likely go in the 1st round. Jayir Brown also has some buzz 

CB - Emmanuel Forbes and Tyrique Stevenson are both guys I could see BB drafting.  I’d expect we go out and secure a CB in FA, but could see it going either way (draft vs FA)

Either way, whether it’s a stud TE, RB, or WR I hope we come out of the first 3 rounds with a top playmaker.

Restructuring allows teams to convert portions of a player's contract into a signing bonus. In exchange, the converted money which would have counted against the cap for the current season is instead prorated across the remaining years on the contract.

It's a win for the players because they get guaranteed money right away.

It's a short-term win for the team because they can clear up a lot of cap space instantly.

It's tough for the owners because it means they need to fork over the cash for the signing bonus rather than paying that money over the life of the contract.

15198,136622,136622,Pain_Monster,"If you re-read my original comment, I’m saying it should apply to repeat offenders in the same season.

If someone has a history of injuring players (being a “dirty”) player, then a fine or penalty is not going to be enough of a deterrent.

Remember when TJ Ward took out Gronk by basically submarining his knee? I felt that was a dirty play. He could have made a tackle and wrap up, but he basically just torpedoed him at his ACL joint. That’s disgusting.

Now whether TJ Ward had intent to injure or not, it’s reckless and shows lack of sportsmanship. I’m sure he got fined by the league or whatever. But it was far different from other injuries like when Brady tore his ACL. That one felt like a football play and he got hit by a falling lineman and was unlucky, but TJ Ward’s hit felt dirty and targeting.

So, hypothetically speaking, if Ward did that earlier in the year, and then does this *again* to Gronk, don’t you think he should be forced to sit out as long as Gronk is out of commission? I mean, these guys tackle with immunity. This rule change would get them to rethink their habits and perhaps wrap up more than go for knees. Gronk is far too valuable to lose for the year, and someone can take him out with virtually no repercussions??

It’s not a perfect rule; nothing is. But I’m trying to think of a way that would offer some accountability to the defensive player that actually creates a more equal sense of responsibility to play the game the right way without any injury-prone type hits.
