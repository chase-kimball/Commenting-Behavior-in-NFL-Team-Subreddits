15101,101905,101905,Nijo32,"The best way for a fan to estimate an upcoming free agent’s contract is to look at similar players’ contracts in the most recent free agent period. So for K.J., I’d look at what WR2/WR3’s signed for in the 2022 offseason. Obviously it depends how K.J. plays in 2023, but a few players I’d put in K.J.’s range of outcomes are:

Marquez Valdez-Scantling: $30M / 3 years

Russell Gage: $30M / 3 years

Zay Jones: $24M / 3 years

Cedrick Wilson: $22.5M / 3 years

Braxton Berrios: $12M / 2 years

Josh Reynolds: $6M / 2 years


These WRs offer a variety of skillsets and production leading into their free agent deals, but I would guess if K.J. continues building on his recent success, that $30M / 3 year deal will be what his agent kicks off negotiations with. If the Vikings cut/trade Thielen and K.J. is the 2023 WR2, his demands could be much higher. Conversely, if the Vikings retain Thielen, or draft/sign a WR who jumps ahead of K.J., he may slide all the way down to the Berrios contract (Berrios was a WR4 with special teams contributions).

15111,101916,101916,Nijo32,"In one word? Aggression. Flores may run a base 3-4, but he’s a polar opposite from Donatell in how he deploys his unit. Flores LOVES to blitz, or at minimum present a blitz to create confusion in the opposing OL. His final year in Miami, he used either Cover 0 or Cover 1 about 50% of the time, and he loves to disguise blitzes by showing more potential rushers than the offense has as blockers (think Zimmer’s double-A-gap looks). Contrast this with how rarely Minnesota blitzed in 2022, and it’s already looking like a big shift in ideology. Players who jump out for this scheme are Asamoah and Harrison Smith as blitzers, and the Vikings will likely look to add athleticism at the slot to threaten blitzes from there as well. 

While this may sound great after watching the “Donashell” for a season, the potential downside is the risk it creates in the secondary. Flores relies heavily on his CBs, and even asks safeties to play some man coverage on particularly aggressive blitzes. Corners are put on an island with much less safety help, and if the blitz doesn’t get home it can result in chunk plays. Do the Vikings have a secondary that can be trusted with this? Hiring Flores could signal heavy investment in the CB room in the upcoming offseason. Again, slot is a glaring need for improvement, but it’s yet to be seen how Flores feels about players like Booth, Dantzler, and Evans, or the possible returns of Peterson and Shelley. 

In my opinion, it’s a great calculated risk in scheme change. The Vikings simply don’t have the talent to sit back in a bend-don’t-break defense - they’re almost always worse than the opposing offense, and can’t rely on getting key stops consistently. Creating chaos and forcing mistakes is a better way to overperform a unit lacking talent, until the defense has been effectively rebuilt.",27.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10vlgzm,False,0.0,Kwesinomics,2023-02-06T17:39:58Z,minnesotavikings,0.0380913824986399

You’re a bit off on Hamilton and Hill, however. Hill played 130 defensive snaps all season per PFF, never earning more than a small rotational role behind Mike Hilton in the slot. He played a total of 20 snaps in the Bengals’ two playoff games. 

Hamilton had an excellent rookie season, but that was after a hot and cold start. He began the season as a rotational sub when the Ravens went DB-heavy on passing downs - through 8 weeks, a whopping 181/212 of his snaps were coverage. The Ravens ultimately moved him almost exclusively to a slot/box role, where he played almost 500 snaps (compared to 92 at safety on the year). On the season, he played in almost exactly 50% of the Ravens’ defensive snaps.

15139,101949,101949,Nijo32,"I think everyone is painfully aware of the trenches being the problem. The issue isn’t that the Vikings are ignoring it though, it’s that we’re missing on our player evaluations. 

Our entire OL is 1st or 2nd round draft picks from the last few years, but only Darrisaw and O’Neill are true hits, with Bradbury and likely Ingram being big whiffs relative to the value of the pick used on them. 

The DL has also been heavily invested in, with Hunter, Z, Tomlinson, and Phillips are highly paid. I think Hunter and Z are the only two who fully lived up to their salaries, with Tomlinson and Phillips being solid players but not offering the pass rushing upside you’d hope for on the interior at their salaries. We’ve spent quite a few mid- and late-round picks on DL depth that have all been underwhelming. Wonnum, Lynch, PJ2, etc. have all been ok in flashes but would be scary to trust as a starter. 

It’ll be really interesting to see what our approach is - do we continue investing heavily into the positions and ignore sunk costs? Do we hope the new coaching staff can develop these players we’re already invested in, and spend high picks on other needs like DB?

Here are some of my unpopular Vikings opinions. Downvote away:

As much as it pains me to admit it because Moss is my all-time favorite player; Jerry Rice is the 🐐. Moss is arguably the greatest deep threat and athletic specimen of a WR (Moss vs Megatron is a debate), but what Rice continued to do in his 30s - 12,274 yards and 91 TDs *after* he turned 30 - and 40s - 2,509 and 10 TDs - is insane. 

The '98 team would have been beaten in the SB by Denver. The injuries and porous run defense would have been torn apart by TD. '09 is the year we *should* and *would* have won the SB. 

AT does not belong in the Ring of Honor. Incredible story, but his peak was so short. Two 1k yard seasons doesn't scream Vikings legend. 

Numbers shouldn't be retired. At some point, if the NFL continues long enough, you'll run out of them. That said, I would like a player to earn the right to wear all-time greats (Smith Jr. wearing 84 and having stone hands doesn't sit well).",8.0,minnesotavikings,t3_10ssfux,False,0.0,moss fro,2023-02-03T14:30:25Z,minnesotavikings,0.0116328150406201

""These hybrid players are important in making sure the defense runs properly. Eric Rowe and Brandon Jones are perfect examples of these hybrid players from Flores’ time in Miami. Rowe was a cornerback turned safety, who was often asked to cover tight ends. Jones, on the other hand, was an excellent pass rusher for the safety position.""       
         
That sounds so much like harrison smith and cam bynum to me. Bynums is a cornerback-safety convert and harrison smith is one of the best blitzing safeties in the league.

* The data shows that more-running QBs are not injured more often than less-running QBs.
* Even if it were true that mobile QBs are injured at a higher rate, you'd still have to analyze the data. Wouldn't you assume that a QB running means someone else is not running or receiving, and therefore that person (RB/WR/TE) is less likely to be injured? So you'd expect this to even out.

Run frequency is not an adequate predictor. A quarterback who stands in the pocket and is sacked could easily have a serious injury, while a mobile quarterback could escape that pressure and contact.
