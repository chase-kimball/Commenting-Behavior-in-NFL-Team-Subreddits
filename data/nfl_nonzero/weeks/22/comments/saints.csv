Also you can tank all you want but unless you go 0-17 or 1-16 the #1 overall pick isnt a guarantee.

Feels weird to say that those last two if the head coach lost you by that point.

> DA ain't got that locker room swag. Dude showed no emotion on the sidelines. Every fan saw it. Belive the players saw it too. 

Why does everyone need to be Sean Payton? Plenty of coaches coach without huge bursts of emotion consistently. Belichick, Reid, McCarthy, Reich are hardly animated on the sidelines for example. Doesn't mean their players didn't believe in them and certainly doesn't equal lack of success. Y'all act like DA is Jim Caldwell emotionally.

> Where's all the praise from the players about DA?!?! The lack of that speaks. Ain't no one going out of their way to speak positively about him. That should tell you something.

It tells nothing. Why do players need to praise their coach publicly? Do you also assume couples who don't publicly remind people they love each other consistently that they're bound for breakup?

We see front office-level tanking every year.
