Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder’s expansive Potomac estate, which has been quietly on the market for years, is expected to officially hit the listing sites as soon as Monday for $49 million, what would be a record fetch for D.C.-area residential real estate.
The aptly named River House, listed by Heather Corey and Michael Rankin of TTR Sotheby’s International Realty, spans just over 15 acres and features a 30,000-square-foot French château-inspired home completed in 2004. Snyder bought the majority of the Potomac River-fronting lot, at 11900 River Road, in July 2000 for $8.64 million from the estate of Jordan’s King Hussein and Queen Noor, then expanded with the acquisition of six adjoining parcels.

River House

The offering comes as Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, co-owners and co-CEOs of the Commanders, weigh offers to sell the NFL franchise, though the team has yet to publicly confirm whether a full sale, or simply bringing on additional investors, is the goal of a process to “consider potential transactions” that started in November. 

The Snyders no longer live in the five-bedroom, 13.5-bath mansion, the work of architect John Ike, designer Geoffrey Bradfield and Horizon Builders. Corey said TTR has privately shown the property for a couple of prospective buyers in the last year. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2018 that the home was available, but it does not appear to have been formally listed even then.
The property is officially hitting the market now to get more eyes on what Corey described as “undoubtedly the best-built house I’ve ever been in.” The main home, per the listing language, includes custom wrought-iron doors leading to a two-story reception hall and massive limestone fireplace, four bedroom suites with en-suite baths on the second level, a master bedroom encompassing the full third level, commercial-grade kitchen and breakfast solarium, a gym, spa lounge, library, office with built-in bookcases and ""an imposing marble fireplace,"" wine cellar and “large mahogany-paneled club room."" A theater was installed in 2017.
At $49 million, Snyder is seeking the same price he reportedly sought in 2018. If it sells for asking, it would be the most expensive residential real estate sale in Greater Washington history. As it stands, Snyder already holds the record.

The current ask is $1 million more than what Snyder paid in November 2021 for River View, a 16.5-acre estate between Old Town Alexandria and George Washington’s Mount Vernon highlighted by a 16,000-square-foot main home, separate carriage home and unspoiled Potomac River frontage. Corey brokered that sale.
The Snyders also own a 305-foot superyacht called the Lady S, for which they reportedly paid more than $100 million.
Daniel Snyder's yacht

River House in Potomac was built from concrete and steel and clad in materials the Snyders handpicked from across the globe, the listing agents said. The house, Rankin said, is “unbelievably solid” and soundproof with a timeless look. “It is extraordinary in every turn of corner,” Rankin said. 
The larger property includes a basketball court painted in the Commanders' colors, a pool, walking trails, extensive river views, granite-cobbled motor court, detached 12-car collector’s garage that doubles as an event space, two-bedroom guest house with spiral staircase, a gate house, house manager’s residence with offices and conference room, grounds landscaped in the style of an English garden, and a roughly half-mile driveway from the front gate.

""The 15 acres provide privacy and space that is unrivaled and unavailable elsewhere in the Washington region,"" per the listing language.
In 2004, the Snyders had 130 mature trees removed from their Potomac property without a permit from Montgomery County, a matter later settled through the granting of a perpetual easement, a $37,000 payment and reforestation requirement. The Snyder's land sits adjacent to protected parkland on either side of the river.
Multiple outlets recently reported that several bids for the Ashburn-headquartered Commanders were received prior to a late December deadline, but none met the $7 billion asking price — the team’s reputation has been sullied in recent years amid allegations of a toxic work culture. The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported in early January that the Snyders now list England as their usual residence, citing a certificate of incorporation of a private limited company for Snyder UK Investments Ltd.",42.0,commanders,t3_10v8013,False,0.0,Fuck Dan Snyder,2023-02-06T08:33:00Z,commanders,-0.0093949638377164

So if I understand you right, you're saying that by setting a cap, that essentially guarantees that QBs get a raise whereby in the current system, a faux-QB max will inadvertently be set just by the nature of markets?

>If these calls were for example to sign at 15% of the cap over term I would say its a win win for the team and the player, but the way contracts are structured now fall more in that category.

Also, by this are you saying that you support the QB max at 15%? Cause 20% is more or less an arbitrary number. It could always be negotiated to be X-value",1.0,nfl,t3_10w4s7o,False,0.0,:Commanders: Commanders,2023-02-07T20:50:17Z,commanders,0.0047324479999999
10662,93402,93402,Kwugibo,"First off, thank you friend!

Second, why don't you think a salary % cap for QBs would work?

Say we cap at 20% so guys like Mahomes, Burrow, Hurts, etc. can max out (similar to NBA) - that would always leave 80% that you can always be sure, regardless of how cap rises, than you can pay your other 52.

These edible cookies are kicking in so work with me as I think this through

But I guess I see what you might be saying, in that even if there's a ceiling, it doesn't do much for the floor, so it doesn't necessarily help fringe roster guys

But also, now you wouldn't have to worry about QB contracts continuing to rise. Back in 2012 Peyton set the new bar with his annual salary taking up 15.92% of the cap. This upcoming year, Mahomes will command 20.82% of the cap. Collectively bargaining for a QB cap that last, idk, 10 years could lead to a few changes:

1) A clear set marker of what a QB is worth. Is this good? Idk yet. If we see that Patrick gets 20% would GM's have an easier time negotiating contracts? Does Kyler automatically get his 20% or do teams have an easier time saying ""I'm not paying you above 15% of the cap!""

2) Might make it easier to provide valuations for other positions, even if there's no set rule. If franchise QBs are 20% then what's a DPoY caliber player, like prime Donald, Watt, or Watt? Maybe 10-15% ($22-33mm in 2023)? How about just a solid starting CB, 7-9%? Makes it easier than random dollar amounts
