> And if you don't understand how having a HOF TE opens things up deep (Safety help forcing a lot of cover 1 and sucking up defenses) then of course the logic does not make sense.

But then who is going deep for KC? I'd argue that having Saquon opens up things over the middle with linebackers and safeties creeping up. We saw this happen a bunch last year and is one of the reasons Richie James got open so often vs zone blitz.

> Also, your logic is flawed. Most offenses throw short high completion throws but when Jones does it, it is an issue?

I never said it was an issue, the issue with Jones is that he locks into reads and the coaching staff doesn't trust letting him throw it 35+ times per game. He's a game manager who can throw it 20-25 times for 1 TD and not turn the ball over. I think that can work but it will be hard to fill out the roster with a guy like that making $40M/year. I see him as Tannehill but a better runner and worse passer.

Back to the receivers though, we could definitely do worse. Teams like GB and Baltimore still saw more offensive success than us with worse supporting casts. Some of that has to fall on the QB.

The coach may have failed to throw the challenge and he definitely did. But that requires multiple other layers of failure before it gets to that. With a camera angle that shows VERY clearly that no catch was made, while no other camera angle showed anything at all, how is the failure on the coach for not challenging?

How is this really an argument for people? The officials absolutely fucked this play up. Absolutely inarguably fucked this play up. The coach should have challenged as a final level of protection, but the fact that something as obvious as an incompletion requires that is nuts. It took seconds to review the footage.

As others have said, the league is devoid of QB talent and there are tons of teams who’ve been cycling through garbage QBs for years who would gladly take a quality-but-not-elite starter.

Anyways, he had a great season, and he deserves to be rewarded for it. The contract is definitely a gamble that he keeps up on a steady path of consistency and improvement—but honestly, having watched him since he was drafted, the signs were always there that he was making gradual, but steady progress. Daboll has definitely done wonders for him, but the flashes and subtle year-to-year improvement was definitely present in DJ before him.

All in all, an up to $40 million per year deal for hopefully around 3 years is a gamble i’m willing to take as a Giants fan. DJ has earned it and we really don’t have any other options. Without him, we don’t win shit this year.

Staffords pretty good, cant tell much because hes injured.

Goff is definitely better, Goff played lights out in Detroit. Although he has a stacked offense there, he elevated it even more, compared to Dak Chokescott being elevated by the team. 

Cousins is okay, but dimes is better and more versatile. Having a dual threat qb makes the offense so much harder to stop. D

Kyler is so shit, definitely worse.

Geno has shown some promise, probably the hardest one to compare, it'd say DJ is slightly better. 

Purdy is good, but hes played on a stacked team and hasn't shown enough to decide to see if hes better than jones, right now I doubt it.

Fields is just Jones but slightly faster with a much worse arm

I don't think we get to see that leadership as much as fans.  All \*I\* know is that the players seem to rally around him in a way that seems to indicate he is liked and respected in the locker room.  I'll put it to you this way; at least he clearly isn't in the Russ Wilson/Aaron Rodgers conversation of QBs the players openly dislike.

I like that he didn't turn the ball over.  I like that he put together some game-winning drives.  Shoot, if it weren't for some crucial drops (like that Slayton ball that *almost* cost us the game) I think DJ could have been even better.

It's crazy because I say all of this and I still don't know if he is a QB that can *will* a team to win as Eli did during those SB runs.  I think DJ is a *decent* QB.  We still don't know if he is a game-changing QB, though, because he still has a patchwork oline and limited-skill receivers.  I'm not even bashing the effort by our receivers.  We just don't have a spread-the-field guy or red-zone guy that we *know* we can count on.

I guess what it comes down to is that I don't know the answer to this question:  **if DJ was under center for Filthidelphia instead of Hurts, are the Eagles in the Super Bowl?**
