(Good or bad) that's kinda how it was for me. I had liked a lot of his bluster but something had rubbed me wrong but couldn't put my finger on it. Then he comes out as insinuating that His time is more important than a coaches time (who had been on before, fairly recently) and he got butt hurt and showed his true colors. He thinks he's God's gift to podcasting and his claim that only he had been praising the Lions came off as, see I did you guys good now you owe me. Others had been saying that the lions were better than what they looked like and that they had been playing well at the end of the season. So that rubbed me wrong too. On top of that he tends to talk over his coworkers. Idk if there is a hierarchy and he's top dog but that just came off as rude to me. I can't stand others that don't let those around them finish bc they Have to say their thing asap. There are a few times that someone gets Excited and Adds to what's being talked about.

You need some people that have slightly different opinions to see things from a different side or else it comes to just being one guy talking padded out with yeses and mmhmms.

4- Colts are going QB, if they trade up then it's the Bears who will almost certainly go EDGE/DT as well

5- Seahawks are yet another case of a team that has a pretty big EDGE/DT need

So basically, all top-5 teams just happen to have major needs at either QB, EDGE, or DT. Since the top of the class happens to be strong at those positions, I don't really know how many of them would be willing to trade down if they can just get their guy.

At 6, sure I’ll agree with you. There’s defensive players who should be able to make an instant impact for the turnaround next year. But at 18?

He did everything he was suppose to, and did it well mostly.

Even with our depleted roster, he still had a huge hand in leading us to an 8-2 finish to end the season. Before that run, he was still leading one of the best offenses in the league. 

It is the height of stupidity to use such a high draft pick for maybe the best 3-4 QB in the draft after the season he had. It’s even more stupid to waste draft resources to trade up to get one of the top two QB’s when we need to improve our defense more then anything else.

There are 2 incidents I've seen. The 1st one was in high school and it apparently never even happened.  The girls father (Hernandez) said this. 


It was also noted Mixon denied that allegation.

After Rapoport's report, Hernandez's lawyer Blake Johnson gave Florio a statement from his client in which he said in part: ""I do not believe Joe ever did anything to hurt my daughter.""

Hernandez's statement also gave more context to the incident:

""Once, when they were in school together, my daughter had a minor disagreement with some of her classmates that got blown out of proportion. Like any father would, I reacted emotionally. Unfortunately, I did so before I had all the facts. Now, having talked to my daughter and investigated the whole story, I realize that I was mistaken about Joe’s involvement.

36203,217873,217873,Wiggymaster,"Literally the only logical argument for favoring the Packers is that they were at home and had just come off a big victory. They had shown time and again throughout the season that they were soft. They beat the finesse teams like the Cowboys and the Vikings but they could not win in the trenches against the stronger offensive lines nor did they have answers for the stronger defensive lines. 

I hold that Detroit would've walloped the Cowboys had Swift and Chark been in there. As it is they couldn't move the ball because St. Brown had a lock-down corner on him all game and the rest of the receivers couldn't really get open, either. Raymond had himself a good game but they really missed Chark and Swift in the red zone, IMO. Swift's impact on the offense is immensely underappreciated, in my opinion. He's a potential home run hitter that defenses have to account for. Chark played the role of Mr. Reliable outside the numbers. My hope is that we hang onto him while doing our best to turn Jameson Williams into a similar reliable deep/outside threat. We already saw this coming to fruition against the Packers on the TD that was called back. I'd be all for giving Chark another 2 year deal at this point. 

I'm digressing - either way 80% chance to win for the Packers was wishful thinking and dismissal of facts by analysts going into that game.

Played 4 years in the league as a wideout with the Broncos in the early 2000s.

He was also a finalist last year for the Panthers OC job & has spoken about his aspirations to be an OC one day. Also interviewed for the Saints OC job last year.

Also an interesting tidbit I found: “When Reich hired Montgomery to be the team’s running backs coach, he did it in part because Montgomery is an expert in the RPO world, a trend that has swept across the NFL the past couple of seasons.”
