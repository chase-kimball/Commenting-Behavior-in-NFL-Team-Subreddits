35537,252252,252252,theRegVelJohnson,"So they should have not picked up Watson because there was a chance Lamar would become available? If someone suggested that as a reason last year not to get Watson, they would have--rightfully--been told they were insane. Namely because the a previous MVP quarterback being available off their first contract is literally unprecedented. Making decisions based on hoping things--which have never happened--might happen in the future isn't a winning move either.",-3.0,nfl,t3_10uk2zd,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns,2023-02-05T17:52:38Z,browns,-0.0037531249999999
35538,252253,252253,theRegVelJohnson,"And whom would we have snagged this year? Carr is going to cost more against the cap in 2023 that Watson will after a likely restructure. Same with Jimmy G. Seems unlikely Rodgers would ever end up in Cleveland.

The options were gamble on Watson, or hope to hit a rookie who can elevate the team in the next 2-3 years. If either of those strategies fail, it's a substantial rebuild in 5-7 years.

People throwing around ""franchise suicide"" so much it's lost meaning. The only thing that would be long-term FO malpractice is if they keep restructuring and pushing the cap hits even further out even if he doesn't perform. If he looks shitty again this year, they'll (hopefully) stop restructuring him and plan for a rebuild.",-5.0,nfl,t3_10uk2zd,False,1.0,:Browns: Browns,2023-02-05T17:10:46Z,browns,-0.0612235473632812
