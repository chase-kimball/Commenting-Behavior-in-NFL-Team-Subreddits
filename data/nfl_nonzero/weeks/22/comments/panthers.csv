Pointed criticisms have been and should be written about those issues. That's not what this article is. It's a rehash of those criticisms written for the purpose of nothing other than to bitch about what a terrible League it is. The article even acknowledges positive changes for the better itself, before glossing over the point. And the inclusion of Hamlin is just a cheap emotional ploy.

> So, as the curtain rises on the annual Super Bowl spectacle, my explanation of the NFL’s year in 2022 includes the recognition that the sport often came with disappointment and regular reminders that, for all its PSAs, programs, and charitable donations, the league’s commitment to supporting women, advancing social justice, and valuing player safety extends only to the point of holding its own accountable for their actions—as long as it doesn’t interrupt the league’s cash flow. It also includes the understanding that there is little indication that the NFL has faced any genuine consequence for this. In the coming days, the league will crown a champion and award the best performances in playing, coaching, and roster-building as a way to celebrate and memorialize the season, and I think for many, that celebration will be interwoven with an acknowledgement of the NFL’s moral failings throughout the year. That’s an uncomfortable feeling because it couples a thing that brings excitement and joy with disenchantment and hypocrisy. It’s worth sitting in that discomfort, though, mostly because it’s honest, and just maybe because acknowledging it could make some tiny difference.

What's the purpose of this, other than to complain and put the author on a sound moral high ground? Where are the proposed solutions? What does this contribute to the conversation?

> **Findings:** In the aggregate, stronger gun policies were associated with decreased rates of firearm homicide, even after adjusting for demographic and sociologic factors. Laws that strengthen background checks and permit-to-purchase seemed to decrease firearm homicide rates. Specific laws directed at firearm trafficking, improving child safety, or the banning of military-style assault weapons were not associated with changes in firearm homicide rates. The evidence for laws restricting guns in public places and leniency in gun carrying was mixed.

> **Conclusions and relevance:** The strength of firearm legislation in general, and laws related to strengthening background checks and permit-to-purchase in particular, is associated with decreased firearm homicide rates. High-quality research is important to further evaluate the effectiveness of these laws.

There are some definite success stories out there. There's a guy in Utah who owns a fleet of 3D printers and he makes a living off having a mini factory in a barn essentially. He takes orders that are too big for individual fabrication but too small to justify outsourcing to china (think small plastic items, between 1k and 10k items) and he's doing great for himself.

The idea of organ printing or whatever (which I'm currently researching) hasn't overcome some of the technical and chemical limitations.

One of the hard things about the field is that it requires members who are very well versed in chemistry, materials science, mechanical engineering, optics (in the case of photopolymer printers), and spectroscopy (again for photopolymer systems). It's rare to find a team who's well versed in all of those things. And then after that you need to get your manufacturing capabilities sufficiently uniform, and then you need a business plan.

That said, I saw a talk this morning that says the market for 3D printed materials is in the many billions, and several 3D printing companies have >$1billion valuations.

- No way Evero is fine with being turned down by the Panthers for a HC spot only to turn around and take their DC spoy

Rebuttal: It was common knowledge that the Panthers were not hiring a defensive head coach anyways. Chances are maybe we brought Evero in as a HC interview, but used it for both sides to get feelers for him being DC instead

- Wilf will absolutely not be out-bid, the Vikings ownership has and will continue to spend money

Rebuttal: Yes, they're both billionaires, but Teppers near $20 billion net worth absolutely trumps the Wilf's $2 billion combined

- It's better for Evero getting a HC spot by taking a bottom of the league Vikings defense to top half than taking an already good Panthers defense to a slightly higher level

Rebuttal: There is, unfortunately for the Vikings, no guarantee that would be the case. Their defensive roster may not even be in shape for even a small improvement, much less a large one. Meanwhile, the Panthers are going to likely look good, and that just plays better for Evero when he's showing off his 2023 work

- Ties to their HC and GM

Rebuttal: We learned this, actually, that ties aren't everything. Vic Fangio has ties to Charlotte (his first ever DC job) and Reich (Panthers QB when Fangio coached for us), but still passed over the Panthers for Miami.

Aside from the other story lines about it being potentially awkward, people said why would he ever want to coach for us again when we didn't make him the head coach? Like well, he isn't going to be a head coach anywhere else, and he's probably not going to be a defensive coordinator, so if the best position he can obtain is a defensive coach, why not coach closer to home instead of going across the country out of spite lol

It makes sense from the team's perspective to move on from him because of the new coaching regime, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me from his perspective, because unless he gets a significant upgrade in position, he'd probably prefer to stay closer to home. I doubt he is angry at us",2.0,panthers,t3_10uon2h,False,0.0,Give us the 3rd pick,2023-02-05T19:24:00Z,panthers,-0.111068672
