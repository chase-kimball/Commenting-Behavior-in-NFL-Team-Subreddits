1563,8823,8823,ASuperGyro,"I think the Ravens run game is so good because their OC, well that’s all he was good for really, so it was easier to plug and play RBs. I think Dobbins pre-injury was great and is looking good on the back half of the year however. Plus having Lamar as QB makes the run game much harder for defenders since the threat of him keeping is obviously a big factor in how they pursue. I think the Bills could have a better run game but they don’t seem to scheme a good run game, but I think Singletary is a good back and would produce well with the Ravens versus I expect Dobbins to take a hit producing for the Bills. 

Won’t argue about the TE disparity because that’s a given, although I think Knox is an excellent red zone guy versus Mandrews being a full field effective TE that demands attention. But because they lack in other receiving options he isn’t able to have as big an impact as Goedert or Kelce (Kelce obviously being next level). If they had better receiving options elsewhere, like last year, he really shines. Point being I think having Diggs-Knox elevates the offense more than having Mandrews-Robinson(Bateman still kind of unknown because of injuries, but first few weeks looked good tbf) Watkins has just had a disappointing career relative to his expectations, I believe Buffalo even drafted him so interesting that he’s on the opposite side of the comparison. I also believe he’s on his fourth team, which says a couple things both positive and negative. I don’t know that Davis would last long enough to hit four teams but I also think he’d be valued enough to stay with an individual team longer.

Really curious how the new offense looks with an OC that can expand the passing offense and get them some better receiving options. 

Long and short is I think I agree with the sentiment but value individual pieces and outside impacts a bit differently.

I’d lean closer to 1:1 than one being better or worse offensive pieces, but that WR1 in this kind of league pushes it for me.

I didnt say it was... but I disagree with everything else you said and explained why in my previous comment. Its just my opinion. There is no other team in the NFL with as many holes as the Bears roster and the Lions have a much better roster than many give credit for IMO. I think an elite prospect at a position that is difficult to find at a position of need is absolutely worth the trade up. Jalen Carter is the consensus best player among most scouts and while the Bears would love to have him he projects better as a 4-3 IDL rather than a NT in their 3-4 defense and they would be better suited to get a LT and WR for their young franchise QB to help his development.",1.0,nfl,t3_10sppix,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2023-02-04T17:17:42Z,steelers,0.1676348058127572

There are some very good options at Edge/CB who will fall to the late 2nd-3rd round but a true 3-down DT who can create pressure as a pass rusher from the interior is rare. 

They don't need help on the OL or at RB currently or a QB considering Goff has looked pretty good. WR is pretty good and TE is very deep in this draft I think they could get a guy in the 4th to develop.

1.01 DT Carter
2.18 CB Cam Smith/Antonio Johnson
2.24 DE Zach Harrison/Mike Morris

I like the way the board falls for them if this is their approach rather than him-hawing over whether Myles Murphy will be able to translate his physical gifts into production on the field (if he is even there when they pick) or if Tyree Wilson has enough physical talent to be viewed as a top 10 pick.

Maybe they go CB and take a guy like Witherspoon which would probably be the most likely pick at that spot but Dan Campbell seems to be the type of guy who would prefer that 1st pick be used in the trenches which is also a more highly valued position group.

9212,54519,54519,Dang026,He could be replaced much cheaper by Connor Heyward picking up an expanded role. Honestly its such a deep and talented draft for TE this year id love for them to draft Cameron Latu from Alabama to be TE2 considering Zach Gentry is seldom used as well as Latu is a converted DE/Edge and should be a great special teams player to replace Watt for much cheaper and get younger at the position. Watt will be 31 in November. Maybe they keep him for a year but idk roster spots are getting increasingly valuable and hard to come by.

It could also be a long winded way for me to ask the question ""Should the Steelers play Terrell Edmunds as an ILB in 2023?"" Not that I believe it's the same thing but I would understand somebody boiling it down to that.

So my answer would be no... Edmunds was a better tackler than Spillane last year and had one of the lowest missed tackle rates on the team iirc. Unless of course they went out and drafted another ILB such as Sewell or Campbell of course but I see them as replacements for Myles Jack and his bloated salary IMO.

12959,72730,72730,EnjoyMoreBeef,"The Civic Arena was the albatross around the Penguins' necks. It was the oldest arena in the NHL by the mid-1990s, and it was never intended for hockey in the first place. It was built in 1961 for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, who occupied it for two years before the piss-poor acoustics made them move back to Heinz Hall. It was an utter failure of urban planning, and the reason why the Penguins almost relocated in the first place.

The franchise itself was driven into bankruptcy by dumb ownership decisons. When Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was forced to sell the Penguins to save his real estate business, the new ownership group, led by Howard Baldwin, bought the team with very little of their own money, and gave away the rights to all the arena's vital revenue streams (parking, concessions, luxury boxes) to SMG Entertainment, the company that managed the Civic Arena. In addition, he stupidly agreed to the most expensive arena lease in the NHL on what was already the oldest arena in the NHL, which further reduced his financial flexibility. Meanwhile, the star-studded roster was becoming more expensive, so with no other way to cover the payroll, and a stupidly expensive arena lease, all it took was a minor decline in attendance to force the team into bankruptcy.

When Mario Lemieux was awarded the Penguins post-bankruptcy, he promised to repay the franchise's creditors in full. He renegotiated terms with SMG Entertainment for a less expensive lease on the Civic Arena, a significantly larger percentage of the vital revenue from the arena, and full takeover of arena management in 2004 instead of 2012.

As the creditors were being repaid, expenses had to be cut, which included the payroll. The roster was gutted of pretty much all talent, and the Penguins were a *de facto* AHL team by the 2003-2004 season, which was the one season when attendance *actually* collapsed. Even in the non-playoff seasons of 2001-2002 and 2002-2003, attendance at Penguins games as a percentage of arena capacity was just over 90% and just under 90%, respectively, which is perfectly normal for an NHL market with less than 3,000,000 people to draw from. But it collapsed to 70% in 2003-2004, because nobody wanted to pay NHL prices for an AHL-caliber product. Local TV ratings remained high in spite of this, which belied the notion of a ""disinterested"" hockey market.

Mario Lemieux didn't threaten relocation until 2007, right after his plans for a fully-privately-funded arena were shot down by a state government agency at the end of 2006. By that time, attendance was comfortably above 90% capacity again. Here's the text of an official statement released by Lemieux to the press on [December 17, 2006](https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/mario-lemieux-statement-on-penguins-ownership/c-494981):

>As you know, **the long-term future of the Penguins in Pittsburgh is dependent on a new arena.** That has been our stance since we purchased the team out of bankruptcy in 1999. When our group **bought the team more than seven years ago,** I never could have imagined that we would be **standing here today, still without a new arena.** But that is the reality.

>We were told repeatedly during the first six years of our ownership that there would be **no public money available to pay for an arena.** We were told repeatedly that we would have to somehow **come up with private funding for a project that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.** Against all odds, and thanks to Isle of Capri Casinos, we did that. We brought the Isle of Capri to the table with an offer to **privately fund construction of a $290 million arena** as part of a $1 billion-plus development plan in the Lower Hill.

Note that the word ""fans"" does not appear anywhere in the text of the press statement, because fan support had nothing to do with the Penguins' troubles. Other NHL teams in markets with less than 3,000,000 population have had similar fluctuations in attendance based on the performance of the team (Blues, Predators, Avalanche, etc.), but those teams weathered those downturns with no problem, because they never cut themselves off from vital arena revenue like Howard Baldwin did when he bought the Penguins. Bottom line, the Civic Arena was the alpha and omega of the Penguins' problems from 1995-2007.",2.0,nfl,t3_10tzzwx,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2023-02-05T14:13:28Z,steelers,-0.0128125020796252

Super Bowl XXXIX: Eagles versus Colts

Super Bowl XLVI: Giants versus Ravens

Super Bowl XLIX: Seahawks versus Colts or Ravens

Super Bowl LI: Falcons versus Steelers

Super Bowl LII: Eagles versus Jaguars

Super Bowl LIII: Rams versus Chiefs

For example, the AFC North has sent more teams to the playoffs than any other division in the NFL since the division realignment in 2002, and has had some of the toughest defenses in the NFL too, even factoring out the Steelers defense. Playing QB in the AFC North is tough.

Furthermore, every team in the AFC North plays outdoors, and often in poor weather conditions late in the season. Something tells me Matt Ryan wouldn't look as pretty if he was getting his brains bashed in by the Ravens defense behind a bad offensive line on a muddy field in the cold rain. Conversely, I'm pretty sure Ben Roethlisberger would look prettier if he got to throw to Roddy White, Julio Jones and Tony Gonzalez inside a climate-controlled dome against a bunch of mediocre-to-bad NFC South defenses during the early part of his career.

It should also be noted that Matt Ryan had [consistently more offensive support](https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/peyton-manning-had-the-best-offensive-teammates-among-top-quarterbacks-in-2000-s-donovan-mcnabb-had-the-worst-01dxesjm101k) from 2008-2013 than Ben Roethlisberger did from 2004-2013. In fact, according to [the chart](https://i.imgur.com/BTF4Pp0.png), which was inexplicably excluded from the article above when it migrated websites, Roethlisberger's offensive support was below average overall. ""But he had amazing WRs!"" So amazing, in fact, that none of them were invited to the Pro Bowl from 2005-2010. Add in an objectively bad offensive line from 2008-2012, in a division with tough defenses and poor weather conditions, and you end up in a QB-unfriendly situation. ""But he had great defenses!""
