We open with a demolishing of the Bengals (44-13), but lose a squeaker to the Eagles. We beat the Chiefs a few weeks later in a paltry 9-6 contest.

We then get stomped by the Texans 43-13. 

A few weeks later we score one of our highest totals in franchise history in a 55-20 win over Oakland. And follow it up with a 13-10 win over the Steelers. The team is all over the map.

Week 12 is a game we probably should have lost. On a 4th and 29, Flacco dumps the ball like 2yards to Ray Rice who punches his way to the first down marker and sets up Tucker for the winning FG in OT.

We then go 2-4 down and stretch and come into the playoffs completely cold. The Broncos have us all but dead when Rahim Moore completely whiffed on a game-tying TD pass to Jacoby Jones. Which, given the Ravens' play calling was likely a shot at drawing a PI call.

* The drafting of Markus Wheaton, a rare Steelers WR who didn't work out
* Kamar Aiken's flash in the pan in 2015
* The saga of Breshad Perriman
* The complete inability to develop Chris Moore into anything beyond an okay returner

Basically the only accomplishment you can argue he has are Kamar Aiken's magic year - and given he failed to get him to sustain that momentum the next year I dunno how much credit he gets there - and being the TE coach for Andrews' formative years, and I'd argue that given the rest of his resume that was more Andrews being that good than anything he did.

1. We have no idea that Lamar is actually dead-set on a fully guaranteed deals

2. This past year is like the first time in history a guaranteed deal has been on the table for anyone in the NFL. The point that Brady wasn't signing guaranteed deals in the 2000s and 2010s is irrelevant, because it wasn't even an option.

> Never strung his teams out

""This deal, which was slated to take Brady through the 2010 season, got contentious. It was signed on May 4, but the hangup and haggling began in late February. At issue? The Patriots wanted to pay Brady his proposed $24 million signing bonus in four installments. More than half of the bonus money would come in the first two years of the deal, but unpaid bonus money in the later years of the contract would not be guaranteed, meaning if Brady were injured and couldn’t keep playing, portions of the $24 M bonus would never be realized."" From NBC sports

> AND took team friendly deals
