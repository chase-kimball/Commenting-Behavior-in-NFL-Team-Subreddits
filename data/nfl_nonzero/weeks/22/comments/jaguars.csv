It's extra hard since they have the #2 pick and not the #1. The team that picked #2 in the draft with Burrow were still called the Redskins.

Granted the Bears don't really have incentive to draft a QB, but there are other teams like the Colts that do really want one, and could pull the rug out from under the Texans.

Still, I think your point stands- we're in a sort of primordial swamp for new rivalries to form with the generational turnover we're seeing in the league.

I was more stating that he looked soo good outside, that I don't know if moving him back to the slot is a great idea.

I know he can play slot, but he was so much better when he was moved outside in week 14. I remember him stating that outside is where he belongs. 

So while we can move him to slot, is it really what we want to do when he was playing the outside so well?",1.0,jaguars,t3_10vb3u9,False,0.0,:JAX0:,2023-02-07T00:56:42Z,jaguars,0.132065056

I'm not saying he's no great, or that there isn't an argument to be made, just that I myself would rank Jacobs and Henry higher. 

Ekeler had a great year, but he had less total yards (rush+rec) than Jacobs had just rushing. 416 less yards total. Ekeler did have more TDs, of course, and that is a big deal. But he also had more fumbles. 

I personally also feel like Jacobs and Henry were more important to their respective offenses. Would Ekeler do as well if not for the outrageous talent on the LAC offense? Both are stronger blockers than Ekeler. 

I don't know, but how I'd likely phrase it is that if I was picking on of the three for my fantasy team, I'd take Ekeler. If I was picking one to be my RB for my team (I'd take any of the 3, let's be clear), I'd pick Jacobs or Henry first.

17052,125740,125740,Oopiku,"I feel like these are needs, but out of order. Plus, there are certain positions that I honestly feel should be weighted as more valuable in the 1st round. A position like TE isn't as important in the 1st as OL, DL or CB. So the need at TE would have to be huge, and the talent available a once in a lifetime type talent. The best TEs of the last decade haven't been taken in the 1st.That is the only problem I have with this list - it is specifically stated it is for the 1st round, and I just don't feel TE is the most important position to address in the 1st.

1. OL/OT depth/starters. This is highly dependent on where people fall in the draft, and if Taylor is re-signed. If he isn't, I'd say this is the most important position to address in the early rounds. Even if he is re-signed, the OL still needs more talent and depth, so it wouldn't fall far down the needs list.
2. Interior DL - Football is won in the trenches, and a great DL helps your secondary almost as much as having great DBs. I love a lot of our rotational guys, but I honestly think the D needs to move to a 4-3 and if we do, we will need another body in the middle.
3. Slot CB - Our outside corners are both solid, in Campbell and Williams. What we really need is a strong cornerback who can play the slot well. I don't know if Williams could move there, but if not I could see someone like Cam Smith being high on the board, as he played a lot of snaps in the slot in college. Though I don't think he'll fall to 24 personally, I'd love it if he did. I think someone like Clark Phillips III is more likely, but I'm not sold on his size.
