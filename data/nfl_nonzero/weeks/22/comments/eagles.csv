Arrived nearly 30 minutes late to the deposition.

Acted “belligerent and pugnacious, refusing to answer the most routine of questions, despite there being no objection to the questioning coming from his counsel.

“[C]hanted, over and over, as if a mantra, a narrative of his own warped concept of the proceeding.”

“Acting as if he was above the rule of law, [Brown] proceeded to make a mockery of the deposition process. [Brown’s] antics were so unreasonable that barely twenty [20] minutes into the deposition, his counsel asked for a break [so] he could speak with [Brown] about his demeanor.”

“When the deposition resumed, [Brown] began texting on his cell phone. Regardless of multiple requests from his own counsel, and from the undersigned, [Brown] continued texting.”

""After approximately 20-30 minutes, [Brown] required another break. When the deposition resumed [Brown] increased his level of obstructive behavior. At one point, [Brown] refused to answer any questions, instead saying ‘next question’ no less than 10 times.”

“Soon thereafter, [Brown] started announcing a countdown, starting at ‘five [5] minutes,’ and counting down the minutes thereafter. Before noon [Brown] left the conference room.”",11.0,nfl,t3_10u2oy7,False,0.0,:Eagles: Eagles,2023-02-05T05:39:52Z,eagles,-0.0049941503846

7631,70732,70732,IFoundHimInTheSea,"I played defensive line in high school. Junior year, I went out for the season due to a spiral fracture in my leg as a result of making a tackle that required surgery to put in a plate and screws. That entire experience sucked from start to finish and still gives me trouble almost twenty years later. I heard the break when it happened which messed with me mentally. Required a bunch of physical therapy at the time. I still have to stretch it daily until it cracks multiple times (not severe crack, but like a knuckle/neck/back crack) so I can get full range of motion. It noticeably tightens up during colder weather.

Then Senior year I was excited to come back aaand then went out for the season again due to an MCL tear. My knee still acts up here and there, but not nearly as much as my leg. That one actually happened at practice and I recall my teammates giving me shit for being soft bc it wasn’t a big hit or anything..just the oline dude catching my knee coincidentally at the exact wrong spot. But as soon as I got up, I knew there was something serious, could barely hobble off the field. 

I don’t regret playing because it was an incredible experience and nothing beat the feeling of putting an opponent on their back. Fwiw I’m also trans, so football, especially defense, was a really great outlet for relieving some of the weight of my depression/anxiety/gender dysphoria. I could just get lost in the moment while on that line.

I just wasn’t really expecting to have to deal with the results of an injury on the daily for the rest of my life.

- Mix it up. Have some spontaneity but the planned moments can be hot too. Something about it makes you get through work when you know it's going to happen.

This ain't one body's story. It's the story of us all. We got it mouth-to-mouth. You got to listen it and 'member. 'Cause what you hears today you got to tell the birthed tomorrow.              

I'm looking behind us now. . .              

. . .across the count of time. . .               

. . .down the long haul,

into history back.            

I sees the end what were the start. It's seasons with no post seasons, full of pain! And out of it were birthed crackling dust and fearsome time. It were full-on winter. . .  and Mr. Tomba-Raydee chasing them all.               

But one he couldn't catch. That were Jordan Mailata.               

He gathers up a gang of Eagles, takes to the air, and flies to the sky!               

So they left their homes, said bidey-bye to the high-scrapers and cheesy stakes. . .               

. . .and what were left of the knowing, they left behind.               

Some say the wind just stoppered.               

Others reckon it were a gang called Chiefs.               

And after the game, some had been jumped by Mr. Mahomes, but some had got the luck, and it leads them here.               

One look and they's got the hots for it.

They word it “Super Bowl Fifty Sevens.” And they says, ""We don't need the pundit nay-sayings. We can live here. ""                           

Time counts and keeps counting.               

They gets takings to the end zones what they had.               

They get so lonely for the high-scrapers and the cheesy stakes.             

And they does the pictures so they'd 'member all the knowing that they lost.               

'Member this?               

SECOND PHILLY SPECIAL!             

'Member this?               

ON THE ROAD TO VICTORY!            

'Member this?

They counted eleven at a time, and that were them. The great First Downing Ten.                            

They said bidey-bye to them what they'd birthed. And from the regular season they looked back. . .               

. . .and Jordan Mailata hollered,

""Wait, mate, one of us will come. ""

14959,126769,126769,One_Hall_8290,"If you guys ever get the opportunity to take a young woman's virginity, I highly recommend it.

When I was 25, I met this sexy 18-year-old girl at work. She had the trifecta of fire red hair, electric blue eyes, and beautiful pale skin, plus a pretty face and a gorgeous, very slightly chubby body (which was a plus for me because I'm not really into thin/fit women). I couldn't stop thinking about her, so I started flirting, and luckily she reciprocated.

A few weeks and a handful of dates later, and I'm balls deep inside her and taking her virginity. She was nice and tight, and it was truly a transcendent experience to watch her plump breasts undulate with every thrust and to hear her gentle moaning as I sunk my fingers into her soft hips while opening up a whole new world of pleasure for her. She also had one of the top two best tasting pusssies I've ever tasted.

Like most good things in life, however, there was a catch. A few days after we had sex, she says to me, ""You know...I thought about it, and I don't think I'd be willing to get an abortion if you got me pregnant."" And I'm like the fuck? She was a horny little thing after her first time and kept asking me to do it again, but I'm vehemently childfree and just couldn't bring myself to do it. She was persistent and eventually started saying, ""I thought about it some more, and I might be willing to go through with an abortion,"" but I knew better than to trust a hormonal 18-year-old, especially when she ""might"" have an abortion. So we stopped seeing each other.

I still think about her sometimes and wonder what she's up to now and who currently has the good fortune of fucking that snug, delicious pusssy. I also wonder if my life would have turned out differently if I had continued dating her despite the abortion disagreement. She was actually a really sweet girl, and at one point I did see potential for something longer term. And I have to admit that it took a decent amount of maturity to be open and honest with me about her feelings on abortion despite knowing that it would make me lose interest. But I suppose there's not much benefit to pondering these things now.

Anyway, this is the only time I've ever taken a woman's virginity and the only time I ever had sex with anyone below the age of 20 (I personally lost my virginity when I was 20 to a very experienced 23-year-old woman). But I just wanted to say that if you ever get this opportunity, absolutely go for it. 10/10 experience.

Glad to see someone finally getting upvotes for this accurate take. People have been salty over this, but I'll say it again (and take the downvotes with glee).

Shanahan is a great coach who had a really bad day with some questionable calls. Even if he thought that was a catch, he should still challenge it as it was 4th down AND the Eagles were going hurry up close to the endzone. Best case, you get a turnover on downs and prevent the score entirely. Worst case you can substitute your defense, slow the offense, and hold to a field goal, negating the touchdown. He froze.

As for the blocking, it wasn't just one play. Occasionally you put a weak blocker on a top rusher because you're going the other direction and need your best blockers for where the play is going. That happens. We did it too. But Shanahan had friggin Tyler Croft (3rd string TE) blocking Hassan Reddick (#2 in the NFL in sacks) on the majority of snaps and all passing plays that I could find. This resulted in 2 sacks, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery (different play, so 2 turnovers), an injured quarterback, and contributed to the second injury, in less than 2 complete quarters. It was an asinine decision, and anyone defending it simply does not understand football.

20548,193677,193677,Vladimir_Putting,">but from what I can tell based on my humble reading ability, Eriksen's cardiac arrest was probably caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

I'd really like to know what article you're getting that from. Care to share the source?

>The fact that he wasn't *diagnosed* with a heart condition beforehand doesn't mean it wasn't preexisting, unless you're actually suggesting that he developed it mid-game. As a super fancy heart surgeon, I'm sure you're a lot more knowledgeable on people developing heart conditions during the middle of a sporting event, but I digress.

No. It's possible he had a pre-existing condition. But he was checked yearly by ""super fancy heart doctors"" and they all found nothing. And even after going back and double checked with a fine toothed comb after his cardiac arrest they still found nothing.

Now does multiple of the best cardiac doctors in the world who can't find a shred of evidence of a heart condition mean you 100% don't have one? No.

But you're acting like you have evidence. And, that's obviously false.


>Assuming he did not, in fact, develop a heart condition mid-game, we're left with the conclusion that he had a preexisting heart condition (meaning a heart condition that existed before the game, in case this was unclear) and that this could have caused cardiac arrest at some other point, for instance during another game of football (which footballers have been known to engage in from time to time).

No. We're not left with that conclusion. You can get sudden cardiac arrest from exertion while having a simple common  virus.

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352539

But you saying ""we're left with one conclusion"" must mean you already explored all the other possible options right?

>
>This is vastly different from Damar Hamlin being hit in just the wrong spot at just the wrong hundredth of a second, and even then my point still stands. Damar's injury was, to the extent of our knowledge, directly caused by him getting hit. 

And what doctor told you that?

Did they tell you they were certain there were no other factors?

>Football players get injured from getting hit every week, yet the NFL doesn't stop them from playing after sustaining an injury. When injured players do not play, it's generally because their injury prevents them from playing, not because the league doesn't allow them.

No. When the NFL stops you from playing it's usually because the risk of playing is judged to be greater than the league is willing to bear.

It doesn't mean you can't physically run, jump, tackle.
It means the league doctors have decided that the risk is above whatever threshold is deemed as acceptable by their insurance standards.

This is exactly how the Concussion protocol is drawn up. You aren't allowed to play, even if you are fully physically fit and pass the tests, until the doctors say risks are low enough.
https://www.nfl.com/playerhealthandsafety/health-and-wellness/player-care/concussion-protocol-return-to-participation-protocol

>Each player and each concussion is unique, and there is no set time-frame for return to participation. Team medical staff consider the player's current concussive injury, **as well as past exposures and medical history, family history and future risk in managing a player's care.**

>After a player has progressed through the five-step process, and is cleared for full participation by his club physician, he must be seen and separately cleared by an Independent Neurological Consultant (INC), jointly approved by the NFL and NFLPA, who is not affiliated with any NFL club. **Until cleared by this independent physician, a player may not return to contact practice or play in an NFL game.**


Which if you really understand WHY they do this it makes your original comment plainly stupid:

>there's no reason to think the NFL would ban him from playing any less than they would ban someone who tears their ACL. 

And so...

>Eriksen isn't allowed to play in Italy because of his not-a-pacemaker. He is still evidently fit enough to actually play, seeing as he is actually playing, albeit not in Italy.

That's exactly my point. He's not able to play in Italy simply because they will not entertain the risk. It has nothing to do with if he's able to physically sustain himself during a match. It's about the league not wanting someone to die on the pitch.

Expecting a lot of backlash on this, it was a similar argument back in 2017 when CMC was my big draft crush. Look at the Niners before and after trading for him this year though - that's my case for picking Bijan (or at least considering it). Because people will invariably point to CMC, Saquon and their teams' success after they were picked... while ignoring that our team is already filthier than the best case scenario of those teams' grandest rebuild aspirations at the time of those picks.
