7968,56222,56222,DireFox1,"The biggest thing about this case that doesn't make sense to me is the timeline. First off, the specific time of this alleged incident has, to my knowledge, not been publicly revealed but the date has (1/21/23, the day before the Divisional Round game at Buffalo). But to me it seems like there's one of three options for a general time. 

It may have occured early in the morning after midnight, which would be odd due to the fact he would probably be wanting to sleep well before the trip to Buffalo that day, though it's not entirely implausible. 

It may have happened before they leaved for Buffalo in the afternoon, which seems like the most likely to me but that also would have occured in broad daylight with witnesses more than likely around. 

And the final option is that it would have occured after they departed, meaning either A. It wouldn't have happened at all or B. It happened but it wasn't Joe Mixon. 

All of these possible situations have questions that haven't been answered, and the time also has yet to be answered. 

I also want to say while I know everyone wants to rush to condemn him for this because of his assault of that woman while playing for Oklahoma, he hasn't had character issues since that point (at least not within public knowledge) and apologized for the incident. So while I won't affirmatively say he didn't do this crime, I don't think using behavior from over 5 years ago that he hasn't repeated since is a good basis to build a case. 

Since this was the prosecutor who dropped the case and they've said they'll need additional investigation, I doubt this will be the last we hear of this case, and hopefully that reveals some light on the situation and justice will be delivered either way: Either his name cleared or, if he did do this, the victim gets the justice she deserves.",7.0,nfl,t3_10spbbu,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2023-02-03T17:25:23Z,bengals,0.0595567134031868

All I'll say is I don't expect any moves on the oline and while I hope we take an OL in rd 1 of the draft I think it'll be for depth and a starter in 2024.

Reid's a great coach, but outside of the Chip Kelly hire, Roseman got 2 more great hires post Reid that aligned with his team building vision. The same reason the Ravens sustained success when moving from Billick to Harbaugh, the foundation of the front office Ozzie built was still there

The Browns failures since then have been on them for awhile, I'm not taking that away and I certainly enjoy watching it, but I also get annoyed with Ravens fans who act like they built everything on their own when the best part of that foundation was built on a foundation that started in Cleveland and was merely perfected in Baltimore.

I was conflicted in last year's Superbowl, and I'm not a fan of the trash talk or the victim mentality, but now the Bengals are my team. Not just because of the franchise, but because of the fans.

Mahomes is really good, but they act like he's flawless, and he's not. He has a great offensive line. Mahomes would be shit with the Bengals AFCCG line. When he has a shit line he's terrible (see the SB against the Bucs, he was dogshit). Also, all those quirky, highlight-reel plays he does, they are a result of him missing his open receivers (based on the ingenious play design by Andy Reid). 

Frequently, Mahomes misses an open receiver, and makes those fantastic plays because he missed the open receiver. 

The Eagles have the best oline in the NFL. I want the team with the best oline to win, to show the Bengals what a great offensive line can do. The Bengals still need to upgrade the line. Volson, and Collins aint it. 

Also, Mahomes injury was overblown. Mahomes flopped on that push out, where he tripped. The NFL loves him as their posterboy. I'm sick of it. 

Let's go Eagles. Lets go Hurts.

They run in families, so if you have family history or are at all concerned set up consult with urologist and they'll do an ultrasound and see if you have any in the kidneys.  Many people produce but never pass them.
