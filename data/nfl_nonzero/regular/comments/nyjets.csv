130,287,287,09-24-11,"The Saints often restructure contracts of their good players such as Cam Jordan (twice). During the restructure the player benefits because base salary is converted to guaranteed money, so the player is happy. The team is happy because it allows the GM to move cap hits to open space, but the cap hits don’t disappear. They increase in later years. Example: 

> Jordan restructured his contract with the Saints on March 6, 2021 for cap purposes. We are estimating that Jordan will receive a $1.1 million salary and a $12.7 million signing bonus. The move will create $9.525 million in cap space for the Saints in 2021 and increase Jordan's salary cap number by $3.175 million in each of the 2022 to 2024 seasons.

The Saints have done this with Jordan, Kamara, Thomas, Ramscyk, Davis. 

This is not “cheating” the cap and the cap is not a myth as some like to think. The Saints have lost Marcus Williams and Trey Hendrickson and many others as cap casualties. 

“Why don’t more teams do this” they do all the time and we have as well. We did this with CJ Mosley this past offseason. The key is that you need good players you reasonably want to keep around for a long time, the Jets have no had this until recently. Some GMs also want the flexibility to their books clean. Cap manipulation is objectively a negative thing for the GM to do, it’s a desperation move. The Saints get the call outs from fans because they’re typically in the negative every year pre-restructures so it looks like magic but it’s not.

137,314,314,09-24-11,"1. To reiterate, then either define the rule or remove it entirely. Your stance is to let the subreddit roam free then so be it. The rules here are rarely enforced overall. There are constantly posts not related to the Jets, memes on game day, and jersey posts not mandated to the game thread. One of my pain points with the low effort posts thing, is that it is one example of rules not being followed and that is the bigger issue. 

2/3 I know it’s not a premium website and it doesn’t always have to be game film. Myself, I’ve posted salary cap breakdowns that take 20-30 minutes to write up, not just “we’ve sucked for a long time we need Rodgers” posts. Others have posted original art. I feel like I’m not asking for much here lol what I’m tired of seeing is a reiteration of a stale talking point. As far as driving away the regular users, it won’t happen.

138,315,315,09-24-11,"A few things: 

1.  If the answer from mods is to downvote/hide, then just remove the rule for “low effort/duplicate posts”. It’s almost never enforced and you yourself just said that hide and downvote is the answer. Fine, then have the rules reflect what the sub is supposed to do. Remove the low effort rule entirely. 

2. I feel this way because it is the same questions or topics being discussed with little effort with no new flavor of discussion. I especially feel this way due to the lack of effort. If fans posted in depth self post content about player reviews, contracts, game film, etc that is different because there is quality and effort being put into the discussion and that’s what makes Reddit, and sometimes r/nyjets a great place. 

3. You are saying that removing low effort posts won’t improve the quality of the posts. Disagree. I think when people have their low effort posts removed; they will be persuaded to bring low effort comments to the daily thread or the QB thread. And if it stops the low effort content all together, then so be it. 

4. I wouldn’t actually be in favor of banning gossip tweets. That’s limiting content. I was half kidding in my original comment.

457,791,791,09-24-11,"For me it has been a combination of ownership influence and hiring the wrong people to lead a franchise. After Favre left us in 2008 we were a team ready to win now without a QB (sound familiar?) We had to trade up for Sanchez. Sanchez was raw but did enough for us in his time here. Year 3 Sanchez we began to lose weapons around him on the OL and skill position. He was more heavily relied on to win but was unable to. Due to poor drafting and bad prioritizing of assets, we didn’t correctly replace his positions. Sanchez eventually failed here. 

In comes Geno to the same situation as Mark - bad OL, minimal weapons. We had an almost miracle season 2016 with Fitzmagic but the foundation of that team was based on bandaid players - older with no long term outlook here. 

Geno and Fitz are gone and Maccagnan continues to draft poorly and mismanage assets. We finally manage to land Darnold who…surprise surprise…comes into a team with minimal OL protection and little weapons to work with. Not to mention a terrible coach hired by ownership. 

In the years past I think it was easy to point blame at GM, roster and coaching but right now Zach has (so far) the best roster since our older playoff runs and what seems to be a great GM/Coach combo.

$2.75 each way. Avoid traffic. No need for an Uber. Door to seat in 35 minutes. This is exactly what I do for Mets games and it’s incredible. Bonus is that I can be at the bar on TickPick waiting for a cheap ticket to post, buy it and go. If it doesn’t hit my price point, I’m at the bar watching the game. Win win.

Our relationship has been less than stellar throughout my childhood-mid 20's, but the love of the Jets brought us back together around the glorious 2010 season. 

I took him to his first NFL game at Metlife Stadium where we watched the mighty Jets, led by Fitzmagic, squash the hell out of the Jaguars. I cried when i saw his face light up like that 6 year old in the photo when he saw the field for the first time coming through the concourse, and again when the boys scored the first TD that game. Now we are stronger than ever, both as a family, and a team. 

We still proudly stand behind that Jets helmet.

2243,19649,19649,Benedict-Glasscock,"The fix is simple. 

1) Brian Johnson for OC.
      - Dak’s QB coach at Mississippi state 
      - Hurts’s QB coach the past 2 years
      - OC at Florida, had the #9 offense in the nation and made Trask look good

2) Pep Hamilton for Senior Offensive assistant.
      - 20 years of NFL coaching experience         
      - Herbert’s QB coach his rookie year
      - Offensive coordinator for Luck’s first couple years


3) Accept that the Zach experiment is over and trade him for whatever you can get. 


4) Trade up for a QB in this upcoming draft or take one at 13. 
     - Ideally Stroud or Richardson

     - Is Derek Carr really beating Pat Mahomes in the playoffs? 
     
     - Every QB in the playoffs right now was drafted by their respective teams and is under the age of 30.
       


5) Jacoby Brissett. 
      - Inexpensive 
      - Serviceable vet
      - Can hold it down till the rookie is ready 


6) Develop a QB correctly and win games.

“It could’ve been from a Super Bowl 20 years ago, or an NFC Championship Game 10 years ago, or a recent playoff game,” Mangini said. “Whatever the different situation was, Dan had gone and pulled that video, broken down the situation, we’d talk about it and then I’d teach the situation. We’d show the situation and then we’d practice the situation.”

Mangini credited Shamash for developing a “database of all these different things that happened over time in the NFL, some of which are just mind-boggling and almost seem unbelievable when you’re presenting them to the team, like a giant comeback.” Mangini said Shamash would use the Jets’ Week 2 comeback — scoring 14 points in less than two minutes to overcome a 13-point deficit and win — to educate players in the future because “it’s just so ridiculously improbable. But those things that happen historically, you want to make sure your guys understand what’s possible, how it’s possible. And he was a big part of that.”

Mangini also had Shamash study officials.

“If they’re heavy on calling pass interference, then that’s something you gotta be especially conscious of. It could be offensive pass interference. It could be offensive holding, defensive holding, the crews have tendencies just like players have tendencies,” Mangini said, adding that the goal was “to make your guys aware of it so they can’t come back and say: ‘Well, I didn’t know they were going to call that.’ Well, we talked about that.”

All of that helped shape Shamash into what he’s become: the Jets’ purveyor of situational information.

“If (the Browns) weren’t going to be more talented than the other team — which we weren’t usually going to be — we were going to be more prepared. That definitely stuck with me,” Shamash said. “I learned all those things from (Mangini). Things like: How do you handle a two-minute warning? What does this ‘gotta have it’ situation mean to each person? It was an incredible experience and I don’t know where I am without it.”

Back then, Shamash wasn’t making any speeches to the team, though. “He’s quiet,” Mangini said. “Sometimes people can confuse someone who is quiet for someone who doesn’t have a lot to say. It’s not that, it’s just Dan thinks before he talks.”

In 2012, he was hired onto Greg Schiano’s Buccaneers staff as a quality control coach. Schiano brought other assistants with him from Rutgers, but many with game management responsibilities had little NFL coaching experience. During one game against the Cowboys, Shamash remembers turning to offensive assistant Jimmy Raye during a fourth down and saying: “Hey, we might want to go for this one.”

That Monday, Schiano called him into his office and said: “Why don’t you do this stuff for us?”

Shamash, still only 25, accepted the offer. He noticed that every other coach with a similar job around the league had been coaching in the NFL for a long time, so they had a backlog of knowledge and experience — which he didn’t. So, every Monday, Shamash watched every single game from the day before. He didn’t sleep much, he admits.

In 2014, Shamash became the Jaguars’ defensive quality control coach, joining an organization that was already heavily invested in using analytics. That’s where he met a linebackers coach named Robert Saleh.

\-

When Saleh was hired by the Jets last year, Shamash had a difficult decision to make. He had been on Anthony Lynn’s Chargers staff for four seasons, but when Lynn was fired and replaced by Brandon Staley — a coach at the forefront of the NFL’s analytics and go-for-it-on-fourth-down movement — Shamash had a choice: Stay in Los Angeles with Staley, or join Saleh’s staff.

Shamash’s wife was seven months pregnant with their second daughter, so he opted to stay with the Chargers. “It’s hard to say no to Robert,” Shamash said. Saleh instead turned to Burke, a longtime NFL position coach and former defensive coordinator.

This offseason, Burke was hired away by the Cardinals, so Saleh called Shamash again.

“I called him and said: ‘OK, bud, you ready to come home?'” Saleh said. “Thankfully, he said yes.”

Shamash and Saleh have chemistry built up from their time together in Jacksonville, and Shamash said that Saleh “has a great patience about him, which makes him very easy to communicate with.” That doesn’t mean they always agree.

Last week, after multiple touchdowns against the Dolphins, Shamash broached the idea of going for a two-point conversion. Saleh said no. Saleh said the Jets would’ve had a conversation about going for two at the end of their comeback against the Browns, but since Cleveland missed an extra point, making it a 13-point deficit instead of 14 points, it wasn’t necessary.

“We’re in constant dialogue,” Saleh said. “He gives me the information. He might say: ‘It’s fourth down, Coach. Analytically, we’re saying go for it.’ But then he’ll give me some other situations … then I have to make the decision: Do I want to go for it or not? Sometimes I take his request, sometimes I’m like, ‘Smash, here’s what I’m thinking, here’s why I’m not doing it.’ I think it’s a really good relationship.”

“By nature, he wants to go for it on every fourth down,” Saleh added, laughing. “He’s like: ‘Go for it! Go for two! Onsides kick!’ He’s very aggressive.”

Shamash laughed at that characterization.

“Inherently, I’m probably more conservative,” Shamash said. “I’m a believer in the saying that games are lost, not won. But at the same time, I’m not going in with the mentality of: Let’s not lose this. I’m thinking: What do we need to do to walk away with a win today? Whether that’s aggressiveness, or playing the game out, whatever the situation calls for … whether or not we play conservatively, no game is the same.”

Ultimately, Shamash feels like his No. 1 responsibility is to be a teacher. During a game, he’s communicating what he knows to Saleh, LaFleur, defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich and special teams coordinator Brant Boyer, with whom he worked in Cleveland. During the week, he educates players about everything to do with situational football, and the rules of the NFL.

“I’ve been playing for eight years and he’s bringing up rules I had no idea were even things,” Uzomah said. “There’s so many intricacies where I’m like: I thought this was this. And he says: ‘No no, no, trust me, this is how it’s seen from the refs’ eyes.’ I don’t usually think about it that way; I think about it from a player’s perspective. It’s things like that where we’re all just like: OK, I see you, Smash.”

Shamash’s Friday lesson before this week’s game against the Packers was on roughing the passer penalties, especially as officials have put a greater emphasis on those fouls in recent weeks. Shamash usually tries to get ahead of NFL trends.

“He says, ‘Put it in the bank,'” Saleh said. “That’s in his presentation. It might not pop up now, but it could in Week 16. So put this in the bank. He’s a very, very smart man. I’ll put him up against anybody with regards to rules and game management. He’s the best of them all.”

Last year, the Jets were outscored by 39 points in two-minute situations before halftime and at the end of the fourth quarter, per TruMedia. Since Shamash’s arrival, the Jets are outscoring opponents by 30 points in those same situations — the best differential in the NFL.

“As we continue to grow,” Shamash said, “you’re going to see wins stem from our situational awareness.”

It helps that the Jets have more talent than they did in 2021, especially on offense. Quarterback Zach Wilson is in his second year and surrounded by talented weapons and an improving offensive line. The defense has gotten better, too. The Jets made big additions on both sides of the ball in the draft and in free agency with Hall, wide receiver Garrett Wilson and cornerbacks Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed. They’re all contributing.

Also, Smash.

He’s just happy to be back where it all started.

“This organization definitely feels like home to me,” he said.",54.0,nyjets,t3_y4xyl3,False,0.0,None,2022-10-15T16:26:49Z,nyjets,0.0087111943055634
2779,26615,26615,Catharsis,"Full article (1/2):

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — It was late in the fourth quarter against the Steelers and the Jets were losing by three points, but Robert Saleh wanted the offense to move slowly. The drive started before the two-minute warning and the Jets still had all three timeouts, giving them plenty of time to operate. Quickly, Zach Wilson got the offense into Steelers territory, which helped. After an 11-yard pass to Michael Carter, the Jets were at the 37-yard line when Pittsburgh called timeout, 1:31 on the clock.

This is around when Saleh started talking “Smash Ball.”

Wilson completed a 17-yard pass to Corey Davis coming out of the timeout. Meanwhile, Saleh was calmly talking on his headset with Dan Shamash, who sits upstairs in the box during games next to offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur, who calls the plays. Saleh was so confident the Jets were going to move the ball and score a touchdown to take a lead, he instead focused more on managing the clock.

After a defensive holding penalty, the Jets were at the 9-yard line, within striking distance.

Saleh asked Shamash: Do we want to take the clock down to 24 seconds, 20 seconds or 18 seconds before calling timeout?

“If we’re going to be aggressive, take it down to 18,” Shamash said. “If we want to leave room for a penalty, take it to 24.”

Saleh wanted to be aggressive, as he often does.

“There’s a lot of back and forth,” Saleh said. “It’s very comfortable because ‘Smash’ is very calm and he’s ahead of it. So those discussions are not: ‘Ah, just shut your mouth.’ He’s very smart.”

So after a 7-yard Breece Hall run got the Jets to the 2-yard line, Saleh waited to call timeout until the 18-second mark, as instructed. Hall punched it in for a touchdown. After the kickoff, the Steelers had only 16 seconds to go 65 yards, which they failed to do. The Jets won 24-20.

Saleh has gone out of his way to credit Shamash during news conferences for some of the Jets’ decision-making in crunch time this season. He pointed to the offense’s clock management before halftime against the Browns as another instance in which Shamash was particularly impactful.

But few outside the team really understand how important Shamash has been to the Jets’ 3-2 start.

“I’m a very small part of a big cog,” Shamash told The Athletic.

Shamash’s job title is “situational football/game management coordinator,” but his responsibilities go beyond that. He helps to coach the tight ends, educates everyone on league rules and regulations and is a big part of the Jets’ movement toward utilizing analytics.

He sits next to LaFleur on Sundays, and is in Saleh’s ear all game, preparing him for every possible scenario — and what the math (or the analytics) says is the right thing to do in any given situation. Shamash uses a “four-down analytics model” that takes into account factors like weather and injuries. “You’re going off that to a certain degree,” he said, “and there’s also a feel.” The model is put together by the rest of the analytics staff, which includes Brian Shields, Zach Stuart and Jeremiah Whitmire.

Every Friday, Shamash leads a five-minute team meeting educating everyone on league trends, rules and other things to keep an eye on. He’s normally soft-spoken and a self-described introvert, but his energy changes when he’s standing in front of the team, his deep voice booming across the room. That comes from his passion for teaching.

The players love Shamash.

“You mean Smash Ball?” Jets tight end C.J. Uzomah said, gleefully. “He’s smart as hell.”“On Friday, he’s got the stage,” Saleh said.

“That’s Smash Ball. And when he’s done, everyone chants ‘Smash’!”

As Shamash leaned against a door at the Jets facility to prop it open on Thursday, he nodded his head in the direction of the nearby mailroom, a reminder of where his career started.

In 2008, the Jets had just moved to their new facility in Florham Park. Shamash, from the Bronx, was fresh out of college, graduating from Carnegie Mellon, where he played inside linebacker. At orientation for an internship with the Jets, a 22-year-old Shamash asked general manager Mike Tannenbaum what he needed to do to stand out and get hired full-time. Tannenbaum told him: Your job is 9 to 5, but what you want to accomplish will come with what you do outside of those work hours.

Shamash thought: Well, then, outside of those hours, I’ll be here. He was working as the outside linebackers coach at Columbia University in Manhattan, so he’d drive an hour to Florham Park every night for his internship.

“I was the late-night guy,” Shamash said. He did anything the Jets coaches needed. Head coach Eric Mangini liked that he knew how to operate the music system during practice.

He also knew his way around the building, while some coaches were still finding their way in the new digs. One night, Shamash spotted a short, bald man with a beard wandering around, lost. It was the Jets quarterbacks coach. He asked Shamash where the mailroom was. Once they got to talking, they bonded over playing Division III college football.

That was Brian Daboll, now the Giants’ head coach.

Mangini was fired at the end of that season but hired as the Browns’ head coach a week later. He brought Daboll with him as offensive coordinator. Daboll called Shamash. They didn’t have a job for him yet but Daboll said they could use Shamash’s help transitioning their operation over to Cleveland. Daboll said he didn’t need to leave right away, but to come soon.

“I was like, ‘Yeah, right,’ and I just drove straight there,” Shamash said. He arrived around 6 a.m. after an eight-hour drive, called Daboll and told him he was in Cleveland. Daboll couldn’t believe it — and told him to go sleep for two hours and then call him.

Shamash was convinced Mangini only wanted him there to install their music system for practice, but he didn’t care. He’d take out the trash if it meant sticking around.

“The first thing they did was meet with me to figure out what they needed to order (for the music) and what they needed to get done in case I didn’t pan out,” Shamash said, laughing. “If that’s what the job ended up being, that was fine with me.”

Instead, Shamash made himself indispensable. He assisted Daboll for three months before Mangini actually hired him. He was living out of his Jeep Wrangler, in the winter, spending most nights sleeping in his office. He stuffed his cellphone in a desk drawer on his first day and didn’t remove it for months.

He’d see coaches like Daboll, Mangini, Rob Ryan and Brad Seely working deep into the night, so “it took me a while to figure out that people even went home from the office,” Shamash said, laughing. “It turned into a 4 a.m. rule where if you’re still at the office, you just stay. I did that every night. I honestly didn’t even know that people went home to see their families.”

Finally, they hired him as an offensive assistant, working primarily with Daboll on daily practice scripting, scheduling and game-planning while also assisting Mangini on everything to do with situational football.

“He showed up, worked, did whatever jobs we needed him to do at the time — and there were a bunch of them,” Mangini said. “He was so good that we couldn’t let him go. He created the opportunity.”

\-

Just about every NFL team has an analytics department now, some more expansive than others. More recently, there’s been a trend of teams bringing on game-management coaches, variations of Shamash’s job. The Broncos made waves earlier this season when they hired veteran coach Jerry Rosburg to help Denver head coach Nathaniel Hackett, who was floundering in his late-game, high-pressure decision-making.

Saleh hired Shamash this offseason, and veteran coach Matt Burke had the role last year.

Mangini was way ahead of the curve — “Eric was very analytically advanced, especially for the time,” Shamash said. Mangini was a demanding coach but working for him became a crash course in situational football for Shamash. Mangini was always asking for detailed, uber-specific information, and often on short notice. An example: If the Browns were playing the Steelers, Mangini would demand information about how many times linebacker James Harrison lined up on the right side and dropped into coverage. Before team meetings, Mangini would direct Shamash to pull up clips from specific situations, especially end-of-half or end-of-game two-minute drill-type scenarios. Shamash said often he’d find out “20 seconds” before walking into the meeting.",47.0,nyjets,t3_y4xyl3,False,0.0,None,2022-10-15T16:23:14Z,nyjets,1.450908951373739e-07

8165,68389,68389,JaMollyAdams,"Just gonna rant here cuz I'm in bed and I just saw this post. 

It's so tough because the coaches are doing everything they can to protect him from himself, but with Zach, it's SUCH a fine line between ""don't fuck up"" and ""throw the fucking ball to the open receiver."" It's so damn frustrating to watch him play. 

If he was throwing 30-40 yard bombs that were falling incomplete or heck - even getting picked off, we'd be like ""ah damn, nice try down field"" but the dude cannot hit receivers behind the line of scrimmage 8 yards away from him and throwing balls directly into the defense's chest. It's truly mind boggling how terrible he is.

And I absolutely think you're right. He's so mentally in his own head that he can't make the gimme throws to start the momentum and get the offense and himself going.

And on top of ALL of this piss poor QB play, he refuses to accept responsibility and take accountability. The few fans and supporters he had going into this week have dissipated after his post game conference. He no longer has the full support of his teammates, coaches, or fans. It's going to take A LOT for him to turn this shit around. 

And going 18/30 with 1 TD and 14 rush yards against Chicago isn't gonna do it. He needs to beat this subpar Chicago defense down to a pulp to prove he can potentially be the guy and can turn things around.

When the Jets hired Saleh to be head coach in January 2021, LaFleur was an easy choice for offensive coordinator.

Saleh and LaFleur had been fellow assistants on the 49ers under Kyle Shanahan — Saleh the defensive coordinator, LaFleur the passing game coordinator — and had known each other for years. Saleh worked and lived with Mike’s brother Matt at Central Michigan, and would annoy a teenaged Mike by hogging the TV when he visited the LaFleur family home in Mount Pleasant, Mich.

LaFleur’s hiring was praised by many around the league. “It’s the West Coast system,” he said in his introductory news conference. “We’re trying to run the outside zone and do the play-action stuff off of it, but we fit it to our players.” But some players found the system to be needlessly complicated.

“We’ll have one route but it has a bunch of different names depending on the concept,” said a former Jets receiver who spent time with the team in training camp this year. “I’ve been on multiple teams, this is the first time I’ve experienced that.”

Calvin Jackson, an undrafted rookie wide receiver who spent the offseason and training camp with the Jets, said LaFleur spoke with him one-on-one after Jackson had a tough time learning concepts in OTAs. “He’s one of those soft-spoken guys that won’t say much,” Jackson said. “But if you need help, you can always go to him and ask for it.” By training camp, Jackson said he had the concepts figured out.

As a rookie, Zach Wilson struggled with the complexity of the scheme and went 3-10 as the starter. Over the offseason, LaFleur and quarterbacks coach Rob Calabrese studied what worked for Wilson in 2021 and what didn’t. There was some level of frustration. LaFleur would tell people how much more effective the offense looked with quarterbacks Flacco, Josh Johnson and especially White. The stats backed it up.

But Wilson was the Jets’ future, so LaFleur adjusted the scheme, reduced the volume of plays and tried to make things more digestible. Wilson seemed to have a better handle on the offense in OTAs and went into the rest of the offseason committed to building chemistry with his wide receivers.

He spent thousands of dollars flying to Florida, Arizona and Tennessee to work out with teammates. Wilson invited most of the team’s skill position players and quarterbacks to Idaho for a getaway right before training camp, a fun weekend relaxing in the company of celebrities like Wayne Gretzky and Justin Bieber. Some of Wilson’s teammates appreciated the effort he was putting in.

“I never hung out with him outside of the building or anything, but from my experience he was a cool, down-to-earth dude,” said the wide receiver who was with the Jets in training camp. Jackson said when he was first signed to the Jets, Wilson told him: “I’m happy you’re here.” And when Jackson was cut, Wilson called “to make sure I was in the right headspace.”

In New York’s first preseason game, Wilson started things off by sailing a pass over Garrett Wilson’s head and throwing a bad interception. On his second drive, his right knee buckled on a scramble, a non-contact injury. He had suffered a torn meniscus and bone bruise and was forced to the sidelines for six weeks while recovering from a procedure to repair the meniscus. Wilson said afterward he did not anticipate any long-term effects from the knee injury, or from the PCL sprain he suffered as a rookie to the same knee that forced him to miss four games.

Wilson made his 2022 regular-season debut in Week 4 against the Steelers and struggled for three quarters, though he did catch a second-quarter touchdown on a trick play. In the fourth quarter, the Jets trailing by 10, Wilson pulled his teammates aside and told them, in so many words, to “man up.” He completed 10 of 12 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown that quarter while playing through an ankle injury, and the Jets won 24-20.

“The young man doesn’t flinch,” Saleh said after the game.

It never got better.

LaFleur’s directive to Zach Wilson when he returned to game action wasn’t complicated: If the first read and second reads aren’t there, run.

The strategy worked against the Steelers and again in Week 5 against the Dolphins, a 40-17 win. In Week 6, the Jets won in Green Bay, even though Wilson completed only 10 of 18 passes for 110 yards while playing through a separation of the AC joint in his left shoulder.

The Jets’ simplistic approach to the passing game wasn’t sitting well with some wide receivers, who weren’t seeing the ball as much as they had with Flacco starting the first three games. Garrett Wilson had one catch against the Packers. Elijah Moore wasn’t targeted at all while running 14 routes. Moore reportedly first expressed his displeasure to teammates after the Packers game, questioning his future with the Jets. That night, he also responded to a tweet about his lack of targets by saying: “If I say what I really wanna say … I’ll be the selfish guy … just know I don’t understand either.”

His frustration spilled into practice that week. That Thursday, Moore surprised teammates and coaches by blowing up on LaFleur, telling him to “go f— yourself” and “you suck,” according to multiple people who witnessed the interaction. LaFleur and Saleh ultimately decided to send Moore home to cool off. That night, he requested a trade.

He was the second highly drafted wide receiver to do so — Denzel Mims, a second-round pick in 2020, wanted out in August, once it became clear he was buried on the depth chart. Both times, the Jets made it clear they didn’t intend to trade either. Publicly and privately, Saleh supported both Moore and Mims, and his compassion resonated with other Jets players. Moore and LaFleur hugged it out. Mims and Moore didn’t cause any issues the rest of the season.

The Jets won their Week 7 game against the Broncos, though it came at a great cost. Hall, averaging 5.8 yards per carry during his rookie season, suffered a torn ACL. Star offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker, selected 12 picks after Wilson in the 2021 first round, suffered torn triceps. Both were lost for the season.

The next week, Wilson threw three interceptions in a 22-17 loss to the Patriots, and his relationship with LaFleur started to sour. NFL legend Steve Young, who Wilson said he called in November for advice, shed some light on their relationship in a radio interview earlier this month.

“Zach doesn’t need tough love. He doesn’t need somebody to see how tough he is. He needs a big brother — a young, knowledgeable innovator, someone who he can trust and says to him, ‘You know what, despite everything that’s happened, Zach, I believe in you. You can get this done.’ Zach needs that,” Young said. “Mike kind of kept him at arm’s length and gave him the tough-love aspect, and I don’t think that’s really useful for Zach.”",13.0,nyjets,t3_10g2z3a,False,0.0,None,2023-01-19T09:32:00Z,nyjets,0.0089612379368876
9083,72109,72109,Jets2022Champs,"When the Jets hired Saleh to be head coach in January 2021, LaFleur was an easy choice for offensive coordinator.

Saleh and LaFleur had been fellow assistants on the 49ers under Kyle Shanahan — Saleh the defensive coordinator, LaFleur the passing game coordinator — and had known each other for years. Saleh worked and lived with Mike’s brother Matt at Central Michigan, and would annoy a teenaged Mike by hogging the TV when he visited the LaFleur family home in Mount Pleasant, Mich.

LaFleur’s hiring was praised by many around the league. “It’s the West Coast system,” he said in his introductory news conference. “We’re trying to run the outside zone and do the play-action stuff off of it, but we fit it to our players.” But some players found the system to be needlessly complicated.

“We’ll have one route but it has a bunch of different names depending on the concept,” said a former Jets receiver who spent time with the team in training camp this year. “I’ve been on multiple teams, this is the first time I’ve experienced that.”

Calvin Jackson, an undrafted rookie wide receiver who spent the offseason and training camp with the Jets, said LaFleur spoke with him one-on-one after Jackson had a tough time learning concepts in OTAs. “He’s one of those soft-spoken guys that won’t say much,” Jackson said. “But if you need help, you can always go to him and ask for it.” By training camp, Jackson said he had the concepts figured out.

As a rookie, Zach Wilson struggled with the complexity of the scheme and went 3-10 as the starter. Over the offseason, LaFleur and quarterbacks coach Rob Calabrese studied what worked for Wilson in 2021 and what didn’t. There was some level of frustration. LaFleur would tell people how much more effective the offense looked with quarterbacks Flacco, Josh Johnson and especially White. The stats backed it up.

But Wilson was the Jets’ future, so LaFleur adjusted the scheme, reduced the volume of plays and tried to make things more digestible. Wilson seemed to have a better handle on the offense in OTAs and went into the rest of the offseason committed to building chemistry with his wide receivers.

He spent thousands of dollars flying to Florida, Arizona and Tennessee to work out with teammates. Wilson invited most of the team’s skill position players and quarterbacks to Idaho for a getaway right before training camp, a fun weekend relaxing in the company of celebrities like Wayne Gretzky and Justin Bieber. Some of Wilson’s teammates appreciated the effort he was putting in.

“I never hung out with him outside of the building or anything, but from my experience he was a cool, down-to-earth dude,” said the wide receiver who was with the Jets in training camp. Jackson said when he was first signed to the Jets, Wilson told him: “I’m happy you’re here.” And when Jackson was cut, Wilson called “to make sure I was in the right headspace.”

In New York’s first preseason game, Wilson started things off by sailing a pass over Garrett Wilson’s head and throwing a bad interception. On his second drive, his right knee buckled on a scramble, a non-contact injury. He had suffered a torn meniscus and bone bruise and was forced to the sidelines for six weeks while recovering from a procedure to repair the meniscus. Wilson said afterward he did not anticipate any long-term effects from the knee injury, or from the PCL sprain he suffered as a rookie to the same knee that forced him to miss four games.

Wilson made his 2022 regular-season debut in Week 4 against the Steelers and struggled for three quarters, though he did catch a second-quarter touchdown on a trick play. In the fourth quarter, the Jets trailing by 10, Wilson pulled his teammates aside and told them, in so many words, to “man up.” He completed 10 of 12 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown that quarter while playing through an ankle injury, and the Jets won 24-20.

“The young man doesn’t flinch,” Saleh said after the game.

It never got better.

LaFleur’s directive to Zach Wilson when he returned to game action wasn’t complicated: If the first read and second reads aren’t there, run.

The strategy worked against the Steelers and again in Week 5 against the Dolphins, a 40-17 win. In Week 6, the Jets won in Green Bay, even though Wilson completed only 10 of 18 passes for 110 yards while playing through a separation of the AC joint in his left shoulder.

The Jets’ simplistic approach to the passing game wasn’t sitting well with some wide receivers, who weren’t seeing the ball as much as they had with Flacco starting the first three games. Garrett Wilson had one catch against the Packers. Elijah Moore wasn’t targeted at all while running 14 routes. Moore reportedly first expressed his displeasure to teammates after the Packers game, questioning his future with the Jets. That night, he also responded to a tweet about his lack of targets by saying: “If I say what I really wanna say … I’ll be the selfish guy … just know I don’t understand either.”

His frustration spilled into practice that week. That Thursday, Moore surprised teammates and coaches by blowing up on LaFleur, telling him to “go f— yourself” and “you suck,” according to multiple people who witnessed the interaction. LaFleur and Saleh ultimately decided to send Moore home to cool off. That night, he requested a trade.

He was the second highly drafted wide receiver to do so — Denzel Mims, a second-round pick in 2020, wanted out in August, once it became clear he was buried on the depth chart. Both times, the Jets made it clear they didn’t intend to trade either. Publicly and privately, Saleh supported both Moore and Mims, and his compassion resonated with other Jets players. Moore and LaFleur hugged it out. Mims and Moore didn’t cause any issues the rest of the season.

on the defensive side, Ahmad ""Sauce"" Gardner is a rookie cornerback who just had an incredible all-pro season and will almost certainly be the defensive rookie of the year. we've also got defensive tackle Quinnen Williams who's entering his 5th season and coming off the best season of his career, where he also was an all-pro

on offense, we've got rookie wide receiver Garrett Wilson who just had an incredible year, as well as rookie running back Breece Hall who looked unstoppable until he got injured week 7 and was out the rest of the year. Alijah Vera-Tucker is also a very good offensive lineman entering his 3rd season, who also just got injured week 7 and missed the rest of the season. that was a rough game

the biggest piece we're currently missing is a quarterback. a couple years ago we drafted qb Zach Wilson with the 2nd overall pick, and he turned out to be a complete bust (this is a few years after drafting qb Sam Darnold with the 3rd overall pick, who was also a bust). many of us are hoping we can grab someone decent in the offseason so we can maybe compete next year. our defense was elite this past year so whether we can compete next year really just comes down to whether we can get a good qb. but as a team we've historically had a lot of bad luck at that position, so who knows

11193,84056,84056,Kwall267,"Not seeing the daily thread for today so I’ll post this here. Here are the top unrestricted Free Agent QBs in 2023 who currently do not have a contract (this is in no particular order): 

Tom Brady (lol), Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold (lol), Jimmy Garopollo, Teddy Bridgewater, Daniel Jones, Case Keenum, Jacoby Brisset, Geno Smith (lol), Andy Dalton, Joe Flacco, Mike White, Taylor Heinicke, Lamar Jackson, Drew Lock, Cooper Rush, Gardner Minshew. 

I think we resign Mike White if he’s half competent this week as our back up. I don’t think Lamar or Danny sniff free agency. Tom would rather retire then play for us. Geno and Sam would never come back and Bridgewater probably wouldn’t either. Baker, Keenum, Brisset, Rush, Minshew are high quality back ups that aren’t any better than White. Dalton and Flacco are washed and have “Indianapolis Colts” written all over the their tired faces. That just leaves Jimmy G. Between his and our San Fran roots and he probably would like to stick it to old Billy B I’d say that is the avenue we go down. The only downside is he’s playing super well and Lance is still a huge unknown and they have a Super Bowl roster so if he sucks they would want to have someone like Jimmy G waiting.

11196,84062,84062,Kwall267,"I know I’m going to get downvoted to the shadow realm but I say with stick with Zach for the season. This roster is solid and we shouldn’t have too much roster turn over next year. If anything we will be in a better position since our high quality rookies will have a full NFL season under their belts. 

Best Case: Zach gets his shit together, apologizes to the defense privately and makes an adult statement to the media. Goes out and plays consistent football at or around how he was in the 4th quarter in Pittsburgh. We sneak into the playoffs and we all feel good about the season. Then we bring in a quality back up this off season. Case Keenum, Andy Dalton, Teddy Bridgewater, Jacoby Brissett, Taylor Heineke, Cooper Rush, and Gardner Minshew are all unrestricted free agent QBs next year who have real game experience and can be some competition for Zach this off season 

Worst Case: Zach sucks and we know that definitely and we miss the playoffs. But, we can improve our draft position. We then make some moves to bring in a better QB this off-season. Jimmy Garappolo, Daniel Jones, and Lamar Jackson are also unrestricted free agents next year who don’t have a deal as of this moment. In this scenario we have everything to be true contenders. 

The only thing that can truly make this situation worse is if the locker room implodes. Right now I really think the only thing keeping us together is Saleh. If he can keep the players sharp and the captains continue to speak his good word to the locker room we can weather this storm.

Edit: I also don’t believe that White or Flacco give us any better QB play.

Flacco is not a starter in this league. At best he’s a veteran presence in the locker room. Jury is still out if Zach is the guy. I really hope he is because he’s perfect for NY and so much fun to watch when he’s playing his game well. 

Our guards should be the one best duo on the league. AVT is getting better and better every game but so far Tomlinson has underperformed. Having a rotating door of tackles will ruin an offensive line. If Becton isn’t the guy that needs to be priority number 1 this off-season.

Weve spent a stupid amount of resources on the offense so it’s pretty telling with respect to JDs abilities that it’s so bad. 

Multiple first round picks used on the OL, tens of millions spent on a guard (who sucks), 20 million spent on a replacement LT because our current one can’t stay healthy, and the deal for George Fant that has proven to be a bust outside of one fluke year. 

Outside of that, a first and second round pick on receivers (one of which is really good), a second round and a couple of fourth round picks on RBs, multi year high AAV deals for two tight ends plus a third round pick on one too.

That philosophy can work, but from the outside looking in, (none of us know what actually happens inside the locker room) it sure seems like there’s no accountability if players keep making the same mistakes week after week.",6.0,nyjets,t3_xoww7z,False,0.0,:billruckert:,2022-09-26T23:09:23Z,nyjets,0.0060917947590351

Military, professional sports teams, universities and leading medical facilities across the nation all use AlterG treadmills. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill helps a broad spectrum of people – top level athletes, orthopaedic and neurologic patients, pediatric, geriatric, and those looking to lose weight or to achieve their personal health and performance goals!  
  
AlterG treadmills offer an unique unweighting process utilizing a differential air pressure technique that NASA developed. The original use was to help astronauts exercise and maintain conditioning while in space. The air pressure comfortably lifts the user and allows him/her to walk or run at a fraction of their body weight.  
  
**AlterG treadmills allow patients to rehab from a lower extremity injury or surgery with less pain. Allowing for early weight-bearing exercises without the risk of injury to the healing tissue, the AlterG is ideal for joint rehab.  The AlterG assists in correcting gait mechanics and promoting a normal range of motion by reducing the demand on the affected joint.
Athletes of all sports and ages find the AlterG to be ideal. The AlterG creates a low impact, pain-free environment that allows athletes to increase their training volume, decrease downtime, and reduce the likelihood of training injuries that will cause a delay in getting back to their sport. The athlete can then return to their sport sooner and in better condition.
Lower body conditions that benefit from the use of the AlterG:
Total Hip or Total Knee Replacements  
Meniscectomy (Meniscus Repair)  
ACL Reconstruction  
Achilles  
Bunionectomy  
Arthritis (OA, RA)

13851,99397,99397,NannigarCire,"Actually I’m coming back because one thing you said here kept bothering me more than the others- “brady is number 10 and Fitzpatrick is #2”, this statement misses the point. You can’t make a bad player good. The product of the NFL would be worse if they tried to. Fitzpatrick given the volume of passes he takes, is unsurprising to be ahead of Brady because he’s a worse player. He’s more likely to throw into tight coverage where holdings and DPIs are happening, more likely to get hit during a play to get unnecessary roughness, he’s a worse player. Brady isn’t going to get more calls because he doesn’t play like shit. Even if it was the other way around, where Brady gets more calls that wouldn’t prove that the league does anything to tip the scales. It’s not actually refuting the concept. The idea and the reason why this point is so bothersome and wrong to me- is whether players are qualitatively (not quantitatively) getting favorable calls in situations where lesser players would not. Does Tom Brady on 3rd and 6 throwing to Wes Welker from the slot on an out route get the holding call when the safety makes a ticky-tacky hip touch while the patriots are up 3 late in the 3rd? When comparing it to all similar qualitative situations, are those calls even or is there a pattern towards particular players getting the calls? Who are those players, and what is their relationship to the league brand?

13853,99399,99399,NannigarCire,"the view of it as a scripted contest would require that but not a view of moderate favoritism. like you don't need more than regular exposure to specific players and personalities to do that. i also don't agree that the nfl would've loved to have sanchez and rex and hard knocks in the superbowl imo- it's arguing they are creating narratives for the sake of narratives instead of creating positive reciprocal relationships with those that forward the brand. And the Jets are not even close to one of the major teams that do that. I think it's either misguided or a misunderstanding of what i'm saying. Like it's almost undeniable when watching QBs that the ones with more tenure, exposure, and popularity get better calls than the ones that don't have any of those. 

i brought up the WWE metaphor because its a fully scripted show but the script is 100% earned by the people involved. You don't just win Championships because they decide it, you build up loyalty within the brand, show your skill and talent as an exciting actor in the ring, and then get rewarded for it with better matches, better stories, better etc. The NFL can't do that, that's impossible for them. But they can tell the refs to protect their biggest assets like Brady, Peyton, Brees, Mahomes, etc. They can't make them play well, but they can choose to be more loose with holding calls not just for certain teams but also for certain matchups. Like the NFL can request the refs to keep the flags only for the most egregious calls in marquee matchups on primetime if they want to. Or for whatever leads to the highest scoring game. They're doing what they perceive as being good for the brand and it's marketing. There's nothing to suggest they can't. The risk/reward factor is intangible, it's unclear- because other sports exist but not all of them are even nearly the cultural product likely because partially a missing compelling narrative that is culturally bigger than the game being played.

It's essentially what they do when they change the rules to make it better for QBs and the passing game, they're not focused on some internal competitive fairness- they're deciding based on what they think makes the game more marketable and expands its cultural relevance. Peyton was the main lobbyer for this version of the game and he was a massive brand ambassador for the NFL.

>And now that there is so much gambling involved , it would be a federal crime that would put a lot of people in jail.

i'm sorry to accuse you of this, but this particular statement is a little naive considering how illegal insider trading is but how regular it is. It's likely that the majority of the owners involved in the league even do some insider trading through all sorts of dark accounts, along with many other illegal things. 

The idea of ""making things a little more exciting"" on the field, is even lower effort than that. There's a relevant quote from Chomsky that's sort of related here- where he's talking to a BBC interviewer and they ask him- ""you think i'm being told by my superiors what to write?"" and he says, no of course not. that's ridiculous, its likely that your thoughts are your own but your viewpoint is one that already aligns to the position they want. The filter happened when you got the job. There's no need for anyone to be directed, they've already chosen people who understand the point.

Because this leads me to something i don't personally understand too well- how were the referees able to strike? I've participated in a lot of labor organizing so usually strikes are based on leverage. But what is a referees leverage exactly? Like it seems to be a pretty high demand job with a lot of potential replacements who (if not all thrown in at once) would probably ease in without much issue. It pays well (200k per season) and there's tons of potential guys who can and want to do it. The guys who aren't on the field in sports are about as replaceable as the guys in the arts, where no matter how well trained you are from juliard or berkeley, they'll find someone else to put in the spot with ease.

13856,99406,99406,NannigarCire,"alright so under the new context maybe its unnecessary for me to do the stat analysis i wanted to do BUT i still did a little bit of it because i wanted to really make my point- the thing for Adams vs Cooper is that the game Adams plays is one that doesn't impact defenses compared to the way Cooper plays. Adams is a very heavy underneath receiver who mostly works his best in the short game compared to all the other all-time great WRs who are intermediate players + have some amount of deep threat to them. Like you mentioned Adams being doubled etc but this is only important if Adams was going for deep routes, which isn't really his thing. It's a very ideological statement on my part because there is no objective point to make here, but IMO a legit top WR should be playing the big boy game of intermediate + deep ball profeciency and Adams is a short yardage specialist more-so. He's like a powered-up slot receiver. Like his two killer seasons with Green Bay had 60% and 67% of his targets either short or behind the line of scrimmage. Whereas like Julio never went past 47% of his targets in that area. Cooper's also usually below 50% in the area, although in 2020 he had like 60% in the area, which was the season where Dak got hurt early and Dalton+Ben Dinucci became QBs so that explains that. Davante plays a much different game than the all-timers is what i'm getting at, and i'm guessing you don't disagree


*i'd like to go even more in depth by breaking down the variance +luck aspect of adams vs other top WRs but..downloading this data from PFF is impossible bc its too many columns

But anyway, in relevance to Carr- i did a long dive into Carr and the thing with him is that although he had weapons they were not in the areas he is best at. Carr is a short-passing specialist, his best seasons were when his best players had average depth of targets before the first down marker (Waller at around 8.something + Renfrow at 6.something) and then supporting targets that went deep (Agholor, Ruggs, Zay). His bad seasons are when his top targets have their average depth of targets deeper down the field (both Crabtree/Cooper were above 10+). Davante should've been another one of these short yardage guys, but for some reason McDaniels decided to send Davante way deeper than he normally goes this year. In the last two years with GB Davante's ADOT was 9.7 and 8.7, but with the Raiders this year it was 12.8 which is his career high. So the thing with Carr is that he was in a talent mismatch by being asked to throw farther a lot more often than he's supposed to.

But i think in any case the thing i wanted to deep dive onto isn't going to be a disagreeable point, however i do think Amari is very valuable to a level that isn't much worse than Adams because he is an intermediate/deep receiver that opens up the rest of the offense. Whereas Adams, because he's not really that type of player, doesn't have the same overall impact on the offensive scheme + defensive reaction. Adams skills will get him a lot more counting stats though, in the right situations. Honestly i'd be curious to see what his volume is when he's in an offense that has other targets because i think given his speciality he wouldn't get the heavy usage he has received since 2018.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10shocp,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-02-04T18:58:03Z,nyjets,0.0282955181502271

13861,99414,99414,NannigarCire,"sorry ot throw myself into this conversation but it's a pretty good discussion. I want to add that Davante has faced very weak target competition throughout his career. As a third year receiver playing alongside Jordy's penultimate Packers year, he was a distant second. But in most of his high performing seasons he's been far and away the only true target on that offense and way above the guys around him, and he's not exactly the most talented NFL WR. Looking at the guys on those teams from 2018 onwards, i don't even think some of them would've been able to start on the Jets teams. The ghost of graham? Allen Lazard? Equanemous St. Brown? 

also just can't imagine putting Davante on the all-timer scale. Davante was never dominant like Julio, so it feels very box score heavy to say he's the best WR at any point in the NFL. It's sort of like arguing Diggs as the best WR because he once led the NFL too, but neither Diggs nor Adams are so scary that defenses have to totally adjust for them the way they have for Julio, Calvin, and now Chase and Jefferson. Davante and Cooper are both hall of very good players for very different reasons, and to bring it full circle Cooper's had a lot more competition for targets and with a significantly downgraded QB. Carr isn't a guy who forces the ball to his man the way Rodgers does, and he had few opportunities with Prescott or Watson. Plus on the Cowboys his target competition was way harder than anything Davante has had to compete with.

Even when i did the Zach Wilson or Mike White breakdown, the majority of posts relish the content (which is appreciated) but there is no back and forth- very few users here can actually talk to you about the topic when you go into depth. And as much as i like being right, actually discussing something on the level that i want to discuss it- is the whole reason why i would personally post it. Partly praise, partly to garner discussion.

The payoff is very low. And unless your goal is to be picked up by some low-end blog that will expect you to churn out high quality content to legitimize their website, there is very little to gain. You just do it for yourself. And i don't think raising the standard for what counts as a post will change that. This isn't askhistorians, it's a bunch of people who get buzzed on Sundays, tune into the same channel to watch a football game at the same time, and then have very strong emotional reactions to it for the most part.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10s997w,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-02-03T16:56:57Z,nyjets,0.0513560233802062

Low effort is very subjective. It has a large range, some posts do get removed for low effort but it's something that we often let the subreddit deal with because the content control is almost entirely in the hands of the people here. My definition of low effort is a lot different than yours, and others, and etc. I think making up random scenarios and asking about 'what if' is low effort, but some people like discussing that stuff.

There is no unique scheme, no unique ideas, the only unique thing he's done is cause one of the most embarrassing displays of resource mismanagement and player usage ever with the 2022 Broncos.

I think it's disgustingly stupid to hire someone who is only in the NFL out of nepotism, after they have just shown a massive failure in their hands when the majority of these coaches can't even be told apart from one another in a significant way. If someone can find a real difference between Hackett and any other potential OC, i'd be surprised. All of these people bringing up 'offensive ranking', Rodgers MVP season- none of them can say what makes Hackett perform any of these tasks in a standout way. Hiring him after what he just showed is a disgusting display of how the NFL's insiders club operates, there is no punishment for only being there because of your father and then fucking up.

I'd look at the others but it would take too much time to PFF search players i don't really recognize. In the remaining four, you find only 1 starter in any of them and barely a player worth starting in the other players within.

The chance of filling all these holes youre pointing out using these picks is astronomically low. and what you're actually giving up is 1.5 starters for a QB. That's actually what is given up. 1.5 starters on average. The draft is not for filling needs. This is not what its for other than QB. If you have a need, you look to FA. And if FA doesn't have an option, then you have to draft. But all short-term needs, like the ones that are necessary for next season they are/should be filled with veterans. Why would someone want a competitive team to play a rookie FS or rookie C or rookie LT in a competitive year? 

It's unnecessary, it's not a good trade off, and it's pushing a completely new issue onto the team of not even allowing them to take advantage of having 3/4 of their best players be on their rookie deals- the cap saving of that is almost the same as the amount of cap being saved by a rookie QB deal.

It's fun to follow a bad team is what i'm saying, as long as you don't tie the Jets winning games as something that affects your emotional well-being or that serves as a personal accomplishment.

The best player is currently Ahmad Sauce Gardner, rookie cornerback who just had an incredible season. Other top players are Garrett Wilson (Rookie Wide Receiver) and Quinnen Williams (5th year defensive tackle). Another contender for one of the teams top players is Alijah Vera-Tucker who seems to be a god at all of the offensive line positions.

The Jets are outside the top 16 contenders for the superbowl almost entirely because they are missing a quarterback. If they find one of at least top 16 quality, they probably jump into the top 10 for Superbowl contenders and will be a force in the upcoming season.

Dak has been given good weaponry for most of his career, that's undeniable but this year his weapons are worse. and Burrow's weapons are incredible for every year he's played since his first. Top 5 WR in Chase, top 15 WR in Higgins, one of the best slot WRs that's underused in Boyd (who used to be a 1000 yard receiver when before all the other WRs joined), plus great receiving backs. Like the only thing they lack is a top 15 Tight end. Dak's had good weaponry in the past when he had the Lamb/Cooper/Gallup crew but he barely got the chance to play with them. Most of his luck has been in having good OL but you can't accrue big numbers just by having time to throw and yet, his numbers are still in a rare group of high efficiency players who also have high volume of production. and then on top of that he has a 70% win rate for his career.

13941,99511,99511,NannigarCire,"This year was a bad year for him, but even with this years stats, his career production and efficiency is above average. But the concept you bring up- of 'should be able to transcend a weak supporting cast'- he did. He did when he won MVP in 2019 by throwing to Mark Andrews, Rookie Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead. He did in 2020, and he did again in 2021 although his interception rate that year was way higher than any other. He didn't do it in 2022. But the concept of turning water into wine constantly over and over again, isn't even proven in the accepted elite quarterbacks. Aaron Rodgers has two years in his career with some of the worst supporting casts imaginable and both years his numbers take nosedives in passing efficiency, just like Lamar, just like Carr this year, just like many other players. Lamar being unable to raise a sub-par offensive cast into a strong offense is already disproven by 2019-2021. Go look at those teams. They are not filled with talent. For his career, the best situation he's had is one good tight end Mark Andrews, one solid receiver Marqise Brown, and rotational pieces.

If the argument is then ""well his most recent season is the only one that matters"" then i'm sorry, it's a bad argument. It's going to fail historically, it's going to lose when i show other great QBs bad seasons, it's an easy argument to show as poor.

13943,99513,99513,NannigarCire,">I hate this kind of assumption. There's also a possibility that Lamar is the limiting factor in an offense with better weapons and his passing numbers don't jump significantly. Until you actually see what happens you can't assume that 30% better receivers equals 30% more production, for example.

​i'm not assuming it, you can look through his year to year and see the worse receivers correlate with worse production. And this is the case for almost every QB in the league, but to a degree that is limited by their individual skills and sometimes by skill mismatch (Carr with Cooper/Crabtree was worse than he was without them, for example). But even so, bad QBs will still improve with better talent. And Lamar Jackson has two seasons that are above 75th percentile with below average talent. It's not going to scale 30% to 30% like you said, but it improves almost always.

IMO what this argument has to say in order to make sense is not that ""the improvement doens't scale"" but that Lamar Jackson is actually not talented enough. And that argument isn't going to make sense.  He is clearly talented.

There is no way the MVP of the 2019 season throwing 66% completion (76th percentile amongst all QB seasons from 2012-2022), 7.8 YPA (78th percentile), 1.5% interception rate (86th percentile), and a 5.4% sack rate (66th percentile) to top four receivers Mark Andrews, Rookie Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead while setting the record for all-time QB best rushing season is not talented.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10gya3b,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-20T15:56:46Z,nyjets,0.0274804574521417
13944,99514,99514,NannigarCire,"I'm saying, he can. He did in college. He ran a pro-style offense. He will still run even in a pro-style offense. But the Ravens built their offense around what they did because they don't have the ability to do anything else. Their roster does not allow for any other offense to be used. They're not going to get much out of a receiver room containing an injured Rashod Bateman, Devin Duverney, and James Proche and then one good quality talent in Mark Andrews. If he's an above average passer with that situation, he will likely be a significantly above average passer in the Jets situation.

As far as resources, the majority of the jets team's cap is tied in veterans that aren't useful. The money is better spent on a QB, and most competitive teams with QBs have no problem having both the competitive roster + the QB on it. Like to put Jackson on the roster you're selling Corey Davis + Carl Lawson + Jordan Whitehead this year. That's an easy sell. And FA rarely has good players on it regardless, because good players aren't usually allowed to walk.

13945,99515,99515,NannigarCire,"mildly above average while having a below average supporting cast. His support is 1 good tight end and a bunch of rotational parts that are pieced together through injuries and bad luck. Even when he won MVP his supporting cast was very not good. It's a sign of his talent to be that good with that weak of a support.

I don't know if he'd be the same passer if he can't run, but teams are always putting a spy on the field for him and he's still outrunning them while also being an above average passer under a below average circumstance. This year it was even worse because they were using guys like Demarcus Robinson off FA, 36 year old Desean Jackson, and then horrible offensive line play due to trading away one tackle and losing the other to injury.

I genuinely think people are not doing any sort of analysis of Jackson and placing everything onto 1 player when the circumstances are clearly bad, something that also affects all the other potential QBs in this years market from Aaron Rodgers to Derek Carr to Daniel Jones just feels silly to me.

13961,99532,99532,NannigarCire,"Lets talk Derek Carr. Already talked about [Lamar](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/10eigeh/qb_weekly_megathread/j4r67v3/) and [Rodgers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/10eigeh/qb_weekly_megathread/j4wjht9/?context=3) and i'm going in order of who i personally prefer.

I used to fucking hate Derek Carr. Derek Carr was my fucking enemy. From 2014 to 2018 Derek Carr was viewed as the next Aaron Rodgers. I don't know how many of you remember this. It was very common to say he looked like a young Aaron Rodgers and had all the same talent and could make all the throws. Derek Carr even came 3rd in MVP voting in the 2016 season. [He was ranked #11 by NFL players in the NFL top 100.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lile9z7i9yM).

Lets see how Derek Carr's career compared to the average QB season and Aaron Rodgers career over the period of 2014-2018. That's five seasons.

Stat|25th Percentile|50th Percentile|75th Percentile|Aaron Rodgers 2014-18|Derek Carr 2014-18
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
YPA|6.8|7.2|7.7|7.4|6.7|
Completion %|60.3|63.4|66.1|63.7|62.8|
TD %|3.4|4.4|5.4|5.9|4.4|
Int %|2.9|2.3|1.8|1.1|1.9|
Sack %|7.5|6.1|4.6|6.6|4.8|

[Look at this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/017/thumb.png). Carr is either average or worse at anything other than not throwing interceptions or getting sacked. This was supposed to be Rodgers heir?

Here's what Carr's numbers looked like the year he was 3rd in MVP voting:

* 7.0 YPA
* 63.8 Comp Rate
* 5.0 TD Rate
* 1.1 INT Rate 
* 2.8 Sack Rate 

There ain't a damn thing here to celebrate. Below average completion. Below average yards per attempt. Just pure conservatism.

I fucking hated Derek Carr, man. The accolades were unbelievable. And there's no good reason for it. The offensive line was considered one of the best in the NFL. He was playing with Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, two college superstars. Crabtree was already having a career renaissance already when Colin Kaepernick took over for Alex Smith but a foot injury that took more than a year to recover made it seem like his career was taking a downturn too soon. There was no excuse for being this ineffective and inefficient. By the 2018 season the tide would turn on Carr, and he was no longer viewed as the elite QB in waiting. And some weird shit started happening late in 2018.

Michael Crabtree leaves the Raiders for Baltimore. Amari Cooper gets injured. The rest of the team is Jared Cook, Jordy Nelson (his ultimate season at 33 years old), UDFA Jalen Richard, and UDFA Seth Roberts. Carr's efficiency stats suddenly improve.

In 2018 he has 7.3 YPA, 68.9% completion, 3.4% TD Rate, 1.8% INT rate, and an 8.4% Sack rate. His passing effiiency improves. He gets worse at taking sacks, and his touchdown rate goes down (i think this is a dumb stat TBH anyway) but his actually per play passing improves. Why? Because he starts throwing shorter. Carr from 2014-2018 averaged about 8.5 yards per attempt. The NFL average for any QB season from 2012-2022 is 8.0. Carr is throwing at a depth around the 75th percentile on average. That year he starts throwing at...6.9 average depth of target. That's about 13th percentile. And he improves.

The next season the Raiders would drastically reshape their offense by luckily finding Darren Waller and adding slot receiver Hunter Renfrow to the offense. You know what's good about slot receivers and tight ends? They're good at taking short passes. With Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree- their game was mostly deeper down the field. With the Raiders Amari Cooper averaged an Average Depth of Target around 10.7 yards, and Crabtree around 10.8 yards. Darren Waller has averaged 9.1 and Hunter Renfrow 6.8 average depth of target. The Raiders completely revamped the focal point of their offense into two shorter passing targets. Carr's average depth of target returns to 8.5 and 8.4 in 2020 and 2021, but because the focal point of the offense is the short targets, it gets different results.

Carr's 2019-2021 are sick:

from 2019 to 2021 amongst QBs:

* 7.8 YPA
* 68.7% Comp Rate
* 4.3% TD Rate 
* 5.4% Sack Rate
* 1.9% INT Rate


Here's where those rank across those 3 years of play amongst all QBs to throw at least 400 passes from 2019-2021

* Completion % - 3rd
* YPA - 10th
* Sack Rate - 14th
* INT Rate - 15th
* TD rate - 22nd

His passing efficiency is so much higher. He becomes generally above the 75th percentile. The Raiders offense for these three years is top 8 in yards per drive twice, and once is top 8 in points per drive.

And he does this without a lot of talent. It's just Waller and Renfrow and a bunch of ancillary WRs whose career he keeps reviving. Nelson Agholor was first, coming off a terrible 400 yard season he was thrown out of Philadelphia after being a short redemption story, and has 900 yards with Derek Carr before getting a big contract from New England. Zay Jones left Buffalo as a complete and total bust. in 2021 he puts up 600 yards with Derek Carr including a 120 yard game near the end of the season and has his career revived. This year, Carr got Mack Hollins- a player who had 700 receiving yards in 5 years and Carr gets him 700 yards during the regular season. Likely reviving his career too. Henry Ruggs is here too, but he ends his own career by being a fucking moron. But it sets up the ideal situation for what Carr needs- short focal points with a deep support.

What happened this year then? Davante Adams is brought in, shouldn't that be good for Carr? It should've, but then Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow got hurt. And McDaniels decided to send Davante Adams deep. Really deep. Davante Adams career average depth of target (ADOT) is 10.7, the same place where Carr struggled with Crabtree/Cooper. In Adams best and last two years with the Packers, he had 9.7 ADOT and 8.7 ADOT. This year with the Raiders his ADOT was 12.8.

Carr is a great short passer who is very careful with the football. And the thing is, he is talented but has the mindset of a significantly less talented guy. And on top of that, he's just now hitting the peak of his career- you'll find a lot of QBs really hit their best seasons after 30. Carr is a massive buy low with upside to gain. He's in the same area of players that guys like Matthew Stafford and Kirk Cousins belong to as being in tier 2.5- guys who are not talented enough to ever challenge elite status (like tier 2 players such as Burrow/Allen/Jackson) but are far more talented than tier 3 players (Goff/Tannehill) and can sometimes perform as well as those tier 2 players. They're guys who can win a superbowl, even have a run where they are the engine for the superbowl. But just as importantly, they are engines for winning the regular season. They don't get in the way of that.


I like the idea of Carr now. I think people have highly overcorrected for their early career perception of him, and he's now deserving of actual credit and re-evaluation. It's been said before, but most of his W/L record can easily be attributed to being on the team with the 32nd ranked defense multiple times. If Lamar and Rodgers are out, Carr is the easiest buy in the world. And if the Jets are unsure whether Rodgers has more than just 1 good year left in him, Carr can easily challenge him for #2.",12.0,nyjets,t3_10eigeh,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-19T18:43:33Z,nyjets,0.0067778918591168

>poor feel for the game (running the ball on 1st down at an astronomical rate despite having probably the worst rushing offense in the league).

I'm using stathead right now on PFR. The Buccaneers ran the ball on 226 first downs compared to 290 passes on first down. 56% pass rate. They were 2nd in the league in passes on first down, and 4th lowest for runs on first down. They were #1 in the league in passing rate on first down. If we add a scoring margin to -14 to +14 (two score game), the bucs were 4th in passing on first down, and 7th least on running on 1st down. 4th best passing rate in the league on first down when the game is within 2 scores.

IDK so much about the routes thing, maybe that's true- but also Brady was undeniably given a good passing situation by being a top leader in passing on first down. And he's also 45. And he didn't look very good this year.  His balls sailed and he kept throwing short. They probably should've ran it more given that.

13990,99566,99566,NannigarCire,"Another writeup for me, let's talk Aaron Rodgers. Already posted about [Lamar](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/10eigeh/qb_weekly_megathread/j4r67v3/) earlier in this thread.

Aaron Rodgers is turning 40 next year. Despite that, two of his best ever seasons came in the last three years at 37 and 38, and he won MVP in both of them. Even this year, with Rodgers putting up his worst season since 2015, Rodgers was still Rodgers-esque. You don't watch him and see a player who can't do it anymore.

And there's a lot of similarities between his 2015 and 2022 seasons. In 2015, the Packers lost Jordy Nelson before the season started, and were left with Sophomore Davante Adams and Randall Cobb. They'd eventually pick James Jones back up off Free Agency. This was the season where Davante Adams was dreadful. It was almost certain that he was a complete and total failure of a player. His performance was so unbelievably bad. James Jones at 31 led the Packers in receiving yards. It was just an awful team. Rodgers put up the lowest YPA of his career (6.7, lower than Geno Smith's 2 seasons with the Jets and less than Zach Wilson this year) and one of the highest sack rates of his career. Rodgers was even less efficient at moving the ball that season than he was in 2022. And just as similarly, this season the Packers gave him Allen Lazard, rookie Christian Watson transitioning from Division 2 (or 3?) football, and rookie Romeo Doubs from the MWC conference, along with Randall Cobb as his main weaponry. This is a setup for failure.

Also note that if one of the greatest QBs of all time has had two awful seasons as a result of poor supporting cast, it deserves considering for every other QB. Including Lamar Jackson who people claim ""is regressing"", or Derek Carr who is claimed to be ""regressing"" or whoever. You can even dig further and deeper into it to really separate when it does and doesn't matter, but if one of the greatest QB talents of all time is affected by it, it matters. 

I'm under the belief Rodgers will bounce back next year easily, as long as he's given a better supporting cast. I think a lot of people see that too. The question for Rodgers is how many years does he have, and how worth it are they? If the choice is between 1 good year of Rodgers and 3+ years of Derek Carr, it's almost a coin flip. You have one chance to get everything and very little time to make a transition plan. But 2 years or more of Rodgers makes him a nearly automatic get. That's why personally, he's my #2 option after Lamar. You can easily transition from Rodgers if you have more than 1 year to do it.

Also, unrelated as part of evaluating Rodgers, but out of all the Quarterbacks the Jets can get Rodgers seems like the one that would be the least capable to handle the NY media. He's defensive, childish, kind of pretentious and some of his actual ideas/beliefs will run into backpages and backlash. It's sort of hard to imagine a 9/11 truther QB for the Jets. I don't care, i don't look for football guys to be anything more than football guys. But I think it's strange how i've seen posts about Lamar's social media tweeting or Carr's ""good christian"" act as signs of their inability to handle NY Media, but not this guy.

14005,99583,99583,NannigarCire,"i'm gonna post a bit about each QB as i figure out what i want to say about them. I wrote these up in context of QB seasons from 2012-2022, starting with 2012 bc that's when the Read Option transformed NFL QBs and defenses.

Lamar Jackson is most peoples #1 pick as a mix of being immediately impactful, extremely talented, and a likely long-term option. Lamar’s still young at 26, and has yet to hit what is commonly QB peak years of 30+. However, those are usually the peak years for guys who are known for their passing. Jackson’s career as a passer has been inconsistent, with his first full season as a starter having his best performance of 66% completion with 7.8 YPA while also breaking the record for most rushing yards in a season for a QB that same year. Rushing wise, he followed it up with another great year with similar efficiency (6.9 YPC vs 6.3) and in his most recent season has again been very efficient as a runner at 6.8. He’s yet to show any signs of decline in his athletic abilities. As a passer he hasn't been able to meet the 7.8 mark again (the following years were 7.3, 7.5, and now 6.9) but even so, with additional context, the 7.8 mark is hard to believe he ever hit. For the majority of Lamar Jackson’s career his supporting cast at receiver has been sub-par with exception to Mark Andrews, a strong tier 2 tight end. So to hit 7.8 with top 4 targets Mark Andrews, Marqise Brown, Hayden Hurst, and Willie Snead is absolutely lifting the quality of your offense. Same for 7.5 with a similar cast (Andrews, Brown, Rookie/injured Rashod Bateman, Washed Sammy Watkins). What’s even more surprising is that he’s around NFL average for his completion % career despite being one of the deepest constant passers in the NFL, never dropping below 8.3 ADOT in a season. So he throws far, and is still more accurate than 50% of NFL QB seasons since 2012. And his overall career YPA is above the 60th percentile when compared to individual seasons from 2012-2022, his CAREER is above 60% of individual seasons. He's efficient, effective, and dynamic. Plus he might be the best rushing QB of all time.

Lamar hasn’t had an impressive cast to work with but, as is common with any team considering extending a passer they aren’t sure about, the Ravens began to invest heavily in the position in 2021 by adding Sammy Watkins, and spending a first round pick on Rashod Bateman. Unfortunately Sammy was already dusted, and Bateman was mostly injured but they were an improvement over prior receivers and brought Lamar back to the 7.5 mark, steadily above the NFL average in passing. In his latest season, marred with contract negotiation issues, the supporting talent around Lamar took a nosedive again due to injuries and a lacking investment in WRs and Lamar regressed as a passer again. Some of the questions around Lamar remain whether he can transition into his 30s as a passer once his rushing skills began to wane, but there’s not a lot of doubt that the next three years of his career are likely to showcase the best of both worlds for him.

I'd grab Lamar in a heartbeat, even for the cost of 3 1st rounders and 2 day 2 picks. If you think that's too much, i just created a random pick generator that looks at years 2018-2021 and takes 3 random guys from the first round, and 2 random guys from the second round. No filter for picks, so 1st overalls are in here despite how unlikely the Jets are to ever have them in the next 3 years, Lamar or not. Here's 10 totally random runs, no redos.

Daniel Jones, CeeDee Lamb, Derrick Brown, Marlon Davidson, J.K. Dobbins

Payton Turner, Montez Sweat, Austin Jackson, Connor Williams, Marlon Davidson

Mekhi Becton, Zaven Collins, Trevor Lawrence, Deebo Samuel, Taylor Rapp

Rashan Gary, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Daniel Jones, Trayvon Mullen, Jawaan Taylor

Alijah Vera-Tucker, Brian Burns, Frank Ragnow, Lonnie Johnson Jr., Sean Murphy-Bunting

Derrick Brown, Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, Noah Igbinoghene, Kyle Trask, D.K. Metcalf

Not counting the one that involves Lamar Jackson, only 2 runs are better than trading for Lamar (the DJ/CeeDee/Derrick Brown/Dobbins and Lawrence/Zaven/Deebo run). 2 out of 10.

If you believe the cap is too much, Jets can probably expect about 36m hit this year for Lamar. That's Carl Lawson + Corey Davis + Jordan Whitehead. If you'd rather have those 3 players than Lamar Jackson, idk what to say. At some point you gotta get good players, and Lamar is one of the goodest at his position.",13.0,nyjets,t3_10eigeh,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-17T12:17:49Z,nyjets,0.013662207451587
14006,99586,99586,NannigarCire,"for a young long-term QB 3 firsts is fine. jets are unlikely to have any 1st round pick in the top 10 with Lamar and probably even outside the top 16. Those picks each have less than like 30% chance to hit for an average GM so they're at most giving up 2 starters (who may not even be elite, just starters). You can throw in 1 day two pick if you want as well since that's like a 20% hit. I think he's likely to net 2 firsts and probably a day 2 pick or two. Russell Wilson got 2 firsts and 2 2nds and i think he was, at the time, perceived a lot better than Lamar is right now.

i swear to god someone is going to reply to this with something like 'Russell Wilson!! now i definitely don't want lamar"" and i'm going to go joker

*to fully extrapolate this idea, i just created a small random draft pick thing where i took the last 4 years of draft classes from 2018-2021 (no 2022 bc unknowns) and took the first round players, and second round players and randomly selected 3 from the first round and 2 from the second round. This is like a worst case scenario trade. No filters at all, so even top 10 picks (that the jets are unlikely to have) are still in here. So heree's what you're potentially missing out on, five runs:

First run: Derrick Brown, Kenneth Murray, Josh Rosen, Ben Benogu, Deebo Samuel.

Second run: Trevor Lawrence, Rashaad Penny, Noah Igbinoghene, Levi Onwuzurike, Nasir Adderley

Third run: Justin herbert, Eric Stokes, Isaiah Wynn, Javonte Williams, Shaquille Leonard

fourth run: Rashaan Evans, Austin jackson, Justin Jefferson, Dante Pettis, Nick Chubb

fifth run: Kaleb McGary, Eric Stokes, Javon Kinlaw, Asante Samuel Jr., Darrell Taylor

14007,99587,99587,NannigarCire,"i was referring to the relationship between QB Talent to rest of team talent, elite QB talent means you can afford less talent elsewhere, and as you go down in QB talent you need more talent elsewhere etc. I don't prefer Jags and lamar, but this also isn't an either/or. Any team that pays their starting QB has to continuously draft well, play contracts intelligently, and continue bringing in talent. I don't want JAGs and Lamar, but having Lamar is also how you get veteran FAs to want to come here as a last effort to go to a superbowl- which is a highly valuable thing the Jets have not been able to get.

and you're not forgoing the chance to have either, what you're giving up is 2 chances of doing so out of 6 picks the Jets have this year and some amount of FA that would've otherwise been spent on a random guy. In the first round that's the 13th pick, which is well otuside the elite prospect range (so like a 35% chance of them being a hit maybe?) And in FA that's probably not an elite guy either, but an above average to below average starter- because very few good players are even in FA to start with. And if a truly good FA is there, and they're looking at the Jets without a worthwhile QB, why would they come here instead of the chiefs/cowboys/whoever has cap space that is also coming out of the playoffs? Like this is the problem the jets had the last few years, there's no reason for good players to come here, so they were overpaying.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10dolj5,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-16T16:56:56Z,nyjets,0.0224044451722324
14008,99588,99588,NannigarCire,"But you're screwed in a different way, because they're less talented. They're worse players. You need a higher threshold of talent supporting them to be a year-in, year-out playoff/SB competitor than you do with Lamar, as is shown by the Ravens roster.

>O Line is no longer a disaster. We improve the safety spot, and augment the coverage ability of our LBs. We take more shots in the draft, theoretically augmenting our cost controlled core. You have signifigantly more cap space in the Summer '24, when once again there will be a qb musical chairs situations again, and you have less glaring holes on your roster.

how? Like, how would the team suddenly fix all of these holes in one offseason without accruing any new ones? is there some history or proof that teams just get better every year and never get worse or stay the same? In this scenario you're hoping that something like 7 new player acquisitions all turn out for the best with 1 of them being a first round, probably 1 big FAs and thats the only ones that Lamar Jackson's contract stops. And that's without even accouting for the talent the Jets will lose over the next 2 years due to aging out/contract disputes (Elijah moore will near certainly be leaving and need replacement) And in that scenario, you're hoping for a 80% hit rate on those players just to what? grab the next veteran who is worse than lamar?

I think that's far less likely than paying off Lamar to get a 100% certain hit at the most individually impactful position, while using all the other resources to still attack the same positions. Like what exactly is the %age loss for a competitive jets team to choose at pick 13-24 for the next 3 years vs not picking there and just having lamar jackson?

to me, i can't get behind any of this idea because it's a boat vs mystery box scenario. like this is an idea i understand for Carr/Garappolo, or even Rodgers due to age concerns. There's a big trade off there, but for Lamar? Unless you think Lamar is outside the top 12 QBs and is extermely unlikely to be a top 5 QB, it's hard to agree with any of it- and personally i think he currently is top 8 and very easily could be seen as top 3 in a situation that is very good around him.",1.0,nyjets,t3_10dolj5,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-16T16:29:04Z,nyjets,0.047626430526528

He's not unique in being catered to other than having a unique set of talents. And i don't know what they figured out, Lamar last year put up 7.5 YPA which is just around 75th percentile for league YPA with 64% completion which is just around 65th percnetile while having an awful supporting cast. And then this year, with an even worse supporting cast, his passing efficiency went down but his rushing efficiency returned to the same levle it was when he was MVP.

If 'catering an offense to him' is making guys like Demarcus Robinson and Patrick Ricard play >50% of the snaps then this is a very bad catering job imo. it's more likely they were hitching their wagon to Lamar saving an offense that was lacking the talent to do anything else",1.0,nyjets,t3_10dolj5,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-16T15:50:10Z,nyjets,0.0229565013885498
14010,99590,99590,NannigarCire,"Within the playoffs team have the ability to hone in and focus all resources on containing a teams main engine. it's why Sanchez had great playoff games and bad regular seasons. hyper-fixating on playoff games when the players in question are on flawed teams and being asked to make a pieced together offense work is silly to me, it's over-emphasizing 6 games he's played in a career that currently contains 76, especially in a scenario where the talent divide between teams significantly lessens and the flaws become extremely visible.

The idea that a guy who is used to playing hero ball for an entire season would suddenly turn it off when it's carried him all the way there because in a surprise turn of events, some of his players were actually performing for once, isn't very realistic when you can bet the entire week of practice leading up to it was likely based on Lamar being a hero.

I also think it's obvious that Lamar is not in the tier 1 of QBs (the one that used to contain all the elite QBs but now only contains Patrick Mahomes and no one else), so the thought of him having flaws is not an issue. All the tier 2 Qbs, Lamar, Allen, Burrow, and Herbert if you want to include him have significant flaws in their game that keep them out of elite, cause them to have drop-dead awful games sometimes, but also have strengths that allow them to be extremely competitive and SB hopefuls year in and year out. In the past guys like Rivers, Romo, Roethlisberger all fell into this group and all of them were prone to some of the most boneheaded 4 INT games ever seen.

If the goal is to wait for a tier 1 QB to be available, it is never happening. The tier 1 QBs who enter FA are either unknown as Tier 1 guys (Brees) or guys who are too old to sure what their quality is (Brady, Rodgers).

He tries to play hero ball when the game gets away from him and ends up making poor decisions, throwing off time (usually too late), rushing through his mechanics (too many inaccurate passes in playoff games), 

all of this is just...so not good at evaluating whats happening. How is Lamar playing hero ball if his starting receivers in the playoffs the last time he played were Mark Andrews (good), Marqise Brown (good enough), and then Willie Snead, Miles Boykin, Patrick Ricard, and the ghost of Dez Bryant. What is the methodical non-hero approach to running an offense like this? Lamar had to rush for 140 yards for the Ravens to take out the Titans that year. Without the hero game, they lose. Has Lamar been in a situation with the Ravens to be able to not play hero? He had as many carries in that playoff game as the Ravens RBs. It's not on Lamar that his team has not had enough support for him, they've tried to with Dobbins + Bateman + Watkins, but injuries have kept that from happening so he's left with the aforementioned cast of sub par support.

Yes, you'll have to lose first round picks to get Lamar and that will make some of the team-building more difficult but the Jets are currently stacked with young talent and alternatively, not getting a QB at all will just waste them altogether.

2016 - 10-3 Raiders played 1 cold weather game in Kansas City, Carr had a bad game. It was the best KC defensive performance of the year.

in 2021 7-7 raiders played an outdoor game vs the above average browns D Browns at 40 degrees. Carr put up 236 yards on 38 attempts (6.2 YPA, very weak) with 1 TD and 1 INT. the passing yards were about average for what the browns allowed that year to QBs. Raiders didn't play anymore outdoor cold games. *I forgot they played an outdoor playoff game against the Bengals in the playoffs that year. Carr had a below average game, 300+ yards but on 50~ attempts, a full yard per attempt under the average for what the Bengals were allowing that season. I'd say it's a bad game. Vs the Browns, the raiders won, vs the Bengals, they lost by 1 score. Carr had the team at the 9 yard line on the final drive of the game but couldn't finish, got INTd on a pass to Zay Jones.

There are some notable statistics and expectations when players change teams and the impact that has in their first year vs second year, for example most elite players who change teams at any position experience a regressive year in their first season with a new team and then continue on their old path in their second year (Cousins and Brady both had this happen) but neither of that has anything to do with whether or not they will win a Superbowl.",9.0,nyjets,t3_109fqgj,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2023-01-11T15:57:08Z,nyjets,-0.0754004993998628

I find both ideas presented here to be very strange. Geno Smith's Jets tenure wasn't him ""missing on poor timing"", it was the players he was surrounded by being terrible. Geno was good at throwing to Decker and Harvin, he was bad throwing at David Nelson and Jeff Cumberland. And at the same time, Justin Fields is bad at throwing to Velus Jones, Equanimous St. Brown, Dante Pettis, Byron Pringle etc. It's a highly assumptive blame to say the QB is out of time/place and not the WRs, because you are assuming the WR is actually in the right time and place when you do so but with a WR room full of cast offs and generally not good players, why? Why assume that?

14078,99666,99666,NannigarCire,"I'm gonna post a bit about Derek Carr, because i do think he's a good option for the Jets if Rodgers/Jackson are not available.

from 2014-2017, Carr was considered some MVP potential guy who was cmparable to Aaron Rodgers. This was ridiculous because he was putting up horrible efficiency, completely substandard QB play for a guy playing with Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree.

But from 2018 onwards, his offense doesn't look very good and suddenly his efficiency in every way became...so much better. 2018 is Cooper's last season with the raiders, he only plays 6 games but Carr puts together a 69% completion with 7.3 YPA throwing mostly very short passes to Jared Cook, Jordy Nelson in the final year of his career at 33 years old, UDFA RB Jalen Richard, and UDFA WR Seth Roberts. this is what people think Daniel Jones has done this year, but Jones isn't even close to getting this yardage efficiency. From there onwards, his efficiency goes insane. 

From 2019 to 2021 amongst QBs:

* 68.7% completion
* 7.8 YPA
* 5.4% Sack Rate
* 1.9% INT Rate

I'm avoinding TD Rate because i think its a dumb stat, but he's at 4.3%.

Here's where those rank across those 3 years of play amongst all QBs to throw at least 400 passes from 2019-2021

* Completion % - 3rd
* YPA - 10th
* Sack Rate - 14th
* INT Rate - 15th
* TD rate - 22nd

Also, for a general Raiders offensive health:

Year|Stat|Rank
:--:|:--:|:--:
2019|Yards Per Drive|6th
2019|Points Per Drive|19th
2020|Yards Per Drive|5th
2020|Points Per Drive|8th
2021|Yards Per Drive|13th
2021|Points Per Drive|17th

So the Raiders offense overall has been very good at moving the ball, and had a very unlucky scoring season in 2019 but otherwise has been on par. Also, the Raiders have been consistently one of the worst fumble teams in the league over this time. Bottom 5 in fumbles per drive in 2020 and 2021, bottom 16 in 2019. Derek Carr is a big reason for that, he's tied for 5th in the league over that period for QB fumbles with Josh Allen and Kirk Cousins. This is one place where he's to blame.

THe majority of Carr's improvements came from him throwing shorter as the Raiders changed their game from the intermediate/deep threats of Amari Cooper/Michael Crabtree to the shorter YAC game heavily utilizing Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow. While the rest of the cast was kind of shitty. Nelson Agholor, Zay Jones, Bryan Edwards, Tyrell Williams all had very prominent roles on this team and Carr revived Zay Jones and Nelson Agohlors careers. Agholor's final PHI season was a pathetic 400 yards, immediately followed up by a career-high 900 yards with Carr that led to him getting a big payday with the Patriots. And i think everyone remembers the league laughing at Zay Jones/Christian Kirk contracts the Jaguars gave out, and it was Carr that helped Zay Jones gets his when Zay got 120 yards on 10 targets against the Colts in Week 17 of 2021.

Clearly Carr fits into an offense that utilizes a heavy short-game relying on YAC that also has ancillary deep threats (rather than focal points, ala Amari Cooper) who he can exploit when they're open- as he did with Nelson Agholor, Zay Jones, and Henry Ruggs before he ended his own career. It's very unsurprising that in a season where Darren Waller is mostly injured and playing less than 50% of the snaps in 5 out of 8 games he's active for this year, while Hunter Renfrow is also only active for 9 games and playing 3 of them with less than 50% of the snaps, that Carr's not adjusting well to it. 

Davante Adams is playing his age 30 season as the entire focal point of the passing offense.  And much like Amari Cooper, Adams is being used as a downfield role with a career high 12.7 Average depth of target, not far off from what the Raiders were doing with Amari Cooper when Carr was struggling with his efficiency then. Adams career average depth of target before this season was 10.4, and his two best receiving yardage seasons in 2020/2021 had him below 10 (8.7 in 2020, 9.7 in 2021).

OCs, QB coaches so on can only help but can not do for them. There probably is a training and development program they could’ve utilized to better prepare him for a career as an NFL QB, so they can’t be blameless for not doing so- but to me the priority for that still falls on the QB themselves. I don’t think coaches in the NFL are miracle workers or able to make guys who suck into good players, most guys who are good in the NFL are also good in college so on and so forth. But certainly, at some point, none of these guys knew how to do anything and someone taught them. So I’m not throwing out the idea that coaches can help, but I can’t take it away from the QBs shoulders that they have a responsibility for their own development that super-cedes the coaching staffs responsibility to develop them.

14097,99687,99687,NannigarCire,"Not really, his season is pretty ~~bad~~ mediocre. He's got the lowest ADOT in the league, is league average in amount of interceptable throws, so he's throwing conservatively and still getting tons of potential INTs but leads the league in lowest INT rate...huge luck for him. His ""plumbers"" are guys from extremely talented teams, and because he's throwing underneath all game, teams aren't really going to stop him. It's not much different than how Mike White was winning. But then Jones on top of that, has one of the worst sack rates in the league despite being a checkdown heavy short passer.

Like i don't know what about him makes people think he'd be good with better WRs, but when he did have better WRs, he was still bad. He's just never had a single good passing career ever. Not even in college. He's not a talented QB. His arm is kind of mediocre. He has surprising athleticism for someone who looks like such a dork. But he's completely behind the curve in every single way. Like again, if the Giants didn't have a winning record, no one would even consider Daniel Jones to be a QB option.

14098,99688,99688,NannigarCire,"Carr's a better option than Brady or Daniel Jones, by miles. One of them is washed, the other has never in their career of either College or NFL had a good season as a passer. And i'd consider trading for him if it's possible to do with only one 1st rounder. Cap space or not, he's been a very good passer in the league for three of the last four years with an insanely high 67% comp, 2.1% INT, 7.6 YPA, and 5.4% sack rate- which includes his shitty down year this time around. All of those numbers are above the league average for the last four years which is: 65% comp, 2.2% INT, 7.3 YPA, and 6.4% sack rate. Two of his last four seasons hit an insane 7.9 YPA, which is very impressive even for players with a talented team. There's only like two guys who have hit that mark at all in the last four years and aren't considered ""good"" QBs, and that's Jimmy G and Tannehill. Who will also likely be on the market. Everyone else is either elite or a franchise QB- Mahomes, Tua, Allen, Prescott, Cousins, etc. You could probably argue Carr is in the same space as Cousins as this sort of uninspiring but fully capable player.

And unfortnately, although he has what i consider Bad Brain disease- he is an insanely talented player who refuses to really play like it for most of his career. At least under Gruden he seemed to let go of his worst instincts and play more loosely, leading to those high statistics, but he's a firmly tier 2.5 player who isn't much different than Stafford was on the Lions. There's still a non-zero chance that Carr entering his early 30's (where often QBs actually tend to peak) will finally let go. IDK. It's weird to think he has upside, but anyone who hasn't seen him throw might not realize that he's able to hit some insane ones. He just has the stupidest conservative mindset.

I also just...don't understand how people keep putting Daniel Jones on this pedestal. If the Giants weren't winning, no one would care.

Anyway, Keelan Cole came into the league as a UDFA for a pretty solid Jaguars receiver room in 2017. It contained Allen Robinson, Marqise Lee, Allen Hurns, Dede Westbrook- a lot of guys who had either draft capital placed onto them or had already shown some real production. Cole was himself an elite producer at KY Wesleyan (Cole, in his best season, was 60.7% of his team's passing offense. 99th percentile amongst WRs since like 2010). He got lucky to get onto the field for Jaguar's offense in 2017 as basically everyone besides Marqise Lee got injured. He'd end the season with 2 games of over 100 yards, [including one that went for 180](https://youtu.be/ZOx1B3HwysQ). At the start of next year, he looked fantastic with a 116-yard game that included this [killer highlight catch](https://youtu.be/z7cX9WRaWx0) and seemed like he was about to break into a rare group of great UDFA WRs. But then Jaguar's offense started getting bad, and Cole went through a three-week slump of drops and bad play. And suddenly he was benched. He'd never really make a lot of noise again but keeps hanging around the league.

Quincy Enunwa is another weird one. I love the guy and thought he was incredible as a prospect. Drafted by the Jets in the sixth round of 2014. He was a late breakout in college who only really did his damage as a senior, generally a bad sign, but at 6'2 225, running a 4.45 he was a weapon. But he was very raw. His rookie season was spoiled by an accusation of Domestic Abuse, that was later dropped, which led to him being sort of put on the end of a roster containing no one special beyond Eric Decker. It's pretty likely that if he was active in 2014, he gets a lot of playing time. But The Jets didn't expect much out of him at that point, they basically were fine assuming he wasn't gonig to be a significant contributer going forward, Jets even drafted Devin Smith in the 2nd round. They don't do that thinking that Enunwa is going to be an important piece for the future. 2015 comes around, Marshall is brought in, and Decker is healthy after a season of being in and out of the lineup in 2014. They stay healthy all year and maintain the outside spots, and Quincy is slowly eased into the offense over time. He's barely used for most of this season, save for randomly getting 10 targets against Philadelphia. But with low expectations and low pressure, there's not much to be upset about for his play. He's the #3 on an offense with a clear #1 and #2. Then comes 2016. Marshall has hit the age apex. Decker is injured. Quincy is thrust into the role in year 3. 2 years of completely low-pressure development. Quincy...turns the fuck on. Getting the ball to Quincy becomes a priority. He can make amazing plays happen out of nowhere. This [70 yarder on a random curl vs the Ravens.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lshokI5OBzM), this [Beautiful catch and juke vs the Browns](https://youtu.be/Avi2nbCU5IQ), and this [skillful highlight touchdown against the Patriots.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgJuK6UuvMo). Quincy is a potential god. Injuries derail what is looking like a very bright future.

Cole was placed in a high-pressure do-or-die situation early on as a rookie, easily swam, but was completely replaced after just a short stretch of bad play in year 2. The lack of investment and subsequent substandard play on a team that desperately needed it in 2018 led the Jaguars to bench one of the most promising UDFAs ever. Unclear if a greater investment and commitment to him would've led to a much different career for the guy. Meanwhile, Enunwa was given low pressure, had the 4-year contract commitment due to being drafted, and had a long time before his number was called to show up. Despite being drafted to a barren team, and mostly because of luck. If Enunwa was forced to play more for the 2014 team, there's a good chance his inconsistencies that showed up in the 2015 season would have been much more costly and resulted in a significantly worse perception of him as a player. Even in 2015, i remember defending Enunwa and getting a DM when he dropped a pass in week 16 asking how can i stand to defend someone who plays this badly? Yeah, people really do that.

I think people see coaches as being like seers or something sometimes, but I'm willing to bet they don't see anything more than we do although they have the tools to mold and shape what they see more than any of us do. And because of that, they're just as biased in their initial perceptions vs their reaction to their initial perceptions and so on. You know, a first-rounder struggles in their first year and they're right back on the field in year 2. A UDFA struggles in their first year, and they're likely to get cut. And there are players whose college careers do not back up giving them more opportunities, even for a first-round pick, while there are UDFAs and very late guys whose college careers do give a lot of reason for optimism.

This leads me to someone like Isaiah Hodgins. I like Isaiah Hodgins, I tried trading for him for years in my very deep dynasty. I finally got him this year off the waivers. We use contracts in my league, and get 1 contract extension to use on a player off waivers each year. Between Greg Dortch (also a huge fan of), Justin Watson, and Isaiah Hodgins, I picked Hodgins. This was in week 10. Hodgins just played 1 game for the Giants, 1 game for the Bills, and spent the rest of the season inactive. Hodgins missed his rookie year due after being drafted in the 6th round by the Buffalo Bills to a shoulder injury he sustained in the preseason. Gabriel Davis was the other day 3 rookie they drafted, similar build and use as Hodgins- and he got the shoo-in from there. Davis sustained his momentum in year 2, plus they brought in Emmanuel Sanders which further pushed Hodgins down the depth chart as the Bills wanted to make a real run for the championship. In year 3, he was just the odd man out with Davis performing, Diggs at the top, McKenzie playing slot, with Crowder brought in to back that up, and then new fourth-rounder Khalil Shakir blowing up the camp. Between him and the remaining receivers, Jake Kumerow, also a similar body and usefulness had special teams ability so he was kept. Hodgins ends up on waivers mid-season, and with the Giants struggling and their GM + HC both having Bills familiarity with Hodgins, they brought him in and nearly immediately placed him on the field. Hodgins was a killer player in college. He was 40% of his passing offense at Oregon State (85th percentile), broke out as a significant contributor at a young age (19), and was an early declare for the NFL. These are the stats of an NFL WR hit, most players who hit in the NFL have these traits. Yet when talking about the talent around the Giants, Hodgins is treated as a practice squad player. The initial perception of him seems to be the biggest reason why. 

Development, luck, player careers...it's kind of random. There are a lot of great players or HOF-would-be's whose likeliest biggest reasons for not making it are just randomness, and not because of injuries. The idea of a meritocracy within the NFL is just an idea, the flow of money and jobs being on the line means that teams have a lot of other factors for why/who they choose to play. And in a way, guys like Mike White and Zach Wilson are also victims/beneficiaries somewhat. I don't believe you should sit a QB, but it's undeniable that playing more is the only way to get better. I think Kevin Durant said this about Lamar Odom, that he's not a bust because he was just injured. You can't be a bust if you never really get to play. There's probably a lot of pretty good players who aren't thought to be as much because they don't get to play enough to prove it.

14108,99699,99699,NannigarCire,"This is a good post about the Jets free agency, and i mostly agree. Although the Jets should keep Berrios because i think people are misevaluating him having a season where none of his dynamo is showing as him being bad suddenly. Last year it just hit more often, but he's still just as dynamic. It happens. However, it's very funny how people other than you tend to think about Free Agency because the basic premise of free agency is that the team the player was on didn't think the player was worth keeping. There are so few good players on FA, if you can find anything that isn't actively bad on it, you've done enough. Fans make it worse by trying to calculate the amount of money being paid to players sometimes when they analyze it, but then forget to calculate (or rather, can't) the actual desire of players to come play here which would've been a huge factor in the quality of players to begin with and are the reason the Jets pay heavily for some mid to low-tier talent.

Anyway, it was a good FA class, and Tomlinson is really the disappointment. But Tomlinson has played well in the past, and there's a chance he'll play well next year.

Daniel Jones currently averages 6.4 air yards per attempt. Lowest in the league amongst starters. basically a checkdown heavy player. Despite being a checkdown heavy player, he's league average for turnover worthy plays (according to PFF), but leads the league in lowest INT rate. Guess what that means, he's getting very INT lucky this year.

But there's more! On top of being very checkdown heavy, he's holding the ball 35th longest in the league. And here's the funny thing with that, he's also got the 7th highest sack rate in the league. Here's the funnier thing about it- that's common for him in every season of his career! At this moment his season-long YPA is no different than any other year of his career, so he's playing exactly as efficiency as he was before with only one difference, he's running the ball more, and he is to his credit a pretty good runner.

IDK if this is really important. Matt Ryan's college stats were not dominant, and in fact he only had one good year as a senior, he's a pretty great player. Mahomes at Texas Tech had a losing record (and it was used against him in the draft process).

>I also don’t know why he’s excused for the two other years he had that were completely below average.

on this though, Wilson's first year is pretty good. He started 7 games as an 18-year-old freshman, and put up a fantastic 66% completion with 8.7 YPA. Those are good numbers. The sophomore is a downer year but the offseason going into it he had a shoulder surgery on a torn labrum (iirc), which has killed a few QBs that are better than him.

I also didn't see him live, only in cutups leading up the draft, and i just thought he was a fine prospect, not special like the Mormon Mahomes nickname but not much different than most 1st round prospects. The deep balls were less than they were sold but the quick release, movement, avoidance, and abilities to read around the field were promising for a 20 year old. And Wilson did shred the competition he faced, his season is insane 73.5%, 11.0 YPA, only 3 interceptions on 336 passes. Yeah, looking at it you can find jump balls that receivers took away for sure, they did build a good jump ball team with tall guys even if they aren't special and, not to compare, but because i recall these arguments around Mahomes time about air raid, big-12 competition, so on and so forth, like these reasons as ""the reason"" fall sort of flat. I think so far the only thing that can convince me of my own miss of Wilson is not properly valuing the size of his pockets at BYU since that is the only major difference and his fear of getting hit has been shown over and over

*let me put it this way about competition, there is probably a greater margin of difference between LSU Justin Jefferson + Jamarr Chase + Terrace Marshall and every single defender they faced in Burrow's final year, than there was between Dax Milne + Gunner Romney + Neil Pa'u and every defender they faced in Zach's year. Just as mucha s Zach's destroying inferior NFL talent, he's playing with inferior NFL talent too. Did any of that BYU OL get drafted either?

14139,99732,99732,NannigarCire,"Idk where adjusted accuracy under pressure is from or why it would matter, every statistical regression that’s been done for future predictive value has found performance under pressure to be valueless compared to not under pressure which makes sense considering QBs are not under pressure about 90% of games. I also don’t buy this competition argument bc there are not a small amount of guys in the NFL who have seen moderate to extreme success coming from extremely bad (Romo, garoppolo) or overpowered programs (Wentz) in recent history. the bigger receivers argument has some potential merit but even then the guys he played with are all sub-200 pound guys who aren’t even significantly tall at WR minus Neil Pa’u who wasn’t used any more significantly than any of the other players on that team. Like is having Gunner Romney, a guy who didn’t even make it onto an NFL praxtice squad the reason Zach hit 75% completion?

To me all of these are circumstantial pieces of information that are better used as descriptors of why things may have happened than actual reasons for why he played so well the final year of college play.

He's also been on teams that are constantly bottom 8 on defense, both in yards and points allowed during these last 5 years. Multiple times bottom 3, even. This has been an awful team and now it's coached by one of the worst coaches in football in McDaniels. Carr's had two years in his career where his defense was top 16 (not top 8, just top 16) and in one they went 7-9, Carr was ok, the other 12-3 with Carr as the starter and Carr was 3rd in MVP voting (highly undeserved imo). But the guy would be an automatic 9-12 win with the current Jets. It's almost unquestionable. His lapses in judgment are not ideal but not uncommon in players that are firmly in the tier 2/3 of QBs, who can forget Tony Romo, Philip Rivers, or Ben Roethlisberger putting up random 3-4 interception games once or twice a season. It's not the end of the world, and with a defense that's good at getting the ball back there's a good chance of the Jets surviving those.

This late in his career, and not really likely to get a huge payoff- Carr has a chance of taking less than the top market value for QBs which opens up more money to re-sign defenders and keep adding FAs to what should be one of the most attractive FA teams this yaer. That's a huge success by Douglas, considering where we were the last 2 years.

They don't run this defense often enough in this game for me to clearly get it even in retrospect, i think this was the only time they ran it.

IMO Moore's open because the Cloud defender over him is completely turned around. if you throw a medium pass over there, you hit Moore on the sideline because you're exploiting the depth of the cloud drop against the timing of the wheel- he's so far off that the wheel has an opening if you throw it with a lot of anticipation and the cross will pull (and does pull) the cloud over and turns his back to the wheel, making him out of position to cleanly recover. At least that's how i view it, but honestly i can't say for sure if that's right or wrong.

I also don't think the completion % is a good barometer of that, last year he was averaging 8 air yards per pass (23rd in the league amongst multiple game starters) and now he's averaging 9.5 air yards per pass (6th in the league amongst multiple game starters). Your completion percentage drops as you throw deeper. That's just how it goes for most guys.

I also see a lot of those same issues, but last year they were even worse. He is better than last year. And a lot of these things, like processing, he's met an NFL threshold for. I don't really care about the standard of him being the #2 overall pick. Like, that doesn't matter anymore. The cost is already paid. So it's just about evaluating his play, regardless of the context of how he was acquired. He should be doing better because he's far too athletic to be unable to make an accurate pass just because his base is wide etc

i just watched a lot of videos of people talking about it. i don't know how correct i am about a lot of stuff which is why i mention when i don't know things, but there used to be a lot of videos of NFL players talking about how to do things, coaching clinics you could watch, ex-nfl players teaching mechanics. Larry Fitzgerald has some fantastic videos on how a WR should run a curl route for example. Then i started searching for ex-NFL guys who were talking about the game and reading their stuff to understand what was going on, and eventually when you just watch stuff and try to analyze it you're forced to figure out.

Not having the context of how other QBs play shows up in his work constantly as he is just writing from the hip on what good/bad plays are based on what he sees from other jets QBs, most of whom have been bad. His missed Moore analysis here shows the lacking imagination/context because he’s talking about the corner needing to peel off Garrett but in a cover-3 that corner was always going to be held by Garrett because that’s what they’re taught to do against the vertical stems. So when the safety rotates off the *right hash vertical, that’s all the tell the QB needed that he needs to start a soft drift towards the right to make time because the only player carrying Moore is a damn Linebacker. And because the safety is the one rotating that means the outsid CB is going cloud while the slot CB is going flat (IE will not be following Moore). *and if there's any thought that he might carry Moore, White should check it and once he sees that he isn't, know that he's got a play available.

14173,99767,99767,NannigarCire,"almost did a full writeup on Mike White's game this week but i don't feel like it- but here's a quick breakdown; it was bad. From the first drive in the game the Buffalo defense had White so confused on what to do that he was just missing reads left and right. And it's not like they're running something intensely difficult to comprehend, it's just not as obvious on the pre-snap as the Vikings and Bears were. Missed players over the middle when the MOF was completely empty, forced throws and checkdowns, it just wasn't pretty at all. His accuracy was better in this game than in games prior but his mental game was just as weak and it's clearly his achilles heel. His internal clock is too fast very often and when protection does hold up and allow for opportunities to build down the field, he doesn't take advantage of it- and that's before he took a hit in this game so it's not from a buildup of that. He almost plays to not lose more than he plays to win. 

He's going to continuously put up stats but a lot of them are going to be empty because how much of it falls short of the mark he's trying to reach. As the players on the field don't turn short gains into huge YAC, he's not putting together great games. His YPA has dipped twice below the 7 mark and it's dropping immensely. but he keeps putting the offense in a position to create something for itself, and that's really all that can be said. And in this game he threw even shorter on average than he did in Chicago, going from 5.8 air yards per attempt, to 5.3. The Bills just had his brain completely picked. They ran a mostly cover-3 zone, with some cover-1 man and cover-2 zone mixed in, but would rotate their safeties and not show who is in the flat and who is going intermediate and he just couldn't take advantage.

i think if the Jets want to keep using him, they have to find a way to put Moore in the position for quick throws underneath to add a dynamic player down there. Because having him throw to knight and carter and conklin and other checkdown options whose main open field ability is to hope the defense forgot about them is not adding anything to this offense.",6.0,nyjets,t3_zlo2h4,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-12-14T17:47:46Z,nyjets,0.0352017600081005

I agree though like it's not bad to be a system QB, every QB is in some way highly affected by the system and supporting cast around him.

I didn't say it's decided post-snap. It's clearly part of the pre-snap decision. And his decision to run the drop he did, SHOWS what his first read was tied to, which was Ty Johnson. which he chooses to do, not the OC. The OC can suggest what the first read should be based on the coverage, but the QB decides the reads himself based on what they believe is happening.

both takes on him not expecting to have time on it, or not actually having time for it- are based on something he COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN at the time of setting his pre-snap decision. Whether it was a risky play is something he could have known but again there is no reason to credit this as a big A+ for not CHECKING IT.

14199,99796,99796,NannigarCire,"no, it probably isn't made 90% of the time. 90% of players don't contort their body in the opposite direction of their momentum to catch the low ball. the standard for the WR in the NFL is not even close to that high. it's a very tough play to make and i don't understand where any concept of this being an easy one to do comes from. it is very difficult. not a 90% catch rate. There are i think 5 plays where a similarly positioned ball is thrown at a Jets WR and i don't think a single one of them was caught. a large amount of players will probably just let this hit the ground altogether because they will not be quick enough to recognize the balls trajectory against their momentum, or move their body quickly enough, or finish the play. and again, it's the only placement that allows Hicks to make a play on the ball. There are better placements and they were available. It's on White. Berrios could catch it. But he also could've just let the ball sail behind and not even tried, which would've made it more obvious- it's the fact that he put in that insane effort to almost catch the ball that even makes it possible to blame him. It's like when a defender misses a tackle after coming all the way from the other side of the field- they're lucky to even have made it there in the first place.

IMO Kendricks (the LB under moore) wouldn't have time to undercut it, it would be a very close play where he'd be somewhere in the vicinity but an on time pass would not lead to him getting there. he still has a lot of ground to cover before he will make it to Wilson. But again- even if he ended up seeing that the linebacker was coming, White never even attempts to recognize this event. He is already pre-determinately going towards Ty Johnson. 

[Here's the exact moment the ball has left the hands of White (the end of his throwing motion)](https://imgur.com/2FgTJIB). The time is there. There is a chance it wouldn't be, lets even pretend it wasn't there, but the way White plays this he never has a chance to figure out. He also doesn't have to run a quick drop. He can go deeper, because the drop depth is based on his decision to pre-determinately go to the shorter route. If he wanted to read Wilson, he could extend his drop. And all of this goes back to the main criticism- his conservatism leaves these plays unexplored. Ty Johnson was always going to be there. But he never thought about seeing what the other option provided.

>I’m sure you could cherry pick examples of everything,

trying to imagine what gotcha this is trying to make out and what i'm imagining is someone believing there's a conspiracy i'm creating to contrive a totally false narrative on an otherwise great QB.

> Do you think by looking elsewhere that defender somehow drifts so far to the inside that he’s out of position?

i have no idea. I don't know. There's a lot of subjectivity in this play. I'm noticing it as part of a bigger pattern of his eyes being quick to stare at the target, and that leading defenders who watch the QB to react to it. If he's not watching, i don't know what the CB would do. He might do nothing. But the point isn't that White is why this play doesn't finish (i agree that Conklin's depth might play a part in that), it's that White could've added something to this play by using that but he didn't. And it's not an isolated incident. I can imagine how you believe this isn't a 'fair criticism' if you think this is the only play i can find of it. But I chose it because it's an interesting what-if. [The Harrison Smith near INT in the 4th Q is just a more egregious one that is undeniable, but that's boring for analysis.](https://imgur.com/SigCUaC) I like to choose plays where something as mundane as just looking off a bit more could've resulted in a much larger chain of events occurring because it expresses the immense subtlety and difficulty of the QB position much better than just visceral obvious events.",5.0,nyjets,t3_zdlht9,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-12-05T19:44:12Z,nyjets,0.0146771991233868
14200,99797,99797,NannigarCire,">I don't like the framing. You invite comparison but you don't say what it takes to be ""a QB"" so it's a straw man argument.

i don't follow what you're saying here. there's no set criteria for being a QB- the QBs skills are all based on their relationship to each other and no specifically rigidly defined critiera will help make it clear. White's pocket presence means he needs less athleticism because he is rarely off balance. His quick decision making in the short game means he needs less throwing power since he throws early and on time. so on so on. you can't just like, make a checklist. everything occurs in relationship to each other.

>Because like all QBs with 5 starts they are inconsistant with their play and hasn't been exposted to all that is football and until we see that, we can't know the risks very well.

sure. but across 3/5 starts that span 2 years he's shown some very consistent tendencies. ive reserved my opinion on him until now because until now it wasn't clear if there was any pattern to his play. but there is. i don't know if he'll change, but my guess is not. probably just refine a bit. i think he could learn how to not stare down his target, even if he knows where he's going pre-snap. he could built up his intermediate accuracy a bit more. but none of this is guaranteed.

The following play was the Conklin 4th and 2 that wasn't finished. It's not a tall ask, it's something QBs in the nfl definitely do. I'm not watching White in a vacuum and asking him to do something that my mind logic'd out.

i don't think white should've looked left, he should hold closer to the middle while still looking right. QBs do this often. If this was Brady, he would basically be looking down the right hash with his head but have his eyes all the way to the right. It makes it seem like he's looking in one direction but he's actually looking the other. Zach knows how to do it as well, if only he could do the other parts. Again, i'm not sure if it would play a part because i'm not sure how that corner in this situation would've reacted to it. But *the CB has line of sight on Conklin and the QB and there's a chance that if he's not staring at Conklin the CB drops further above him instead of staying at his hip. But i can find you another play of him staring at his target if that would convince you it's a real thing he does, and that it affects the plays.

>ompletely catchable ball thrown at the needed awkward arm angle

this is just a fully disagreeable take. just because the one camera angle makes it look like the arm angle and all was necessary doesn't mean it was. it's not a reach either, the ball is thrown low and closer to the defender than any other throw would've. it's seems ridiculous to have you claim i'm making an unfair criticism when White puts the ball in the one spot the defender has any play on. I can find him doing that in multiple plays on this game, this one is just the most impactful. i don't undersatnd this whole 'getting blown up' idea either. he doesn't have to throw him laterally towards kendricks. he can throw him deeper towards the back of the endzone. that's actually how most QBs would make this throw.

i don't see what you're talking about re:elijah. he's looking at the trips which just lets him read the whole thing. but what he should do imo is hold his head more inside as he does so to at least not over-commit and tell defenders where he's going. it's unrealistic for him to stare down the middle as he drops back for this one, but he could potentially do more with his eyes. unclear if it would help this specific play but he lacks these habits overall which is why it stands out to me. i saw the same thing in the chicago game. the harrison smith play is where it's most egregious, maybe i should've gif'd that one

14213,99811,99811,NannigarCire,">Next, let's look at what White does well. The biggest thing that jumped out at me, and admittedly it's a stark contrast to Zach (but also to Joe Flacco) is his pocket presence. Watching him against Chicago (admittedly not a great pass rush, but also admittedly our O-Line is really banged up) you saw White slide around the pocket with poise to evade rushers while keeping his eyes downfield and getting the ball out on time. He didn't simply check the ball down either, as he made many throws in the intermediate range, as noted by his 11.3 YPA.

No. His air yards per attempt last week was 5.9. if that number held across the season, it would be the 3rd lowest amongst all QBs with only Colt McCoy and Kyle Allen being lower. Right now, as of the last two years- Mike White's games rank the following in air yards per attempt (AYPA) out of 937 individual QB games where a player threw at least 10 passes in the last 2 years:
> vs CIN: 3.7 AYPA, 9th lowest

> vs CHI: 5.8 AYPA, 157th lowest

> vs BUF: 6.6 AYPA, 299th lowest

> vs NEP: 6.8 AYPA, 333rd lowest

> vs IND: 9.2 AYPA, 720th lowest (217th highest)

He has one game in his career throwing further down the field than average, and it was the one he got knocked out against. I bet he would end that game a lot lower if he finished it, and in the other games where his AYPA was higher, they were his worst performances.

He's an effective short passer, but he is very prone to checking down and playing the underneath game. YPA does not in any way measure the depth of passing- it is the total completed yards. It's a complete misunderstanding of the statistic. Being willing to throw down the field more often doesn't mean anything specifically either, but you can not retcon him into someone he is not. Until he does so, giving him credit for something he does not do is completely wrong.

>He also has shown that he has plenty of arm strength to fit the ball in tight windows. Look at the second TD to Garrett Wilson last week. He fit the ball over the linebacker and in front of the DB on a ball that required a lot of zip, but still touch to get it over the linebacker's outstretched hands.

His near INT to the linebacker that is argued as arm strength is also misevaluated- the linebacker was never part of the equation because what actually happens on the play is the LB made an insane recovery after the playaction that was highly unanticipated and that White probably did not even calculate. Even if the Linebacker got his hands on the throw and taken it away, White would've not been to blame as it was just an impressive play by the Linebacker to be in that position from where he began. Earlier in the same game, he tried to make a throw where he did not calculate Eddie Jackson's position and got nearly picked off. In that one, he was wrong, in this one- he would've been right even if he was intercepted. That's to say, it's not unusual for him to not account for a players position. He is not shown that kind of elite mental processing, which is also evidenced by his tendency to checkdown. In any case, it's not a sign of arm strength.

i also wouldn't rush to credit him getting sacked as a positive indicator of anything. the two plays i referred to were just the same as the others, underneath players he wanted- but he chose not to because the defenders were getting closer than he was used to. he also didn't run into many disguised coverages in this game, most of the plays were pretty straight-forward. i could guess the coverage on the pre-snap, and i've never played a sport in my life. there were two where they surprised him (and me) with a rotating blitz, and to his credit he hit his checkdown fine against them. but it's still just hitting a checkdown. better defenses that aren't relying on Jack Sanborn and Nicholas Morrow over the middle might not let that play happen

He had 3 clear bad plays on the sack, near INT to Garrett, and then a 3rd down miss near the end of the game. The sack and the 3rd down miss were both on him entirely, and i don't know why it happened, but he paused to take an underneath throw as he had been all game and missed the chance. He's quick to make decisions and his accuracy on those decisions are solid. His pocket movements are controlled and he's generally ready to throw even has he moves. I'll say this much, he looks better than Fitzpatrick did in 2015. We'll see what happens with a few more games, but i think Zach had a game similar to this against the Steelers and Dolphins.

I haven't argued he shouldn't throw to Moore, once he makes the wrong read on the progression he has to throw to Moore because he can't make up the throw to Carter- that throw was timing dependent. And while you're right, they are multiple assumptions, i'm saying it because i've watched other QBs and very similar plays. This is Brady's bread and butter on game winning drives. It works because defenses are more scared of giving up a big play than a short one in these situations. It only doesn't work here because Zach leads them to this play. It's not even a special play, it's very normal around the NFL. This is like a Garappolo or Alex Smith play. Very low threshold to clear. Not clearing it is very bad. He should've thrown to Moore once he has made the wrong play, but throwing to Moore only fixes the problem he had in the 4th Quarter with 0:32 seconds left against the Patriots in a tie game, and he has far bigger errors that reverberate a lot more through his games when he misses the pre-snap read.

*He could've still hit Moore even if he made the other progression, if he noticed the corners not taking the bait and staying disciplined.

And i think you might be misremembering it- now i didn't watch the game but from the screenshots i had a good feeling of what was probably happening in this play and to me the play itself confirms it. Here it is in full:

https://imgur.com/V83e3UL

So yes, he throws to Carter and it didn't make it. But look at his process of getting to Carter. He starts on the opposite side of the field, slowly crosses his way over to the middle, and then to the side of Carter. By doing that, he's leading the zone defenders to Carter. This is not by design, Zach is given this play and he can choose his progression here based off what he's reading on the defense. And the likely optimal progression as is obvious from the pre-snap when the linebacker drops out, would be to watch Mims as he goes up the seam from the slot because now he's 1v1 with a linebacker in zone coverage who will be pedaling to catch him (potential big play if the throw looks good) and thereby keeping the safety along with the nickel back who is staring at Wilsons eyes the entire time driving backwards as well. Instead, because Wilson takes his time crossing the field, the nickel back sits in his pre-determined zone, watches Zach, and begins moving towards Carter even before he makes the throw there. He can just tell that Zach is heading there. Zach's eyes had to hold that nickel and the outside corner behind him and force him to follow the seam or even dip backwards towards the slant from the outside WR. That would create the space for Carter to catch, get a first down, and then get out of bounds.

He makes a bad call on his progression, decides to read left-to-right in a situation where the play is very obvious, but ends up at the decision he knows he has to get to but does so late. And by reading it left to right, both of those corners are able to sit in their zone instead of following his eyes deeper down the field. He knew he had to throw to Carter, which is why he gets back there when he overlooked Moore. But he did the entire process badly. It's a long hesitation to throw to Carter, and it's also the wrong progression to use here. He could have made the throw to Moore to save this play- but it still wouldn't change that he made the mistake before the snap even happened by not making the right pre-snap read imo

14231,99829,99829,NannigarCire,"Yeah, you can. But it's still not the ideal way that anyone would handle this. On the pre-snap (the first image) you can see pretty clearly that Carter is the best option, because the safety is so far away from him and they have a numbers advantage of 3 blockers on 3 defenders with only that deep safety on carter. Knowing that, if you really wanted to win this- you put your eyes on Mims as he goes up the seam to keep the safety back and then fire to Carter.

Zach's supposed to make 1 read on the deep end to potentially flip the field if they overplay their hand, and then switch to carter right away. That's what Brady does on all of his game winning drives. Even taking Moore, this would be a bad play, because the right play was always obvious even on the pre-snap when Carter moved into the area behind the WRs.

14235,99834,99834,NannigarCire,"I personally don't take these types of catastrophic games in any heavier weight than necessary, it's all just one game as part of a bigger picture. Geno famously had 3 INTs in 8 passes and then put up a perfect passer game, and now in this year- none of that matters. So i've just learned there's good reason to avoid over-weighing individual moments.

Anyway, about Zach- watching him from the start of his Jets tenure the one issue i've constantly found annoying about his play is that he never seems to be in time with his receivers. A lot of people seem to think he can't read defenses, or can't go through progressions- i don't know if this is true when i've watched him. He has two problems of a sort of wacky accuracy, and then being off time with his receivers. And personally i would guess, his accuracy problem comes from being out of time with other receivers. As he starts rushing himself to get in time, he then rushes his throws. I'd say it's less likely he can't read defenses..and maybe more likely he doesn't know his own playbook/receivers really well. I don't think it has to be both, but he might just have no chemistry with his surrounding players. I think it's obvious he has very significant issues as a QB because of this, and the Jets need to explore some other options after this year. I wouldn't pull the plug on him, but i would feel strongly inclined to change something.

I'm very critical of MLF on top of this- i think Zach has been given a bit of a bad offense to work with that doesn't fit him at all. Zach is not a timing passer. He wasn't known for that in college either. He's kind of a ""big time passer""- and this isn't really an offense designed for him at all. And i'm gonna say again, he seems like he can read defenses- if he couldn't his INT numbers would be much much higher. I don't see him throwing into double and triple coverage constantly, he isn't making boneheaded throwing decisions. His INT's or even interceptable plays, seem more like bad inaccurate passes than just total misreads. You don't see a linebacker undercut his throw very often as far as i can tell, or a roaming safety snatch one out of nowhere. And i personally just don't get why they drafted him if this is what they were going to do with him. Who watched Zach Wilson in college and thought, he would make sense in an offense with a lot of timing, horizontal, short, screen passing?

Anyway (2), i don't know if this is fixable or not, that's not really up to me.

In most other situations, this is a pretty automatic read- and that’s also why the linebackers give up this throw. Moore’s supposed to be your last chance- but what I don’t get is why he doesn’t throw to the running back on the side. Honestly that’s the throw that probably nets 7-10 yards and stops the clock.

*didn’t watch the game so I didn’t know he did throw it to the RB, in which case the problem is that he didn’t make that decision before the snap. With the time on the clock and situation, Zach basically has to treat this as a one read play.

14275,99878,99878,NannigarCire,"Appreciate this post, as it is very good in explaining the phenomenon of the ""bad logic"" zach defenders. It's very hard to make a case for Zach Wilson at this moment, the majority of it would come from a sort of ""what ifs"" that can not be objectively pointed to. But If i have to try and make an objective case, i could at least point to a few things that either counteract some of the criticisms against him or explain them in a way that offers an opportunity for improvement.

For one, the most obvious is his clean pocket performance. His 9.5 YPA in a clean pocket is second best in the NFL, and the thing is that most plays for most quarterbacks are within a clean pocket. It's where the majority of QB play occurs, and being good at it is pretty stable on a year to year basis according to most people who have modeled statistical regressions against it. Which at least suggests that there is a stat that he is very good at, and is able to potentially perform consistently with year to year.

He also currently holds a 7.4 YPA for the season, which is quite high- in General 7.5 or higher is what a long-term NFL starter (and franchise QB) usually has. And i focus on YPA for both of these because they are the basic statistic that has the best correlation to Wins/Losses when you run linear regressions where X = YPA and Y = Wins.

On a non-objective matter, the thing about the bad games is the context of them. I'm reminded of Geno Smith's 2014 because he had a lot of ""bad games"" in that year that people would place onto him but completely misunderstood what the reasons for these bad games were. Zach doesn't have even close to the same amount of incompetence surrounding him, but i can see two main problems with the offense that may be the reasons for his struggle that could still improve.

For one, MLF is absolutely terrible right now at calling plays. I think anyone, regardless of their opinion about Moore at this point, clearly understands that telegraphing one of your WRs as a pure decoy is a horrible move. The big advantage the offense has is that they get to set the terms, and if the defense has already figured out that one of the five players is a dead route, it's stupid. It's just a bad offense. This is a horrible way for the offense to function. If Breece Hall wasn't superhuman, i think the run game would be just as bad.

Then you have my personal pet peeve, which is the setup of the offense made Corey Davis the only true beneficiary. With Moore double covered on decoy routes, and Garrett drawing the top coverage corner, that means Corey Davis was the receiver getting the + matchup on most routes. This is a clearly bad move. Davis is the least dynamic of the three, has the least to offer. I think it's very unsurprising that in the same game that Corey Davis was out, the Jets offense put up 300+ passing yards and Zach Wilson threw for 8.66 YPA. Not that Davis is a leech on the offense, but when he's around the Jets coaches make the awfully lazy decision of not doing enough with the other receivers. IMO, this is because of how much he's paid, but i can't prove that.

In any case, i'm disappointed in Zach's season and can't say that even with all of these i would jump onto defending him. But i think there's enough out there on him right now to let him play out the season regardless, and see where it takes him. I also do think it's not unrealistic that MLF is a terrible OC, even if Zach is also a bad QB.",2.0,nyjets,t3_yiot4b,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-11-01T10:04:01Z,nyjets,-0.0267351458963796

This is an awful video. I can't see what Mike White is actually reading and have no idea if his jerking head moving quickly from side to side is indicative of good reads or of bad play. I can not imagine buying into Mike White due to this video.


Going through Progressions is something fans seem to get off about without understanding what going through progressions actually means. Going through Progressions means your first read was covered. What does it mean if your first read is covered? it means you made a pre-snap read on a player that was covered. That means the QB- using the pre-snap information they had, either straight up chose the WRONG PLAYER to look at first, or the defense did a great job of covering the first player.

And without even being able to see what the play was in this video, i have no idea what the reasons are for him moving his reads around. Was he just dropping reads too quickly? chose the wrong player? great D play? there is no reason to fetishize going through reads. The elite QBs around the NFL do not go through their reads on every play. Probably not even on half the plays. They're mostly correct on the pre-snap read first and foremost. When you saw prime Brady, Rodgers, Manning, any other ""cerebral"" QB doing that thing where they look one way for a long time and then come back to another player, they didn't go through their reads. They knew on the pre-snap what would happen, and they held on long enough to make it happen, if they didn't just make the quick throw off the first read to begin with. But they can also just go through their reads if they were wrong.",5.0,nyjets,t3_yi2w1h,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-10-31T12:11:07Z,nyjets,-0.0315499167650752

Very few coaches make an impactful positive or negative difference on a team imo. Just recall how Bowles started with that 10-6 season out of the gate and then had a horrible tenure. Was it his coaching or was it just the jets talent? Same thing for his tenure with the Bucs. was it his coaching or just the Bucs talent? If you try to squeeze out the most analysis you can out of any teams situation, you can usually find a compelling reason besides the coach for why a team is doing well or poorly.

I personally don't believe the mods should be heavily involved in doing much other than not allowing the space to become a link dump for sport pundit hopefuls to post their drivel and to keep the users from returning to their primitive states when they can't convince each other of something. I don't know how the other mods feel, but i don't like the idea of summing all threads into one. There have been scenarios where the mod team has done this in the past, and it's usually relating to some specific news. Making a singular ""discussion"" thread about a player's performance, even if it refreshes every day is a very specific choice.

This is my personal calculus for it, if the users didn't want to see it, they'd downvote it. The users on this forum can do that. They can even turn on the setting where after downvoting something, they no longer see it. I have it on. I downvoted this thread even, not because i'm tired of the Zach Wilson content- but because i think it's a dumb argument.

Only about 15 of them are from this top comment complaining about the content.

The thing also, is the users can just choose to not look at these posts. Nothing forces it. I don't see what's gained in summing these threads up. If the users don't have the self control to just not look into the thread, that's a personal issue. I like to treat the users as adults.

Young players rarely come into the league with that level of detail to their seasonal preparation, and are usually more focused on the big picture stuff (base mechanics, playbooks etc). So I’d say this is more of a feature of just having really young teams year after year, although yes luck and randomness is involved the majority of the guys are just young and not quite taking care of themselves in the way the NFL is demanding of them (yet).

14309,99917,99917,NannigarCire,"The elite comment isn’t true and but more importantly, it wouldn’t matter. Since 2012 (when the league adopted the read option and QB evaluations mightily changed as a result)- 23 QBs have played their age 23 season as a second year starter and thrown at least 100 passes. Wilson is 16th out of 23 in YPA at 6.9, with only Josh Allen below him and ultimately becoming good. Of the guys ahead of him are Mahomes (8.8, insane), Deshaun Watson (8.2), Cam Newton (8.0), Jared Goff (8.0), Marcus Mariota (7.6), Justin Fields (7.6), Justin Herbert (7.5), and this is where the list stops showing any more good players. Kyler Murray had 7.1, and Jalen Hurts at 7.3 are the only others who have shown long term starting potential. And I want to compare him to Fields number for a second, because field’s is throwing to worse players and on a worse offensive scheme. There’s no reason for Fields per pass efficiency to be substantially better than Wilson’s. So everything about that should be questioned. Wilson has better talent around him and is getting less out of it as a passer.

If the idea is “well as long as the jets have a good defense, all Wilson has to do is game manage” alright sure I don’t disagree. But this isn’t a post about the Jets winning or losing games.

14310,99918,99918,NannigarCire,"Discourse on Zach is reaching a very weird level of bad analysis imo. Zach is being protective and not costing us games, yes- this however is because unlike him all the other QBs since Sanchez that the Jets have played we’re also being forced to carry the team. Zachs sitting back and being allowed to play this way by circumstance. Once the game falls behind, that’s when he might start making all the boneheaded moves. The one time that happened, he didn’t- great sign and all but 1 game is not much of a sample. His YPA on the season and career (and this is the only basic stat that actually matters long term) is abysmal. Anything short of 6.7 is not even backup QB material, short of 7.1 is barely startable. He’s currently at 6.9 for the year and that’s awful. 

However I also believe that the offense is still not doing Zach favors for accruing stats. They’ve  correctly identified Wilson as their best WR, incorrectly utilized Moore, and as a result have given far too much of the easy layups to Corey Davis who is not dynamic or skilled enough to make an offense worthwhile. I really, really hope that if Davis missed this game and the coaching staff brings Moore back in, they get their heads out of their asses and don’t force Moore to run clear outs for Mims/Jeff Smith of all players.

14313,99921,99921,NannigarCire,"He's not those guys, but it's not really relevant. Moore isn't those guys because he wasn't in the opportunity to be them, and he believes he can be them if he gets the opportunity. So why are the Jets putting him in a spot where he isn't being able to show his worth, after he proved he belongs on a field to do so? For all we know, without injury last year Moore puts up 1k yards.

Sure, it's impatient. But he doesn't have a duty to be loyal to the team. That's something fans imagine. These guys are just employees. If you join a company that sucks for you, you're not forced to see it through.

Winning doesn't do much for his career though, Byron Pringle and Demarcus Robinson were on the winning team for their entire career, and got basically a similar amount of opportunities as Elijah now. They got very bad deals on the market, they're also much less talented. The Jets W-L record matters to Jets fans and organization loyalists. Moore's seeing the writing on the wall as him being an expendable part of the offense that isn't going to bring him in more. And whether its because of his ego/pride or him looking ahead to career earnings, he's seeing a team that wants to stay this way- run heavy, and keeping him expendable. That's his perspective and the organization isn't doing a convincing job showing him otherwise. 

Like think about it- Moore didn't do this week 4. he didn't do it week 5. What was different about week 6? My guess, is week 6 Garrett Wilson was covered by Jaire Alexander for the majority of the game. And even so, in that situation where the defense has put their best corner on your top WR- the Jets still chose to keep Moore in a suppressed, low volume, high decoy position. No manufactured touches or screens (which really is a travesty given our personnel lets be honest), no moving Garrett outside for Jaire to follow him there and have Garrett run a few decoy routes to remove Jaire from plays and open the field for Moore/Davis. He was just gone. And the Jets won. They have no intention to change their strategy. I bet he talked to the OC prior to that game, maybe he was even told this would be his week. But it's not coming.

People are reacting to the only part of the story they have, Elijah is asking for a trade. I don't know what's going on in the management/coaching meetings/private meetings he has with whoever, but i do know what the Jets are doing with Moore on the field is kind of dumb.

14314,99922,99922,NannigarCire,"Tyler Boyd already got paid though. He got 43 million before either of Higgins or Chase joined the team. Hardman doesn't complain for his own reasons, but Hardman has also been given a lot of opportunities to perform and has failed to do it. His situation is different in that sense. Moore's not being given the opportunity this year, and last year when he was he performed, he's just being purposely utilized in a low volume offense to open the field for other guys. He's the sacrifice, and i'm guessing he wasn't told he'd be the sacrifice going into the season. I'd guess this is the biggest problem, that there was no reason for him to enter the season thinking he'd get sacrificed. I also would imagine that for Hardman, playing with Mahomes on a pass-first team is a great place for his career to get a random boost anyway, than on a new team. It's not the same calculation for Moore. Even if the situations were the exact same though, Moore has no duty to be loyal to the Jets. They are just a business. This isn't a hobby club. It's a for-profit business. And the business would, and has, made decisions that would punish a player for wanting money when they deserved it anyway. It's not necessary for Moore to be loyal to the team, the team has to earn players loyalty too. They aren't beholden to the team. I personally side on the players just for that reason alone, and whatever internal conversations have now led to two second round WRs wanting to leave the team in their sophomore years is saying they're not good at making these guys want to be loyal.",2.0,nyjets,t3_y9pm1y,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-10-21T10:11:05Z,nyjets,-0.0029741262348138

14319,99927,99927,NannigarCire,"personally, i support Moore. Whether it's ego/pride, or just wanting to make sure he has the money for the future- team loyalty for a player is stupid. The jets have him running clear out routes for the new guy and one of the most mediocre veteran WRs in the league on a run first team that's winning games- aka not likely to change their formula. I can see the writing on the wall, i'm sure in conversations with the OC, he can be absolutely certain what the writing is too. And it's not like it's working very well either, Jets are 23rd in yards per drive and 24th in points per drive. The defense is what's doing the work of helping the offense be effective. And then the offense is primarily focused on running the ball. It's not conducive for the guy who came into the season as the clear top guy, was the star MVP of off-season practices (""unguardable"" as some beat writers would say about him) and then suddenly made into a ghost on the field schematically- because there's nothing forcing the Jets to put Moore into this position instead of Garrett/Davis.

As a ""jets fan"" aka a guy who turns on the tv when they play, it sucks. But the Jets team would easily make a business decision with any player if they had to. Moore's making a business decision for himself, cool. Championships aren't real, money is though. It's kind of like being at a startup for a year or two and getting passed over for a promotion in favor of some new guy after you've put in tons of work at the foundation, but having management tell you ""our stock is killing it rn!!"" to make up for it. 

I don't think it'll affect the Jets much, Moore isn't really suited for a decoy role anyway. Just go pick up John Ross in FA and you'll get about the same value, and maybe even more because Ross can actually take the top off a defense. But it is extremely stupid, imo, for the Jets to have put themselves in a situation where Garrett gets the top coverage (unchangeable), Moore gets the second hardest coverage as the clear out option (schematically); and then the worst of the three starters, Corey Davis, is given the easiest coverage (also schematically).

14322,99931,99931,NannigarCire,"Personally, this is the best Jets team i've ever watched. you can go into any week right now unsure if it'll be the best team in the league or just mediocre coming out. The amount of young talent and upside, the potential for everything to click in any given week, it's exciting. the Defense gelling together after only 3 weeks of play was astounding, i thought it might not happen until mid-season. i mean think about it for a second, the entire starting secondary had never played with even 1 other player on the secondary prior to this year. 

All that needs to happen now is for Zach Wilson to go from Jimmy Garappolo into at least Derek Carr and we are a serious superbowl contender. As of the last game, he has officially crossed the 16 game mark which i'm going to count as his first full season, and it's honestly not an impressive one (17 game truthers can go to hell):

56% completion, 2.8% INT rate, an awful 9.7% sack rate but the worst of all is a 6.3 YPA. The bare minimum for a journeyman starter is usually around 6.8. 

I had Zach as my #1 in the 2021 qb draft rankings, so i'm not a hater. I've had his flair from when the sub was still arguing about Fields vs Zach. But it has to improve. So far on the season he has 7.6 YPA, which is a great number- elite even. but it's on such a small number of passes that it's hard to rely on, especially since the majority of it comes from only 1 of his 3 games. Zach looked improved against PIT and MIA- sharper, less willing to make dumb passes, much better short-passing game. But the Green Bay game was not good in any way for him. His worst flaw was making Garrett his first read (as far as i can tell) on plays where he was clearly covered by Jaire Alexander. The best QBs don't do that.

I don't think the Jets can or should lose this week. The Broncos are a completely fraudulent team and Hackett is one of the worst coaches in the league. the Broncos also have some of the worst WRs in the league- especially if they continue focusing on Jerry Jeudy over KJ Hamler. But the Jets offense vs the Broncos Defense is going to create problems for Zach Wilson, because he hasn't shown the ability to take advantage of a defense in any way yet, and this one has a lot fewer flaws than the ones faced prior. He's a sufficient game manager right now, he doesn't need to be much more to win this game. But if the Jets want to take this show to the superbowl, i'd like to see more from him.",2.0,nyjets,t3_y8u05s,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-10-20T10:06:40Z,nyjets,0.0260215538419716

14332,99944,99944,NannigarCire,"personally, my opinion is Sam just didn't want to get better all that much. Sam is a very good prospect profile, young starter with great performance in college. He had quality QB skills- good arm, mobility, the confidence to take risks; which also has downside, but you NEED to be able to take risks to be a good QB.

The problem is likely two issues, one the Jets didn't really surround him with good talent at any point of his tenure here. This didn't really let him shine in any way, and put a lot more pressure for his margin of error to be smaller. and Sam was never very good at being a margin for error type of player, he's best viewed as an Eli Manning type with his arm, high margin of error that also leads to both wow and oof plays. He almost never hit wide receivers in stride as far as i can remember.

And that leads to the second part, it didn't seem like Sam was really improving much year to year. IMO most of the QB development for mechanics, accuracy, quickness, mobility, happen when the QB is practicing on their own in the offseason. Whereas their ability to read defenses, and react to pre/post-snap, and get better at preparing for opponents is what they gain during training camp and the regular season. And Darnold just never looked different for either of these. Like you can turn on a USC game of Darnold's and an NFL game and it's the exact same, bad and good. Whereas like, you can turn on a Mahomes game and you can see all the same crazy shit- but you also see issues in college that Mahomes clearly fixed in the NFL.

1. Crazy town dream QBs: Lamar, Rodgers, Brady, Dark horse Geno? (none of these are happening).

2. Higher upside guy who can also step in if needed:
Jordan Love, Carson Wentz, Daniel Jones (he’s honestly looking good this season with AWFUL weapons), Mid-round QB.

3. Vet to sit behind white or maybe push for starting role if White regresses (if for reasonable money): Brissett, Jimmy G?, Matt Ryan?, Carr?, Andy Dalton?. All guys who bring a vet presence to a team, but aren’t very exciting.



Baker doesn’t really fit either of those categories imo. We’ve seen him destroy the production of offenses with solid weapons multiple times now. He also isn’t the type of guy to come in with a vet presence for the team (if anything he’s a bit polarizing). I don’t hate him, but he’s not a guy I’m looking for.

My take: obv we try for the dream QBs, but it likely doesn’t happen. After that we prep for Mike White at QB and try to bring in Love (at a reasonable price) because he’s prob better than any QB we can draft. If not him, then bring in Wentz (who was shockingly solid on the colts 2 years ago if you look at his numbers) and draft someone developmental to sit. We could also go after Daniel Jones. If none of that, I’d rather Brisset tbh who is by all indications a super locker room guy with experience, but I can see why people would want baker over him.

But the more I see from him, the worse I feel. Where is the big step we needed? Zach had like a nearly all time rookie performance last year. This year he is finally completing screens I guess? He’s still missing open guys on easy throws, EVEN WHEN we aren’t asking much if him. 

If you think this take is about Denver then you need a wake-up call. Zach has had like a SINGLE complete game from a film perspective. Even in the Titans game he looked bad missing easy short throws and then hit that long bomb downfield. 

And I wouldn’t say it’s a guarantee he does any better, because now we need him more. Let’s see how he does without a strong run game. 

Again I’m rooting for Zach. I want to be wrong. But I am extremely concerned, and any Jets fan who isn’t is either not watching or in denial. He has not looked good. Let’s hope that changes. But again if he doesn’t look good by end end of the year it’s time to bring some new blood in.",1.0,nyjets,t3_ycce12,False,0.0,:WSB:,2022-10-24T14:35:13Z,nyjets,0.0291878152006702

Wilson is not having much asked of him, and he looks at BEST serviceable when he’s only asked to check down. Him only needing to throw 18 times and him not throwing a pick in that game is NOT some great thing. It’s like borderline a good thing. At least he can not turn it over in 18 plays, and we all celebrate that because he was somehow even worse last year.

The one game of his entire career where he looked like a legit QB was the buccs last year and that’s IT. He has flashes in other games, but he never looks like the guy consistently throughout a game. He’s played 17 in his career now. Good players make things happen, and bad players get excuses. I’m sick of excuses.

I desperately want Zach to be that guy. I love his personality and the team rallies around him. But if he doesn’t start showing more progress this season I’ll be on board with bringing in some new talent next year. We all saw what happened in 2009/10. Let’s not delude ourselves here.

Also, there is no way to confirm it, but it sure seemed like after Moore went into and then came out of the doghouse, he still was being ignored in the playcalling. An NFL OC can't find a way to get someone who is very fast and quick the ball? It's pretty frustrating to watch how effortlessly other teams manufacture touches for players, and the Jets were almost struggling to get the ball to anyone not named Garrett Wilson.

Over time, I've developed my own Jets mantra that I like to think and sometimes yell at my TV. ""Why the fuck do we make every single thing look complex, while everyone else makes it look simple"". I vividly remember yelling it when, against all hope, MiLF had a moment of clarity, and ran a simple quick out at the goalline with Ozumah, and ZWilson was asked to make a throw even he couldn't sail and it looked like so fucking easy. Why do we make things so difficult? Why weren't we feeding all the weapons we supposedly had with simple concepts? If the defense spot it, fine. But we never even got that far because the plays would break down before they even got going. It was frustrating to watch.

I honestly don't think MilF was seasoned enough to take on DCs who were familiar with the Shanahan system, and knew it's tricks and weaknesses. It might have played out different if the QB play was better, and injuries didn't ravage the run game. But MilF still wasn't able to adapt and it showed.

17094,112946,112946,Phifty56,"I was bitching all game about these refs.

* That 3rd down conversion that led to the easy run in by the Vikings. The refs spotted the ball short based the marker. Another ref picks up the ball, move it a bit closer to the 1st down marker, and it's still short. Saleh for whatever reason HAS to challenge it for them to look at it, and they refuse to measure it. They justify the 1st down by claiming the forward progress took JJ past the line. IF that was true, why did the spot it short not once, but twice. In slow motion it does look possible, but the entire process was fucked. Refs should not be allowed to eye shit like this especially on such a big down. It's fucking ridiculous.

* The White QB sneak. Again, Saleh had to challenge it. It was such a clusterfuck and it was a such a big play for either team, that it shouldn't even have been a question to look at the play. Goalline plays have unique conditions that should always warrant a 2nd look on close plays, yet they almost didn't want to be bothered. So what happens when if they ruled against the Jets on this play? Do they get a magical ""Fuck you go directly to the loss column card"" when a 3rd big play happens and they refuse to even double check it? These refs sure did not want to work on Sunday, which leads me to example 3.

* On the Greg 60y FG, one of the Vikings defender #98 either Leaped(trying to jump over the line) or Leveraged (using another player to launch themselves). They didn't call either one, which didn't matter in the end, but had Zurlein missed it, either flag should have been a 15 yard, automatic first down and should have gotten another shot.

* I am convinced that they were closing their eyes to tons of holding against the Jets DL. There were just so many unnatural sudden stops against the DL when they were about to beat their guy, especially in grabbing range of Cousins.

If Wilson is the key roadblock in the team making sure the team has a winning season and other players develop, then you absolutely have to ""punt"" on the issue and deal with it later, even if it has reprecussions.

So while it might suck for Wilson to be thrown under the bus as the ""franchise QB"" for the team it sends a strong message that no one is above the team, and you need to play your ass off to remain a starter.

Too many fans got ""NY Media'd"" and they don't want to admit it.

Did Wilson suck ass on Sunday? Was it bad enough to finally legitimately start a ""maybe this is not our QB of the future"" conversation?  Absolutely. However, people took a bad answer to absolutely go all in on bashing the guy on a personal level and it wasn't called for. 

Anyone who watched the full press conference could see Wilson was upset and annoyed at the loss and the series of questions leading up to the ""gotcha"" one were pretty bad. When they weren't trying to get him to get him throw the team or teammates under the bus, they were trying to make it sound like this loss was the end of the world and the season. Towards the end of it, it didn't even look like Wilson wanted to answer any more of them because he wanted to look ahead to the next game.

The media is always fishing for a ""dysfunctional Jets"" story and everyone is biting down hard on it like they wanted. At the end of the day it doesn't matter what any of the players say, it's wins and performance that matter.

If Wilson continues to suck, the team will move on from him. It's that simple. The rest of the ""accidental tweets"" and magical ""Fields led a group prayer and singing of kumbya in the lockerroom"" stories that are miraculously coming out now are all part of a crafted narrative.

In fairness to Wilson, that despite the soundbyte and quote that is getting play, here are some of the other questions and answers that were asked during his press conference (paraphrasing reporter question when not entirely clear):

> **When the defense is playing as well as it is, how frustrating was it to not get anything going?**
>       
> Wilson: ""Yea, it's super frustrating, it was a frustrating day of course, I felt like I had some balls that got away from me, but you know we gotta find ways on offense...we gotta do some digging, watch some film, and see what we can do better""
>        
> **Aside from the first time you played NE, aside from the turnovers, you were able to move the ball up and down the field offensively, why today...Did they dramatically change what they did in the first to the second game?****
> 
> Wilson: ""No it's the same. I think you have to put into account that it was windy as hell out there guys...theres times where you just can't take shots down the field, you can see it moving out there.,...We were trying to establish the run game, same as the Patriots were trying to do as well, they weren't out there trying to chuck 30-40 yard passes either, we got to find a way, I have got to find a way to make the easy ones on the side line and try and get my guys on the outside so they can run. What it really comes down to is execution.
>         
> **How tough will be to shake this one off Zach, losing like that?**
>        
> Wilson: Yea obviously it sucks to lose that way, but we are gonna move on from it, and learn from it.
>         
> **You guys talked alot about this game, what does that do to your momentum and confidence?**
>       
> Wilson: yea nothing, we won some big games, we lost some games we want back, we are gonna move on and learn from this one. We got Chicago next week.
>        
> **CBS cameras caught Wilson and Mims a little upset after a couple of the missed passes, Did they say anything to you or the you talk on the sidelines?**
>         
> Wilson: ""No we are all close, we are all talking and communicating, there's some stuff I want them to do different, and I get frustrated as well. I miss a throw high there and they are frustrated as well, it goes both ways, this isn't anyone pointing fingers here, this is everyone taking accountability and trying to get better.
>         
> **As an offense though, when you are only able to score 3 points, and the defense only lets up 3 points do you feel like you let the defense down at all?**
> 
> Wilson: No.

The press conference is ended on that question.


Its not like Wilson was completely washing his hands of his major role in the loss. I think the NY media wore him down and were trying very hard to get him to throw someone under the bus or obviously offer himself up as a scapegoat (which would have been the right and smart move) but it was clear he was getting annoyed at the repeated questions and just wanted to pull a ""we are on to Cincinnati"" but finally nailed him with the final question and that's all that gets play. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt here, because sound bites are sound bites and at the end of the day, they are worthless. It's performance that matters.

Wilson can answer all questions ""right"" but it's all for nothing if he is continue to play poorly. Sam Darnold answered every question right, but he wasn't good enough. Maybe Wilson isn't good enough either, but he sucked on Sunday, moving on is the right attitude and not throwing your teammates under the bus is also the right move. Words are cheap and performance is what truly matters. Don't get bogged down in one poor, admittingly bad, sound bite. If he answered the last question ""of course"" does it really change the fact he is missing open receivers or that he is still getting flustered in the pocket? It either gets fixed by Wilson and the coaching or they have to move on. It's that simple.

NY Media is gonna NY Media. Don't take the bait. They love lockeroom drama and the Jets have bigger problems than press conferences and tweets. Wilson needs to improve or get benched. That's the entire problem, don't get distracted by the ""noise"" aspect of it. Letting them divide the lockeroom will create much bigger problems in the long term than Wilson just playing like ass.  So stop helping the dogpile and start looking at QB alternatives if you like. That is infinitely more constructive than trying to get the team to pikle on to Wilson.

* Mobility in the pocket was next level, the way he bought time and avoided pressure that would have doomed the average QB was excellent.

* The confidence to let it rip was something that is great to see. Not only does that mean he mastering the offense, it means he trusts his abilities and that of his recievers.

* Getting everyone involved. All the WRs got involved, Conklin and both RBs. If this continues to happen, defenses aren't going to be able to focus on any one target, and it opens up the play book for more creative playcalls and unique looks.

* Zero confidence loss after throwing a few Ints. They happen even to the best QBs, and not having to baby him with conservative playcalling is what keeps the pressure on defenses.

A few things to clean up:

* Those short passes are still quite an adventure. Even some of the completed ones can be better. The WRs bailed him out of a few, especially Davis, and being able to get Wilson/Moore/Berrios/Hall passes in stride will give them tons of YAC potential.

* Wilson was a magician in this game saying some broken plays, but I am afraid that might get him injured again. I hope he get a bit more comfortable just bailing on them earlier, for his own sake.
