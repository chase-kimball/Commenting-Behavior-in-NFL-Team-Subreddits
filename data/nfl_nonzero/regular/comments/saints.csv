128,7000,7000,Alistair_Burke,"As a DC: A large amount of hope.

As a HC: I'm not hopeful.

Both sides can find what they want to be for or against, but I think he's less likely to succeed than be a good HC. There are a few things to examine.

QB:
The Saints don't have one. If you don't have a solid QB, you won't go anywhere. Also, DA had better QB play than Payton did in 2021 and still had a worse record.

Taysom:
The Saints had a great record when Taysom rushed for over 50 yards. I heard DA didn't like Taysom because he was Payton's boy. If he helps, he helps. I think DA got in his own head with Taysom. Maybe he's learned.

OC:
We all know that Carmichael was abysmal. Can he be trusted to work with a new QB and, maybe, get a rookie ready? I don't know. Everything probably rests on this. Carmichael also couldn't use Kamara right despite seasons of watching Payton. He plateaued with Taysom, too. I lost faith in Carmichael, and DA gave him a vote of confidence. If he's wrong, that's it.

D-line:
It's getting worse. DA needs to identify the right guys for the job. The line has been inconsistent for a few seasons. Teams can now run on the Saints. That said, they did enough to not drag the defense down. You expect DA to get that out of the unit, and he did.

LBs:
Looking great. Werner was a great 2nd round pick, and Elliss looks legit. Those two and DeMario are an amazing part of the team. DA had a vision for certain LBs, and scouting found them. Total win.

Secondary:
I think DA was part of the personnel moves, and I hated the team picking Maye over Williams. Maye is older but cheaper. I also feel like he'll miss some games due to a suspension. His play was fine, but he lacks the range of Williams. On the other side, Badger looked bad for about half the season then finished strong. He's getting older, but maybe he can keep it up. The whole secondary seems to live or die with Lattimore. That's good and bad. They're great when he's healthy, but they're weaker than they were in 2021. DA prefers Adebo to Taylor, which does confuse me. The unit got worse, but it's still really good when Lattimore is there.

Special teams:
This entire unit became a mess. Gilikin couldn't stay consistent while Lutz started weak, got right, then struggled at the end. Punt coverage is okay, so they have that. It got worse under DA. I don't know if it's his fault, but it is his job to find a solution.

Optics/Leadership:
At his best, you could say DA is a silent assassin/stoic coach. You don't see anything from him on game day. When the team is winning, that's a quirk you just shrug at. When the team struggles with penalties and execution, it looks like he doesn't care. Once you get that reputation, you don't shake it. Ask Aaron Brooks. Players were terrified of being around Payton after making a mistake. DA doesn't project that. That's fine if he has some enforcers on his staff, but who fills that role? Nielsen did, but he's gone. With guys like Payton and Campbell gone, there's no one like that on offense. DA doesn't have to change his demeanor, but he will have to rely on hard-nosed coaches. It doesn't seem like he's aware of that. I know some are tired of the now meme ""Keep doing what you're doing"", but it hasn't disappeared for a reason. It's who he is. When times are good, that's a fine approach. When the team has many weaknesses, it's not so good.

Payton had plenty of issues with the defense. He held on to Gibbs for too long; meddled with Ryan (though who knows if Ryan would have been good, anyway); and gave Williams too much freedom.

His winning percentage is one of the tops in the league over his tenure. Also, Super Bowl. I just don't see any world where Payton's floor is similar to DA's floor.

There's a reason that teams would trade significant assets for Payton then pay him $20M-25M a season. No other team would take DA as a head coach. He'd probably land a DC gig, which is probably what he is. He's always struck me as a guy who is a coordinator, not a head coach.

That definitely wasn’t set in stone going into the season. One prevailing idea was that this team had too much talent (particularly on defense) to not at least compete for the playoffs. Jameis was more of an unknown than anything - he played pretty well last season before getting injured, so we didn’t really know which Jameis we would get during the season. Dennis Allen created an elite defense over the past few years, after all, so why wouldn’t he make a good HC?  

In hindsight this was probably a dumb mindset. It’s not that we *don’t* have talent, it’s that it’s being completely wasted by our trash coaching staff. Not to mention Jameis, without being tethered by a leash to Sean Payton, reverted back to his old ways. I think taking Olave was a good pick and one that was easy to make at the time (they love their Ohio State players), though with hindsight we’d obviously have preferred a QB.  

I honestly don’t know what we do going into next season. This team does still have lots of talent, it’s just not translating into wins. The smart move is probably trading away some pieces and tanking with Dalton or Jameis over the next few years, although I wouldn’t be surprised if “we just keep doing what we’re doing,” as Dennis Allen likes to say. It’s not a stretch to say that we’re just a QB and head coach away from making the playoffs, but the likelihood of getting either of those while this core is still in its prime doesn’t seem great.",6.0,nfl,t3_zbmc4e,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints :Chiefs: Chiefs,2022-12-03T18:17:47Z,saints,0.0692418978108748

Roby

Tuttle

Ingram

PJ

Harty and everyone else UFA can kick rocks for all I care.

So going into next year if we lose all of the above it's not that bad and we save a ton of money. We will still have our core good players. We may not have a 1st rnd pick coming up but we did get Olave and Penning will start at LT when healthy.

Starting lineups wont change much, and we should get a haul for Sean if he returns. We can fill any holes in FA and draft BPA like usual.

QB is the biggest issue which I'm sure we'll be looking to draft. Could possibly trade into the late 1st round if one is there..i don't see us getting a day 1 starter though.

I'd try for Jimmy G if possible as a good stop gap though as I think we still can have a good roster next year to compete in the south. Especially if brady is gone then none of the teams have a franchise QB.",2.0,saints,t3_y9uuow,False,0.0,None,2022-10-21T11:24:03Z,saints,0.0033103480911121

Lastly, there were some rumblings from the organization about changing the offensive scheme a little bit. Making it more modern, and if that's the case they need someone who can run it properly.

Football is not sumo wrestling. It's not one guy standing in front of another and going at it mano a mano. Have you ever seen a play in football, where one of the offensive linemen is just kind of standing there looking around while the play is going on because there's no one to block? Have you ever wondered what happened? 

Because the protection scheme called for a double team that ended up being unnecessary or a free blitzer who instead dropped into coverage. 

The pre-snap protection calls are vital to a play's success. Jameis doesn't understand how to make the correct ones. 

Once the ball is snapped, a quarterback has around two, two and a quarter seconds to identify where he's going with the ball and getting it out of his hands or moving around in the pocket or scrambling to buy a little extra time. Jameis also sucks ass at this. 

Andy Dalton is an average basic level talent at the position, and he understands how quickly he has to get rid of the ball, and also understands how to identify what they expect the defense to do. So on a given play, Dalton has a much better chance of calling the correct protection than Winston does. It's a big reason why sometimes five lineman can can block six rushers. And sometimes why as few as three defenders can get into the backfield.

4048,33865,33865,Cleavon_Littlefinger,"Well written and some good thoughts here. My opinion on a few of these:

1. Lattimore is a top three corner in the league at minimum. But at this point in his career, no one's been able to shut down Jefferson. And plenty of those yards were gained in zone, but  the defense probably would have been better off putting him on Thielen and bracketing him with a corner/safety duo. 

2. This and number three are accurate.

3. See above.
4. Dalton needs a few more games of similar performance, but he's definitely setting himself up as a perfect bridge quarterback in my opinion. 
5. Agreed, but the two called on us in the 4th quarter, and not calling pass interference on the Olave sideline attempt (I've seen less effective arm grabs called) I can't really blame on the team. Which means that 54 yards of today's totals were in my opinion illegitimate. 
6. When it's working, it's brilliant. Sean Payton used to always do that, send in a complete skill position package for different plays on the same drive. Just because it didn't work very well today, doesn't mean that is not a valid strategy. 
7. Olave right now is looking like a stud. And there's a pretty prevalent feeling that we will get a second first round pick this year when Payton signs on to coach another team for 2024. They were willing to go all in on trying to get this on Watson, so I can't imagine they don't have a plan at that position going forward, be it a draft pick or an upcoming free agent.",10.0,saints,t3_xttn4z,False,0.0,None,2022-10-02T17:05:52Z,saints,0.0244245768759447

7593,73689,73689,Jopplo03,"I’m going to copy and paste u/ daybreaker comment because BountyGate deserves more than Roger Goodell’s investigation which a federal judge called “fundamentally” flawed:

tl;dr  The coaches never admitted to paying for injuries (despite what r/nfl would have you believe). They said there was a pay for performance pool, which paid for interceptions, fumbles, and yes, big hits - but players didnt get paid if a hit was illegal or flagged. Goodell also never produced any solid evidence to back up injuries - just circumstantial evidence and evidence backing up the pay for performance pool.

 Roger Goodell claimed the Saints had a system from 2009-2011 where they would pay to specifically injure other players. He claimed to have several thousand pages of evidence of this, but refused to show it to anyone. Instead, he said what some of the evidence was, and the media went to town taking his word for it.

The coaches and players never admitted to any bounties - only to a pay for performance program, where you would get bonuses for interceptions, fumbles, big hits, etc.

But by then, public opinion was easily swayed by the media showing one hit on Kurt Warner, a few hits on Favre, and playing one audio tape by Gregg Williams, over and over and over and over, while still not asking to actually see any of the other evidence Goodell had.

To further advance the farce Goodell brought in a ""special investigator"" Mary Jo White, who claimed they had received a signed confession from a player, so the case was basically open and shut.

But then the NFLPA leaked the ""confession"" and it wasnt a confession.

Goodell said he had the bounty ledger, full of pages of a history of payments for ""cart offs"" and other injuries. Except when they released a page that had ""cart off"" payments on it, it was for a game where no one had been injured. The NFL quickly revised their statement saying it was actually for a different game.... that also didnt have any injuries in it.

The NFL then said they had a powerpoint presentation from Gregg Williams to the defense that specifically references bounty payments.  Except the NFLPA leaked that one too, and it was a ridiculous Dog the Bounty Hunter themed presentation that was just creating metaphors for their gameplan to the popular-at-the-time TV Show.

Those are just a few examples. Basically, any time Goodell said he had evidence, and it got leaked, that ""evidence"" didnt say what Goodell said it did.

And yet no one in the media really cared about all the inconsistencies. They kept writing their articles about how shameful all this was. Getting on their soapboxes. Pete Prisco, in 2011, had said the Falcons shouldve injured Drew Brees to keep him from breaking the passing record against them. But then he became the biggest critic of ""Bountygate"".

The whole thing was a giant media shit storm created by Goodell, because the league needed a scapegoat to look like they were ""tough on player safety"" ahead of the retired players concussion lawsuit. And it apparently worked, because the league got off BIG TIME with the relatively small settlement the judge awarded.

Basically, Gregg Williams is an over-exaggerating asshole who uses harsh language to fire up his team. But to this day there is no solid evidence of any payments for actual injuries. The details of the pay for performance plan even specifically pointed out that players didnt get paid a bonus for any illegal hits. And from 2009-2011, the Saints were near the bottom of the league in personal fouls and opposing team injuries.

Now, pay for performance was certainly illegal in terms of violating the salary cap. But the media firestorm and outrage wasnt over the salary cap violations - it was over the injuries. Which were never proven. We had several players suspended for a year, Coach Payton suspended for the year, our GM Mickey Loomis suspended for 8 games, and ou assistant coach Joe Vitt suspended for 4 games. We also lost two 2nd Round draft picks, and were fined $500k.

Paul Tagliabue was later brought in and voided the player suspensions. Goodell also said that if the Saints cooperated, and helped the league start several safety initiatives in high schools, we would get our 2013 2nd Round pick back. Benson never spoke out against Goodell, and was entirely cooperative with anything he wanted. We never got our 2nd Round pick back.

Many people will claim there is proof of a $10k bounty on Favre from Vilma, or that it wasnt from Vilma, but actually from Mike Orenstein (who was in jail at the time and couldnt have actually sent anyone anything). There's never been any proof of these things - these all come from just one source, Mike Cerullo, who had actually been fired from the Saints for several reasons and had to be escorted from the facility by the police. Seeing as how he's the only ""witness"" Goodell ever had, it's pretty easy to call into question his reputation.

We were pretty much victims of trumped up charges that a lazy media did nothing to refute.",30.0,nfl,t3_10h7l8n,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints :Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-20T18:10:45Z,saints,-0.0093781053648511

7648,73793,73793,Jopplo03,"For everyone interested in this, because 99% of people don’t know any details about bountygate and just hopped on the bandwagon, here is a post I saved form several years ago from u/ daybreaker

tl;dr  The coaches never admitted to paying for injuries (despite what r/nfl would have you believe). They said there was a pay for performance pool, which paid for interceptions, fumbles, and yes, big hits - but players didnt get paid if a hit was illegal or flagged. Goodell also never produced any solid evidence to back up injuries - just circumstantial evidence and evidence backing up the pay for performance pool.

Roger Goodell claimed the Saints had a system from 2009-2011 where they would pay to specifically injure other players. He claimed to have several thousand pages of evidence of this, but refused to show it to anyone. Instead, he said what some of the evidence was, and the media went to town taking his word for it.

The coaches and players never admitted to any bounties - only to a pay for performance program, where you would get bonuses for interceptions, fumbles, big hits, etc.

But by then, public opinion was easily swayed by the media showing one hit on Kurt Warner, a few hits on Favre, and playing one audio tape by Gregg Williams, over and over and over and over, while still not asking to actually see any of the other evidence Goodell had.

To further advance the farce Goodell brought in a “special investigator” Mary Jo White, who claimed they had received a signed confession from a player, so the case was basically open and shut.

But then the NFLPA leaked the “confession” and it wasnt a confession.

Goodell said he had the bounty ledger, full of pages of a history of payments for “cart offs” and other injuries. Except when they released a page that had “cart off” payments on it, it was for a game where no one had been injured. The NFL quickly revised their statement saying it was actually for a different game…. that also didnt have any injuries in it.

The NFL then said they had a powerpoint presentation from Gregg Williams to the defense that specifically references bounty payments.  Except the NFLPA leaked that one too, and it was a ridiculous Dog the Bounty Hunter themed presentation that was just creating metaphors for their gameplan to the popular-at-the-time TV Show.

Those are just a few examples. Basically, any time Goodell said he had evidence, and it got leaked, that “evidence” didnt say what Goodell said it did.

And yet no one in the media really cared about all the inconsistencies. They kept writing their articles about how shameful all this was. Getting on their soapboxes. Pete Prisco, in 2011, had said the Falcons shouldve injured Drew Brees to keep him from breaking the passing record against them. But then he became the biggest critic of “Bountygate”.

The whole thing was a giant media shit storm created by Goodell, because the league needed a scapegoat to look like they were “tough on player safety” ahead of the retired players concussion lawsuit. And it apparently worked, because the league got off BIG TIME with the relatively small settlement the judge awarded.

Basically, Gregg Williams is an over-exaggerating asshole who uses harsh language to fire up his team. But to this day there is no solid evidence of any payments for actual injuries. The details of the pay for performance plan even specifically pointed out that players didnt get paid a bonus for any illegal hits. And from 2009-2011, the Saints were near the bottom of the league in personal fouls and opposing team injuries.

Now, pay for performance was certainly illegal in terms of violating the salary cap. But the media firestorm and outrage wasnt over the salary cap violations - it was over the injuries. Which were never proven. We had several players suspended for a year, Coach Payton suspended for the year, our GM Mickey Loomis suspended for 8 games, and ou assistant coach Joe Vitt suspended for 4 games. We also lost two 2nd Round draft picks, and were fined $500k.

Paul Tagliabue was later brought in and voided the player suspensions. Goodell also said that if the Saints cooperated, and helped the league start several safety initiatives in high schools, we would get our 2013 2nd Round pick back. Benson never spoke out against Goodell, and was entirely cooperative with anything he wanted. We never got our 2nd Round pick back.

Many people will claim there is proof of a $10k bounty on Favre from Vilma, or that it wasnt from Vilma, but actually from Mike Orenstein (who was in jail at the time and couldnt have actually sent anyone anything). There’s never been any proof of these things - these all come from just one source, Mike Cerullo, who had actually been fired from the Saints for several reasons and had to be escorted from the facility by the police. Seeing as how he’s the only “witness” Goodell ever had, it’s pretty easy to call into question his reputation.

8151,79768,79768,Kitchen_Net_GME,"I got more tin foil on Drew. Drew’s last season was 2020. In the off-season prior, Drew was doing very intense strength building and arm velocity building. 

https://theathletic.com/1986561/2020/08/11/how-drew-brees-is-using-his-legs-to-take-10-years-off-his-arm/?amp=1

“House, a former Major League Baseball pitcher and coach who has built a second career as a throwing specialist for pitchers and quarterbacks, knows that each mile per hour of velocity Brees could achieve would translate to 1 yard of distance on his throws. They spent a month strengthening his arm and shoulder using various functional strength training techniques.”

And this: 

“After a month in the gym, Brees took his arm to the field. In early July, House said Brees was throwing “45-, 50-yarders like he was 25 years old again.” By late July, House said he was throwing “balls 57, 58 yards without even trying.”

So a lot of people were excited when training camp started that the Brees deep ball was coming back. 

And then in training camp, we saw……nothing. Three weeks into to basic 7x7 drills there was not one single deep pass from Drew. 

In training camp Drew has QB challenges for fun after practice. They try to hit targets and what not. 

I finally sat down to watch it and saw something immediately. Drew had a “hitch” in his mechanics. Clear as day, and I have studied that man since 2006. 

I think he went all Tiger Woods on his shoulder and did more harm than good. I believe he had a significant injury from that training that never hit the press. His passes never were the same. 

To add on that, Brees broke like 11 ribs several weeks later. 

I think when he writes a tell all book there will be things that shock a lot of people regarding his health.

Edit: another example was 2010 season for Drew. He was not playing well at all. His 2009 was MVP worthy, as was his 2011 season. But by comparison his 2010 was awful. 

It later came out that he played the majority of the 2010 season with a torn MCL.",126.0,nfl,t3_10gy9lu,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2023-01-20T11:34:52Z,saints,0.0033425358395518

The very next pass was a routine throw on a slant to MT. This was a terrible throw and it skipped on the ground before it got to MT. 

The next throw was the infamous non call. The pass itself was very very soft. As mentioned earlier, the cornerback could have just played the ball for the pick 6. 

The corner imo was surprised how slow the pass was and arrived way to early. 

Then in OT Brees could not throw good passes.

But starting in 2020, Romo stopped doing this. Instead he became a hype man for the biggest and brightest stars in the NFL. Prescott, Brady, Mahomes, Allen, they became his targets -- instead of showing us the insides of the game and how it works to the point of even telling us what the play was going to be based on formations and how the defense reacts, we get him preaching about Superman Allen or Mahomes being the ultimate warrior and Brady being a goat.

Dennis Allen and Carmichael as HC and OC looks like a huge mistake. 

We sent CJGJ (fans loved him) to the Eagles for peanuts picks just to overpay Matthieu and also bring Maye. Now CJGJ is a Safety and leads the league in INTs. 

We also went hyper aggressive trading up this year for a tackle and a WR. It's one thing doing this with Brees and Payton and being a SB contender. But this year it was obvious we could suck (and we do). Now the best team in NFC is sitting on a Top 10 or maybe even Top 5 pick, that we could've used to get a much needed QB. 

We also had controversial 1st round picks recently. Davenport is pretty good, but we also traded 2 firsts to get him. Payton Turner seemed like a reach and is always injured. Ruiz was horrible for 2 seasons, but this one gets a pass because he pulled a miracle from his ass and is our best OL this year.

Tony Dungy gets some sort of credit for Chucky’s TB Super Bowl win in 2002 and then he actually did win it with Manning in Indy. Not much success otherwise as I alway thought he was a dud. Played in the league though so probably got through to guys better.

The fact that if your offensive head coach succeeds and your team doesn’t need to learn a new offense every year is a huge benefit to that type of hiring. A defensive guy having a OC poached and losing that system has killed plenty of teams seasons. At the time, I wanted McDaniel most then Daboll to be the HC here with DA staying as the DC so damn bad. I got downvoted for that opinion often but I definitely disagreed with it.

The inability for the head coach to select the right coaches under him to help succeed and the inability to develop young talent on the roster and new acquired talent, the fact his teams were undisciplined and underperformed… all of it just screams his Raider days were obvious failures. All you can do is look at the guy’s predecessors and successors to judge value and in that time frame he is a VERY clear outlier. 

I hope he succeeds here as the HC, but I have a close friend who is a Raiders fan who told me what to expect from a DA coaches team, and all the things he said lined up to this years performance. He is the same guy to this point. The fact you just dismiss his record for his 2 full years of coaching when the previous and next 2 years were much better without him is ludicrous to me. The guy failed to even reach a .250 win percentage there and the people before and after weren’t below .500 with the same amount of time. His raiders coaching days were not good. Period. He was not a good coach. You hope he learns from his mistakes, but last year didn’t look promising. Team was still undisciplined, not aggressive on go-for-it situations, adjustments weren’t made during the game, “keep doing what we’re doing” when what we’re doing is losing games due to boneheaded plays and penalties… I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong, but let’s not act like he wasn’t given a fair shake.

This is a weird hill to choose to die on bro that’s all I’m gonna say. Jamies is a Big Ben comparison in terms of athletics, Lance is closer to Jalen Hurts. There is not comparison in their play styles. 

Also, the Shanahan offense is more tailored to a Purdy/Garoppolo player. The dude made Matt Ryan an MVP, that’s the kind of offense he runs. Lance isn’t a great fit to his specific offense and Shanahan even said that it may take some time to adjust his play calling to get the best out of Lance, but it’s worth it to get that added element of a mobile QB. Lance had less than one game in a monsoon this season, let’s not get ahead of ourselves with “beat out” here. They’re a loaded team and could win with a lot of QBs right now, and if they do win it all with a cheap 7th rounder, a guy like Lance would potentially become available. The same guy who cost the 49ers 3+ first round picks to trade up for and get. Yes, I’d give pick 31 away for him.

Jameis stans can be funny. They see the upside and that’s literally it. His upside is crazy high, sure. Dudes got more talent than most QBs in the NFL, but his decision making is terrible and his lack of ability to check the ball down is why he will never be a long term starter.

15047,142001,142001,Skullkid1423,"Gregg Williams (our defensive coordinator for a few years, including our Super Bowl) was known for fast and hard hitting defenses. For years the NFL was trying to prove he lead a pay for injury program. The NFL investigated us by looking into sound bites from games and locker room speeches, interviewing coaches and players, as well as watching game film.  There was a lot of smoke to it, but the only thing anyone admitted to or could be proven was pay for performance pools. Basically whoever lead the team that week in big hits, TFLs, INTs, Fumbles, etc. would get the “pot” of money that coaches and players contributed to. This program circumvents the salary cap by providing in house bonuses/bets. The NFL was also getting a lot of heat about CTE at the time (less about it being a thing and more about the NFL knowing about it and not acknowledging it) so this was a perfect way for the league to look like they were tough against injuries and made sure to hammer home the title ‘bountygate’ and try to punish the organization as much as possible. 

The league tried to suspend some key defensive players for a substantial amount of games, as well as Payton a full year, Gregg Williams and some defensive coordinators claimed to be involved indefinitely. The Saints appealed and the case went to former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. After he reviewed the findings along with the NFLPA Head (the guy literally in charge of keeping the players in the nfl safe) he determined the investigation the NFL lead contained no tangible evidence towards an actual bounty program, but rather pay for performance. Tagliabue did note there is a lot of stuff in there that could lead to the thought a program existed, however it was not substantial and he reversed the suspension of the NFL players and lowered the suspension to the coordinators to 6-8 games as the coaches did break that rule. He kept the suspension to Payton and Gregg Williams. The saints lost draft picks and were fined. 

Goodell and the league still won though, the headline of Bountygate stuck and not many people outside of saints fans actual researched the Tagliabue findings.

ETA: obligatory fuck Gregg Williams. 

Also, I’m not saying we didn’t have a bounty system in place, we probably did.

Just not sure it would lead to a SB. Not that Carr would, but the investment there is much less and lets us continue retooling despite having our QB for now. Expectations would also be less crushing than if we had a former MVP

Tbh if we were making a crazy swing--which I still think getting Carr or just rolling with Dalton and aiming for the draft next year is the best realistic path--even though it has a much chance of busting at that point I'd rather trade 2 1sts to the pick 5-10 range and try to get Anthony Richardson since that would be cheaper and the player would be younger. Not that Richardson wouldn't face a similar question mark with our coaching staff but I'm assuming the other top QBs are out of reach.

Why throw out everything we have and risk being the new Browns for a hypothetical future 'win the lottery' scenario. It should be obvious by now that having loads of open cap space and high picks does not make an ascension to contention any more likely than hovering around .500 and hoping a window opens, and likely means losing everything else you have going for you in the process. It's sustainable to be 'over' the cap unless you go absolutely all-in or a global crisis like COVID lowers the cap

You can chill on all-in moves and let the cap settle a bit without giving up on being competitive. And bringing in Derek Carr rather than a backup quality QB isn't exactly an all-in move. The Eagles are a good example of consistently retooling without bottoming out. Honestly, so are the Chiefs when they eventually moved to get Mahomes. If you're already a bottom feeder like the Bills or Lions were at one point it's possible to do a standard rebuild well, but it makes no sense to force yourself to the bottom on purpose.

This is on top of having to spend almost 10 more years as an assistant than white assistant coaches.

Direct quotes from a black offensive coordinator regarding the hiring process:

“When I got my first job, I interviewed with the coaching staff to work as a scout,” explained one of the few Black offensive coordinators who has interviewed for a head coaching job. “When I joined the coaching staff, I interviewed with the offensive coordinator to make sure I understood the offense. But if I want to be a head coach, you have to interview with people who never played in the league and don’t really know anything about football. They’re just looking for someone who they think is smart. Well, what’s smart? Someone who talks like them and acts like them. 

“It’s not like they don’t like Black coaches—at least I don’t think they know they do. But if you look at who gets the jobs, it’s white kids who grew up in skyboxes and went on vacations with the same people who are doing the hiring. It’s not that there’s just one good ol’ boy’s club and you gotta know the secret handshake.

Now, that’s not completely true. This is an ideal scenario for the Saints to exercise the post-June 1 designation and reap greater salary cap benefits. As observed by Over The Cap’s Jason Fitzgerald, the Saints did this restructure with Thomas on the last day they were allowed to in order for him to be eligible for a post-June 1 release. By releasing Thomas in March (before the trigger date guarantees that $31.755 million for 2024) and designating him as a post-June 1 cut, the Saints will carry his $13.15 million salary cap charge until June 2. At that point it reduces to $11.993 million, and New Orleans will be left with a $14.181 million dead money charge in 2024.

So why restructure Thomas now? If the Saints hadn’t touched his contract but still intended to part ways with him, they’d have to carry his $28.2 million salary cap hit on the books all the way through free agency, the draft, and summer workouts until the post-June 1 benefits kick in.

This.  

It's not remotely close to a sure shot that you get a stud QB. Probably more like 50/50 or 60/40. Most def not worth intentionally tanking over, especially when your team was only like 1 game out of a postseason spot. In a division where nobody has a stud QB. And you don't get good immediately after you get that stud QB --- it usually takes a lot more. 

Also you can tank all you want but unless you go 0-17 or 1-16 the #1 overall pick isnt a guarantee.

Over here in reality though, we’re talking about a time where ESPN had full segments dedicated to brutal hits on the field. I had to watch jabari greer’s leg get snapped in half like 30 times on instant replay. The roots of the NFL are violent and until bountygate happened the league and media celebrated that violence. I’m sure there are a ton of people in this sub who played football at a high school level back in the 80s 90s and 00s that can recall times where even their HS coaches were encouraging their players to injure players on the other team. 

Again, that shit is absolutely wrong but it was rampant. There are plenty of interviews with former players who say the same thing and that it wasnt a big deal because they knew their team was doing it too, like Terrell Suggs said the Ravens had bounties on Hines Ward and Rashard Mendenhall, and even Brett Favre says in his own memoir that the Vikings had a bounty program.

Yes he's shorter than most QBs and wasn't very mobile. But people forget that arm talent isn't all about raw throwing distance. The man was as accurate a passer as the league has ever seen.

QBs that are built to run will often known when a play is dead and try and get back to the LOS and end up only losing a yard or two vs a guy doing a 7 step drop and then bailing back a couple yards. I'm a bit surprised at the data here frankly because Andy Dalton was an absolute statue in the pocket this year for us and took sooo many sacks where a more mobile qb would have been able to leave the pocket and throw it away.

Dennis Allen has had 10+ losses in every season he’s been a head coach. Occam’s razor: sometimes the simplest answer is the right answer:

Dennis Allen is a bad head coach

If we had tanked in 2023 with Dennis Allen, we’d be in an amazing position right now:

No Maye who’s injured and has a suspension upcoming

No Mathieu who isn’t in our long term plans

Our 1st round pick at #10 or lower to get our next franchise QB

A much better cap situation because we didn’t go all out for Watson

If we try to compete this year, we end up stuck with a bad head coach, an old roster, and overpaying for a bad qb (carr, hendon hooker, etc)

You can tank but keep the good culture by keeping older vets just for the culture. For instance, Cam Jordan stays (if he wants) to keep the locker room culture after 2023

Here are the moves we can do to tank and set ourselves up for another SUPER BOWL WINDOW NOT BARELY WINNING SEASONS

trade Demario and resign kaden Elliss to have a dominate young Lb group 

Trade Bradley Roby for picks and play lattimore Adebo and Taylor

Trade mathieu  to a contender or just let him play out his contract

Resign Dalton to a 1 year deal and run it back with Dalton vs Winston 

Cut Thomas and don’t resign Landry. Do resign Harty to a 1 year prove it deal 

Trade Peat IF you get a good deal. Guards can play for a long time and a great OLine is important to a young qb for 2024

Don’t trade Kamara, he’s got a suspension and coming off a bad season he’ll get nothing

Draft all depth position, DO NOT DRAFT A QB THEY ARE NOT A GOOD BET OUTSIDE TOP TO MIDDLE FIRST ROUND

let Davenport and Onyemata walk unless they accept cheap deals

Play our rookies like Payton Turner, if he sucks ok we lose more games. If he’s good great 

Overall, we are in the terrible mediocre middle of the colts, raiders, commanders, etc where it’s just patching holes on a shitty boat

Why does everyone need to be Sean Payton? Plenty of coaches coach without huge bursts of emotion consistently. Belichick, Reid, McCarthy, Reich are hardly animated on the sidelines for example. Doesn't mean their players didn't believe in them and certainly doesn't equal lack of success. Y'all act like DA is Jim Caldwell emotionally.

It tells nothing. Why do players need to praise their coach publicly? Do you also assume couples who don't publicly remind people they love each other consistently that they're bound for breakup?

There's a lot to unpack from the Richard stuff. 

One, the co-DCs hasn't ever and clearly didn't work out this time. That solved itself when Nielsen was hired away. 

Two, Richard has been here for two seasons, and yes we've seen some great secondary play overall in that time, but we weren't exactly starved for good DBs before that. The big difference was cutting down in penalties in the secondary.

Three, DA has overseen the building of the defense, the strength of our team, for 7.5 years now. It is highly unlikely that the guy who said ""keep doin what you've been doin"" is going to make such any drastic changes to the overall scheme that would ruin our defense. It's much more likely Richard wanted to add wrinkles that don't mesh with DA's philosophy.

Just because there's shakeups in the defensive staff doesn't mean the offensive staff isn't going to get touched. Yes, Pete is returning. But it's still too early to tell the final makeup of the staff on that side of the ball.

The doomsdayers in this sub are so annoying. One breath they want to tank, the next they complain that we're the Texans despite having a stable front office and talent on both sides of the ball.

The bottom line is the team took a bunch of risks to extend the window while Brees was around and attempt to prop it open once he left. Sometimes things just don't work out. I don't think anyone anticipated that Michael Thomas had fewer than 16 games left as a Saint after his record breaking season. I don't think anyone anticipated Trevor Penning getting turf toe and a Lisfranc injury in his rookie season. I don't think anyone anticipated a global pandemic would occur and cause an always-inflating salary cap to decrease for a season.

26858,247568,247568,myxanders,">  and why the Saints need to tank in 2023 and move on in 2024

No one needs to tank nor is this team planning on it, but okay let's hear.

> Best case scenario: 

> we keep Pete Carmichael and Andy Dalton in 2023, get Kamara and Mayes suspensions over with, Thomas works his way back from injury, and we backfill depth

> After the 2023 season, we fire Allen, draft a franchise qb, and hire a new coach with a qb and a much cleaner cap

I understand it's skewed because you want this team to lose but this doesn't sound like best case scenario. Also Michael Thomas will not be back next year so this is fantasy.

>Worst case scenario: 

> we get a decent OC, trade/sign Derek carr, sign overpriced free agents, and go 6-11, 7-10, 8-9 for three more seasons before realizing Dennis Allen is a shitty coach

I'd say worse case scenario is we don't add any QBs, Kamara gets a long suspension, we don't add any DL, and we don't add any WRs.

I'd be willing to wager that barring another season of constant injuries, so long as we address positions outlined above we'd be in better shape than we were this season, particularly if Carr is QB.


> Mickey Loomis is a NUMBERS GUY, he has said in many interviews he asks the coach who he wants and goes for that player

Mickey is a numbers guy. The flip side is he has said and demonstrated in the past: the team decides what they're willing to pay for a guy, and if the player asks above that value, they move on. This is important to remember for later.

> Dennis Allen chose to let Marcus Williams walk, 

This contradicts what you just said on the basis that the team offered Marcus Williams a new contract and he wanted more. Our two safety signings this past offseason cost a couple more million per year combined than the contract Williams got.

> not put CJGJ in as SS.

Breaking: Defensive coordinator turned head coach decides he wants to keep top nickel corner at nickel.

> Allen was the DC and then HC, he clearly failed in his evaluation that Maye/Mathieu was better than Williams/CJGJ

It was also a lot cheaper. And it failed so hard we ended up with the 2nd best pass defense in the league.

> If you’re trying to say “CJGJ wouldn’t have played SS”, well he did with the Eagles with no new contract. Had Dennis Allen told CJGJ he could be our SS for the season before signing Mathieu, CJGJ would’ve realized he could make bank in an elite secondary

There's a couple assumptions in here: 1) that I was gonna say ""CJGJ wouldn't have played SS"". That's not exactly what I was gonna say. More along the lines of ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". I wouldn't recommend moving Juwan Johnson back to WR just because he had a career year and entered the league as one. 2) That CJGJ would've realized he could make bank in an elite secondary. He seemingly already knew that being that he played in an elite secondary and wanted to make bank. I don't think DA moving him to SS would've been an epiphany for him.

He wanted top 10 safety money despite not having played safety for us. It wasn't just about the position, it was mainly about the money. The team (included numbers guy Mickey Loomis) decided he was asking more than they were willing to offer. His refusal to participate in camp after talks broke off meant there was no need to keep him, as he wasn't going to play.

Once he was traded, his leverage was gone. Nothing to lose by playing.

> Dennis Allen mishandled many injuries. 

I don't think DA has the medical license to clear someone for playing.

> Why wasn’t Lattimore on IR?

Should've been, yeah.

> Why did Winston play 2 division games with a broken back and a torn up foot?

Shouldn't have, yeah.

> Why did our top tier backup Dalton not start against the Panthers in week 3??

Should have, yeah, but Jameis was apparently cleared.

> Why didn’t Winston get a chance to start again if he was “healthy” per Allen??

Because the two times Dalton's job was most in jeopardy he put together he put together his best games of the season. Otherwise he wasn't losing games for us.

> Just so many bad decisions. Either Allen was not smart enough to ask the right questions or he botched the whole situation 

He probably asked the medical staff ""is he clear?"" and asked the players ""are you good to go?"" which is enough for me to make decisions but yeah if he didn't that'd be pretty poorly managed by him.


> SO MANY FANS DONT REALIZE ALLEN APPROVED EVERY CARMICHAEL OFFENSIVE GAMEPLAN

> Saints fans think Carmichael and Allen don’t have long discussions all week about the offensive game plans

Sure, DA has a part in the overall gameplan, but not the script as the game goes on.

> You really don’t think Dennis Allen wanted to run on 2nd and 10s?

No. Why the fuck would he comb over the play sheet and tell Pete you have to call runs on 2nd and 10? That's not how game plans work.

> You don’t think Allen told Carmichael to build a 10 play offense that was super conservative 

Well the play sheet was bigger than that, so I'm sure whatever game plan they agreed to had more than 10 plays. But again DA doesn't breathe on Pete's neck and  murmur ""it's 2nd and 10...run the damn ball"". If they did put together a big play sheet with copy and paste of the same 10 plays then yeah that's bad, but I don't think that's what happened.

> Dennis Allen CHOSE Andy Dalton OVER Jameis Winston 

Yeah. Seemed alright for the most part.

> Dennis Allen wants to run a 1985 bears offense, and Pete tried his best

That's super presumptive, on both counts. You said these were facts but now you're just assuming things.

> Pete isn’t amazing, but he was trying to use race car parts (Olave, shaheed, Winston, juwann, etc) to build a truck offense (ground and pound , etc) that Dennis Allen wanted

Again, presumptive. Isn't Pete paid to gameplan and actually call these plays? Why isn't he doing his job in your fantasy land? Pete probably saw our QB was our weakest point, and wanted to commit to the ground game because our best, most reliable player is our RB, and the hallmark of Saints offense over the past decade and a half has been strong OL play. In 2021 our leading receiver had 700 yards and couldn't separate. Of the 3 big offseason additions to the WR corps (CGM included) only Olave played more than half the season.

> Dennis Allen is WAY TOO CONSERVATIVE,

Agreed. Not enough risks on 4th down or in plus territory.

> no self respecting OC would ever want to come here.

Disagree. A new OC would have a solid OL, a fun toy in Kamara, a Taysom, a couple young WRs, and an opening for a QB they might be in love with. There's clay in place and a nice paycheck. No self-respecting OC would turn down a job where your starting expectation is to be better than 20th. 

> Why would any QB like Derek Carr want to come here either?

$$$ and a job. Any QB like Derek Carr is immediately the starter.

> Dennis Allen couldn’t even figure out how to use Kamara, Taysom hill right. 

You've breached over from saying DA signs off on the gameplan to suggesting DA has blackmail on Carmichael and is forcing him to misuse Taysom and Kamara. You can take off your tinfoil hat and acknowledge Pete didn't call good plays at good times.


> Oh and he didn’t realize mark ingram had a busted knee on that late dump off vs the Bucs

Pretty sure he was cleared to go in. Also DA doesn't play QB so he didn't check it down to Ingram on that play either.


> Besides the Maye and Mathieu mistakes above, Dennis Allen made several other mistakes in 2022 on his own side

Correct. Elaborate.

> Allen didn’t seem bothered to bring in any interior DL, even when guys like Malcolm Brown were free agents

Yes his trust in the current DT crop was bad. I've said this since last season. Malcolm Brown ain't that guy though. If he's any guy, he's JAG.

> Allen played Davenport the entire year when Granderson outplayed him the entire year

Davenport was among the highest at getting pressures early in the season when all our DL was doing was getting pressures, no sacks. The sacks never came for Davenport and he lost snaps to Granderson got more in every game after Baltimore, so half the season. Plus Granderson is more prone to getting swallowed up along the edge in the run game.

> Payton turner had great games when played, but almost never played 

He had great moments. Would hardly call them great games. 

> Allen let Chris Harris continually blow games, including the late hit out of bounds 

Harris stopped getting snaps when Roby came back. Who else were we gonna play at nickel when Roby, Lattimore, and PJ Williams were all sidelined?

> Against Minnesota, Jefferson was burning Lattimore all game, and Allen never adapted. Jefferson was the reason the Vikings won

True. He had a little too much faith in our top 10 CB against their top 10 WR. 

> Against Cincinnati, Allen didn’t double cover JAMAR FREAKING CHASE and had little man Mathieu as the closest defender to help

You double cover Chase and then Boyd and Higgins singled up against the remainder of Harris, Adebo, and Roby. Do you want Harris single covering people or not? Not super simple.

> Chase probably has 50+ pounds on Mathieu

10 pounds actually

> Overall, Allen completely failed with a good roster 

Disappointed, yes. Failed would imply we didn't have a lot of young guys step up (Olave, Shaheed, Ruiz, Taylor, Werner, Elliss), that our defense sucked (interior run defense sure but the rest was elite), and that the locker room was lost (no indication it has been).

> Give us Daboll, OConnell, or McDaniel and we make the playoffs 

Dang so having someone else in charge of the offense would've been better? Wish I would've thought of that.

> DENNIS ALLEN, 2023 TANK COMMANDER. (Hopefully)

Hopefully not. I like it when the Saints win, personally. Half the people who want to tank just would just complain about how poor we play anyway.

- This uni combo is better than black on black.

- Penning looks nice in the run game. Needs some reps and work on his pass sets.

- Offense has been humming along nicely. But the situational playcalling/decision making hurts us. Missed throw by Dalton, questionable playcall on 4th and 1.

- Olave and Shaheed are beauts.

- I know we're playing a lot of backups on their DL, but this preseason OL looks alright.

- I am comfortable with Dalton returning next year provided we try to add a starter.

- Pass defense is elite. I'm saying it.

- Run defense is pretty abysmal.

- This is probably Davenport's last game in black and gold. Likely the same for Onyemata unless he takes a discount. Need to add a disruptive DT this offseason.

- Next year we've gotta figure out how to create more takeaways defensively. Every time we get one we can see the impact it has on the entire vibe of the game. Far too few occurrences this season. And far too many the other way.

The point of the segment is to show the complexity of these playcalls as they're brought up in the huddle.

Most of the time the playcaller will call out the full play. Because you might notice that the playcaller's sheet usually has a lot more depth to it than a QB wristband.

You'll see when Taysom checks in at QB, Andy will look at his wristband and relay something quick to Taysom (likely a number), and Taysom will read the full play once he's in the huddle. That's an instance where Pete would likely call a play number and not the full play.

You can check any QB mic'd up and not one will say ""hey guys it's play 57"". That doesn't mean shit to anyone without a wristband.

> at millions per year your ass best know play 57 and all others

Wristbands change every week. Play 57 today won't necessarily be 57 next week, but Right Flip Zebra Scat will remain Right Flip Zebra Scat week to week.

Have we underperformed relative to our talent this season? Yes. Have there been game we look unprepared or flat? Yes. Have there been games where we shoot ourselves in the foot and it costs us the game? Yes.

That said, the past 6 weeks we've looked like a competitive team in each game. The 49ers game was the only one over that stretch where it didn't feel like we controlled the flow of the game. The defense, despite missing Pete Werner, who was having a Pro Bowl caliber year pre-injury and Marshon Lattimore, a top 10 CB when healthy, has been overall solid over this stretch, giving up no more than 20 points a game.

I think the offense is sorely missing 1) more playmakers besides Taysom and AK 2) some creativity in the scheme. Last in the league in presnap motions. Last in the league in attempted screens. We're still moving the ball but I think there's another level of play were capable of.

The first half of the season we were very undisciplined. DA's coaching decisions have been very conservative.

- Taysom and Kamara are our offense. Andy is managing perfectly fine.

- Not a whole lot to add here. Overall solid if unspectacular game. Refs made it scary at the end but ball don't lie. Still alive.

- I am a fan of bird teams not from Atlanta the rest of the weekend.

- We've scored exactly 3 points on offense without All-Pro Cesar Ruiz. Obviously the major element affecting this squad.

- Our list of injuries is starting to resemble a Christmas wishlist for every kid in America in length.

- Pete Carmichael is so frustrating because there's very little creatively presnap, and when there is something he abandons it/doesn't evolve it. His game sense is a massive step back from Payton, more than expected preseason.

- If we never see a pop pass from Kamara out of that direct snap, see the previous point.

- In the first quarter we tackled well. Second quarter it's like the Browns were covered in butter.

- Cam Jordan is still good.

- All I want for Christmas is a takeaway by our defense (and a Saints win).

- What I blame Dennis Allen for: poor discipline defensively. What I don't blame Dennis Allen for: plays called on offense, because I'm smart enough to know he doesn't call plays on offense.

Yes, we run fewer screens and presnap motions than anyone else. Believe it or not we do run some outside zones, but Hurst is adequate at best, Ramczyk is having easily his worst season (which no one here ever seems to talk about) and Trautman keeps losing blocks on the outside. Oftentimes there's no outside for Kamara to go to. When your best OL are (a healthy) C and RG you tend to run more inside.

Carmichael has shown to be bad at playcalling once the game goes on. His scripted plays to start this week were great. I think it's reasonable to ask him to be more creative during the game, absolutely. He's been disappointing but I do think saying he's the worst (I assume you're just talking about OCs and not DCs) coordinator in the league is hyperbole.

27115,247925,247925,myxanders,"This post doesn't include Calvin Throckmorton or literally any of our middling DTs so it's not remotely close to accurate. I'd also argue there are worse players than you mentioned purely based on the fact they don't see the field.

Tyrann has been unspectacular and a downgrade but worst player? Nah.

Kamara is not even close to 10 worst players lmao.

Callaway isn't the worst he's just got a reduced role because he's not starting quality despite the hype most people here put on him last year.

Davenport has been solid and gets pressures but not sacks. Easily the second best DL this season behind Cam.

Harris was serviceable for a game or two but there's a reason he was a PS guy so sure I may agree.

Adebo has had a sophomore slump and he had a costly PI against Tampa. I wouldn't put him in top 20 players on the team but I wouldn't put him bottom 10.

Landry has been fine when healthy. Again not spectacular but not top 10 worst.

Turner has been hurt and has had flashes. Similar to Adebo in that he isn't among our best but I would say there are worse players on the team right now, particularly on the DL.

Jameis played hurt and he wasn't very good outside of 1 quarter of play. Again, not sure I'd call him worse than 50+ other guys who have played for us this year.

Dalton has been steady at QB and not great. But the last few games we haven't been winning or losing because of Dalton. 3 out of 4 games now he's been exactly what we needed of him.

The fact you only included guys in positions with easy to look at stats or easily memorable plays/fuckups shows you're not serious about this list.

27195,248025,248025,myxanders,"Postgame thoughts:

- Carmichael felt like he hit a sweet spot in the second quarter of the season but holy crap the playcalling has been tragic the second half of the year.

- Carmichael got two chances to run a four minute drill tonight and failed miserably (also failed vs Cincy). He's got minimal game sense in calling plays. Don't care how smart he is and how well he can scheme things up if he can't call plays real-time. He deserves to be fired more than DA.

- I'm so sick of seeing our defense take the brunt of the criticism because this offense can't sustain drives when they need to. They've played winning football 3 weeks in a row and we're 1-2.

- It's no coincidence that since McCoy got hurt our run game has struggled behind Throckmorton and Josh Andrews. All-Pro Cesar Ruiz is turning sure losses into 2-3 yard gains.

- I'm not necessarily saying Olave is him but I've never seen Olave and him in the same room.

- Dalton was good enough tonight.

- Defense is starting to turn it up at the right time. Interior DL needs to be better though.

- I saw posts asking if we should trade Cam in the lead up to this game. Fuck my life if Cam plays a snap for any other team.

- First time I've said this but Adebo's job may be in jeopardy once Lattimore gets healthy. His lows have been far worse and far more often than Taylor's. Disappointing after a really good rookie year.

- For fucks sake go for it on 4th and 1 just once I beg you.

- Special teams stepped up today.

- I've been 27 for two days and sports already suck.

- 0-2 in black helmets. Keep the golf full time.

- All-Pro C/G Cesar Ruiz deserves better than this offense.

- Rasheed Shaheed is a better Deonte Harty right now. 

- Can't believe I'm saying this but WRs are letting Dalton down tonight. He's doing enough to win.

- The fact we've only run a screen *once* out of that 3-stack formation with Taysom at QB is a playcalling travesty. We've run QB draw out of that like 10 times.

- I can't wait for McCoy to get healthy so Throckmorton/Andrews no longer have to start.

-  Our defense is at its best when Cam Jordan is on the field. Go figure. No idea why he was taken off the field majority of the 1st quarter snaps but I feel like they averaged 5+ yards per play when he wasn't out there.

- Cookie Monster is a little thumper at CB. Clean up the holding penalties and I feel amazing.

- ~~Defense went and got their allergy exam and the needle marked for takeaways left such a large welt you could see it from space.~~ fucking finally thank you Demario but I'm not deleting my poetry

- That takeaway shows just how important turnovers are to momentum and scoring opportunities. The lack of them by our defense and the influx of them by our offense have swung games unfavorably far too much this season.

- Hold your tablets tightly tonight.

- They really fired the cannons after a third down conversion because they weren't sure they'd get another chance to.

- No one loves shooting themselves in the foot and wasting scoring opportunities than we do.

27248,248092,248092,myxanders,"> The fact the New Orleans Saints gave up everything heading to the future for Drew Brees to get his last super bowl to only beat themselves in the playoffs vs the Vikings, Rams, and then the Buccaneers when they have beaten them TWICE in the regular season (which doesn't matter) and Brady gets all the glory. 

Not sure the point here. At least we went down swinging. I’d argue we didn’t necessarily beat ourselves against the Rams but I digress.

> This team is now worth nothing, shittiest season ever played by both the coaching and players. 

Shittiest by each player individually? Or as a team? 2014, 2012, 2007, 2005 were all pretty shitty teams imo.

> The off-season hype recap looks like trash, we really hyped up a 30-year-old Tyrann Mathieu, and Jarvis Landry when they barely thought about using him,

Agreed. Wasn’t expecting such a sharp decline but the dropoff is apparent.

> Michael Thomas is a useless human pussy garbage can due to injuries and being useless off the field, don't know why yall like that dumb cunt,

2020 he got hurt in garbage time and tried to rush back early to give Brees one more ride. Didn’t pay off. 2021 from what we know is his fault due to stubbornness. This season he came back and was competitive and broke his toe. I can’t speak for who he is as a person but ‘useless human pussy garbage can’ seems extreme. I personally like him because he’s proven that when healthy he’s a menace on the field. That 2019 campaign was something special and it’s a shame he hasn’t recovered since.

> Mark Ingram being traded last year to only be used in useless plays this year and watching him retire soon,

Another veteran regressing more than anticipated, yeah.

> Chauncey Gardner johnson was the worst trade right behind Ricky Williams in the Ditka era,

It takes two to tango. Words gets out a guy in a contract year isn’t going to practice or play for his team then that team loses a lot of leverage. It’s not like the team turned down a first round pick to send him to Philly for what they did. We traded Darren Sproles for a 5th and that became Ronald Powell. So all we need is for the picks we acquired to get more than 2 career tackles and that’s already a better trade. We also traded Akiem Hicks for Michael Hoomanawanui straight up. The other 24 trades involving a player since that Williams trade has been a wash or a good deal.

> Kamara along with Lattimore, etc, in the 2017 draft keeps looking worse as players go elsewhere and succeed more with them and have the Saints in a dumpster.

This is probably the dumbest point. The 2017 draft class is absolute not looking worse. Every one of those guys saw success in New Orleans (except Muhammed) and every one of them who moved on is also finding success. It’s hard to pay seven guys their market value at the same time when they’re all starter quality.

> Mickey Loomis has not received enough criticism for his incompetent management of the cap salary and honestly looks closer and closer to being fired. 

He’s received plenty of criticism for how he’s handled it. We *still* put together competitive teams for the greater part of 12 years since the uncapped season. He’s well aware that tactic is not as viable. He said as much this past offseason. I have no idea where you’re getting the idea he’s ‘closer and closer to being fired’.

> Dennis Allen is a coach that should have been on the Saints before 2005, absolute garbage how he ruined a wonderful franchise to watch due to being blinded by constant errors he says he could clean up. HIS RECORD ON THE RAIDERS HAS BEEN 12-36, 8-28, AND 4-8 CURRENTLY IN NEW ORLEANS.

DA has been underwhelming to say the least, yes. Pretending this wasn’t the smartest hire given the circumstances of the hiring process is retcon.

> The Saints have been so poverty

tf does this even mean

> that the injury reports must be a result of the medical staff mismanaging injuries, it's atrocious, and they JUST FIRED A PREVIOUS MEDICAL STAFF LAST YEAR.

The team let go of the strength and conditioning coach last offseason. The Director of Sports Medicine left for LSU before the 2021 season. The new guy seems to be an overhaul of both those positions. I’d argue it went downhill when the Director of Sports Medicine (Beau Lowery) left. If you recall, injuries sucked last year too.

> Get ready for a new era revisit with paper bags and an empty super dome again, this team does not deserve the fans' energy and love

Anyone who brings out the paper bags has been spoiled by the last 15 years holy crap. But hey, if it means better seats for cheaper then cool I’ll have fun without y’all.

> and I hope it all backfires if those idiots actually have the audacity to keep Dennis Allen for next year. 

Spoiler alert: >!they have the audacity!<

> What I expect from the Saints' terrible decisions next year is they do not trade Sean Payton until 2024 and just let him go when they could have gotten first-rounders,

Again, they have his rights until 2025. He’s not sitting out for 2 more seasons after this one. No team is gonna wait through 2 more seasons after this to inquire about him.

> and cut, and leave players for free agency in order to ""better"" themselves when they worsen for 2024. 

Yeah they’ll probably let some more guys go rather than restructure so the team doesn’t fall back into the same cap trap. You literally wrote a sentence earlier about how stupid the cap maneuvers were before and now you’re gonna mock the idea that they avoid doing that this offseason.

> I just would trade Kamara for top 5 picks, same with dumbass Michael Thomas so he won't become a locker room cancer for 2023 or 2024,

CMC went for a handful of day 2 and 3 picks. This offseason Kamara (+ legal issues) is not worth that much, let alone top 5 picks. Also not worth the dead money for trading him. I’d rather pay him to play for us than pay him not to. Same with Thomas, who is also not fetching top 5 picks.

> and trade Lattimore, cam Jordan, and Demario Davis for the sake that their loyalty doesn't deserve to be spent in their later years in a trash team.

I’m so confused, would you rather tank and have no players and no money or build off what we have? Again, you demonized the cap moves earlier only to – in the same breath (at least I assume same breath as there were no line breaks) – do exponentially worse things to the cap. 

> We dont even have a QB for the future until 2024 when we have 30 for 30 Winston and Andy ""mediocre"" Dalton throwing picks or making no touchdowns. 

Not wrong. Maybe sanest point you’ve made.

> GET CHRIS HARRIS JR OFF THE TEAM, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE STAFF???? 

Dawg we’ve had like 2 healthy outside corners most of the season. Nickel corners don’t grow on trees, especially ones that aren’t demanding to be paid as much as the top safeties on the free agency market.

> Wil Lutz and Blake Gillikin have been mediocre and disappointing with missed field goals and short punts to give the other team advantage. What hurts as well is the Saints defense has 2 interceptions through 12 games, pathetic. we were a top 5 D last year and it all popped like a balloon.

Correct. Special teams overall has taken a step back. I’d still take Lutz over the kicker carousel last year though. And the defense is allergic to INTs.

> These are my predictions and can't actually tell what will happen which is why it infuriates yet worries me how terrible this team has been. It seems pretty obvious when the Detroit Lions lose but lose with passion and hope to win more games, which seems to be going on around the team, basically a rebuild going well, same with the New York Jets having a better record than us.

Yes, the Lions who are on Year 7 of their rebuild and not there yet and the Jets who are on Year 12 of their rebuild and don’t have a QB of the future either.

> We are sadly the worst team in the NFL 

I encourage you and everyone else who keeps echoing this to watch the Texans, Bears, Broncos, Jaguars, or Rams play football right now. Not everything on this team is either top 5 or worst in the league. Are we super disappointing? Absolutely. But there are worse teams right now.

> and yet Tom Brady is still on top with a mediocre season, and won a super bowl since joining our division, TRASH.

He’s the GOAT QB. Give him a functioning supporting cast and he’ll contend. The Buccs did that the past two years.

Davenport is Cam Jordan lite. Bigger, younger, but a little less consistent against the run and doesn't finish pass rushes as well as Cam. He's still impactful at edge but he's the king of ""almost sacks"". In a vacuum I'd be more willing to re-sign him but him being an edge rusher balloons his market, so I think he's priced out.

- We had a chance to make it a one score game with 10 minutes to play but then point number 1.

- Another chance to make it a one score game with 6 minutes to play but point number 1. Two drops and two whiffs in pass pro by Hurst.

- RedZone playcalling continues to be atrocious. Absolutely embarrassing.

- Great to see Taylor's ball skills but of course it was undone by point 1.

- Olave is an elite route runner and I have 0 regrets about the trade.

- Cesar Ruiz's All-Pro play has severely overshadowed  how Ramczyk is easily having the worst year of his career so far.

- Run defense looked better than they have of late. Wish the pass rush could balance that out by getting some sacks.

- With Roby back and Lattimore getting healthy I think I've had enough helpings of Chris Harris.

- I trust Lutz more from 50+ or with a chance to win/tie than I do from <50 with a chance to cut the lead right now.

- We are so predictable when we're not actually planning on running a play on 4th down. We're 4-7 and have trailed for most of game time and we've only actually gone for it 8 times all year.

- One day we'll force a turnover and *not* get it called back. Hopefully before my kid who hasn't been conceived yet gets their drivers license.

- Our players' feet look like Swiss cheese because of how often point number 1 happens.

- Winning the battle for field position does fuck all if you can't get points and you can't win the time of possession battle.

- Offense gotta start taking some early chunks on possessions. Get some rhythm going. Need to get some time of possession. Our D is gonna start wearing down.

- OL has been mostly good.

- If we could stop giving the ball away whenever we get moving that'd make me so happy.

- Defense playing a great ""bend don't break"" game. Pass rush needs to win battles a bit quicker.

- There's no killer instinct in this team. Can't finish pass rushes. Can't generate takeaways. Can't take advantage of good field position.

- When Werner comes back that means Elliss takes over whatever snaps Baun would get which is a double positive.

- Gillikin with a strong half.

- Last week we did a great job of adjusting at halftime. Need to do the same this week.

- I would like a chance at first place next week so please finish strong.

Brees could put the ball in the exact spot it needed to be - short or long throw, pre-noodle arm or during noodle arm era - it was on target with anticipation.

Mahomes gets the yardage and the scores based off raw arm talent and playmaking ability. Brees got similar production based off of precision. It's two different skillsets, and both are very beautiful to watch and appreciate.

- The team that took the field in the second half looked like a completely different team.

- Offense was grooving that second half. Scores on the first 3 possessions. Utilized all of our weapons.

- Can't spell ""I love you Chris Olave"" without OROY.

- OL was about as good as you could expect with the entire left side being backups. 

- Cesar Ruiz for All-Pro. Aaron Donald is scared of him.

- Ever since the Rams collapsed in week 18 last year they can't hold onto their half time leads oh no

- Rams still trying to score at the end of the game with a bunch of backups in what a bunch of tryhards

- This offense will live and die with how the Taysom package is used and evolved the rest of the season.

- Defense sorely missed Cam. And also Davenport. But mostly Cam.

- No turnovers. Minimal penalties. Disciplined football is good football.

- Special teams is the best it's looked all year. Lutz nailing kicks. Gillikin back to punting like a pro. Return team getting big plays. They need to run midplay gimmicks to outdo our coverage unit.

- I just want Cam, Lattimore, Peat, McCoy, Werner (and CGM) back asap :'(

- Much better from the coaching staff this week. Team looked prepared and came out at halftime firing on all fronts. **We need to be putting this together in back to back weeks though.**

-  A lot more offense in this one than I expected if I'm being honest.

- This offense is operating about as best as you can hope for having a below average QB and 3 backups on the OL.

- I think play calling is improved this week. The Taysom package continuing to evolve is important for the sustainability of Taysom in the offense. Dalton and Winston couldn't be more complete opposites on how they use check downs.

- Ruiz has gotten the better of Donald so far. I am once again asking that he be recognized this awards szn.

- The defense was playing pretty good overall. Then that last drive the pass rush just kept getting stonewalled and made it way too easy.

- The little things like setting the edge or fasting pass rush wins are what we are missing without Cam and Davenport.

- We are the least healthy team in the league according to that FOX stat. So naturally we've lost another DE.

- I'm a big fan of limiting penalties and not turning the ball over. I'm not a big fan of another half of 0 takeways.

Tanking can happen at the front office level and arguably down to the head coaching level (see recent controversy with Lovie and the Texans at the end of the season or the Flores-Dolphins controversy). But below that, every assistant coach and every player is out there giving it their all with very few exceptions. Those exceptions might be something like a skill position player declining to hit someone aka ""business decision"" but otherwise they know their value is tied to their performance on tape and they have no reason to tank their own career prospects for the good of the organization. I guess you could argue that it becomes little challenging to motivate them if it's clear that the front office thinks the season is over, but that's subjective and hard to quantify.

We see front office-level tanking every year.

Let's say a defensive tackle mauls the QB about 3 full seconds after the ball is thrown. It's a blatant penalty. No argument from anyone there. Instead of gifting the offense 15 yards, simply boot the DE from the game (after a review of course) and suspend him for X games. For less severe examples, like reckless but not blatantly foul play like a DB colliding with a WR the wrong way, you can apply less severe penalties, but do NOT change the outcome of the play unless the infraction directly influenced the outcome of said play. In other words, a sack is still a sack and it's still 4th down. If the defender hit the QB dangerously, then punish the player directly and maybe the team indirectly (off the field - see below) if they do it too often.

You can also grade teams on how many instances of dangerous/reckless play they had in a given year to rank them by ""clean"" play level overall. The cleanest teams get the extra 9th home game and will get more primetime games than the dirty teams (the NFL doesn't want horrific injuries on primetime national TV... right?). You could also take draft picks from the dirtiest teams and award them to the cleanest teams on a sliding scale if you really wanted to punish them. I'm sure there could be more ways to reward/punish too - those are just off the top of my head.

* A ring or at least a couple of conference titles
* Pro Bowl - should have several of these on the resume
* MVP / All Pro or at least a clear top 3 QB for a few seasons
* Big career stats / records - often comes with consistent, long careers

So let's look at how Luck was doing as far as the above criteria:

* Rings / Championships:  He brought the Colts to the AFC title game just once. So let's go with ""no"" on this one.
* Pro Bowl type accolades:  He was a 4x pro bowler in his 6-7 seasons, depending if you count the fully injured one. So I think it's certainly plausible that he would have continued to rack up such accolades.
* MVP or top 3 QB:  He was a borderline #3 one year but otherwise was #5-8 range for his few full seasons that we got to see. So I'm going to go with ""no"" on this one.
* Career stats/records:  He was certainly putting up some big yardage in the few full seasons that we got to see, so I would call it plausible that, if he had managed to hang in there for 20 years, he would have been up there in career numbers. But, then again, wouldn't a lot of QBs have huge numbers if they hang around that long?

So I guess my opinion is that we only saw him working toward 2 of the 4 check boxes. If he continued on that path for a long career, he probably would have ended up in the Hall of Very Good with guys like Philip Rivers.

27893,257815,257815,physedka,"Just a theory, but I think the rushing ability is more of a liability in the media's eyes. I have long suspected that they have an inherent bias against running QBs because they know that injuries will be more frequent and it will hurt their bottom line in terms of eyeballs and ad revenue when they are sidelined. The sports media likes to hype matchups and especially the main heroes of those matchups. Everyone tunes in to watch Lamar Jackson's Ravens but no one tunes in to watch Tyler Huntley's Ravens when Lamar is on the sidelines. Just look at all the work that has been done to protect the pocket passers via rules changes over the past 40 years. The NFL and the related media knows where their bread is buttered and they invest in it.

That's not to say that the pure pocket passer archetype QBs can't get hurt, obviously, but it's far less frequent than anyone running with the ball down the field regularly. I once thought it was more about racism against the higher number of dual-threat QBs that are black going back to Randall Cunningham days, Michael Vick, etc. But I think it might be more about the risk in the media's eyes. They would rather hype something like a Tom Brady vs. Aaron Rodgers matchup because the odds are very high that they will both be on the field when the time comes and playing without injury.

So going back to my original point, I think the media disrespects Hurts because they think that at some point, he's going to get mangled while running down the field and it will hurt their ratings when he's on the sidelines or if he's not playing at a high level.

Remember that a kickoff is a live ball as opposed to a punt where if the kicking team touches it, the ball is dead and goes to the return team. If the kicking team gets a kickoff ball, it's the same as recovering a fumble. So the Raiders were raising their odds of getting a turnover or pinning their opponent deep because the returner basically has to field the ball instead of letting it bounce into the end zone.

While it's true that this would be fair because any team could do this, the NFL doesn't like it because they already have the stance that kickoff returns are dangerous and would prefer to encourage more touchbacks.

For example, go back and check out that long pass to Tyreek in the middle of the 3rd. He was pretty well covered but their feet got tangled and the CB fell.

Outside of a few hits here and there, his drafting was pretty shit until Jeff Ireland came on board (the Lattimore/Kamara draft).

On the flip side, I'm not sure anyone consistently got more out of what they had to work with than Payton (even if his decisions directly resulted in ""what he had to work with"").  He and Brees carried those historically bad defenses to 7-9 (bleh) records or better.  For a brief moment, he made some people believe Jameis Winston was salvageable. When Brees went down, he steered a Teddy Bridgewater-led ship to almost not miss a beat.

The Taysom as a real QB romance was obviously misguided, but even then, we had a winning record.

One thing I will say about Payton is that he was always decisive and fully committed - and never scared to take a risk if he thought it was the best chance for the team.  Even if I disagreed with something he did, I always felt like he believed in it and got his players to believe in it.  In terms of motivation, fire, having the buy-in and support of the players, he is near the very top level of coaches, if not at the top.

My friend is a Packers fan, and after one of their playoff losses, he wrote in to a mailbag basically just saying ""Mike McCarthy is scared"" over and over because of his game management and decision making.

Having watched a ton of games with that friend, his feeling with McCarthy was always ""we're still gonna fuck it up"", while my feeling with Payton was always ""we've still got a chance"".

Didn't know the Donald was a Rams fan. Neat.

But to your point, as long as there are threads asking about sore spots or worst calls or bad officiating in general, this will come up.  

And you are right: bad calls went both ways.  But the bad calls were not equal. You get the Goff facemask, you get first and goal, hell, let's say you even get a touchdown.  Cool.  There's still 6 minutes left in the game, we still drive down, and we still have a chance to win the game. That doesn't even account for the hands to the face/roughing the passer on Brees in overtime on the pick, but you probably don't want to talk about that.

However, if you go back through the comments in this thread, no Saints fan was ""crying"" here or really saying much other than ""yea, that sucked"" until you felt attacked and butthurt and the need to ""defend"" your team.  

Imagine being so sensitive, salty, and attention whorey that you go into a thread about ""most painful moments"" for each team, knowing 100% what Saints fans will bring up, see that they are talking about it in a pretty normal manner, and then decide that you have to jump into that sore wound and twist a little knife in it just for the fuck of it *after you benefitted from it* and then call the fans ""crybabies"" after you instigated them responding to you.

Any new GM would theoretically need to display competence, which SHOULD include a plan to rebuild the team. Loomis or the new GM should not be ""on the hook"", so to speak, for the rebuilding process.

Dennis Allen is under contract.  Unless he pulls a Payton, he is here next year.  If he learns how to not be a completely overwhelmed, overmatched, ""keep doing what you're doing"" shitbird and actually connect with and command the respect of his players by the end of next year, great! Then he can stay on and steer the ship forward. If not, bye Felicia.

Players is a huge mixed bag.  Those under contract, well, they are under contract.  To those we want to resign or pursue in free agency, it should be obvious and made clear what the plans for the team are.  There should be no illusions or false sales pitches.  ""Look, we have some adversity ahead of us, but we have a plan to weather it, and we see you as part of that plan and as part of the path to winning again once we are through it.""

Hopefully, that coupled with not having a quarterback or first round pick will be enough to convince all in charge to embrace the tank, err, rebuild.

As I see it, *very* optimistically:

2022: dead. done. shit.

2023: no first rounder, eat cap, suck, trade away aging vets for picks (cap permitting, and for shitty picks), hope for pick 1:1 in 2024. Fire Dennis Allen into the sun (and Pete Carmichael if he doesn't retire after 2022). If Payton comes back and we trade him, I would expect a minimal return, maybe a 4th rounder - nothing worth getting hopes up about.

2024: eat remaining dead cap, so cap situation is clean after 2024, draft QB 1:1, hire coaching staff to support him and help him develop, focus remaining draft picks on the trenches, suck but with hopefully showing signs of things to build on.

2025: Clean cap, 2nd year QB on the cusp of taking the next step, proper coaching staff (one that hopefully does not enjoy penalties on every play), probably suck, but maybe sneaky good, foundation in place.

2026: Ready to compete.

More than likely, one of the following will happen: the QB will be a bust, the new coaching staff will be middling at best, injuries will conspire against us, or the complementary pieces drafted will fail to develop and create a proper foundation.  So it is much more likely that by 2026 we have some ingredients of success in place, but certainly not all of them, but at least with a more optimistic outlook moving forward, leading us toward our 10 year cycle coming to fruition and being in the NFC championship game in 2029.

Edit to add what I think our dumbass team will actually do: claim Baker, believe he is the missing piece, kick the restructured cap can down the road again past the ""dead end"" sign, trade picks to get back into the first round next draft to take a tight end, extend Andrus Peat again, because why not, suck moar longer.",72.0,nfl,t3_ze7oaz,False,0.0,:Saints: Saints,2022-12-06T09:55:49Z,saints,-0.0495486289379472

Dalton’s thing was he would panic and tuck the ball and then just kind of hunch over on wobbly knees for a couple seconds, then when the defender brushed him Dalton would fold up like a lawn chair. When Carr panics, his technique is more like a happy feet dance, and then he’ll just bolt in a random direction- straight into a defender’s arms usually.

This is a big part of why Brady’s pocket presence is so legendary. He was an expert as positioning himself in the pocket so that his lineman had the best possible angle to block the defenders. With Carr it’s the opposite- when he panics and dances in a random direction it literally makes it impossible for his lineman to stay on the defender (but you’ll almost always see the ignorant fans blaming the OL).

I have a sneaking suspicion that Carr’s issues with panicking and poor pocket presence really ramped up after he suffered that bad leg injury. You’ll see players change the way they play (usually for the worst) because they either consciously or subconsciously fear injury again. We’re seeing the same thing with Dak Prescott.

How often a team gets a big lead, and then the other team miraculously comes back to at least cover the spread. When the favored team wins but the loser covers the spread is when Vegas makes the most money. That result is what usually plays out.

The biggest indictment is the fact that the NFL could fix this. Full time refs, booth refs, a sky judge, cameras, AI.. there’s quite a few ways they could improve the officiating but they refuse to do it. The only explanation is that the NFL doesn’t want to fix the officiating. Remember when they made PI reviewable because of the blowback from the Rams no-call? Only lasted a year.. took too much control away from the refs/NFL, and they couldn’t have that. It was just a meager bone to last until the backlash blew over.
