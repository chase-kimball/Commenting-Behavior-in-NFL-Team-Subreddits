321,3368,3368,2ChainzTalib,"Starting out with my all time favorite football player, number 27. The Smiling Assassin. One of the most feared hitters to play the game. 

From his Hall of Fame entry:

>The Denver Broncos selected Steve Atwater out of Arkansas in the first round, 20th choice overall, of the 1989 NFL Draft. A hard-hitting and instinctive safety, Atwater played in 167 games during his 11-season career.

>He made an immediate impact at free safety in his rookie season. Atwater recorded 129 total tackles (2nd most on the team) to help turn around a Denver defense that ranked 20th in points allowed the previous year to become the NFL’s stingiest unit in 1989 that allowed the fewest points in the league. The Broncos finished that season with the AFC’s best record at 11-5 and a berth in Super Bowl XXIV.

>Atwater was voted to the first of eight Pro Bowls following the 1990 season and earned first-team All-Pro recognition for the first of two straight years (1991-92).

>In 1997, he was an integral part of the Broncos’ championship season that was capped by the franchise’s first Super Bowl title. Atwater contributed 83 tackles (61 solo), one sack, two interceptions, eight passes defensed, and two fumble recoveries as Denver finished 12-4. His strong play continued throughout the postseason. He added 15 tackles (10 solo), one sack, a forced fumble, and five passes defensed in four playoff games.

>Atwater played his final season with the Broncos in 1998 and he helped lead them to a second straight Super Bowl victory. That year he recorded one interception, seven passes defensed, and racked up 55 solo tackles 30 assisted tackles. He had four tackles, three assists and two passes defensed in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Atlanta Falcons.

>In all, Atwater, recorded 24 interceptions which he returned for 408 yards and a touchdown, added five sacks, and registered more than 1,000 tackles. He was named to the NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 1990s.

Sounds like Paige is asking for these guys to come in for a week or two as advisors and offer their opinions on how things could be improved, not in full time roles like GM, HC, or OC. 

For a 4-10 team with a brand new ownership group and rookie coaching staff, I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad idea. However, it would probably be best to pick just one or two of them as to avoid it becoming a distraction.

I don’t see how it could hurt to bring in Peyton Manning to talk with Russell Wilson about leadership and transitioning to a new team.

He’s shown he’s willing to learn and adapt from mistakes and I believe he would do a lot of things differently in a second go around.

I don’t think the Broncos should give him that shot. We have a roster that we expected to be in playoff contention (Before injuries I suppose), and yet here we are at 4-10 celebrating a win against a QB committee of Colt McCoy and Trace McSorley. Hackett has sunk too far into the quicksand and the results of this season have lowered our confidence as fans and shattered the league’s remaining respect for our team. 

We should be celebrating Russell Wilson as he passes legendary QBs on the all time records. Instead, we’re here watching other teams fans go out of their way to post apologies and condolences on our subreddit while we see countless posts about how many bathrooms are in Russell Wilson’s house compared to how many touchdown passes he’s thrown this season.

I would love to see Hackett turn things around and become a top coach in the league because I think he is a good person and I want to root for his success. But someone must be held accountable for the historic failures of this season and it won’t be our $250 million quarterback with an exemplary ten year track record.

4866,20693,20693,Bronco30,"I hate to be ""that guy"" but I work in cardiology and I'd like to make a correction to your post so there is not any confusion around the subject. He didn't suffer a heart attack. A heart attack is a ""myocardial infarction"" and is the result of a lack of blood/oxygen supply to the heart muscle tissue that contracts during a heartbeat.

What he suffered was cardiac arrest. It is very common for the two things to be misconstrued. Cardiac arrest is the sudden cessation of cardiac function usually due to a problem with the electrical pathways that deliver the impulses for a heartbeat. Cardiac arrest can occur AS THE RESULT of a heart attack but usually this is not the case. Most of the time in athletes the cause of SCA (sudden cardiac arrest) is due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This is thickening of the heart muscle from regular, prolonged endurance activities. When the heart muscle is thickening it can lead to problems with the electrical pathways that the impulse uses to tell the muscle to contract. 

In this specific scenario that is more than likely NOT what happened. Athletes at this level tend to be screened regularly to ensure that they don't have any underlying problems such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. What the doc is saying in the video is that he likely suffered from a condition called ""commotio cordis"" in which blunt force trauma causes a sudden, deadly arrythmia as a result from the heart being jarred at a specific time in the cardiac cycle. This throws off the rhythm and can spiral into ventricular fibrillation (quivering of the main pumping chambers of the heart as opposed to a cohesive squeeze.) From the ventricular fibrillation the heart can quickly fall into asystole and complete cardiac arrest. 

Below is a great and quick video of an example of an EKG going from normal sinus rhythm into a deadly arrhythmia and finally into cardiac arrest:

edit: format + adding a tldr since this is being downvoted for some reason

tldr: heart attack is lack of blood flow to heart muscle tissues. cardiac arrest is the electrical activity in the heart stopping suddenly.

I really do think it’s as simple as Irsay believing (correctly) that the Colts OLine is underperforming and he wanted Saturday in as a coach to get them on track. Saturday was not interested in being an Oline coach only and so he probably thought the easiest way he could get him on staff to fix the Oline is to make him interim HC.

With that being said, last night was probably the worst game I have ever watched as a fan of the team. When you combine our expectations this season, how absolute ass and injured the Colts were, our 3rd primetime game in 5 weeks, and this is what we get.

I worked 12 hours yesterday so by the time I got home I honestly wasn’t excited about the game. I just told myself well let’s see not how we win but how we just don’t lose. And then drive after drive of nothing, Matt Ryan literally BEGGING us to stay in the game with his terrible INTs. They lost their backup RB on the first drive, which is apparently our kryptonite because whenever we play a team with a 3rd string RB we lose.

It’s only 5 games, but it’s officially fair to ask these questions. Is Russ…bamboozling us? Is he actually any good anymore? Every game has had underthrown bombs, overthrown fades, short passes with way too much heat on it, and top it off with his INTs and miss on the final play. How does he miss Hamler? HOW? Is Hackett even remotely ready to be a head coach? He looks lost and confused, and the team doesn’t feel bought in. When we were in shotgun on 4th and 1 then a timeout was called I thought surely, now he’ll go under center and we’ll easily run this for a first or TD, as the running game had gotten better throughout. Then we go back out in shotgun again, time out. Surely this time we’ll figure it out! Nope, shotgun again.

I could keep going, but any excitement I had for this season is over. The only hope I have is seemingly the entire league except maybe 3-5 teams look like .500 at best right now.

Instead, we hit the full bronco bingo card—a Gordon fumble to completely fuck up momentum and flip the game around, 16 points, a total Hackett game management screw up at the end, capped off by the anti-clutch defense finally breaking when it matters most—all leading to getting swept for a 3rd year in a row by the raiders, by three different coaching staffs, the third being Josh McDaniels. And it’s not like they were even a good team either. I can handle the chief sweeps, those games stopped hurting in 2019. But I cannot stomach this “can’t beat the raiders” thing. That’s a bridge too far. Even if we’d gone 6-11, I could’ve handled it with a raiders win.

If they lose (like they did), then our starters are just going to play 2 drives and then they’re done. If he’d said something like that, that would at least lower the temperature a bit where someone could at least say “okay, there’s something resembling a plan here.” But instead, he allowed himself to get caught in no-man’s land with this weird “idk what tf we’re doing” game plan, which ended up burning him. And if you do too much of that, then even when one of your gambles “works,” you’re still going to get shelled because people will think that the process wasn’t right—if that makes sense. Broken clock scenario. It’s a similar thing we experienced with Hackett (setting all the other just general bad coaching aside). It just felt like he was permanently reacting, rather than saying, “okay, this is what the plan is for X. This is our process.” And it was most evident on that Seattle field goal where he freaked out and rather than saying, no, we’re not settling for this, we have to get closer, he did what he did.

Point is, people are a lot more comfortable with decisiveness, or at least the appearance of it. It just feels “safer.” At least from your leaders. With indecision, you put yourself in a permanent no-win situation. And I think with Staley, despite the numerical success, it’s sort of a “once you see it, you can’t unsee it” thing, fair or not, and it’s the type of posture that’s woven into who you are as a person, meaning, it’s extremely hard to change, which tells those fans that he’s pretty much always gonna be the guy going for weird 4th downs and making bizarre decisions that only sometimes pan out, which in turn, is going to waste the prime years of their young star quarterback. So while yes, you could definitely do worse than Staley, you could absolutely do better as well, especially with someone like Payton openly willing to come coach your team",2.0,denverbroncos,t3_10d1kkv,False,0.0,Super Bowl 33,2023-01-16T07:57:48Z,denverbroncos,0.0515073744499686

While Russ has definitely played bad for good chunks thus far, Hackett has more of the cloud hanging over his head (fairly or not) which makes it easier to make him the fall guy, and while the one and done coaches are certainly a bad look, they can just chalk him up as the next Freddie Kitchens or Steve Wilks or Chip Kelly—all of whom were replaced by much better coaches. It’s a lot harder to one-and-done your $250M QB while he’s still young enough to be effective, coming off his first year in an entirely different situation where there were more problems than just him; and frankly, his name value far exceeds Hackett’s, and that’s gonna keep Russ here at *least* another two years I’d say, bare minimum. They’ll make sure he’s bad with *two* head coaches before tossing him overboard. Paton is safe for next year I think—despite the redditor freak outs saying otherwise, he’s not some primary source to blame for a lot of this, and is still considered one of the top talent evaluators in the league, and has built a very good roster in the limited time he’s been here—yes, there are OL issues, but no GM is perfect. To fire *him* after this season would be extremely hotheaded and not only *not* solving a problem, but creating a new one.

- The fumbles

- Hackett—who maybe needed a punch in the face type game

- Penalties, holy shit the penalties

I worked at a hotel that had some regular professional athlete visitors. 

Mark Schlereth. Very cool! First Bronco I ever met and always was willing to talk about them. When I got the first iPad I was showing it off to him and we went to YouTube and watched Alex Gibbs blocking instructional videos and we talked about how lineman watch tape. 

Ryan Clady. Absolute giant of a person. Told him I was a fan and kept it moving. 

Larry Fitzgerald. He seemed like a decent guy, possibly his agent was traveling with him and didn’t really let him interact beyond asking for an extra pillow. 

Jerry Rice. The only person I ever asked for an autograph, because one of my best friends was obsessed with him. He very graciously made one out to him, and another visit he asked for a travel toothpaste and as I was walking over to hand it to him, I stopped, threw it to him and he did the standard Jerry Rice catch. How many people can say they threw Jerry Rice a pass?

Steve Young - met him once when he filmed a commercial and then again at my hotel job. He was just as gracious as he was to a dumb kid watch him read his lines as he was to the adult who told him what time breakfast hours were. 

Tom Jackson - at the same commercial shoot as Steve Young. Very cool. A lot of the other kids didn’t know who he was but as a Bronco fan I did.  

Patrick Crayton - had the absolute biggest wrist watch I’ve ever seen. 

Lomas Brown - genuinely cool dude. I loved seeing him. 

Jon Ritchie - good dude, one time hung out and chatted with my brother when he found out he was an Eagles fan.

Trent Dilfer - as big of football nerd as his rep was, kind of a douche. I have a 1998 Washington playbook (that I believe was owned by Mike Martz) and he looked at it for an hour with me.

Jon Gruden - had an aura about him. Very intimidating. Probably because he’s racist.

10156,61013,61013,IamLiterallyAHuman,"*sigh*

I can't believe I'm entertaining this idiocy but here we are.

Let's start with the existing data on Russ at the time of the trade, shall we?

For 10 straight years Russ had posted 20+ td seasons, with good yardage and low int numbers. He hadn't missed a game due to injury until last year when he had that finger injury. He had led his team to 10+ wins in every year except last year, and let's be honest, with how he played last year(25 tds, 3,000 yards, and 6 picks), the Seahawks would have been back in the playoffs had he not been injured. Yeah he didn't look great right after coming back, but he was definitely rushed back, and was back to his early season MVP caliber form(10 tds and no picks to start the year) for the final six games of the season.

The Seahawks looked like they needed a rebuild, we just looked like we needed a QB, match made in heaven. So we make the trade. In the end, two firsts isn't the end of the world.

People clown on the contract, but I don't. We had 10 years of Russ's elite play to reference. It was an alright decision at the time, and would've been hailed as a great move if he continued to play well.

Now, that didn't happen obviously, but what went wrong, let's be generous and say that while Russ didn't help matters, effort hasn't been the issue, and he had had flashes when he plays like the Russ of Seattle. If you look at how Hackett calls plays, it's like he is calling them for Aaron Rodgers and not Russell Wilson, meaning he's treating him like a pocket passer, which Russ is not.

When Russ is out of the pocket, he is visibly better. We haven't seen enough of that this year.

Hackett's playcalling and overall coaching are to blame for this losing season and Russ's apparent poor play.

This is not to say none of the blame falls on Russ, he's made some bad decisions with the ball and he's not compensating for bad coaching like you expect out of an elite qb, that does not mean he isn't or can't still be elite.

I'm willing to bet that he'll be better with better coaching next year, along with more time spent with the offense.

10161,61018,61018,IamLiterallyAHuman,"Well, the team was established as a founding member of the AFL in 1960, which merged with the NFL in 1970.

The team kinda sucked up until the 1977 season when we made our first Super Bowl, only to lose 27-10 to the Cowboys. A few years later in 1983 we got John Elway, the best QB in Broncos history, who essentially carried the team to the Super Bowl multiple times and getting blown out, finally winning in 1997 and 1998, where he didn't actually have to carry us, instead we were carried by Terrell Davis.

The 2010's we had good QB play, but not elite, made a Conference Championship in 2005 but lost to the Steelers, drafted Jay Cutler the next year who was decent at best for us before being traded in 2010. 2010, was to put it mildly, terrible. 4-12. The next year we got John Fox as our coach and Tim Tebow(who we drafted the previous year) as our starting QB. What followed was a hilarious/miraculous run to the playoffs, with multiple 4th quarter comebacks to get to 8-8 in the regular season. We faced the Steelers at home in the playoffs and won in overtime on a clumsily thrown 80 yard TD pass to Demaryius Thomas(RIP).

2012 was great until it ended abruptly. We signed the GOAT Peyton Manning in free agency and started 3-3 on the season. Then waltzed to 10 straight wins and were on the verge of getting to the Conference Championship when Rahim Moore decided to be a complete idiot in defense and let up a game tying touchdown in the final minute of regulation. We lost on a field goal in second overtime. 2013 went mostly the same way except we made the Super Bowl, just for it to be mysteriously cancelled(to this day, no one knows why, or you could just look it up)

2014 was good, Manning started to decline and we had an early playoff exit again. Fox was fired and replaced by Gary Kubiak. Manning fell off a cliff in 2015, but our defense was incredible, we went 12-4, winning the first seed in the AFC, beating the Steelers and then the Patriots on the way to Super Bowl 50. Our opponent was the Panthers, who just had a magical 15-1 season. Easy win. 24-10.

Since then we've gone downhill with Manning and Kubiak retiring, and not knowing how to get a good QB. We've had our moments but otherwise it's been painful. Demaryius Thomas passed away last year as well.

We had hope this season as we made a move for Russell Wilson, but coaching has proved our undoing this year.


The current roster is interesting, we have a great defense, good offensive weapons, and someone who should be good at QB, but are underperforming on that front. The names to remember on defense are Pat Surtain II and Justin Simmons, on offense it's Russell Wilson, Jerry Jeudy, Courtland Sutton, and Javonte Williams(who's knee is unfortunately not at all healthy rn).

One last thing, the Raiders and Chiefs are rivals and are never to be respected. FTR, forever and always.

Edit:

I should add that Pat Bowlen was a great man and owner of this team, it's rare that team owners are beloved by the fans but we loved Pat. Another thing to add is that the team has an intimate connection with the State of Colorado, as the state doesn't have good college football and while hockey and basketball is good, the state is obsessed with football and thus the Broncos are Colorado's team, you can't really separate the two.",18.0,denverbroncos,t3_zs2ue7,False,0.0,3,2022-12-21T16:50:17Z,denverbroncos,-0.000789379209604

I'm just saying that, from my perspective, I saw a lot of it going the other way, too. And along those lines, from the outside it sometimes looked more like this than the way you've framed it (not saying my version is right and yours is wrong, only that this was a viable perspective at the time): 

Russell Wilson finally decided to jump ship after years of putting up with poor line play and allegedly being held back (which as we're now discovering might have been more Russ camp propaganda than anything). Instead of giving him a hearty farewell for all he brought the fanbase, the fanbase turned on him in a really ugly way, which then turned into not just ""I hope he doesn't succeed"" to ""fuck the Broncos I hope they tank."" 

I couldn't say which came first, but it's easy to see how it all spiraled. There's also another context at work, I think, which goes all the way back to SB 48. I know hawks fans got pretty upset about how they perceived being dismissed by the media prior to the game, whereas the actual media narrative was probably more split. Between subs, though, it  seemed from my perspective that just normal ""I like my team and I hope they beat your team"" shit talk by Broncos fans was interpreted by some hawks fans through that prism, so they saw it as ""How dare they disrespect our team by rooting for theirs!"" So at the end of that 43-8 shellacking, our mods spent the better part of two weeks banning alleged hawks fans invading our sub just to gloat. When you lose a game like that and your sub gets inundated with that kind of nonsense, it leaves a mark. So whether or not any commentary about Russ was in retaliation or even a popular viewpoint, it was easy for some Broncos fans to use it as evidence of a fanbase that was just as classless and entitled as it seemed in 2013. 

And so now we're here: what was supposed to finally get us out of the ditch has instead dug us deeper.  And guess who's here to rub salt in the wound again?  Random Seahawks fans. 

Of course the reality is that both fanbases are just very passionate and loyal, and on the whole have had greater success than most—as fanbases we do not handle significant adversity very well, on top of ALL fanbases having a lot of dickbags who say classless things. And yet as you say: at the end of the day it doesn't really matter, and it's largely beefs between people who enter into flame wars over these subjects because that's how the internet apparently works, lol.

15142,86924,86924,OpabiniaGlasses,"Calling those moves ""bad decisions"" really sells them short for how terrible they are. 

We're talking about one of the worst coaching hires in NFL history in Hackett. He's about to be a one-and-done embarrassment and I do not trust the guy who hired him to make the decision on who the next head coach should be. Especially when we know who Paton did interview (Hackett, O'Connell and Dan Quinn) and didn't interview (Daboll and McDaniel) for head coach.

We can argue about hindsight when it comes to trading for Russ. Personally, it was the #2 option I favored behind drafting a QB and ahead of trading for Rodgers (of the most-talked about QB moves they could have made in the off-season). But Paton made an evaluation on Russ and pulled the trigger on that trade. Obviously there's injuries and offensive coaching incompetence working against Russ, but there's still plenty of things that are still his fault alone, regardless of the situation around him. We judge GMs all the time for their ability to evaluate players and there's no getting around that Paton completely failed in evaluating Russ.

Even before Russ played a game and seeing how badly it's gone, there was no benefit to Paton signing him to that contract extension. We've seen so many QBs completely fall off a cliff in their late-30s. Locking up a 34 year old QB to a long term deal, with term still left on his current contract, is just a bad move. I'm sure part of Russ agreeing to the trade was having an extension drawn up for him, I get that. But that gets back to Paton's evaluation that the draft assets and cap space was worth it for Russ. Again, he failed.

>Payton will arrive Monday in Denver, pretty much for good, and the coaching staff will start to become known on Tuesday or so.

>“Here’s the thing I learned back in ’06: Slow to hire,’’ Payton said. “The mistakes I’ve learned over time is when you’re in a hurry – you’ve got to get your guy. That’s not the right thing. Slow to hire, fast to fire.”

>More than half of Nathaniel Hackett’s staff from the Broncos’ 2022 season has already moved on, and more changes will be coming.

>“I said this earlier, I think it’s important,’’ Payton said. “When you have a 5-12 season, there’s dirt on a lot of people’s hands. Obviously, the attention goes to the head coach and the quarterback. But the key is making the correct changes and turning this thing around.”

…

>Payton’s assistant coaching interview process is much more thorough than when he put his first staff together for the Saints in 2006. One reason is the Rooney Rule that extends past two head coach minority candidates, but also two minority interviews for each of the offensive, defensive and special teams coordinator positions and one for quarterback coach.

That would put him in the top 5 for passing TDs (just below Burrow), and #1 overall for total touchdowns by a QB.

It's contradictory but mirroring. Brady also had a higher QBR until his old age seasons dropped his average. 

Either Brady and Vinateri should be considered GOATS at their positions or Rodgers and Tucker should be otherwise you're not judging off the same standards.

The thing that got me was Rosburg acting on the field and on the interviews. He's an interim. He's probably getting canned soon. But even then, he really showed passion. He didn't need to, nobody would care if he didn't, but he went there and showed passion anyway. I think we were missing it. That's an improvement.

- Gave Wilson that massive extension before the season: I know, I know, hindsight is 20/20, you can't really blame him for make a move that EVERYONE agreed was great, but still this one might hurt. Gotta work hard to make sure Wilson plays well enough so that this deal doesn't hurt us.

In fact, it seems like we are regressing as if this was possible. Saying that the Broncos' offense will improve is an exercise in faith, not a sports analysis. For an ""offensive guru"", Hackett hasn't shown ANYTHING that makes me think ""well, at least that's an improvement"".  

But we can't put all the fault in Hackett for this game. I don't recognize Russell Wilson. Missing wide open guys, trying too hard to make throws that weren't there, throwing 2 mind-boggling interceptions. Guys, 2 INTs in FG range and one blocked FG. Just a single point in one of these 3 plays and this would be a win.  

I don't want to be that pessimistic and I know I'm probably overreacting after watching probably one of the Top 5 worst games of my entire life, but things don't seem like they'll get much better. To add insult to injury, the injury bug is running rampant again and we're losing one starter after another.

I'd say we should start thinking about the Draft but we've got no 1st and 2nd round picks because we traded them for our $250M QB that's somehow playing as bad as, if not worse than, our 11 other QBs after Manning.

- What if Geno had taken that sack?  
- What if the RBs had entered the endzone at least once?
- What if Saubert catches that ball?
- What if Tomlinson's shoe was one size smaller?
- What if the ball didn't slip out of Wilson's hand?
- What if McManus hits the FG?
- What if we went for the 4th & 5?
- What if we didn't have 12 penalties?

That said, there were a lot of positives in that game:  

- Wilson is the guy, as expected  
- Jeudy and Sutton will have a good year
- The TEs came to play
- The offense was finally moving the chains with ease
- Defense was bad at start, but they showed they can make adjustments

You’re 7-8 right now and Geno has regressed already. Hell, Russ put up more points against the chiefs than Geno did. Hate to break it to you but you’re already living in the mediocrity. Also I’ll bring this up anytime I can: your front office tried to trade Russ to the BROWNS in 2018. They tried to send him to QB purgatory. He put in a no trade clause in his contract after that. So, in reality, your front office wanted to move on from him before he wanted to leave. Oh but he was vague about wanting to leave/stay before leaving? (Which maximized his trade value btw) what a sin. Also half the people that have hated on him after are from people who have major character concerns themselves (Richard Sherman is obvious but Earl Thomas got kicked off the Ravens for being a shit teammate) he’s also still good friends with DK and Lockett, so clearly everyone there didn’t hate him. I honestly feel bad for y’all that you’ve been media narratived into hating the best QB you’ve ever had.

I agree, even though Paton will never admit it.

If we do hire an OC so good that they get poached as a HC next year, I'd say it's maybe a good problem to have. And hopefully in that situation, you have someone working under that OC that may be able to step in and replace them and at least keep a consistent scheme going that works.

We aren't really even interviewing any other offensive guys outside of Payton. Shaw I guess, but he's never done it at the pro level that I am aware. And I think we only interviewed him as a potential OC if Harbaugh chose us, which didn't happen of course.

>From 2006 through 2021, the Saints were the NFC's top-scoring team with 27.6 points per game. Across the entire league, only the Patriots scored more points during that time. New Orleans finished six seasons with the top total offense, including in Payton's first season in 2006. The previous year, the Saints ranked 20th in that statistic. Brees' skills and how much he threw the ball were a major factor, as New Orleans attempted more passes during Payton's tenure than any other team. But even from 2017 through 2020, when the Saints ranked in the bottom half of the league in pass attempts, New Orleans ranked in the top five in scoring in each of those seasons. As Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said in 2021, speed is also a big part of why Payton's offense operates so well.

>""They operate very quickly. They're on and off the field. They're in that little huddle,"" said Belichick. ""They're up to the line and the ball's snapped, and if you take time to break it all down, you can sort of figure out, 'Yeah, well, this is why he's in this set, and that's why he's doing this and that, and that's what this guy does well, and that's where he's got in there,' but it's hard to do it during the game because it happens so fast, and then as soon as that play is over, he's got somebody else in there and a whole other set of personnel, formations, motion, ball snap, and so it's hard to stay ahead of Sean just because he operates so quickly with so many variables.""",5.0,denverbroncos,t3_10szexd,False,0.0,Rod Smith,2023-02-03T17:58:55Z,denverbroncos,0.0409088383346679

Three have been filled and if he doesn't land the top job still available in Arizona and Indianapolis, Evero will have defensive coordinator offers elsewhere.

>After their 2-hour or so interview Tuesday, it became clear from both the Broncos and Sean Payton that there is sincere mutual interest in each other, sources tell 9NEWS.

>Not that an announcement is coming in the next few days. According to a source, there most likely will be a second step in the Broncos’ head coach search process, with one to three finalists expected to be brought into the team’s UCHealth Training Center headquarters next week for one more healthy discussion before a final determination is made.

>With Jim Harbaugh dropping out Monday to remain head coach at the University of Michigan, most of the speculation has Sean Payton and Dallas defensive coordinator Dan Quinn as the co-favorites to become the Broncos’ new head coach. However, 9NEWS has learned that former Stanford head coach David Shaw has impressed the Broncos’ ownership group and general manager George Paton to the point there may well be a Big Three again in Denver’s coaching search.

…

>Payton, the former Super Bowl-winning coach with the New Orleans Saints, is considered the Belle of the Football among candidates in this year’s head coaching cycle. According to sources, Payton was as impressive as one would expect for a guy with such a head coaching pedigree. He was interviewed Tuesday morning in a Los Angeles-area hotel conference room by Penner, another Broncos owner Condoleezza Rice and general manager George Paton.

>That same trio also interviewed Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris for a little more than 2 hours Tuesday afternoon in the same L.A. hotel. Morris, who has previous head coaching experience with Tampa Bay and Atlanta, also impressed the Broncos’ trio with his preparation and plan to win, according to sources.

…

>From there, Penner and his associates will pause to consider who to bring in for a second interview next week. The second round of interviews will involve Penner, his wife and co-owner Carrie Penner Walton, and Broncos controlling owner Rob Walton. George Paton will be around for follow-up discussions and to help the coaching finalists tour the Broncos’ facilities.

>Contrary to some media speculation, George Paton is returning as the Broncos’ general manager, regardless of who Penner ultimately decides to hire as head coach. Remember, even if Sean Payton asks for final-say authority on roster decisions – as would be his right given his gravitas and resume – he had a productive and professional partnership with Saints’ GM Mickey Loomis that worked well for 15 years.

…

>Although there has been speculation that Payton would command a $15-$20 million a year salary if he returns to coach, he and the Broncos did not talk compensation during their interview Tuesday, according to a source. The Broncos also have not engaged in trade talks with New Orleans on compensation for Sean Payton, although they are aware of the Saints’ asking price which reportedly is a first-round draft pick. The Saints hold Sean Payton’s contractual rights for two more years which is why they are entitled to compensation from the team that hires him away.

Yes, Payton is a gamble. I'm not trying to say he's not. But he's a smaller risk than someone completely unknown. What's more, if Payton doesn't fix Russ and it's clearly Russ's fault, Payton can still be part of the solution *after* Russ.

We cannot know this. It's been slow and the media clearly doesn't have connections within the group that's running this search to give answers.

We need to fix the offense, and Sean Payton is unquestionably the best option to do that this offseason.

He took a good Drew Brees and turned him into a Hall of Famer. I'd be happy if he could take a bad Russell Wilson and turned him into a good one. And if he can't fix Russ, then at least he's proven that he's capable of coaching up a QB for 2 years from now when we can move on from Wilson and draft a replacement.

Ryans might turn out to be a great coach, and I'm not gonna act like the world is ending if we do hire him, but Payton *has proven* to be a great coach. So yeah, given the choice between them I'll take the one who's got more than a decade of proof in his pudding.",2.0,denverbroncos,t3_10mk87q,False,0.0,2-Star Mod,2023-01-27T10:07:07Z,denverbroncos,0.0359472872942518

Because the first team that hired a coach is a division rival of the team that owns Payton's rights. Two other teams potentially interested in Payton have notoriously incompetent owners. That leaves two teams who are, as far as we know, still planning to conduct second interviews with him.

> 1 Championship (14 years ago) Sure, that's nice, too.

How many coaches have won more than 1 championship in the past 14 years? I'll answer that for you: it's *one*. Let's not hire anyone because only one guy has won more than one Super Bowl in the last 14 years, and he's not on the market!!!!

So if the Broncos wanted to wear new uniforms in 2023, they would've had to have informed the NFL of their intent to change uniforms by March 1st, 2022. They would then have had to gotten league approval by December 1st 2022.

The league does allow for extenuating circumstances as decided by  the commissioner. Washington dropping their nickname/logo and going with ""Football Team"" was excused, for example. I've always read (though I can't pinpoint where) that an exception would be made for new ownership as well.

This fan base is extremely spoiled. Fans of at least half the other teams in the league would kill to have the success we've had in our franchise's history, including, it's worth remembering, within *just the last decade.* You will get no crocodile tears from Browns, Jets, Lions, Jaguars, Texans, Panthers, etc. fans for us. I'm with you, u/TheDebateMatters -- I'm not suggesting we have to be green-eyed about the poor play we've seen so far, especially from a QB for whom we backed up the Brinks truck. Totally fine to critique this team. But man, so many fans have insane levels of entitlement. I mean, the boo birds were out during our first home game!? GTFO.

Expectations were *way* too high coming into this season. In Peyton Frikkin' Manning's first season, we were so close to starting 2–4 (and people were even calling for the return of Tebow, lmao), but because PFM was a generational talent, we found a way to get right sooner than later. I love Russell as both a player and person and think he has had an elite career, but he's not PFM. And the whole offense is operating in a new system with a first-time HC. Do people not remember what happened in during Zac Taylor's first two seasons in Cincy? They went 2–14! Then they went 4–12, including 2–7–1 before Burrow got injured. Again, *have some perspective.*

Yes, Russ is a vet. Yes, he is playing worse than he has for most of his career. You can acknowledge these things while also 1) assuming that at some point they will get things on the right track, even if it takes longer than we'd like (Russ's mistakes seem to be more mental than physical, and Hackett has nowhere to go but up as he gains more experience) and 2) not melting down because we didn't become a Super Bowl contender from Week 1.

I've been a Broncos fan since 1997, so I obviously want to see this team succeed every season. But I feel like several years of mediocrity and irrelevance (and I'm not talking about the 6 post-PFM seasons) might humble this fan base a bit. Truly disappointing to see this.

So I promise I'm not trying to just be Pollyannaish here, but this is what I would say about our performance against seemingly weaker opponents so far:

- I was genuinely worried about that Seattle game. There were too many emotions going into it, and as Dave Logan has said, because it was Week 1, the Seahawks didn't know yet that they're supposed to suck this season. So they had tons of unearned confidence going into the game. Moreover, the game was *at* Seattle *in primetime.* Despite all that, our offense actually looked surprisingly good. We lost because of one too many miscues, which it's reasonable to chalk up to rookie coach, no pre-season for most players, things still needing to gel for the offense, etc. If we play that game any other week/not in primetime, I think we win with ease.

- As for Houston and SF, there was only one thing I knew about each of those teams heading into the matchups: despite their ""bad"" and ""meh"" perceptions, respectively, both boasted good defenses. SF has allowed the third-fewest PPG this season (behind, funnily enough, us!). Houston is ranked 12th. Our defense did the job it was supposed to do, and our young offense did just enough against stout units to get the wins.

I actually agree with much of what you said, and I'm not trying to be unreasonably green-eyed about all this. I'm just saying I think there are sincere reasons why those games were all closer than many of us think they should have been. That said, LV is giving up the 9th-most PPG and 12th-most YPG, so I really hope we see the offense finally start to click this week.",3.0,denverbroncos,t3_xpio1d,False,0.0,Kenny,2022-09-27T14:30:55Z,denverbroncos,0.0445967521991514

25815,157606,157606,iSamurai,">	Besides the head coach and play-caller, there isn’t a more important member of the coaching staff than an offensive line coach.

>This is for a multitude of reasons, but just on the surface level, there isn’t a coaching position teaching more players on the field at once. Being able to communicate and teach a multitude of different players isn’t an easy task.

>Nearly half of the offensive players on the field are taught directly by the offensive line coach, making the responsibility he has even more vital to the team’s success. No two people learn the same way, and how players use technique across the offensive line is vastly different depending on the position. For example, an offensive guard’s responsibilities are entirely different than offensive tackles.

>To go along with that, the offensive line is a very tough position group to teach in today’s NFL. While the saying goes, “everything starts up front” applies to all levels of football, the college game and NFL game are vastly different — what these players are asked to do at the collegiate level often doesn’t correlate easily to the NFL. Pairing that with how NFL practices are becoming more and more strict regarding how much physical contact is allowed — it makes it increasingly difficult to prepare players at a position like the offensive line, where contact is inherently part of everything they’re supposed to do.

>Offensive line coaches are also tasked with how to block and counter against all of the exotic looks various defensive coordinators throw at them throughout the season. While blocking may look the same to the average fan, this could not be further from the truth. Depending on the look the defense is giving them and the play the offensive coordinator is running — blocking responsibilities change down to down.

>Because of how difficult the job is now and is increasingly becoming, the value of having a really good coach to both prepare the starters and develop the newcomers, despite the difficulties, is indispensable to any staff in the league.

25938,157947,157947,iSamurai,">	The running back disasters deserve some of the blame, but so does Wilson. This was probably what the star passer did best in recent years with Seattle. In 2020, his 90.2 QBR inside the red zone was the fifth-best mark in football. Last season, even while dealing with the finger injury, he posted a 91.9 QBR inside the 20, which was first. He was second in 2019, 13th in 2018 and fifth in 2017. He ranked No. 1 in the red zone over that entire five-year span.

>This season, Wilson has been the league's worst quarterback in the red zone. His QBR has dropped from 91.9 to 6.3. That's not a typo. The only quarterback within 15 points is Pittsburgh's Kenny Pickett. Wilson's completion percentage over expectation (CPOE) is nearly seven points below that of an average passer, and he's averaging just 2.3 yards per attempt. He doesn't have Metcalf or Tyler Lockett in Denver, but he was dominant in the red zone before Metcalf arrived in town, too.

>What makes this even more staggering is what I mentioned about Hackett earlier. One of the first items on his résumé as a potential head-coaching candidate would have been his success building the game plan for the Packers in the red zone over the past three seasons. The Broncos have somehow combined the best red zone quarterback of the past five years with a guy who was responsible for one of the league's best red zone offenses and landed the league's worst red zone attack.

It's long, but it's like a free class in executive leadership and hiring. Ted is also the CFO of a company.

Key summary points:

* Owners most important job is to set a vision. Without that, everything falls apart.
* One issue the Broncos have had is whiplash between who has the ""juice"" in the building. NFL teams often go back and forth between the GM being top dog and the coach. That doesn't mean that the coach is running the scouting and draft, but that they are seen as the lead executor of the owners vision. Ted believes a coach should have ""the juice"" in a building. They should be CEO and GM should be like a COO.
* He sees it as Paton having the juice last year and Hackett was hired as a subordinate. 
* Penner could be looking to change this dynamic and get it back to having the coach be the CEO.
* Ted lists out his opinion on things that don't matter, but get focused on too much, including a coaches scheme, connections, personality, and what side of the ball they come from. 
* He lists what he thinks is more important like openness, accountability, emotional intelligence, toughness, and humbleness.

These boards can have some connected boosters on them. It wouldn't be the first time a rabid college board had intel on hires before others.

The story itself does line up with the timeline of things, would explain the silence from the Broncos.

Why would the team have shifted PR strategy like that?

This also has a decent amount of detail, but again, it's not like it's very hard to make up plausible fan fiction. I just guess, what would be the motivation for a paid UM forum to make this up?

26690,161283,161283,jl_weber,"I feel like wasting my time today.

The ""media"" as a conspiratorial conglomerate colluding to mislead you does not exist. It is made of of individual people, owners, investors, and companies that all have different agendas, business models, standards, and ethics. They are not coordinating. The differences in what they do can be apparent to an educated reader.

Somebody like Ian Rapoport does not make stuff up. His value is information. If he makes things up, his value is no more. If he was found to make things up, I promise that it would be a scandal and he would be fired. He is reporting things that players, agents, team employees, and others tell him. Could they be telling him one thing to push an agenda? Sure, that's why he is probably waiting to report things until he has multiple sources. When you read his writing, he's also not demonstrative. ""I've been told this is likely to happen"" is what you're going to hear from him and you see that he shares information less frequently because he is working to confirm things. Now, if a source provides him poor information, he's not going to go back to that source. That source is of no value to him. He's also working in an industry that is based in entertainment. If he was reporting on national security, he'd have a much higher threshold and wouldn't even share some of the developments. But he works in football and this isn't that serious so he's going to share information earlier on when there's still a chance that people change their minds. He acknowledges that a lot of the time.

Then you have people like Ben Allbright. He tries to do what Rapoport does, but he then inserts his own interpretation into it. He's doing all the same things, but then he says, ""This is going to happen."" Why? Probably cause his ego wants the satisfaction of saying ""I called it."" You can still get value from the information he says, but you have to read closely to separate it from his added opinion.

Then you've got folks like Zac Stevens here. He doesn't really do any reporting, he just shares what others report and adds his own commentary. He's just pure analysis and his only value is in the speculation and entertainment he provides. Zac tries to be objective, but every day on their podcasts he's ask a lot of ""What ifs"" and he acknowledges making things up just for the fun of considering the implications. ""What if the Broncos traded for Aaron Rodgers?"" This is all well and good as long as you don't take it too seriously and he never tries to claim he knows more than he does. Zac is professional, but there are loads of amateur versions of this (Joe Rowles and Nick Kendell, for instance) who don't have any unique information, but try to provide valuable opinions and analysis.

Then you've got the bottom of the barrel. People are just stirring the pot. Skip Bailey is obviously the prime example. They can be as small as Twitter randos, as prominent as national TV hosts, and much of the time they mask their agendas with previous experience (Skip used to be a reporter in Dallas, lots of former players fall into this bucket). These are the folks you're thinking of. They are just around to get eyeballs. Eyeballs do have value in an advertising-supported business. These guys can get them in the short time, but people get sick of them. Without any information, their entertainment value slowly erodes. They are not long-term money making operations most of the time. Unfortunately, the barrier to entry is very low for these folks with social media so they aren't going away. And for lazy businessmen, this is a low overhead. They can turn these folks into content farms and just have them churn out absurd shit that juices SEO and tries to trick people. Smart readers may get tricked a few times, but eventually they just cut sites like that out of their diet.

Of course, the tough part - and the reason we get lots of claims of ""THE MEDIA"" - is that a lot of places employee all of these types of people. ESPN has great journalists on down to Skip and other trash. That doesn't help their reputation, but it doesn't mean it's all trash.

So I will not say that a headline is never ""complete bullshit"", but I do think that's rare, especially from somebody like Ian Rapoport. And, yes, I've been sharing a lot of links during the coaching search - some reporting and some commentary - but it's because I think this fun. It's a wild ride and I'm just enjoying it because it's not that serious, but it's fun to get happy and angry and yell and shout. The whiplash can be frustrating, but I don't think it's because we're always being lied to. I think things change and I'm just going to enjoy the ride. I can enjoy it because I can tell the difference in all of the above when I read them.",1.0,denverbroncos,t3_10mzy5t,False,0.0,None,2023-01-28T11:26:52Z,denverbroncos,0.0089734952830395

Those coaches didn't fail because they were first time coaches. A good organization and leader will dig deeper than that to understand what went wrong.

Vance Joseph failed because 1) Elway has admitted he didn't set up to succeed with the team he build 2) Kubiak was still around as a senior advisor and so power structure with the org was odd and 3) Vance, in my opinion, as seemed caged off and like he was performing in press conferences. I don't think he was very transparent with players.

Fangio failed also because of a the QB situation, but also because he was inflexible, both in who he hired and how it managed players.

Hackett failed because he had no clue to how to run a team and no plan for how his gimmick would adapt when the going got tough (other than growing a goatee).

26803,161426,161426,jl_weber,"I think this is an interesting thought experiment. 

Not hiring Hackett is one of the more appealing options because it could also affect some of these others. Maybe a better coach wins the Seahawks game, advocates for a different QB, gets more out of Russ, or is more honest with owners about Russ's status and talks them into waiting on a contract. But, of course, our reported next option was Dan Quinn, so maybe the outcomes would've been just the same. 

Out of the Russ options, I'd take back the contract before the trade. That at least gives us flexibility to do whatever we want this offseason. If we took back the trade, I think we'd still suck this year because who would we have started at QB? Neither of these change much in 2022, just give us more hope in 2023. 

Winning that Seahawks game would have maybe been a ""Sliding Doors"" moment. Maybe the vibes are so good after that win that everything clicks into place and we have the season we thought. But I've also seen too many coaches and teams start hot and fizzle so it would've likely been just a blip of happiness. Maybe all we get by switching that is some bragging rights over the Seahawks. 

Glasgow played better than Cush at center so this one is probably lowest on my list. 

Reversing Williams' injury is a contender for #1 cause it's the only one that guarantees something: A healthy Javonte. His injury was so bad that his career is at risk. Not having that happen means that all his potential is still here and I think there's a good chance he helps us pull out some close wins. 

I'm not sure I get #7. I don't think there's any chance the Seahawks take a 2022+2024 first round pick vs a 2022+2023. You just don't see it happen like that much.

26875,161528,161528,jl_weber,"Now this is a much better addition to the conversation. 

I think the shift from drop to catch radius is helpful. Arguing that he doesn't have a big catch radius is different than arguing that he drops balls. Again, I don't think he's extraordinary when it comes to drops, but I can see the catch radius argument. 

People always bring up Tim Patrick - and I love him - but 50 catches for 700ish yards a year isn't a world beater. He's reliable and a useful 3rd receiver and what he does well happens to be what JJ doesn't. Does JJ need to be better than that? Of course. 

Andre Johnson, Hopkins, and the rest you mention thriving with bad QBs are all-timers. There are some WRs who are in a tier where they will win no matter what. I've never expected JJ to be that so I don't hold him to that standard. 

I saw that ESPN is releasing some new WR metrics that try to isolate the different parts of receiver play so will be interesting to see where he lands in those rankings ([https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/\_/id/34649390/espn-receiver-tracking-metrics-how-new-nfl-stats-work-open-catch-yac-scores](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34649390/espn-receiver-tracking-metrics-how-new-nfl-stats-work-open-catch-yac-scores)). 

What I'm arguing isn't that we need to make excuses for him, but try to see objectively. Your post and research is very helpful for that. This isn't a case of ""he's a bum, get rid of him immediately"" and it's not a case of he's a hidden superstar. He's not scheme independent and, like many players on offense, needs the coaching staff to do a better job to maximize what the he does well.

I'd argue that given his rookie contract, he's still more valuable on the team than not and worth keeping around for a second year with this staff (if they stick around) and Wilson, before deciding on the 5th year option.",1.0,denverbroncos,t3_y06sma,False,0.0,None,2022-10-11T13:02:00Z,denverbroncos,0.0072726661161939
26876,161529,161529,jl_weber,"Jerry Jeudy is a great example of how there's almost no nuance in fan evaluation of players anymore. People only remember their first impression.

The most common comment here is that he runs great routes and can't catch.

There's lots of evidence he runs great routes so nobody is wrong there. He is among the league leaders in average separation, up there with C. Kupp, and if you watch tape, he's open all the time.

His catching troubles are exaggerated. He had the highest drop rate his rookie year (which was the COVID season) and then only had 3 drops last season. he improved a lot. 2020 was an aberration. He's got 2 drops this year, so not a great start pace-wise, but lots of people have that many dropped passes included S. Diggs, J. Chase, T. Kelce, and draft mate C. Lamb.

The strange thing is how that first impression has led to lots of comments that seem to be really exaggerating things like he doesn't fight for balls or adjust. Week one of this season he had a great TD where Russ threw it short and he had to adjust and fight through a guy falling on him. And did we all forget his very first TD where he Moss'd the Jets.

Even worse is when people turn this into an ""attitude"" problem. Why? Cause the dude sends the occasional vague or weird tweet? Dude is 23 years old. Get outta here with that until there's some actual evidence or he causes trouble with the team.

We all need to give JJ more of a break. He's played with some bad QBs, his overall targets were cut in half in 2021, and he's dealt with some injuries. Now he's dealing with a new offense again and the entire offense is struggling with it.

A good organization and coaching staff will be able to get a lot out of JJ. Will it be the Broncos? Or are we gonna go further down the path to being a bad organization.

McManus said ""Get me to the left hash on the 46 and I can do it."" Well, they got there, just with a minute left. Looking back, I can tell now that Hackett hesitated because he was thinking ""Shit, I got to the spot he wanted, but we've only got one shot left. What do I do?"" and started internally debating whether or not to do what his player told him or to risk not giving him a shot at all. Hackett is known as a players coach. He seems like a guy that wants to be liked. But people pleasing - I know all too well - leads to bad outcomes, especially in the long term. He's got to learn when to shut down a request like that. I don't blame McManus, a kicker should be confident. But a coach has to protect him from himself. 

It sucked. It was embarrassing and it was on one of the most hyped up game in a while. I just hope that Hackett can be honest with himself and change his behavior. The TOs during kneeldowns and the ""I'd let him do it again"" coach speak weren't great signs. The latter I expect though. The former was nonsense and he should cut that out immediately.

Miller, 33, has previously expressed interest in becoming an NFL GM after he retires, going from the gridiron to the front office like former standouts John Elway (Broncos) and John Lynch (San Francisco 49ers).

“I know what great teams look like,” the two-time Super Bowl champion says. “I know what Super Bowl teams are made of, not only from a player standpoint or coaching standpoint but what the strength and conditioning coaches look like, what the janitors look like, the cafeteria workers. I know what the food’s supposed to be like.

“I’ve been familiar with great teams and I’ve been around great teams. Becoming a GM and being a front office executive gives me the opportunity to still stay connected to the game that I love so much.””

As a QB, it’s your job to make sure the players believe the team can win and for Russ I’d imagine some of it is to hold himself accountable too and speak the wins into existence. He’s not pretending he’s been playing well. He probably wants to win just as much as the next guy and it’s just because he came to town with excitement, saying “let’s ride” and the likes that he’s getting hate. It’s not 100% his fault.

- 2.14 TDs and .4 Ints.
- **15 touchdowns** and 3 Ints. - which is an *insane* *5-1* TD/Int. Ratio
