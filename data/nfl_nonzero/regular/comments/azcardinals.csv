As someone from Hawaii, I love Tua and his personality, but I think Flores was right about Herbert over Tua; even without the concussion concerns, Justin Herbert has done well for longer and Tua mostly had a more stacked offense this year to help as well.

Purdy is looking amazing for the 49ers and the 49ers are the division rival—why would they want to give us their QB that is doing well for them? Kind of seems dumb, right? 

Also, if Purdy was this “good” beforehand, why didn’t anyone draft him until the last pick? Shanahan is one of the best coaches in the league, and the 49ers are well stacked in their defense and offensive weapons and line. That is why coaching is so important in this game. Even so, Purdy was only a 3rd stringer until Jimmy G and Lance got injured.

I was not making an excuse for Kyler. I am just pointing out he has been to only one playoff game in his entire career while your comment reads like he was Dak Prescott or Kirk Cousins in the playoffs. In that game, you cannot put the only blame on Kyler either. The offense could not move at all, the Oline was non existent, and the defense could not stay off the field long enough to catch their breath or to stop the Rams’ killer offense. Our coaching staff never adjusted successfully, which was a consistent pattern through the Kingsbury Era. Everyone likes to circle jerk hate on Kyler, but this is a team sport and our coaching staff always seem underprepared against most teams in the NFL where we just fucking collapse terribly at points.

Also, I suggest you look at Kyler’s contract, there is no realistic way of moving off of his contract until 2025. Even then, the team still incurs dead cap.

Turns out that I misheard. She did NOT say that her keys were in her car. She said that her keys were in her *bra.* And I had just walked over and offered to help get them out.

If your hungry grab a Seattle dog from one of the many hot dog vendors. Cheaper and better (my opinion) than any food you’ll get in the arena)

Walk in the arena through any gate. One of the best stadiums I’ve ever been to. Accessible. Friendly, awesome views.

**Overall Regular Season Record**: 169-100-2

Probably my best year of picking games ever, which is funny because I feel like I know less about these teams than you in years past but have instead mostly gone with what felt most likely. Anyway, for the last game I'll give a prediction for how the game goes in addition to the final score. Hope everyone has a blast and enjoys the game! 


__**Super Bowl LVII ~~Script~~ Prediction**__

**1st Quarter**

Chiefs get the ball first and drive all the way down the field only to end up settling for a field goal. Eagles also have a long opening drive that extends into the early 2nd quarter, but after 15 minutes the Eagles are threatening in the red zone. 


*Score 3-0 Chiefs*


**2nd Quarter**

Jalen Hurts finds Devonta Smith in the end zone to give the Eagles the lead a minute into the quarter. The teams trade 3-and-outs but when the Eagles punt back to the Chiefs, the infamous KC special teams that has been an issue all season rears its ugly head as they fumble the return back to the Eagles. Hurts leads them to a quick score as he throws a TD to Goedert. With time winding down in the half Mahomes leads the Chiefs down the field and finds MVS with mere seconds left in the half to cut into the deficit. 


*Score: 14-10 Eagles*


**Halftime**

Everyone will either comment that this is the best or the worst halftime show in years, maybe even both takes will come in at the same time. Also for the game there won't be many memorable commercials (just a few that get a chuckle or get a sigh) except Burger King will reveal that their jingle was in fact a mind control experiment that passed with flying colors. ""You rule"" is a lie; ""they rule (the world)""  


**3rd Quarter**

Eagles start hot in the second half with a TD drive that includes a 4th-and-1 where they line up for the Hurts sneak but reveal the long con and Hurts completes a jump pass to AJ Brown. Gainwell continues his impressive postseason run as he's the one to score the rushing TD. Chiefs have a promising drive but the Eagles pass rush comes in clutch and forces the punt. After getting the ball back, the Chiefs score a quick TD when McKinnon catches a shovel pass from Mahomes. However the Eagles stop the 2-point conversation attempt. 


*Score: 21-16 Eagles*


**4th Quarter**

Eagles offense continues to stall as Chris Jones comes up with a huge 3rd down stop to force a punt. Mahomes and Kelce work their magic and they connect several times en route to the go ahead TD with 6 minutes left. This time they do get the 2-point conversion as Toney scores on an end-around. Hurts then has his legacy drive, including a clutch 4th down scramble and completion to AJ Brown. Elliott hits the 34 yard field goal with 1:10 left to tie it and the Chiefs out of timeouts. However Mahomes calmly leads the Chiefs into FG range as Butker hits the game-winner from 49 yards as time expires.

2604,21148,21148,BtownBrelooms,"Obviously I have some bias but this is my best attempt of being objective:


1) **Carolina**: This is the prime situation for a first year coach to make the playoffs right away due to how wide open the NFC South will be next year with Tom Brady presumably moving elsewhere. They have a promising o-line and a great WR1 in DJ Moore as well as a solid, young defense. The only real downside is uncertainty at the QB position but the new coach will basically get to choose their preferred guy from day 1 so the success of the QB is entirely in your control. This feels like an excellent spot for an ascending coordinator to make a HC debut and potentially lead the team forward for the next decade. 


2) **Denver**: It's hard to know exactly HOW bad Russell Wilson and the offense is after a nightmare season under Nathaniel Hackett but determining if it can be fixed determines how desirable this job is to HC candidates. The defense is loaded but you need to make sure you continue coaching to their strength since the DC will probably change. A lot of people point at the ownership's Walmart money as a plus but the NFL isn't like the NBA with luxury tax or the MLB with no salary cap so there really are no immediately noticable advantages (other than being able to back up guaranteed contracts, which could be enticing for attracting free agents but at the risk of setting new precedents and getting resentment from the other owners) to having super rich owners due to every team already forced to spend a specific amount on the roster. Also you're in the same division as Mahomes and Herbert so the path to the playoffs will be challenging. 


3) **Arizona**: I put this job in the middle because the franchise is at a bit of a crossroads. They have the ability to either try to contend short-term or long-term and how a potential HC sees the situation will determine how attractive the job is for taking. For example, if you're Sean Payton then the job is more attractive if the Cards are trying to contend now but less so (but not entirely unattractive) if they want to retool and get younger. If you're a rising coordinator (just for an example let's say Kellen Moore), the long-term approach makes it more attractive because you can take your time implementing the type of team you want to run without the pressing need to ""win now"" while your trying to fix things. The NFC West is pretty tough but only the 49ers seem like long-term threats at the moment due to Sean McVay and Pete Carroll's potential retirement in the next few years. Also depends on your feelings and belief in Kyler Murray as regardless of what you think he is guaranteed to be the starting QB for the next few years at minimum. 


4) **Indianapolis**: The division definitely feels winnable at the moment but if Trevor Lawrence ultimately becomes what scouts expected him to be then your path becomes harder. Both the offense and defense have great pieces scattered among the roster but this isn't the same ""talented"" roster this used to be. There is also the fear of how much control a new HC would have in the forming of the team with GM Chris Ballard sticking around and Jim Irsay showing himself to be a very involved owner recently (I understand the potential hypocrisy I'm writing as Michael Bidwill seems to be just as involved but at least in Arizona you are coming in to build a new culture while with the Colts you will be forced to adapt to the pre-existing one). The QB position is also a complete mystery which could be a blessing or a curse depending on if they want to sign someone or draft someone to lead the team. 


5) **Houston**: On paper, this would actually be the most attractive job because it is completely moldable into whatever a HC candidate envisions for their team philosophy. Outside of Lawrence turning the Jaguars into the 2000s Colts, the division is fairly winnable. You'll have several picks from the Cleveland Browns as well as the second overall pick in a draft with two potential franchise QBs to choose from in Bryce Young and CJ Stroud. The elephant in the room though is the fact you'll be the third HC in three years. It's also concerning we are also entering year 3 of a franchise rebuild that has made very little progress (though Deshaun Watson holding them hostage last year definitely contributed to the stalled progress) and thus you can't help but feel nervous about your job security if this is the third straight year Houston is a bottom 5 team. That will be a tough task as while there are quite a few young and talented pieces in place, the number of holes that need to be fixed vastly outweighs the positives.",21.0,nfl,t3_109049h,False,0.0,:Cardinals: Cardinals,2023-01-11T06:36:44Z,azcardinals,0.0325251845089895

2736,21318,21318,BtownBrelooms,"Extremely busy with the holidays so extremely short blurbs this week, hopefully I can have some good write-ups for the final regular season week. Hope everyone is having a great holidays! 

(Disclaimer: quite often my picks are based on ""feel"" over statistical proof. Similar to analytics, stats are merely a tool and not a guide to picking games. Sometimes you just have to trust your gut.)


Previous week: 13-3 (Overall 149-89-2) 


**__Week 17__**


 **Cowboys over Titans**: With NFC East title still an outside possibility, there's no way I see the Cowboys allowing themselves a letdown game. 


**Falcons over Cardinals**: After missing out on a Christmas upset, the tank rolls onwards. 


**Lions over Bears**: Wouldn't be surprised if the Bears played spoiler here but I'm personally rooting for and expecting a win-and-in for the Lions next week. 


**Chiefs over Broncos**: Is there a tiny bit of fear about a ""recently fired HC"" buff for the Broncos? Not really, I'm pretty sure everyone on the team has checked out or will after this week.


**Patriots over Dolphins**: The Tua situation has me very sad and honestly I think the season is pretty much sunk at this point. The dysfunctional Pats survive and remain playoff relevant for one more week. 


**Giants over Colts**: Giants are an optimistic reminder for the Colts that things can completely 180° in one season. But that's next season, Colts are garbage right now. 


**Eagles over Saints**: The ultra rare ""winning helps your draft selection"" game. In all seriousness, Eagles will take care of business and wrap up the division. 


**Panthers over Bucs**: Panthers are a tough team to overcome if they build an early lead on you and can bleed the game clock out. While Brady has been his best when behind this season, the stink of needing to overcome a 10-point deficit to best the Trace McSorely-led Cardinals still lingers. Brady will probably find a way to win but I'm not going to bet on it.


**Browns over Commanders**: In a weird way, I feel like the pressure is off the Browns now that the playoffs are impossible and we might start to see the team gel. Also Commanders making the switch from Heineke to Wentz has me a little nervous. 


**Jaguars over Texans**: Jaguars don't *need* this win to take the division but it would go a long way in making sure the culture shift instituted by Doug Pederson is a long-term one instead of a short-term one. 


**49ers over Raiders**: 49ers are hot and will continue to roll against a Raiders team that has a lot of self-reflecting to do in the off-season. 


**Jets over Seahawks**: With Mike White back, I expect an added energy from the Jets offense against a Seahawks team that seemingly has hit the ceiling and fading down the end stretch.


**Packers over Vikings**: I joked a few weeks ago about the media talking up the Packers after they start a win streak, but it is important to realize the Green Bay offense is finally getting healthy so this might be real. I see the Vikings dropping one more before the post-season and this one feels more likely than next week vs the Bears. 


**Rams over Chargers**: The Chargers have a playoff spot locked down, so wouldn't be surprised to see them let off the gas a little. Rams also probably want to remind the Chargers that SoFi is the Rams house and the Chargers are just tenants. 


**Steelers over Ravens**: Death. Taxes. Mike Tomlin getting a . 500 record or better. Memes aside, I think the Steelers get the victory to split the season series between these two rivals. 


**Bills over Bengals**: Complete toss-up game for me, don't really have a specific reason for this pick so I won't be surprised by either winning.",9.0,nfl,t3_zxe9tb,False,0.0,:Cardinals: Cardinals,2022-12-28T10:51:57Z,azcardinals,0.0120288516385683

Wilks seems to embody the Panthers mantra ""Keep Pounding"" with a tough and physical style with a strong run game and a tough defense. Arizona was not ready for an identity switch from their explosive ""No Risk it, no Biscuit"" personality under Arians, which I'd argue is more finesse than power. It's also why the team immediately started improving under Kliff's Air Raid until the wheels fell off last winter.

Ultimately, I feel that Wilks wasn't a bad coaching candidate, but was instead the wrong one for our team, and that unfortunately hurt his reputation.

Zaven’s playing time was all over the place last (his rookie) season and after suffering some injuries he was all but sidelined in the last chunk of the year. This year he’s been healthy and one of our most consistent pieces especially in coverage and that’s a huge compliment with how little consistency we’ve had in that position. I only expect him to get better. 

Isaiah has been the plug and play guy of our defense. True to his draft profile he’s played a ton of different positions. Safety, ILB, slot corner, rushing the passer a ton. He’s played 40% of his snaps this season at nickel corner and I suspect most of that is due to how spread thin we’ve been in our corner room. It’s hard to judge him because with how many injuries we’ve dealt with Vance hasn’t had a choice but to use him where we need him. Sometimes he’s a freak and makes monster athletic plays and other times he gets lost on the field. How much of that is due to Vance “misusing” him or him not getting consistent snaps in one position, I can’t say.

On the edge you have the corpse of Markus Golden who’s been invisible all season, and a rotating mix of Dennis Gardeck and two mid round rookies. Our ends have been Watt and Allen both of which while really good have battled the injury bug. 

Middle of the field has been Zaven who’s been completely serviceable but this is only his first full season playing, Simmons who plays mostly slot CB and is super inconsistent, and a bunch of 2nd/3rd string type guys. 

Corners have been just as bad as well. Murphy is the best when he’s played but again, missed a lot of time. Marco Wilson has slowly but surely been improving and I think might lead the team in interceptions but he’s still pretty shaky and get beats a ton. Simmons plays a ton of slot CB as mentioned and does okay there. After those three, bunch of replaceable 3rd string type of guys. 

Safety is our best position currently with Budda and Jalen Thompson but it’s also easily the least important.

And by better than I’d expect I mean our defense has been pretty mediocre when I thought it would be one of the worst in the league. 

Also his refusal to play rookies and get them crucial snaps to help develop early in their careers is just asinine. Simmons, Collins, Sanders, Thomas, all of them have at some point or another have been beaten out by veterans who are severely underperforming and deserve to be benched.

Kliff probably wants a prototypical yes man QB that will call the plays exactly as he schemes them up. Sit in the pocket, hit the open man. 

Kyler wants to win and as soon things don’t go well for a few drives in a row he’s going to start looking for the home run play and the hero ball stuff to try to get some momentum building. Hence the improvising and wanting more freedom at the LOS. 

Maybe I’m wrong but that’s just the impression I get from watching the games, especially on the sideline since you never see them interact positively.

We used to hit people in the chest when doing cpr in attempt to reset the electrical activity heart. Its called the precordial thump. 

  Essentially, there is a point during the cycle of a heart beat where the cells cannot depolarize again called the refractory period. A sudden thump in the heart will cause them to depolarize. And the timing of this is crucial. if all the cells in the heart are in this refractory phase, it's no big deal and nothing happens. If none of the cells are in this phase then they will all depolarize in an organized way and continue beating. The problem is when some of them are in the refractory period and others aren't. Then some depolarize and some don't and all the cells in the heart become out of sync and there is no more organized electrical activity in the heart (v-fib). We refer to it as the ""R on T phenomenon"". The ""R"" wave on an ekg is the ventricles depolarizing, the ""T""wave  is those same cells repolarizing. You don't want an R wave on top of a T wave.

Our first play was a wr jet sweep for a loss of 6. This same play averages a loss of 4 and Kliff keeps running it. He runs his offense from the outside in and it should be the other way around. Mike Leech, the coach Kliff learned his scheme from, said he didn't even think it could work in the NFL.

I struggled with depression and even suicidal thoughts for almost 15 years. Back in 2017 I was visiting my brother in Alaska, he was at work, I was in the hotel, and just chillin, watching YouTube, feeling absolutely that heavy blanket of depression. For whatever reason I felt compelled to start watching JJ Watt working out. So I did. And I found his work ethic, his passion, and his absolute dominance just lit a spark in me. From that moment on I watched everything on JJ working out that I could, then moved on to Tom Brady, then Bill Belichek. Those people being elite at their jobs made me excited for life. I realized I had a craving to give more in life, and really give myself to something. 

I ended up signing up for a job with Special Operations (Pararescue) in 2019. I trained as a civilian for a year (DEPed in) with a group in my city under the watch of the Spec Ops recruiter and the former PJ-now-trainer, and I had a blast.

Ultimately I stepped away April 2020, when my dad was suddenly diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and COVID was really ramping up, I decided that my personal dreams weren't as important to me as the need to be with family.

But I took all those mindset lessons from training and I was able to walk away feeling... Content in life.

So yeah, it sounds silly, but JJ really did spark that entire journey for me. The fact that JJ is stepping away for family and health, I really relate to that

> Those with inside knowledge of the Murray-Kingsbury dynamic say the once-close pair, whose relationship dates back 10 years to Murray's recruitment as a high school quarterback, have gone periods without much interaction.
> 
> ""It's not good,"" a team source said last month. ""It seems particularly bad this year.""
> 
> Before Murray's injury, another team source described their relationship as: ""They're cordial,"" adding, ""it's not the relationship you want from your quarterback and coach.""
> 
> Kingsbury and Murray did have a productive talk before a Week 13 matchup with the Chargers, with a team source saying they charted a plan and ""knew what was needed"" from each other.
> ""I'm not losing confidence. Never will,"" Murray said that week. ""The season hasn't gone the way we've wanted it to so far, but again, it's not over and that's got to be our focus.""
> 
> But Murray was late to a practice prior to the Week 14 meeting with the Patriots, a team source said, adding to Kingsbury's frustration with the quarterback.
> 
> Murray, who is slated for surgery around the start of 2023, has not commented publicly since the injury. The state of Murray's contract makes his return to the Arizona starting quarterback job a near necessity. Arizona gave Murray a $230 million contract extension before 2022, with a reasonable cap hit of $16 million against dead money of $97 million in 2023, which is considered prohibitive for a trade. The trade market for a player coming off a serious knee injury also likely wouldn't be robust.
> 
> Kingsbury has five years left on a contract that runs through 2027 and comes with a hefty buyout if Bidwill decides to move on. Typical coaching contracts are fully guaranteed, so if a coach gets fired he continues to get paid as if he's working -- or he and the team can agree on a lump-sum payment. And typical extensions kick in immediately as a new contract, a source familiar with coaching contracts around the league said.
> 
> Agent Erik Burkhardt, who represents Murray and Kingsbury, declined comment for this story.
> 
> And though Kingsbury has said all the right things about the team's efforts to turn it around with Murray back in charge in 2023, the promise of another tense season behind the scenes could be difficult to swallow, and Kingsbury is the more easily expendable of the duo.
> 
> If allowed to stay, Kingsbury will likely need to outline to Bidwill his plan to fix the Cardinals' mess and ""really talk about what's happened,"" a team source said.
> 
> ""Changes need to be made,"" a source close to Murray said.
> WHILE THE FUTURE of the quarterback and head coach's relationship is at a crossroads, so is Keim's relationship with the team.
> 
> Whether Keim, who essentially hand-picked Kingsbury and sold him on coaching the Cardinals, is back in 2023 after his leave of absence ends is another question looming over the franchise. His decade-long tenure as Arizona general manager is an amalgam of bold productivity and curious missteps. Keim's rosters have yielded four double-digit-wins seasons -- including three with the Bruce Arians-Carson Palmer marriage that Keim helped orchestrate -- but he also missed badly on quarterback Josh Rosen, the No. 10 overall pick in the 2018 draft. The second head coach Keim helped hire, Steve Wilks, was fired after one season. Off the field, Keim pleaded guilty to an ""extreme DUI"" charge in 2018, serving a five-game suspension and paying a $200,000 fine.
> 
> A common refrain leaguewide is Keim has ""nine lives"" as Cardinals GM, a survivor in a field with typically little room for error. But league observers are curious whether Bidwill is disenchanted enough to clean house -- and pay enormous buyout money on contracts for the head coach and general manager that run through 2027.
> 
> Billionaire owners, beneficiaries of the league's massive television contracts, seem less worried about picking up the tab on hefty contracts for coaches and executives than for players such as Murray. By way of example, Tennessee Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk fired general manager Jon Robinson in early December, 10 months after extending his contract.
> 
> By most accounts, Keim and Bidwill maintained a strong relationship for years, but that has soured this season, said a source with direct knowledge of the team's inner workings. The roster is largely unspectacular outside of the high-end talent at the skill positions, with one player named to the Pro Bowl in 2022. That falls on Keim's doorstep.
> 
> As for Murray, his recovery and rehab is the priority for an organization that invested hundreds of millions in a franchise quarterback. By the time offseason workouts start in April, Murray might be the only one of the triumvirate left with the Cardinals.
> All of this will fall on Bidwill to clean up. Would he target a high-end coaching candidate such as Sean Payton, who is believed in league circles to be seeking a high level of personnel oversight? Does Bidwill promote from within if the general manager job is open, or does he hire an external candidate for the first time since 1994 when his father, Bill, named Buddy Ryan head coach and general manager?

> That date would mark the peak of the Kingsbury era. Since then, Arizona has gone 5-14 in regular season games without recording back-to-back wins over that span. Ten of those 14 losses have come at home.

> 
> While the Cardinals struggled in all three phases during 2021's concluding stretch, it was Kingsbury's version of the Air Raid offense, brought with him from the college game at Texas Tech, that received scrutiny as Arizona faltered.
> 
> The offense, designed to attack vertically and ranked sixth and eighth in the NFL the previous two seasons, has fallen to 21st in the league this year. Nearly every offensive starter has missed significant time because of injury, and several offensive coaches have been let go. Three of the team's five opening day offensive line starters are currently on injured reserve.
> 
> All of this has made Kingsbury ""miserable"" this season, a team source said.
> 
> ""We're not built to run Kliff's offense right now, and it kills him,"" the source said.
> 
> Screens, short passes and good decisions from the quarterback can force defenses to loosen up and allow Murray, or whomever is playing quarterback, to win over the top with outside targets. But the scheme has become predictable at times, some NFL coaches and defensive players who faced Arizona told ESPN, and when the Cardinals can't run the ball effectively, it's easier to take the other elements away.
> 
> Another core issue fueling division was Murray's feelings about the offense.
> 
> 
> While one source close to Murray said the quarterback wanted more freedom at the line of scrimmage, particularly with running plays, multiple sources said plays designed to get certain playmakers the ball often didn't come to fruition, either due to miscommunication, a play breaking down or Murray improvising, and the disjointed attack created unpredictability for some of the team's pass-catchers.

> 
> Kingsbury has been labeled a players' coach over the years by many on his staff and in the locker room. He's well liked and has support among his players. Conversely, Kingsbury's aversion to confrontation chafed some players at times.
> 
> As one longtime ex-Cardinals player said, Kingsbury's go-to line in meetings, especially after bad performances, was that ""everybody has to play better."" While that approach fosters good relations, the player said, calling out bad performances by name can be necessary at times.
> 
> ""It's a very comfortable work environment, but he won't rip anybody, and if the head coach won't do it, it's hard for the offensive guard to do it,"" the player said. ""I think that's some of what's gone on with the QB."" A team source added that Kingsbury's personality doesn't lend to calling players out.

14047,123402,123402,SerShanksALot,"> TEMPE, Ariz. -- Two days before the Arizona Cardinals were eliminated from playoff contention after a lifeless 24-15 loss to the woeful Denver Broncos on Sunday, Kliff Kingsbury was asked a question in a year full of them.
> 
> ""You've been obviously a head coach for a minute now here and at Texas Tech ..."" the question began before the fourth-year head coach interrupted.
> 
> ""Ten years,"" Kingsbury pointed out, referring to six years in Lubbock and four in Arizona.
> 
> ""It feels like 100,"" he added.
> 
> The weight of the past few seasons -- especially this one -- has taken its toll on the 43-year-old Kingsbury to the point that multiple people close to him have openly wondered whether he would walk away after the season.
> 
> There is also a very real possibility that Kingsbury, with a 28-34-1 head-coaching record in the NFL and without a playoff win during his tenure, will be fired by owner Michael Bidwill, though multiple team sources see a path where Bidwill gives Kingsbury another year, due in part to injuries ravaging the roster and a personnel department in flux.
> 
> Kingsbury's future with the Cardinals has long been rooted in his relationships with three key people -- quarterback Kyler Murray, general manager Steve Keim and Bidwill. All three of those relationships have soured to varying degrees the past two years.
> Murray was lost for the season when he tore his ACL in his right knee three plays into a Monday night loss to the New England Patriots on Dec. 12. That event occurred after Murray and his head coach had grown increasingly distant throughout Arizona's disappointing 4-10 season, according to multiple Cardinals sources.
> Two days after the Patriots loss, the team lost its general manager when Keim took a health-related leave of absence. Keim's short- and long-term future with the team is still unknown.
> 
> Whatever the circumstances, multiple sources said Keim had far less of a presence in the building in 2022 than in years past, making it challenging for the head coach and general manager to coalesce on personnel matters.
> 
> Keim was not made available for comment on this story.
>
> The decision about Kingsbury's future, and the direction of the organization, will fall to Bidwill. Multiple sources inside and outside the Cardinals organization said the relationship between Kingsbury and Bidwill has not been without its own share of tension, though the two men, along with defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, regularly meet for film sessions and one-on-one postgame meetings.
> 
> 
> But given the on-field results, any semblance of a relationship with Cardinals ownership might not be enough to save Kingsbury.
> 
> ""They hold him accountable for wins and losses,"" a source close to Kingsbury said, before contending that Kingsbury hasn't received the resources he believes are necessary to win.
> 
> A source close to Kingsbury said the coach wanted to fire offensive line coach/run game coordinator Sean Kugler well before he was dismissed last month for allegedly groping a woman before a game in Mexico City, a claim Kugler is disputing through NFL arbitration.
>
> Kugler suddenly lost opportunities to contribute to offensive planning meetings months ago, according to a source close to Kugler, but the belief from multiple Cardinals sources was that Bidwill didn't want to pay Kugler's contract buyout. Kingsbury loyalists cite the situation as evidence of the coach's limited control in Arizona.
> 
> ""He knows that it's not a situation that lends itself to him being happy and successful and at his best for that organization, which he wants to be,"" a source close to Kingsbury said. ""They won't let him. They won't let him be great.""

I can see who's really doing it. I can also see where people are sometimes cutting corners.""

That brought us to this mid purgatory.

Shit I forgot terrible off season lack of moves, and roster construction. A pricey QB with up and down performance. Draft picks are taking too long to develop or they just fall off. Pass rush has been meh over all.

On the good side JJ, Zack Allen, Eno, Collins, Simmons, Hollywood, DHop and rarely Moore have shown growth and exceptional play. Ditching Chandler hurt a bit but was the right choice.

Kyler has given us some highlights and that Raider win was magic. 

VJ seems solid to good over all given CB issues.

15141,135623,135623,TJeffersonsBlackKid,"Kylers contract was negotiated by Steve Keim and Erik Burkhardt who are both drunken idiots and the laughingstock of the league at their positions. Rumor in the Cardinals headquarters is that Kylers camp out in the clause to squeeze out extra money though this has never been proven. Still, it’s not like coherent minds are putting these items together.

Regarding the Cardinals, Keim consistently put together decent free agents, shit draft, and no depth. Every team has injuries but not every team was having to start who the Cardinals were having to start.

Here’s a list of the Cardinals offensive starters who missed significant time due to injuries/suspension:

Kyler Murray

Zach Ertz

DeAndre Hopkins

James Connor

Hollywood Brown

TJ Humphries

Rodney Hudson

Justin Pugh

In addition to these injuries, we started 10 different o-line combinations and 14 different players on that o-line. Kelvin Beachum started every game so effectively the 4 other positions were filled by 13 different starters. We went down to our FIFTH string guard at one point, starting Rasheed fucking Coward for three games. Coward was a defensive tackle who became an offensive tackle who filled in at guard for us due to our situation.

Every team has injuries but not every team has Steve Keim dealing with depth. Keim does not believe that line depth matters and believes it is not something to budget for.

The remains of this squad and bringing a new system to a QB who can’t walk practice until the seasons already started is the challenge. Also Nuk understandably wants to leave.

Even still, the idea of anyone shying away from a head coaching job anywhere is pure horseshit. Maybe Bidwell is being too apprehensive or not offering enough or both.

- All-Pro C Rodney Hudson inures his pec and misses several games and is clearly injured when he does play. His backup is Max Garcia, the second string right guard,

- JJ Watt blows up his shoulder and is done for season.

Carry that to this season where their paper thin o-line has been more injured than the entire rest of the league, Ertz is done for the year, Nuk and Brown have been on the field together once, Conner is beaten up, a fucking coach got fired for being a pervert, and Kliff is still a dumbass.

The NFL Community, abhor players:

1. Who are overly aggressive and put themselves in bad situations
2. Who break laws such as DUI, Illegal weapon and drug possession
3. Who assault others and particularly women
4. Who sexually assault others

Yet, all these kids (as I get older these guys are just kids), are finding the things they enjoy off the field that do not put themselves in bad situations.

A large part of the NFL Community think 21 year old kids should be golfing, hiking, dating, having kids, raising kids, driving fancy cars, building/buying fancy houses, partying, drinking, whoring as all are good activities because those things don't distract from football apparently (lots of sarcasm).

This part of the NFL Community doesn't think video games are an approved recreational activity. They put a stigma to it and they attack him off the field for it. It's horse shit.

I don't doubt it. His accuracy is really good. You have to work with what you got, and while I think we could pay more of an investment to our offensive line; when we pay more they aren't healthy. When we have gaps in the oline it has to collapse, the QB has to roll out or step forward.

I don't know where we will find an oline at any point in the season where he can get more than 3 seconds to dropback and pass.

This isn't just about Kyler Murray, this is a problem on almost every football team. When they say a teams oline is good, it doesn't mean the QB gets 4 seconds to hit a target in the pocket. Murray just happens to be so much faster than most pocket passing QB's. He seems to either run or throw. I'd like to see him rollout into some open space and throw. I'd like to see him step up into the pocket and throw. He rarely does and he usually commits to run.

Most your points are valid but I think this one is misconstrued. Kyler sits in the pocket too long and he's just not a pocket passer. He's not tall and he needs to either step up to throw or roll out to throw over the defensive line. Russell Wilson did this for years. To throw over a defensive line these days you have to be a taller QB, a Peyton Manning build QB. 

I think the problem with Kyler Murray is he is skittish about leaving the pocket. He wants to dance in the pocket but we just don't have the line to give him that time and when he rolls out late or steps forward late, they have a man on contain. Rolling out earlier usually forces the LB on contain to commit early opening up the field. Ertz/Conner/Benjamin should be the outlet if the contain commits.",2.0,azcardinals,t3_yb7a9h,False,0.0,:Black1: Kyler Murray,2022-10-23T02:40:18Z,azcardinals,0.0064601736538513

16032,147323,147323,UserInAtl,"Realistically the Cardinals will go where Murray does. If he goes back to the MVP levels of last season we are probably fine. Otherwise the roster is pretty much terrible, especially if Hop leaves. Probably not as bad as r/nfl makes it out to be but way worse than this sub, who tends to massively overrate players, especially if they are from ASU or white.

If we draft #3 we are probably fine with Allen, and whoever we pick in the DLine. Not top 10 but good. CB is pretty weak. Wilson could keep developing but Murphy is a slot guy and we have a gaping CB1 hole. The rest of our secondary is good though. Unfortunately Safety is more of a luxury position though. Simmons is inconsistent and Collins is fine but pretty overrated by this sub. Hes definitely a stater but your not even thinking about him when talking top LBs, but I also disagree that he is behind schedule.

Our Oline is pretty poor. Hump is expensive but probably our best lineman. When Pugh isn't busy being injured he is total garbage. Hudson retired unofficially last year and Jones has potential but he is best at Humps position. Beechum is a starting quality guy though. The rest aren't even worth mentioning. Probaly depth at best but you don't want any of them actually playing 

Ertz is fine but aging. He is probably hitting the wall sooner or later and McBride did fine. Trending in the right direction but I dont think you build your offense off of him next year. Maybe in 2 or 3 though. Connor is good but our line can't open holes so it doesn't really matter tbh. Our WR group outside of Hop is probably bottom 10. We wildly over rate Wesley. Great depth but he isnt a starter. Dortch isn't a WR 1 either.

Really, if Murray comes back strong were probably 1 or 2 good drafts from competing (especiallyif he can get outside of the pocket and take pressure off of our terrible OLine which will take a bit to fix). If he doesn't then were probably back to where the Cardinals were pre Arians.",1.0,azcardinals,t3_10umkya,False,0.0,:Primary1: Kyler Murray,2023-02-05T17:07:55Z,azcardinals,0.0002696098232167

16260,147605,147605,UserInAtl,"I think Colt played well today. That being said, the Ram's QB could not hit the side of a barn. Its hard to judge this game because the other team clearly wasn't going to score more than 1 TD. Stats wise McCoy did alright. He wasn't some world beater with  a line of 26/37	238 yrds	1TD	0 INT and more or less just went off short passes (which this sub dogs Kyler about non stop). If the other team had some sort of offense that could make a drive or two, I think this game may not have looked so clean since we went 3 and out a ton.

I think we need another game or two. In this one, there was never a real threat of losing after you went up because the Rams QB was so terrible. In other games, its going to matter when your QB throws a ball 2 yards pass the LOS on 3rd and 10. I think Colts longest play was 25 yards (and I think that was his only pass longer than 10 yards but I may be wrong). That is okay if you can pin your hat on the defense and get a game manager, but I don't think our defense is at that level.

I agree that Kyler has not been good this year, but TBH I think that this sub has such a raging hate boner for the guy that anything (even mediocre play from a backup QB) will be enough to crown the other guy.  You could of course give up on him and hope it isn't a Tua or Hurts situation. That also means you need to draft another QB next season because Colt is really at best a career backup and is 36. Maybe it works and Kyler's first 3 years were anomalies, then we look great. What's more likely is you get a HC who can use his skillset similar to Hurts or Lamar, and that team goes off while we are back where this team has been most of my life, with no QB and every season hoping you get the #1 pick.

IMO this roster is not very good. Its built mostly off of expensive injury prone vets. Even with Murray on his rookie contract, we had to lose talent last off-season because our cap is a total mess.... with a rookie QB contract. That mess got us a playoff exit. 

Keim did get us 1 playoff win but he also got us 2 failed HCs and a 1st overall pick. His drafts are terrible, and the only defense against that is a handful of players who really haven't been around long enough to crown.

Keim has been the constant here and along with him has been a constant theme of missing on picks, massive holes in the roster, poor oline, and injury prone players backed up with little depth. He cannot draft well enough to fill a rebuilding roster and because of that we never to through rebuilds.

This is true for the full remaining term of the employee’s contract...Once an employee’s contract has expired, the employee is free to seek other employment with another NFL club...

The remaining term (time frame) of the contract is in place, and during that time, the employing team may seek compensation from any other team wishing to hire the retired coach. Once that term is up (the time frame covered by the contract has expired), then the coach is free to seek employment from any team free from any obligation to the original team.

In other words, the contract does not toll, and the time frame covered by the contract runs as normal. If the contract tolls, then it would never expire.

Edit: For further clarification, this came up during the Arians contract. Arians was under contract with the Cardinals until 2018, and they had a team option to extend his contract for the 2019 season. Arians retired and sat out the 2018 season and then came back to coach the Buccaneers in 2019. The NFL originally stated that the Buccaneers didn't owe any compensation because Arians' contract originally only ran through 2018; the Cardinals disagreed believing that they had the ability to exercise the team option to keep him under contract for 2019 as well.

>Fowler: Let's start with the former head coaches, Dan. Sean Payton seems to be lurking in a big way, and speaking of worst-kept secrets, Payton circling around the Chargers is probably one. Some around the league believe he would wait that one out (if the Saints would trade his rights, of course).

>Graziano: I'd like to stop here for a second and talk about Payton, because I think just about every team with an opening will want to talk to him. Carolina, for example, would probably love a chance to throw a pile of money at Payton. But my sense is that he'll be picky and will look for a spot where the QB situation is solid, first and foremost. That's why I think a lot of people are connecting him with a potential Chargers opening. People would line up to coach Justin Herbert if that job came open. If not there, I've been told to watch Arizona as a potential Payton destination (again, assuming there's an opening there). And your point is well taken about the fact that an interested team would actually have to give the Saints some compensation in return for Payton, since he's still under contract with New Orleans. Makes me think it's even less likely that NFC South rival Carolina would have a chance.

Doesn't seem like there is much there to me.

This whole scenario is a little trickier because of the change of possession during the play, and looking back over the rules, I'm not entirely sure which scenario actually applies (if there even is one)

Edit: Looking at this a few times I would say that Item 4.1 would be the applicable scenario, with the caviat that the runner intentionally fumbled forward, which per the rules is considered a forward pass.

This is another dumb argument that undercuts your own supposed point. You're saying his stats don't matter unless he's producing at near-MVP level like he did in 2021.

I'll explain it to you again:

You said Hurts' stats prove he's better.

I showed that the last time (2021) Kyler was healthy for most of the year (like Hurts in 2022) and had a good team around him (yet still worse than the 2022 Eagles), he actually **outperformed** Hurts.

And now you wanna compare 2022 Kyler, who only played little over half the season with one of the worst OLs and teams in football, picking third overall to a guy who played 15 games with the best roster in football, hands-down the best OL, and whose team will likely be Super Bowl champs to one another?

Hurts: 15 games started, 61% completion, 3144 yards, 16 TD, 9 INT

Murray: 14 GS, 69.2% completion, 3,787 yards, 24 TD, 10 INT

You're not making the point you think you're making. Yes, Jalen had a better 2022, but Murray is the more talented player overall, and anyone can use stats to make it seem like one QB is definitively better than the other. Kyler had the better team and injury luck in 2021, and his stats were much better than Hurts. I'm saying Kyler is more TALENTED, not that he had better stats in 2022. They're not the same thing, precisely because things like roster talent outside of QB and playcalling make an outsized impact on a QB's output.

Now let's take a look at Hurts in 2022, with an Eagles roster that's much better than even the 2021 Cardinals:

15 GS, 66% completion, 22 TD, 6 INT, 3,701 yards.

So as a the likely MVP this year, Hurts, having played 1 more game than 2021 Kyler had a worse completion %, less TDs, and slightly fewer yards. To his credit, he had 4 less INT.

So it's pretty reasonable to assume that Kyler is more talented than the very talented Jalen Hurts, considering that Hurts' stats are still comparable or worse than Kyler's on an even better 2022 Eagles roster than the 2021 Cardinals roster. That's using your own  passing statistics argument.

2. Only two teams from the NFC West went to playoffs, and they were the only two teams even close to going (not three, the Rams finished 5-12)
3.

His OL was even taller in college and he apparently had no issue seeing over them then. Either he’s too short to see over them, or he’s not. A 6’5 average college OL is in not easier to see over than a 6’4 NFL OL. 

It’s almost as if him struggling has more to do with coaching, not understanding defenses, and having to run for his life than “too short”.

You’re making my point for me. Baker is 6’. Almost like height doesn’t have much to do with it. Drew Brees was a HOFer at 5’10. Jamarcus Russell was a bust at 6’6”.

I watched every game he played in college at OU, and he was primarily a pocket QB who had 2-3 *called* runs a game. He wasn’t a scrambler and didn’t run many bootlegs or move too much. His athleticism doesn’t need to be as big a part of his game as it has been under Kliff. He can play from the pocket.

It’s something else, not the height crap.

EDIT: Also, this is a really silly argument:

“Everyone keeps saying Heisman winner and he was 7-0 on a mvp year that one half a season.  Yeah.  That’s pretty cool but an NFL season is longer than 7 games.”

So how did he see over his OL well enough to start 7-0 last year and at OU? Did he shrink starting week 8? How did Brees do it at the same height for about 15 years? Your argument doesn’t make sense. Kyler has issues, but height ain’t it.

If coaches scouted and drafted, you wouldn’t have area scouts and personnel men.

Position coaches help with things like private workouts teams hold and sometimes help at pro days etc. And surely they do give their opinion when asked about specific players, but it’s a small part of the personnel equation. Jerry Sullivan, the Cardinals WR coach in 2020, was privately coaching Justin Jefferson and was on record saying that Justin was the best WR he’d ever coached in his 40 years in the league.

One of my bigger questions about Carter is pad-level at times. Leverage isn’t an issue for him in cfb because of what a freak he is, but all NFL athletes are freaky. He’ll need to clean that up, but I wonder if it’s an artifact of him being gassed. As in, could be an issue that naturally resolves itself if you play him more selectively. Everything else is so obvious on tape though. Absolute game destroyer. Cool, cool player to watch.

Will Anderson I loved. I think just because he is such a high-effort player. Gets thrown around a lot, often as a meme these days, but he truly is a dog. I also immediately thought of Von because of their physical stature and burst but they’re different players, specifically because of the aforementioned bend. Not that Anderson is stiff, but Von was otherworldly in that regard. I loved Anderson’s tape on stunts and the few snaps I saw him in space. Just feels like a smart dude, always puts himself in great position even if he isn’t the best finisher. He has a tendency to get stonewalled by tackles more than you’d like to see (felt like Texas was a decent example of this) so I think he might disappoint early vs tackles with a strong anchor and light feet. All in all though, really fun edge to watch if only because his ferociousness is infectious. I do think he’s a good bit below my favorite recent edges like Myles Garrett and Nick Bosa, though. I’d like to see him utilized similar to how the Cowboys use Parsons.

If I had to choose, I’d take Will Anderson because I’m a sucker for flashy plays (sacks). I also like that he’d play more snaps overall than Carter.

If Sanders was good/trustworthy, he would be playing. But he’s not. No shade on him tho, he’s a third-round rookie, it’s totally fair not to expect him to play right away.

I got bad news on Simmons. He’s not out of position, he’s just not good. He looks out of position because he can’t play any position well. He was lost at ILB. He got spun by Juju trying to cover him 1-on-1 in the slot. Gave up a TD to Kelce. The chickens of his “positionlessness” are coming home to roost.

As for Zaven, he’s similarly just bad. Took a chance on a small-school guy after we missed out on all the top prospects and he’s getting exposed against the first good players he’s played. Can’t get off blocks. Doesn’t plug his gap. Gets caught in the pile frequently allowing cutbacks or getting himself walled off.

I get the frustration with the coaching, but ultimately you need enough talent and this is one of the least talented defenses we’ve ever seen in Arizona.

Trying to put homer bias aside but I think objectively Arizona is a much better spot to be than Denver. 

Denver doesn’t have much draft stock and would have to give up some of it just to get SP. 

Then the elephant in the room in Denver is 35 year old Russell Wilson. It’s fair to be concerned he is genuinely washed after back to back worst seasons of his career. Point to the finger injury or Hackett if you want but it’s still factual.

Feels bad about firing Kliff and wishes Steve the best. He says Kliff put in maximum effort and tried harder than any coach he'd seen. Regression was what caused him to make the change. He thinks he's a great person.

Would prefer to hire GM before coach, but will do the right thing. Already interviewed 2 internal and 1 external with more external this week. But later he said he was only confirming he had the 2 internal interviews.

He says he expects to interview and internal coach candidate(VJ). 

Talking to ""team leaders"" for input on what the team needs, along with people he respects in the league. 

Accelerator events in the past 2 years have allowed him to meet with up and coming GM candidates. 

Sounds like he doesn't think the past staff ""got the most"" out of players on the team and has heard input from ""team leaders"" that the culture needs fixed.

Thinks that the roster is good enough to be 1st in NFC West.

Murray has natural talent that just needs better coaching (teammates defend him).  High draft pick.

Media darlings and NFL favorites to go to the Super Bowl for 2016

2016 everyone was healthy we were ready to go to the Super Bowl. Opening game we thought we had in the bag with Tom Brady out and then Garappolo…we lost to a missed field goal kick.  Same season where we had the ridiculous 6-6 tie overtime bore fest/anti-climatic game (some people would say) where both team’s kickers missed against the Seahawks. 

That was the worst to come in with HIGH expectations and respect from fans and the NFL to miss the playoffs to a mediocre 7-8-1

So dumb. 

2018 was a close second. We couldn’t do anything. Constant 3 and outs with Josh Rosen taking the lead. I had high expectations and even had a license plate with the ROSN1   That offense sucked.

Murray plays COD not with his own teammates but with a whole set of another people. That’s something to consider too. So it’s not that COD is bad but most of the time he plays with another professional league!

Maybe it’s the same with Kliff too. I joked and said I want my coach to be overweight from all the potato’s chips they eat staying up late. Using all the hours to study film not workout.

21168,187377,187377,gwwwhhhaaattt,"2006 new stadium opened. That brings a ton of fans from a history of lack of loyalty. 2008-2009 made us Super Bowl contenders and division competitors. Then we didn’t really compete until Bruce Arians came in.

Remember the Arizona franchise is young. Like 1988 young.  I remember growing up in Phoenix and I knew one kid that was an Arizona Cardinals fan. Most people were cowboys fans because that was the cool thing to do (they were the team in the early 90’s). 

I think with the success of the Stadium opening, building of the Super Bowl team, then continuation of a winning culture for Bruce Arians continued that momentum. 

People also forget though that most fans were fed up with Bruce Arians at the end of his term because he was stubborn and too loyal to his attitude and coaches.  We weren’t happy with mediocre. It’s similar to the Kliff Kingsbury fans and haters now. 

So that…hiring of Steve Wilks and Rosen killed momentum. Everyone knew that. BA was a character and brought a culture. It was the no fly zone and no risk it no biscuit.  Wilks and Rosen was like watching a little kids band concert. No one wanted to be there. The music wasn’t good and the that concert was expensive. 

Kliff came and Murray came with some fan fare but some fans did not like that we moved on from Wilks so fast. However the biggest thing was Covid.  Kliff and Murray came with reallly really high expectations. It was balls to the wall of risk that needed to have lots of reward. Remember Kliff was compared to the new McVay. 

So you asked about last year…again we earned the Cardiac Cards nickname for a reason. People have been used to losing and watching from home for so long. So for the Cardinals to win so well still doesn’t change culture.  

That’s why I say just 1.5 seasons of dominating wins.  Or Super Bowl winning and playoff contender the next year…then the bandwagon fans will come back. Those fans will then become loyal again.

21172,187382,187382,gwwwhhhaaattt,"2nd post but it’s more of a reality check  

I’ll also say as a season ticket holder for the past 6-7 years. I caught the end of the Palmer years…Rosen really lost us a lot of fans.  Murray is great but the games won have always mostly been cardiac style.  Covid also lost a lot of local season ticket fans as well. I believe it was last game where they advertised the Cardinals 5k run where they are giving away 1000 tickets for the first 1000 registered. There was another promotion I saw where the Cardinals were handing away hundreds of tickets for a promotion as well. 

The stadium isn’t sold out anymore and hasn’t been the last two/three seasons.

With that there’s a ton of opposing fans in (not just name brand teams either). The rhythm of play this past few years at home also doesn’t help. Even the Vikings game that kicked off last year…Cardinals we’re losing bad and it came down to the last field goal miss from the Vikings. 

I heard someone say to another local Cardinals fan at last home game, “I’m sorry this was your first NFL game”.  Meaning the product just isn’t entertaining for people to fork over hundreds to attend.

So local fans just don’t want to go to the games. Regular season ticket holders like me are burnt out from being burned from the product that’s been on the field.  With Covid, Rosen, and the lack of K1/K2 touchdowns…I can see why there isn’t a home field advantage. 

Wait and see how many Eagles fans there will be in a few days…it’s going to be embarrassing.  “Protect the nest” is a bait and switch marketing term because the Cardinals aren’t doing it themselves and the locals can’t be the “12th man” if the 11 don’t show up together consistently.

I remember talking to Cortez and that crew at a game who have been there since the ASU game and they were saying that people pay hundreds to watch a music act but how the NFL is more than worth it for the entertainment/cost ratio. I’m starting to think that’s not the case in recent years for the Cardinals.  For the opposing fans it’s been great we make every team look like SB contenders.

* Some of this is just performance.  We (Cardinals) were hyped going into the game however after that first half we saw the writing on the wall
* Someone said it right: ""Its worse with good teams since the bandwagon is real, especially ones that have been good for awhile.""  This is true also with our fanbase as well....the bandwagon is real when it comes to Valley sports.
* No established football culture.  Cardinals is a fairly new team with not a lot of history in the Valley.  Mix that with not a big winning culture and you have what you have.
* We are more alive during teams we know...or should beat lol.  Texans was fun.  Seahawks games are always fun as well.  Rams games are okay but those fans are getting too obnoxious now.
* I also said it before...the Cardinals doesn't have a cool chant or anything to hype anyone up.  Chiefs has the tomahawk thing and even the National Anthem thing.  We have a CGI bird to protect the nest.
* To sum it up Cardinals fans are great often times a little passive yes...but even more so when we just don't show up.  Not a lot of confidence going into the Chiefs game may have sucked the energy out...then seeing that performance...yeah that's hard.

O line had holes this year, mainly because 3 starters missed most of the year losing the previously highest paid lineman on our team will be good since he was one of them and it gives us more money to spend on a more reliable player.

26611,234450,234450,xIILuLu,"Have people actually considered that might actually be a big reason why we suck? Have people actually considered that Kliff and Keim know way more about football than anyone in here and there is more to it than just these two persons?

I only see people here calling for Kliffs head because he calls a screen but the only explanation I then hear is ""It doesn´t work"". But listen people just because something doesn´t work doesn´t mean it was the wrong call. Not only in football. It´s always easier to say something was wrong in hindsight.

A lot of offenses are struggeling this season. Most defense protect the big plays with two-high defense for example forcing short and intermediate throws, like screen passes. So a screen could actually be a good playcall but there are good football players on other teams aswell and they might do a good play or we just execute badly which could be partly because we are heavily injured.

Lately I have a hard time reading this sub because people are so negative about everything it´s so frustrating and demotivating. I think this team is in a big slump of form and needs to figure it out. Not Kliff or Keim alone is responsible for this and firing them has no guarantee in fixing it. In fact it could even make it worse.

It feels like I´m the last one here that actually believes in this team, Kliff, Vance and Keim. Last season was the most fun I had watching an offense in a long time and it should be better with Hollywood which unfortunately we won´t see for a while. But that offense was a Kingsbury offense.

The Defense is exceeding expectations for quite a while now and is a big play machine since Vance took over. Lots of game savings plays in the past seasons.

And this might be a shocker but I actually think Keim drafted well the past few seasons. I don´t know why the fans demand one Aaron Donald in each draft class but have they actually looked at other teams drafts? The draft often is just a crapshoot and it often comes down to just luck. The Seahawks drafting players in the first noone ever heard of for years, the Browns drafted Baker Mayfield #1 and so on.

While it might be true that the most successfull teams over a period of time are the best at drafting by no means they find elite talent in every single draft or in the late rounds. Keim got us Humphries, Kyler, Budda, Byron, Jalen who are all top players on their positon. They might not play like it lately, but they are. Simmons and Zaven look like they could become a LB-Duo like Lavonte David and Devin White during Tampas SB run. Zach Allen plays like a stud and is gonna get extended. Rondale has enormous potential. Rashard Lawrence and Leki Fotu are contributing and are tremendous value for late round picks. Look what Eno is doing for a 7th rounder and I´m sure I´m forgetting some here.

And now you could argue ""Oh mimimi Keim drafted Isabella over Metcalf"". Yeah guess what... Easy to say in hindsight. Every team would´ve drafted Metcalf higher if they knew before...

Sorry for my rant under your comment but I´m just tired of this absolute negativity lately in this sub and game-threads. I get you guys are frustrated, I am too because deep down I know this team has the potential to go all the way eventually. But don´t make yourself sick of it. At the end of the day it´s just football. Don´t get mad about things you can´t change in life. Find something else in life that brings you joy and where you can control the outcome so your mood is not reliable on the outcome of a football game or a person getting fired. Oh and lastly I´m pretty sure every single person on that team is not happy about the results and they would change it in a heartbeat if it would be as easy as people in this sub make it out to be.

And with that I´m out.

27396,236411,236411,yngbld_,"I have a few thoughts...

1. If Tom Brady were drafted to the 2018 Arizona Cardinals, he may have ended up being considered a bust. I think people tend to drastically underestimate the importance of a player's first NFL team.
2. If Josh Rosen had been drafted to a more pocket passer-friendly team (like, say, the Patriots), he may have developed into a starter or a very solid backup. Having said that, I think the league as a whole is tending to favour mobile QBs more and more, so he may never have been considered above-average.
3. I think public and sports media perception of him was muddied by the fact that he was a confident, politically progressive atheist. So when he stuffed up, people were more motivated to pile on.
4. There seem to be a lot of people who generally agree with me, so he became strongly associated with the ""He just didn't get a proper chance."" meme.
