783,8862,8862,AlconTheFalcon,"That was entertaining. I loved what I saw out of the defense and the running game. Looks like the blocking scheme worked. We even moved the ball when we had to, up two points late in the 4th. Self inflicted wounds killed us. Two fumbles lost and a botched snap on a beautifully set up 3rd and 1 to win the game.

Very encouraging offensive line play, and Patterson is looking like an absolute monster. Mariota had some nice passes and some not so nice. I loved what his mobility opened up for us. He looks like a good fit for the offense, if he can protect the football.

Love seeing Grady getting some sacks. If he can be productive, I think that will inspire great things from this defensive group that is an odd mix of super young guys with big potential and kind of gritty veterans that are trying to prove they belong.

Overall, I think it was a good start to the season. Looks like we should be competitive. I did want that win though, and don't particularly enjoy blowing double digit leads.",16.0,falcons,t3_xbsjat,False,0.0,None,2022-09-11T16:01:12Z,falcons,0.0228974098094081

1178,14406,14406,Bacun,"In the NFL, a single change in possession is a massive change in the game. Tiring out the defense, managing the clock, scoring points, keeping your defense fresh by keeping them off the field (to better close the game towards the end), these things can only be done if you have possession of the ball. There are NFL stats out there that strongly tie possession/turnover with how often teams win. 

The average number of possessions a team gets in an NFL game is around 10-12. If you compared that to Rugby which has around 90 (from Google), you can see why NFL teams don't want to risk laterals unless truly necessary.

I will also say that laterals aren't used because no one really practices it. Maybe a change in the game that incorporates high risk high reward lateral plays will be used, but there are already things like screens (uses a sideways pass to set up the play) in the league. But yea, it is still very risky and players aren't used to the idea of it. Although there are some great lateral plays that have happened, but more often than not stupid laterals end up with the defense getting the ball.",3.0,nfl,t3_zgxme2,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-12-09T11:16:09Z,falcons,0.0839626064224497

If yes to all, now we need to assess risk vs reward. Getting draft picks is not an automatic hit, but a higher pick is more likely to hit. What are out needs? Do we still have WR needs, will ridley likely produce above and longer than a draft pick? Will he not drag down the locker room? Is the reward greater than the risk either direction? If we are confident we move on to next step.

Contract we have to finish is rookie year, but after that will Ridley accept a performance based contract based on his output and always be yearly reviews and no cap hits? He has put himself in this scenario of trust. If you can get through these hurdles then absolutely you keep him. But at the end of the day we just don‚Äôt have the info, we only know the past.

>The Atlanta Falcons are arguably one of the most underrated teams in the NFL. While they have had their ups and their downs, they have never really been in the spotlight. Outside of the city of Atlanta, they have a small fan-base, but that doesn't mean that we aren't strong. Dan Quinn knew that when he was going to be our head-coach, he had to both inspire this team and demonstrate that they were capable of greatness. He started a, ""BROTHERHOOD.""  
>  
>To be an Atlanta Falcons fan, means that the sport is beyond you. It is everyone collectively coming together, to cheer as one and bring each other up. Not only do we push each other to limits that were once unknown, but we are also there for one another when we get knocked down. We are each others support system. Matt Ryan embodied this when he put out a, ""thank you,"" video to the fans after his Super Bowl LI loss. Matt Ryan had the biggest season of his career. On the field he posted career bests in completion percentage (69.9), yards (4,944), touchdowns (38), and finished with a QB rating of 117.1. He was also the first Atlanta Falcons player to win MVP, and had the incredible opportunity to take his boys to Super Bowl LI. Most of the Falcon players, including Ryan himself, had never been to a Super Bowl before, and while the heartbreak of Super Bowl 51 resonated amongst all fans, I could not even fathom what it must have felt like to have been him; YET , him being the man and the leader that he is, took the time and made a video to say, ""Thank You.""  
>  
>Being a fan comes with great pride. The group of men that come out on the field every practice and every game represents that pride for us. Julio Jones never stops. He defies the laws of physics, and makes these unbelievable catches that will make you jump out of your seat. Devonta Freeman is such an explosive player who will constantly blow your mind how he gets the yards that he does. I remember when he first got drafted, no one in fantasy football leagues wanted him. Fast forward to 2 years later, he is arguably one of the most coveted running-backs you could have on your team. This year, our offensive line opened up allowing Matt Ryan to have more than one target, making their plays even more exciting to watch- you really never know who was getting the ball.  
>  
>This should demonstrate to you why you should cheer for the Atlanta Falcon's. We never stop, and we never give up. This sport is beyond us, and as I said we are a brotherhood. While, ""we got our ass knocked down on the canvas \[we are going to\] get back up and go fight again. That's what this off-season is about for us."" We are a team under one. In brotherhood we strive, and in brotherhood we rise.

>**History**  
>  
>From 1965-Present overall the Falcons have a losing record of 312-402-6 since the franchises creation. Rankin Smith was the first owner of the Falcons and was granted ownership by the NFL to prevent an AFL team from forming in Atlanta. The Falcons inaugural season ended in an abysmal 3-11 record. The Falcons would continue to have disappointing seasons until 1971 when they went 7-6-1.  
>  
>The next few years were full of ups and downs and in 1975 the Falcons selected QB Steve Bartowski with the first overall pick of the draft. Lacking competent coaching however (a theme that would continue for years with this team) they were unable to put together any seasons of note until 1978. In 1977 however, although they finished 7-7 and did not make the playoffs, the Falcons defense set an NFL record for fewest points scored against in a 14 game season. 1978 marked the first time the franchise made it to the playoffs where they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round but lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the next round. In 1979 the Falcons would finish a disappointing 6-10.  
>  
>In 1980 the Falcons would finish the season 12-4 and would feature their first NFC West title. However in the playoffs the Falcons would once again lose to the Dallas Cowboys, albeit in a far more painful fashion. In front of a then record Atlanta crowd of 59,793, the Falcons surrendered a 20 point lead including a last minute game winning TD to the Cowboys. This loss would be ingrained in the hearts and minds of Atlanta natives for sometime because of how dreadfully painful it was. The rest of the 80's would be of little consequence for the Falcons with bad seasons and the eventual departure of the franchise QB Steve Bartowski in 1985. Mediocrity was the theme of team for rest of the decade but in 1989, there was a glimmer of hope that once again appeared for the franchise.  
>  
>In 1989 with the 5th overall pick of the draft, the Falcons drafted Deion Sanders, Defensive Back, Florida State University. Deion provided a face for a franchise that had been severely lacking one since Bartowski's departure. Deion, if you have never heard of him, is one of the greatest athletes of all time playing both professional Baseball and Football. He used his pro baseball career to leverage a big contract from the Falcons and in his first game ran a punt back 68 yards for a touchdown. What made this all the more remarkable was that Deion had participated in his first full practice the Friday before the game AND had hit a home run earlier in the week with the New York Yankees, becoming the only modern athlete to score a TD and hit a HR in the same week.

When it doesn't, that's a team's record not properly reflecting their skill.  Whenever you see a jump then reversion (8-8, 10-6, 8-8) or a dip then reversion (8-8, 7-9, 8-8) that's a team whose record doesn't line up with their skill.

If I were trying to reduce the number of tackles that occur in a game while still keeping the closest thing to current football as possible, here's what I would do.

All players are designated as either Tackle positions or Flag positions.  Tacklers cover all trenches and RBs.  Flags cover QBs and Receivers.  They are discerned by the fact that Flag players wear flags.  Tacklers can advance the ball by the ground and only the ground.  Flag players aren't allowed to get hit intentionally.  To 'tackle' a flag player, pull the flag.  TEs need to be declared Flag or Tackle positions in advance.  On defense, Safeties and CBs wear flags and are the only players who can advance an interception.  All other players are immediately downed with the interception at the spot of the catch.

This way you can still have run plays and throwing plays.  You still have a fight in the trenches and the potential for sacks.  You can still have trick plays where a RB takes the ball and throws it sideways to the QB who makes a forward pass.  But you don't have scrambling as much or YAC as much as 'tackling' flag players is a lot easier.

It's much closer to the current sport than Flag football.  The main benefit is that if a kid wants to play football, weary parents can easily say 'you can play QB, WR, Kicker, or CB' rather than the current situation where Kicker is the only 'safe' position.",-1.0,nfl,t3_102evhm,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2023-01-03T13:35:26Z,falcons,0.0461374189861789

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve talked about trying to get over the hump in some of these close games and where we‚Äôre trying to push the offense,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúWe feel like it‚Äôs the best decision where (Ridder) is at and where the team‚Äôs at. I wouldn‚Äôt have made this decision if I didn‚Äôt think it was in the best interest of this team, not only short term but probably long term as well.‚Äù  
  
Ridder, who was 34-for-56 passing for 431 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions in the preseason, has made enough progress in the last month that the Falcons believe the offense ‚Äúcan operate at full capacity‚Äù with him in the game, Smith said.  
  
‚ÄúWe would have had to adapt if he had had to play early in the season,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúI feel really good about where he‚Äôs at right now. If I thought we had to restrict him, that wouldn‚Äôt be the best move and that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to this team.‚Äù  
  
Falcons running back Caleb Huntley said he was surprised when he learned of the news via social media on Thursday. Huntley‚Äôs and Ridder‚Äôs lockers are side by side in the team‚Äôs practice facility, and Huntley said he thinks Ridder is ready for the challenge.  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a cool guy, funny, I feel like he can command the huddle,‚Äù Huntley said. ‚ÄúI knew his time was going to come sooner or later. I think he‚Äôs ready for it.‚Äù  
  
Ridder looked sharp during Atlanta‚Äôs walk-through on Monday, Huntley said.  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always looked pretty good at practice,‚Äù Huntley said. ‚ÄúHe makes the throws that he needs to, and he‚Äôs always confident, so I know he‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù  
  
Monday was the team‚Äôs first official workout since a Dec. 4 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Falcons had a bye last week. Smith made the decision to change quarterbacks last week, but the team didn‚Äôt announce the decision until Monday.  
  
Running back Tyler Allgeier, who goes to dinner with Ridder and fellow rookies Drake London and John FitzPatrick the night before every game, spent part of his off week catching passes from his friend to help build on-field chemistry, he said.  
  
The team‚Äôs more veteran players will take plenty of time with Ridder this week as the Falcons get ready to face the Saints (4-9) on Sunday in New Orleans, wide receiver Damiere Byrd said.  
  
‚ÄúJust go out and work with him, get our timing down, get his trust in us, get our trust in him, just kind of get in that routine with him,‚Äù Byrd said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for whatever our coaches feel is necessary to help us win these next few games so we can get in the playoffs.‚Äù  
  
Atlanta is one game behind division leader Tampa Bay. The Falcons‚Äô top priority is to maximize this season‚Äôs potential, Smith said, but the coach at least acknowledged the fact that evaluating Ridder now could have future benefits for the team.  
  
‚ÄúThere is risk anytime you make a move, but you have to be willing to take that if you want to break through,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúWe have been in a lot of close games, made a lot of progress, but our objective is to get over that hump. If it benefits us in the long term, that‚Äôs a really good thing for us.‚Äù

Ridder has yet to play in a regular-season game, and the only other player on the Falcons‚Äô roster who could reasonably play the position is Feleipe Franks, who was 0-for-1 passing with one interception last year before being moved to tight end in the offseason.  
  
Smith informed Mariota of the decision to make a change at quarterback on Thursday morning. The Falcons learned Friday that Mariota planned to step away from the team. This is the second time Mariota has been benched while playing for Smith. The first came in 2019 when Mariota was Tennessee‚Äôs starting quarterback and Smith was the Titans‚Äô offensive coordinator.  
  
‚ÄúThose (conversations) are never easy,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúYou try to be truthful, whether they agree or not, those are the conversations you have to have.‚Äù  
  
The Falcons signed Mariota to a two-year, $18.75 million deal in the offseason. If he is cut after the season, they would save $12 million worth of salary-cap hit and have to count only $2.5 million worth of dead money to the cap.  
  
The decision to elevate Ridder was ‚Äúperformance-based,‚Äù Smith said. Mariota was 184-for-300 passing for 2,219 yards, 15 touchdowns and nine interceptions this season.

He started slow in those first four games but you could see him calm down and make improvements and  improvisations as those games progressed. He's made the expected rookie mistakes.

Eventually left to pursue becoming a QB coach. That didn't pan out until he had 3 more years as a RB coach with da Bears that had one fruitful season then came to Atlanta and got the QB coaching job he was looking for.

 Pickett was the most pro ready of the QBs he lived up to that. He was thrown into the thick of it and was asked to do the most he has shown he can be a serviceable starting QB in the NFL.

Ridder was next up in line with being pro ready he knows how to run an NFL offense and has the intangibles but he has to work on his throwing mechanics and accuracy. He was given the best chance to succeed and showed improvement with every game. He did not show enough to say he is anymore than a backup yet.

Willis had a great build, speed, and arm strength but is all raw talent that needs a lot of grooming and even that may not be enough. He was not asked to do much and only really showed off his legs as being effective.

Purdy is propped up by a good system, coaching, and a strong team around him. I would have to watch more film of him to make a fair assessment. He was asked to do a lot as well in running a playoff ready team. Guessing the play calling has been dumbed down a little bit and he could continue to grow.

My friends liked the following teams the Vikings, Chargers, Lions, Titans, and Rams. 

Being in Northeast PA I had to deal with many Eagles fans, Giants fans, and Steelers fans as well they were almost all quite a bother.

That eliminated so many teams to pick from. I then narrowed it down more from there and decided between the Falcons, Ravens, and the Texans. 

I liked the Falcons colors and being a weirdo I thought the Ravens being a spooky bird was cool as well. The Texans being the newest team in the league also made me think twice about them as they would be forever the underdog and everyone loves a good underdog. Almost made sense being a new fan to pick the newest team so no one could call me out for a bandwagon pick.

Add on what happened with Hamlin, what's happened to Tua, risk of injury, it's a dangerous game. I'm sure he'd love to win a ring, but most people value family first.

Our parents get us a new car for our birthday, but its a used Camry with a bad accident history. It isn't flashy, but our parents told us this should be a reliable option. Doesnt seem to really seem to help, though. The ridicule continues. So we decide to buy a couple new outfits. Only, no one told us that Beyblade isnt cool anymore, and that honestly, it never was, so that new t-shirt with Gingka on it isnt winning us any new fans. Despite telling ourselves that our new improvements in our life might help turn the tide in our favor, we're still that loser. We dont even make good enough grades to graduate and go off to be an engineer or some shit to return at some far off reunion where we can rub it in everyone's faces that we made it.

Then, the Browns are mentioned, are you make a flawed, albeit understandable comparison between them and the Falcons, but fail to realize that they only made that absurd offer to Watson, clowning us in the process, because they operated under the Daryl Morey philosophy of presuming that the stars would magically align and they‚Äôd transform into a dynasty if they simply lost every single game.

Since I can only assume Terry and Arthur didn't show up to their interviews with a seven year plan to get the team up and running, the falcons need a franchise qb within the next 2 years to capitalize on cap space, have a talented roster with a cheap good qb and probably not lose their jobs

The first half of the season mariota was still playing poorly behind the best (just mediocre) oline we've had in years.

This idea that everything has to be ideal for a rookie qb to start is a little overblown. 

He has 3 of the best safety valves in the game to work with (Pitts, London, Patterson) and a great run game. Design it to be a quick passing, still run first offense and you're developing Ridder more than you are giving him 15 practice reps as the backup

He's not toxic, or a troll. He posted this in the discord and a bunch of us laughed, so I told him to post it here.

>posts a low content post

This is not something that would fall under low content. Low content is to prevent stuff like title only posts or things that would be better suited as a comment in a GDT or PGT.

>calling one of our own players a clown

Bro if I removed every comment that could be taken as a personal attack against a player, there wouldn't be a subreddit. We have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/yo4iyk/i_fucking_hate_jonathan_vilma/) which could be taken as a personal attack against Vilma. We have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/yo2q78/mf_fumbled_a_fumble/) which is also making fun of Graham, and also has tons of comments going after him. And lord knows theres 87 posts about hating Mariota, shit there's even been posts specifically calling him a clown. 

This was something made in jest, not an actual attack like most other posts.

13494,128342,128342,Wayne93,"I‚Äôd be curious on your 15-20 above imparting the long term prospects as well. Philly developed their own talent contrary to having successful drafts with one guy who has stuck around since 2010. Before 2014 they had key core guys on their lines taken in Brandon Graham 2010, Kelce 2011, Fletcher Cox 2012, lane Johnson and Ertz in 2013. Blew 2014 and 2015 drafts and that‚Äôs how they ended up in the needed position to get Wentz then returned to 1 or 2 guys a year that sticks. Actually hitting on FA signings helped with sustained success and good development. Something Atlanta has yet to prove to do under this regime. 

We are especially poor with pass rusher production period yet have spent often trying to get someone as we can‚Äôt develop. Further beyond that WR has actually been one of the most important efficient uses of money for these large contracts in terms of production after. Our WR core is weak, not spending money on it while we have Pitts and Drake on rookie deals would seem foolish as we don‚Äôt have a lot of production from it. There were 21 WRs and 1 TE who exceeded 1000 yards. 44 players exceeded 750 yards, 39 WRs 5 TEs. Our team leader had 866 ranking 30th. Ranked 44th in yards per game of players playing 8 or more games, only 4 didn‚Äôt play 12 or more games so that‚Äôs not cherry picked. 

Higgins possess all the qualities of sustained production that can still ascend he was drafted at 20 and is only just turned 24. Has one of the most efficient profiles despite injuries this year limiting him. I‚Äôd be curious who you consider getting drafted who can replicate this production? In particular when you use Atlanta‚Äôs offence as an example we don‚Äôt use our outside WRs, we used our elite athlete at TE as a decoy to open underneath routes and threw it downfield to feign our ability to pass downfield with Mariota. In reality would likely cost our 1st with maybe a late pick back like a 5th or 6th if moved whcih we have other more pressing needs period. 

This is all to say everyone saying he‚Äôs not worth it, he‚Äôs more than proven to be worth it. He‚Äôs also proven he is that guy. Chase is simply a generational talent but VERY few are ahead of him. 

Jefferson, chase, AJB, with him and lamb being a 4A/B as both can be a cornerstone at WR for a decade with multiple seasons proven now.

Rookie year: 67-908-6 

Before burrow tore his ACL that year he 43-729-4 through 10 games so a 69-1166-6 pace with burrow over 16 games.

Seems that Ryan and the Colts are making halftime adjustments that work at least somewhat. However, if his receivers don't get open right away, he has trouble getting anything done. Ryan's sack percentage when he has >2.5 seconds in the pocket is 13.9% (unsurprising with an older pocket passer).

14373,148766,148766,d1dOnly,"A few reasons for the improvement after moving on from Matt:

1) The OL is playing better. We replaced 2 OL (Center & LG) and while the new guys aren't world beaters, they have played better. For example, last year's starting Center, Hennessy, had to start at LG against Carolina and the entire OL played worse. Also, our starting RT, McGary, is actually playing well for the first time in his career.

2) When things do break down for the OL, Mariota can use his legs. I love Matt, but he can be a bit of a statue in the pocket, which is harder on the OL. Mariota has 347 rushing yards in 10 games, Ryan has 370 rushing yards in his last 56 games.

3) Despite giving up more YPG this season, the defense is actually allowing fewer points. They are giving up roughly the same amount of first downs per game (22.5 in 2021, 22.3 in 2022), but allowing 2 fewer points per game.

4) Were actually one of the least penalized teams in the league, so we're not giving up free yards.

I've said on r/falcons before, but I think we're 4-6 or 5-5 with Ryan this year.

14955,151474,151474,deegzx,"You realize that just last year Pitts had the second most receiving yards ever out of any rookie tight-end *OF ALL TIME?* He also led the Falcons in targets, receptions, and yards.

How anybody could think Coach Smith's willingness to get the ball to Pitts is in question after that is honestly beyond me. What *has* changed is our *ability* to get the ball to Pitts, because Marcus Mariota does not have the ability to read NFL defenses and stares down his first read, and if it's not immediately there he will either tuck it and run as we so often see him do, try to force as a throw to the wrong guy, or stand there frozen in indecision until he eats the sack. And he will routinely miss easy completions to wide open guys on plays because, again, he doesn't see them because he doesn't know how to go through his reads.

Also, that's not even mentioning the fact that Mariota's success in the passing game is largely the result of the extremely effective play action that Coach Smith *has* to set up for him if he wants Mariota to be able to complete passes when needed. Because of the success and relentlessness of our running game, Mariota is often throwing easy completions to wide open guys because the opposing linebackers have already run up and committed themselves to hitting their gaps instead of playing any coverage, effectively taking themselves out the play entirely. It's *this* complete reliance on the play action game that the offense has in order to get any passing going at all that causes Hesse to get so much more play this year, not because Arthur Smith is an idiot who knows less about utilizing his talent than most casual fans, but because we *NEED* to be hitting teams with an unstoppable and relentless rushing attack in order to open up those passing opportunities for Mariota, and the reason we also keep Hesse in on those passing plays is to actually be able to sell the play action so that teams can't just go ""oh Hesse just came off the field, looks like they're about to throw it here.""

Seriously, look up Mariota's passing stats in play action vs standard passing plays. He ranks as a top 5 or so guy on those play action downs compared to other QBs in play action, but comparing standard passing plays alone he's literally a bottom 2 QB and his numbers are just straight up abysmal across the board.

Long story short ‚Äì Pitts and London will be just fine, but they need a real QB to be able to get them the ball in order to be able to have any real success to the level they're capable of. As good as they are, they can't pass the ball to themselves.

Again, we just saw Pitts have a *literally historic* performance last year that was second to only the GOAT rookie TE season ever recorded, while also leading the team in targets and receptions.

So what's changed since last season? The quarterback. That's literally it. We went from Matt Ryan to Mariota, who is athletic no doubt but is a massive downgrade as a passer. Pitts hasn't just suddenly lost all his talent Space Jam-style, it's all still there.

Once we get another genuinely good passing QB on this team who knows what he's doing ‚Äì someone that can go through all his reads, throw guys open with anticipation instead of needing to see that wide open window first, etc. The young fellas are going to be just fine. These guys will be the face of our offense and franchise for the next decade to come.",12.0,falcons,t3_yeef1w,False,0.0,None,2022-10-27T01:19:54Z,falcons,-0.0113878771851826
14956,151477,151477,deegzx,"lmao savage but fuckin gottem bro

I don't know where all these weird fucking Mariota fanboys are coming from, but the one thing they all have in common is that they haven't analyzed a single passing play on film, whether that's in real-time or all-22 or youtube or literally whatever. Mariota can't read a defense beyond his first read and it's so fucking obvious.

He misses wide open receivers on what should be easy completions *all the fucking time.* If his first read isn't there he panics and either tucks it and tries to make something happen on the ground, forces a bad throw to the wrong guy, or sits there dumbfounded until he eats the sack.

The only way reason he gets any completions at all is that Arthur sets him up heavy in play action with a genuinely relentless run game, so when he's called on to throw the ball he has a completely wide open field with all the linebackers having already taken themselves out of the play by committing to stopping the run instead of playing coverage. He's a guy whose limitations Arthur has to plan literally his entire gameplan around, as opposed to good players who would instead open things up and make things easier for you.

Sure his athleticism is impressive, but if you don't have anything to pair it with above the neck that's just never going to be a consistently winning QB. I don't know how people can look at this guy and think that's an objectively good quarterback, let alone the future QB for the team.",2.0,falcons,t3_yck61s,False,0.0,None,2022-10-26T07:48:14Z,falcons,0.0424744802713394

14966,151558,151558,deegzx,"There‚Äôs a little more context to it than that.

Another huge part of it was that prior to that 14 play running sequence, our last 4 drives had gone disastrously and resulted in a combined grand total of less than 20 yards and just a single first down.

The first 3 of those drives each ended up being quick three and outs. We called for Mariota to throw the ball on 7 of the 9 non-punting downs in these drives, and he threw 7 incompletions in those 7 plays ‚Äî failing to even pick up a single yard, let alone a first down.

Then on the drive after that, we started off by calling 4 straight running plays and got off to a nice start by picking up 18 yards as well as our first and only third down conversion within this 4 possession stretch. Then the next play after that, we gave it back to Mariota to throw for a short pass. He proceeded to throw an interception and immediately kill our 4th straight drive.

So while it‚Äôs true that we kept running it in part because they were unable to come up with an answer for it, it‚Äôs also true that the fact we had **zero** passing plays mixed in within that entire stretch which spanned multiple possessions is 100% due to the fact that Mariota had been a complete disaster and the coaching staff had absolutely no faith in him to throw the ball whatsoever by that point.

Otherwise, the seemingly endless onslaught of running plays which they were struggling to find any kind of answer for would have been the literal **perfect** backdrop to gash them on some play action. And setting that kind of play up is pretty much Smith‚Äôs entire MO as an offensive coach. The fact that *not* *once* within that entire sequence did he even attempt to mix in a single deep shot while they were completely on their heels is telling.",2.0,falcons,t3_xw86hl,False,0.0,None,2022-10-06T01:49:15Z,falcons,0.0031338635742257
14967,151559,151559,deegzx,"I think that‚Äôs actually a Mariota problem after watching the Theo Ash breakdown video on Pitts that got posted here earlier.

He starts by doing a little intro segment on Mariota‚Äôs 2019 season with Arthur Smith in Tennessee. And when you break down the numbers, the clear and unmistakeable trend that emerges with Mariota is that he graded out as a top QB in play action situations *BUT* on dropbacks (when linebackers actually played coverage instead of just rushing into the gaps and taking themselves out of the play entirely) he actually graded out as the second worst QB in the league by essentially all metrics.

One particular metric that he ranked worst among all QBs in was sack rate on dropbacks. And not only did he have the highest sack rate on these in the league, but it was so far above even all the other bottom-ranked ones that it stood firmly apart as a unique outlier.

And that‚Äôs because he pretty much cannot read defenses at all when he needs to and will hold on to the ball for way too long, completely missing open reads and often staring down the completely wrong guy and sitting frozen in place until he forces the pass anyway, decides to just tuck it and run, or takes the sack.",5.0,falcons,t3_xwf601,False,0.0,None,2022-10-05T17:02:00Z,falcons,-0.0850644783093278

Does nobody remember last season when we had Matt Ryan at QB and Pitts led the team in targets, yards, and receptions? And had the second most yards by a rookie tight end of all time? I seem to recall Arthur Smith being head coach that season as well.

Now suddenly 4 games into the next season everybody is claiming that Arthur Smith has no idea how to utilize Pitts and get him the ball, and that his stubborn vision for the offense intentionally doesn‚Äôt include Pitts in a major role because he fails to recognize the talent he has in his hands?

While somehow nobody thinks it‚Äôs even relevant to mention that we‚Äôve massively downgraded at QB and now have Mariota, who ranks second to last in the league in passer rating? A QB who only ever looks at his first read and if that‚Äôs covered either tries to force it there anyway while there are other routes wide open or just tucks it and takes off running? And who even when he *does* target Pitts has already overthrown him when he was open time and time again? And who operates a passing offense that, in spite of having elite receivers and the highest time to throw in the league, is such a non-viable option that we literally decided we were better off just abandoning it altogether and running the ball 14 times straight?

Mariota is the fucking problem this season. Not Arthur Smith.

I feel like people are just angry they burned a high fantasy football draft pick on Kyle Pitts and without ever having actually watched a Falcons game have now decided the lack of production is just an intentional decision by Arthur Smith. And then they see we ran it 14 times straight with Hesse and blame Arthur for designing a poor gameplan, not realizing the reason we went so heavy with the run to begin with is *because* the passing game was so fucking atrocious as a result of Mariota being such an inept passer that it was literally not an option.",22.0,falcons,t3_xw86hl,False,0.0,None,2022-10-05T10:50:45Z,falcons,-0.0457149852549087

Became the second rookie TE in NFL history to surpass 1000 yards. Made it to the Pro Bowl. He had a rough season last year due to a mix of poor play calling, chemistry with Mariota, and lack of effort on routes not immediately going to him. He got a knee injury and only played 10 games.

He has fluid route running and quick after the catch. Good hands and he's a fucking albatross. He's an underrated blocker--no Kittle, but he's not a liability and does a lot despite his frame. Great character--he seems quiet but a leader by example. Overall, he has the potential to be the best TE in the league, but it's a case of putting him in positions to succeed and him improving his effort when he's not immediately getting the ball.

Highly recommend watching his [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijDFisPo_No); when he gets targets he's really fun to watch.

TDs, INTs, yardage, etc, are much more concrete and observable, which, in conjunction with context (O line, WRs, coaching) and reasoning, offers insight into how good a QB is.

Lawrence was on the worst team in the league with Urban, who will go down as one of the worst coaches ever. Fields had Nagy and no O line. Lance barely played. There's also Mac Jones, who was really good for a rookie. But even if they had bad rookie years, they are sill more talented on average and will likely do better than 2022's class.

No one thought this QB class was going to be great, and it hasn't. That's not pessimistic, that's realistic.

I think the offense scored something like 10 points when the drive was preceded by a JAX kick off/punt.  And 20 points when the drive was preceded by a JAX turnover.  The Chargers offense was not great.  They were gifted points all first half by the defense and special teams.  And when JAX cleaned up their offense and stopped coughing up the ball, the Chargers offense went to sleep.  Only 3 points in the second half.  I don't think its too much to ask an offense to score 1 TD in a half of football.  If your offense can't do that then its not playing well.

My general philosophy when it comes to these big blown leads is that it's a team effort because they only happen if the defense and offense both stall out at the same time.

18347,194837,194837,nerdyintentions,"I know that it definitely appears that way but I'm not so sure.

You have to remember that we changed both our GM and coach in the 21 offseason.  They basically inherited an aging, declining QB with the worst contract in the league  and no succession plan in place.  My theory is that the new regime was not happy with Ryan at QB but that it was the least bad option.  I don't remember all the specifics (and I'm not a cap expert to begin with) but I believe Ryan's cap hit was way worse last offseason than this offseason.  It was harder to justify moving on from him back then.  

But we do know this for a fact:

1. They kicked the tires on both Lance and Fields prior to the 21 draft.  Rumor was that they really liked Lance but the 49ers jumped the line.  Apparently, they didn't like Fields so it is what it is.
2. Arthur Smith's offense is radically different this year than it was last year.  It is way more run heavy.  Given that his claim to fame is unlocking Derrick Henry then I think its safe to say that this year's offense is closer to his preferred offense than last year's.  I believe he adapted his offense to play to Matt Ryan's strengths last year and that wasn't an idea situation for him.

Because of this I think its plausible that internally the Falcons had already decided to move on from Ryan but hadn't made their intentions obvious.  Then Watson basically fell in their laps. IIRC Watson's people reached out to the Falcons and expressed interest and we were frontrunners to sign him until Cleveland offered the crazy contract.  Once that happened, it became de facto public that the FO was looking to move on from Ryan.  Of course, Ryan wanted out after that so they put the plan in motion.",14.0,nfl,t3_ycko6d,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-10-24T17:58:20Z,falcons,3.1257777244812235e-05

So let's say the first 4 picks are Anderson, Stroud, Young, and Carter.  Who needs what?

If the Bears are open to trading the pick, then they aren't taking a QB.  Which is not a need for them and if they took one, it would create a big rukus in Chicago.  Yes, Fields hasnt been great, but putting Young or Stroud in the room, it would harm his development.  Fields deserves another year of development before passing judgment.  Opposite view: they want Stroud or Young and are willing to turn around and trade Fields (this throws a wrench at things) but then why trade the pick?

If CHI actually does want to trade the pick then they aren't taking a QB, AT 1, and they arent taking one at 2 either.  So Anderson or Carter is off the board.

So, if I am TX, why do I need to trade with them?  I can stay at 2 and get the QB I want and if CHI surprises me, I still get Stroud.

Now, at 4, if I want a QB, which I desperately need, I only need to worry about TX and AZ.   AZ is tied to K Murray, even though he is injured.  It makes more sense that they sign a FA QB and take Anderson or Carter.

So, now, at 4, unless CHI surprises everyone, I still get Stroud, or the remaining of either Anderson or Carter, without losing my draft capital, and I can still go sign a vet QB.

At 2, the Texans can get a franchise player.  Who are the Bears taking that the Texans are locked in on?

The Texans want a QB, right?  Are the Bears expected to take a QB?

Why doesn't TX just keep their draft capital and take the next best QB?  They wouldn't be wrong to do this.

So. What really is going on here?

Is it possible, at all, that the Bears GM is putting out this trash so the Colts will think they need to pay more to get to 1 than they really do?

The Colts definitely want Bryce Young, because if they wanted Stroud, they can probably get him at 4, unless AZ takes him, which wouldnt be a bad idea, but it would be smarter of them to take J Carter or W Anderson and sign Jimmy G or Jacoby B.

So, sitting at 4, you will have a choice to get a high-quality player, and there are enough quality free agents Matt Ryan can back up.
