First is a lack of clear future QB.  Hopefully this is addressed in the draft, and hopefully it’ll be someone who has mobility. It’s becoming increasingly clear that a dual threat QB opens up a playbook dramatically. The colts have failed to adapt to this. 

Second is the regression of the OLine. We could at least previously hold our caps on the solid o line, saying that we just needed a Qb to plug and play behind that wall. No more. The regression has been abysmal. 

As a result we are stuck without a Qb and without a real offensive line. You only get so many picks and trade opportunities. This is where frustration comes from.",3.0,colts,t3_ztjqqy,False,0.0,None,2022-12-23T10:56:04Z,colts,-0.0370034676779181

Because drafting is merely just *one* factor of a GM's job, not the entire thing. There's many other aspects such as roster construction strategy, free agency signings, etc. 


As everyone here has complained of many times, his roster construction strategy is outdated, as he puts importance on positions that are of lower significance in the modern NFL. He also refuses to sign big name players in FA (esp at those more important positions).

2558,34758,34758,DaBlakMayne,"Mock draft I just did:

**R1P4: C.J. Stroud, QB (Ohio State):** He's 6'3 and 218 lbs and is our QB for the future. He's at his most comfortable in the pocket and has a great IQ along with a good touch on his passes. Downside is that he gets ansty under pressure but our OL improvements should hopefully be able to counter that for the most part. 

**R2P35: Kelee Ringo, CB (Georgia):** Considered the most athletic corner in the class, this is a Ballard pick for sure. He's 6'2, 205 lbs and allegedly runs a 4.35-4.4 forty. His ceiling is high but his floor is a bit low. He's pretty raw and is easily fooled by offenses along with having issues with changes in direction. I think having him learn behind some of our DBs (assuming Gilmore comes back) would be a huge help for him to eventually start full time. But even if Gilmore is out, Kelee is projected to be a day one starter but there will be growing pains 

**R3P79: Byron Young, EDGE (Tennessee):** Is it a Colts draft without us picking a slightly undersized but athletic DE? Standing at 6'3 and 245 lbs, he'd be added to our pass rushing corps, most likely replacing Lewis and Banogu. He has long arms, is explosive and can play a variety of spots on the line. His downside is the fact that he's a bit undersized and needs to improve his strength. He's also stiff in the hips

**R4P106: Andrew Vorhees, OG (USC):** He's 6'6, 320 lbs and hopefully the answer to our issue at RG. He can hold his own against the bigger pass rushers by himself and is especially talented in the run game, he will move you if he gets his hands on you. His flaw is that due to his size, he can get beat by speedier defenders and because he's tall, he sometimes stands too upright when getting out of his stance. But he should shore up the line and keep Stroud from panicking along with giving JT all the space he needs to punch through the LOS. 

**R5P140: Rakim Jarrett, WR (Maryland):** He's 6'0 and 200 lbs. His big selling point is his high IQ, he can play anywhere as a receiver and knows where he needs to be once the play starts. He's also good at getting yards after catching due to him being hard to bring down. He however doesn't have good separation speed so he's not the ideal person to use for vertical plays, he's more of a short to mid route guy which could be great in the redzone but he may be limited to a slot role with us. 

**R6P181: Kenny McIntosh, HB (Georgia):** He's 6'1 and 210 lbs. He's a late round pick so why not take a shot? He's a dual threat HB and can play a role in the passing game that we currently are lacking without Hines granted Jackson has done a solid job overall.  He would be a special teamer to start out for sure but he could easily start making his way into the rotations on third downs and such. This also helps us in 2024 when all our current RBs are free agents, one less player we'll have to worry about. Let it be known that I 100% think we extend JT before 2024 but the backup role will be wide open. 

**R7P223: Kei'Trel Clark, CB (Louisville):** He's a hybrid CB who can play both slot and outside and is 5'10 and 180 lbs. It wouldn't surprise me if Kenny Moore gets traded before the deadline. We will need someone to potentially fill in that spot. I'm not saying Clark will immediately start but he could be in the rotation. He can play press and cover decently enough. He's also competitive and a bit of a daredevil who sometimes plays the ball instead of the person to try and get a pick (both a pro and a con).",6.0,colts,t3_10v60yg,False,0.0,Andrew Luck,2023-02-06T13:53:29Z,colts,0.0152788747204146

My go to with this is the 2018 draft where the top QBs were ranked as following: Rosen > Darnold > Mayfield > Jackson > Allen 

Rosen was traded after his rookie season and is currently on his 7th team since 2018

Darnold flamed out with the Jets and isn't doing much better with the Panthers currently. Panthers are looking to move on by drafting a new QB. 

Mayfield did well enough with the Browns (first playoff appearance in 20 years) but was sent to the Panthers where he backed up Darnold until he was released. Then he turned it around on the Rams for a bit. He's currently a free agent though 

Lamar has been the best thing to come to the Ravens in a long time. One of the best QBs of this generation imo. The biggest issue is will the Ravens pay him what he wants or will he walk?

2809,35302,35302,DaBlakMayne,">One developing rookie LT who the jury is still out on, and and one overpaid liability at RT

Eh I disagree. Raimann has been pretty damn good lately. He's been going up against top pass rushers and has started being able to hold his own. I think he's the starting LT going forward. Smith had a rough beginning of the season but has since bounced back for the most part. 

>An unbelievably horrible QB situation

Yeah our QB situation is atrocious but hopefully it'll be on the mend soon with the upcoming draft. I think getting Young/Stroud/Levis will bring an air of hope that we haven't had since 2018. 

>Some decent pass rushers, but not a single difference maker

Yannick nearly had 10 sacks before he went on the IR but he's a little one dimensional. I think we should re-sign him though. Paye has been good but he's been hurt. Dayo has been decent as well. Wouldn't surprise me if we draft another EDGE in the upcoming draft. Having a lights out pass rusher is sort of rare. There are some good ones in the first round this year but we need a QB badly.

>An good aging corner and a young corner our DC refuses to play

Gilmore has gone off this year. I just hope he doesn't regress going into next year like Rhodes did from 2020 to 2021. I'm not entirely sure why Rodgers was behind Facyson after the first few weeks. I know he's hurt right now though. I expect a free agent pick up to add to the group and a late round CB draft pick 

>Our team is built around a left guard (whose play has fallen off a cliff), a weakside linebacker (who can't stay healthy), and a running back (the position with the shortest shelf life).

Yeah I'm not sure if Nelson or Leonard ever completely bounce back. Both have back issues. No way we trade Nelson but Leonard could be decent trade material. He shouldn't have tried to rush back but we also played well without him. We won't get a first round for him anymore but maybe a conditional 2nd round picks and some change. JT would be fine if we had a QB who could throw for more than 15 yards. Defenses know we're exposed so JT isn't as scary as he was during his rookie season. 

>We also have a GM who is clearly a failure, and who the owner apparently doesn't trust (since he forced an interim head coach on him), but who he also refuses to fire.

Hot take, Ballard is gonna stay for two more years to try and clean up the mess. Most GMs get two coaching regimes before the plug is pulled. Getting a new GM means full rebuild and completely different schemes and cultures for both offense and defense potentially. Irsay is going to hold off on doing that for now. Ballard is good at talent scouting and drafting but he's horrible at the free agency and making a decision at QB. It's like he's so afraid of whiffing on a rookie QB that he's convinced himself that having a vet would always be better. That outlook has failed. We need a young QB to build around and I think his leash is going to be a lot shorter going forward. Bringing Saturday in to override him may have been a warning by basically getting another front office guy to assess the talent as a second opinion.

>Looking at our team from the outside, what top coach would choose the Colts over another team? 

I agree with you but I think there are some things to look forward to coming up with the roster. I also never thought Harbaugh would come here. I want Ken Dorsey or Demarco Ryans and I don't think it would be impossible.

Oh for sure - but after that you are pretty much on your own as the QB. You get your call from the sideline and its up to you to make changes at the line/read the defense, etc.

With OSU, everything comes from the sideline. They make his adjustments, tell him where to go with his reads, and so on. This is also the big knock on OSU QB's. They don't have a lot of responsibility unlike a system like Kentucky where it is all on Levis.

Once MHJ went out of the game, I thought we got a glimpse of who he is - Likes his receivers to be open - will not throw them open.

Many, if not all, threads don't get any depth because the questions don't ask for depth or get downvoted because people don't want to express the same opinion for the 36th thread in a row.

I don't wanna come off as whining because that's certainly not how I feel, but based on reports and downvotes, the majority consensus is to remove ""lazy"" (for a lack of a better word) posts that add nothing new to the discussion that has been posted dozens upon dozens of times.

So instead of having discussions sprinkled across the 5 threads per day, it's more productive and efficient to have it concentrated in one mega thread.

If they crash down the line, the read is to give to the RB and let them go outside one on one with the backer the is pursuing. If the DE stays home, it’s a keep and the middle will be more open.

Or the fact that if you’ve even taken a shit in the stall next to Sean McVay you’ll get a high level job somewhere). There are plenty of qualified black candidates who get overlooked, never rise up the ladder, or have other white coaches chosen over them, because they don’t fit the “stereotypical” head coach profile. HOWEVER, the Rooney rule is an abject failure and ultimately only forces owners to parade black coaches into sham interviews when they never intend on hiring them in the first place. It’s disrespectful, it’s demeaning, and it’s embarrassing. Brian Flores essentially said that’s exactly what happened to him, and I doubt he’s the only one. I do not know what the solution to the black coaching problem is, but it definitely does exist, and the Rooney rule is not the way to solve it. That being said, Saturday is an INTERIM head coach.

Despite today, I still think Ryan is good (we definitely need an heir apparent though next draft). Anyone blaming him for todays performance either doesn’t have eyes or doesn’t understand the team complexity of football. A QB can’t be good if he has nowhere to throw. “But good QBs make receivers be open”. Horseshit (pun intended). Receiver have to be capable of making athletic moves to go get the ball. This corps is not capable of that against nfl secondaries. It’s not their fault either. It was organizational malpractice to run that WR corps out and ask them to be competitive. They aren’t capable. It’s on Ballard. EVERYONE said we need WRs. EVERYONE. Except Ballard. Everyone says he’s a great drafter but why? Cause he got Nelson, Pittman and Taylor?? Anyone with eyes knew they’d be at least decent pro football players. His defensive drafting is awful. Just horrible. Especially on the D-line. Every damn year we have 0 QB pressure. All opponents have to do is double team Buckner and their QB could read through his progressions, read War and Peace, and take a nap before making the throw and he won’t be touched. And you can’t say Ballard hasn’t TRIED to address the d-line. Trading for Buckner (good move), Ngakoue (is he even on the field these two games??) hasn’t fixed it. Drafting Odeyingbo, Banogu, Paye, etc hasn’t worked either. The secondary is awful as well, so sick of 80% completion rates from QBs against us, and minus Leonard the LBs are below average.

But, I think that also stresses my point about how important it is to judge whether and how young players learn from those defeats.

I think Carson’s descent was a little more than just that one game against the Jaguars.

He had an entire season of questionable decisions that repeatedly happened in much the same way they had for the Eagles in the prior season, and worse - he did a shit job of taking accountability for those decisions. Whether or not we care about it now - I do think Irsay personally took issue with Carson being the poster boy of “respect my choice” in our locker room and then missing a game without having the elite performance that Leonard did to back it up.

And I think how quickly Irsay soured on Wentz also directly influenced the quick exit soon after for Frank. After all, Frank was Carson’s biggest advocate even after the collapse in Jacksonville.",2.0,colts,t3_102i2k7,False,0.0,Dhalsim,2023-01-03T20:21:36Z,colts,-0.0558155877594796

We have some really good pieces, but 4-9-1 is not a result that inspires confidence by adding one or two pieces in the offseason. Especially when all but 1 of those wins are in one possession games.

9893,84907,84907,Luck1492,"A:TLA and LOK are both amazing shows. Now that  the new Earth avatar series has been confirmed to be in the works, I think it would be a really cool idea if the new avatar was a nerd. And I think it makes a ton of sense given the way the avatar cycle is supposed to work.

MAJOR SPOILERS FOR AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER AND THE LEGEND OF KORRA AHEAD

We know that the next avatar will always fix the biggest failure of the previous one. Roku let the Fire Nation become too strong and expand its influence too much; Aang put a stop to their imperialism. Aang vanished when the Fire Nation used Sozin’s comet the first time, leading to the wiping out of the Air Nomads; Korra brought back the Air Nomads with the Harmonic Convergence. Korea’s greatest failure was (in my opinion) the loss of her connection to her past lives. While she regained the power of the Avatar State upon reuniting with Raava, all she had to rely on was her own memories and Raava’s power, without all the wisdom of all the avatars before her.

In that regard, then, I think that the primary driving force of the new Earth avatar should be to build that knowledge foundation back up. Notice how I said knowledge, rather than wisdom here. I think based on the rules shown to us regarding the Avatar State, the connection to every life before Korra is truly lost. This means that the best possible alternative must be pursued, and in my opinion that is to gain as much knowledge regarding bending and the Avatar State and everything else associated with being the avatar so that it can be passed on to every future avatar once again.

In that respect, I think a genuine nerd would be the perfect choice for a new avatar. Someone who wants to learn everything there is about bending and the world and everything else would be the perfect avatar to pass on wisdom to every avatar after them.

As for the main conflict and their own biggest failure, I think there are two parts: first, Vaatu’s growth within Raava (as per my understanding of how the grow within each other) could pose a problem within the avatar themselves for the first time. In addition, while Aang’s story revolves around him growing into the savior of a world who so desperately needs the avatar, Korra’s story revolves around pushing back on doubters who feel the avatar is no longer needed. I think the Earth avatar should fall into a third category - people believe the Avatar should act as the envoy of the people, rather than the envoy of the powerful, and there is a struggle for the control of the Avatar. I think while this struggle may be more geopolitical in nature and of a smaller scale than that of Korra’s struggles, it is very apt for a nerdy avatar who is more focused on restoring the wisdom of a line than dealing with worldly issues. As a pretty nerdy person myself, I am better with books and work than I am dealing with people. While they will ultimately grow into a more well-rounded avatar, I think their biggest failure will be the alienation of the Avatar from all people over their lifetime, which will be left up to the next avatar to solve. Note that this is a different failure than Korra’s arc because Korra was doubted from the beginning and proved that the Avatar was needed, whereas people believe in the Avatar’s necessity in the beginning here but slowly lose faith over time.

I’ve thought a lot about this and I think it would genuinely make for a good story, but if anyone would like to comment on it feel free.",6.0,nfl,t3_10rrt9o,False,0.0,:Colts: Colts,2023-02-02T10:50:20Z,colts,0.0384602894315352

Colts GM Chris Ballard, who was previously a scout in Chicago, is very familiar with Bears GM Ryan Poles — the two worked together for four years in the Chiefs’ front office. This would mark the third time over the last 25 years that the Colts held the No. 1 pick. It worked out well the other two times: Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck.  Bryce Young is a complete outlier from a size perspective and would be somewhat off-type for Ballard, but Young’s instincts, vision and accuracy as a passer are the traits worth betting on at the position. It won’t be a driving reason behind a trade up, but sniping Young ahead of division foe Houston would be an added benefit.” -Dane Brugler, The Athletic.](https://theathletic.com/4097059/2023/01/17/2023-nfl-mock-draft-dane-brugler/?source=user_shared_article)",89.0,colts,t3_10edhfw,False,0.0,Touchdown Jesus,2023-01-17T08:24:47Z,colts,-0.0064089919578311

I'll try to clarify. Watson has done it 30+ times and got $230 million guaranteed and is playing a game today. He 1000% deserves scrutiny and criticism, especially today.

Manning has one documented incident. It was really gross, he was way out of line, he also 1000% deserves scrutiny and criticism just as he deserved to get sued for it. I think less of him because of it, as should any fan of any team. All of this I've already said.

My entire point, going back to the original post, is that today, the day that Watson plays in the NFL on a massive contract despite everything that we know he did, should be met with backlash.

I'm not sure what you're going for here. We're on the same side - sexual assault isn't okay, what Manning did isn't okay.

Personally I didn't chant anything because it happened before I was born and didn't find out about it until he was in Denver (shocking that the Indy/national media didn't mention negative info on Peyton Manning).

But with the benefit of hindsight - it fucking sucks. It was a really shitty thing to do and, from what I can tell, he absolutely deserved to be sued for defamation. It made me lose respect for him.

I don't think there's much room for comparison between Manning and Watson, as you seem to have done. Peyton has one incident when he was 20ish that is gross and not worthy of respect. Peyton went on to do extensive philanthropic work that changed Indy completely, benefiting the community enormously. We even have a children's hospital named after him and deservedly so. But, still, Indy folk tend to act like his a literal deity, and that's not accurate.

Deshaun Watson assaulted 20-30+ women. He did it repeatedly and has shown no remorse. He was rewarded with the fattest guaranteed NFL contract ever. He is a comprehensive piece of shit. He and the browns deserve a lot of flack for the decisions they've made.

I'm sorry Peyton Manning kicked the Texans ass his whole career. I'm sorry the best QB you've ever had turned out to be an awful guy. But deflecting away from rightfully criticizing someone bc someone else did a different bad thing almost 30 years prior benefits nobody except the person who deserves the negative attention right now.

Call out shitty people and shitty behavior. Deshaun Watson's actions to all those women were horrible and disgusting. What Peyton did was the same. However, Deshaun did it 30ish times and is getting paid $230 million to play a football game today. I'm more concerned with the former at the present moment.

2.	the film is night and day different at least for on the run accuracy which levis would need in indy with how awful our line is. i will admit josh’s decision making was bad in college too but honestly this year has shown he still has those same issues even with an elite system and receiving cast
3.	those two are very much exceptions to the rule that accuracy can improve from college to the NFL and the many busts over the past decade sit heavily on my mind. if you have to whiff on a QB i’d rather miss on somebody who showed they can play football at a high level rather than miss on someone who has the potential to play football at a high level

He has a record of 37-30-1 and has made the playoffs half the time he’s been here, not advancing past the divisional (and that was 4 years ago). Hardly inspiring hope there. He consistently gets outcoached. For god’s sake Eagles fired Pederson, he took a year off of football, and in his second game as the coach of a 2-15 team last year, he *destroyed* Reich, in Reich’s 5th year. This is completely unacceptable and it has been a consistent theme in Reich’s five years here.


This is not a knee jerk reaction. How can it be after the ending to last year? Most coaches would be fired for vouching for Wentz and collapsing how we did, and here we are 9 months later and Reich + his staff have learned nothing. They have not improved, in fact, they have regressed. Oh yes, somehow they have regressed from one of the most embarrassing losses in the 70 year history of this franchise. We are the laughingstock of the NFL.


Not to mention Reich picked Gus Bradley to be his DC, a complete reject from multiple teams who has now let two mediocre QBs destroy us. I think most realistic fans were expecting he’d be about as good as Flus, but somehow, some way, he is much, much worse.


How can you look at the performance Reich put out today, and then look at new hires Mike McDaniel, Kevin O Connell, among others, and say “yep, Reich is the guy, surely something will change in year 5!”


By all accounts he has lost the locker room. The team looks unmotivated, uninspired, and chaotic. In. Week. 2. Of. A. 17. Game. Season. He will not take us to a Super Bowl. Ever.

Reich, a winning coach overall, shown the door after end of season and beginning of next struggles in the first half of the season replaced with a person who has ties to the owner and was against the wishes of the GM.

Also, you deal with an owner that is over-emotional in his decision making and your past performance makes little difference (mind you all, this is shit that bad teams do).

You could throw in some very strange plays, but if the teams screws up just one because someone isn’t familiar, it only takes about 3-4 turnovers to equate a loss.

So because we have a new QB and lots of new pieces to the offensive line, we run vanilla pass plays and power runs.  Until you can trust all parts of you O-Line to block you can start running some sliding runs like Q mauling a LB, but we aren’t there.

Honestly, the team is in its head.  There’s no trust from player to coach, player to player, coach to player. The hope is that the cohesion and repetition will allow the playbook to open as the season goes on, which is what happens.

14894,110115,110115,Primary-Bath803,"Thread (2-9)


Zach Wilson is judged differently because he was a high draft pick. Wilson is 5-2 as a starter this year and his play hasn’t been great. He has 4 TD passes and 5 ints and QBR of 45.1. But what if I told you a QB with similar results is receiving adoration?

The other QB is 4-1 as a starter with similar results. 5 TDs-4 ints, a QBR of 46.4 and just got named the Starting QB despite no TDs in his last 2 games for one reason and one reason only. WINNING. That QB is Taylor Heinicke of the Commanders. So whats the difference? (2/9)

The difference is Wilson was the 2nd overall pick and Heinicke was undrafted out of Old Dominion. Heinicke has a great story and lower expectations after bouncing around the NFL and another pro league while sleeping on his sister’s couch. Wilson’s “No” comment didn’t help. (3/9)

While Saleh is benching Wilson for poor play, Ron Rivera said Heinicke doesn’t have to play good to keep the job because the whole team plays better when he starts even if he isn’t. YOU NEVER HEAR THAT IN THE NFL. Only Winning matters for Heinicke but not Wilson. (4-9)

Wilson gets no credit from Saleh for the play of the Jet’s defense but Heinicke gets credit from Rivera for the play of the entire Washington team. Rivera says, “There is just something special about Taylor Heinicke” and everyone else says, “What’s wrong with Zach Wilson?”. (5-9)

Heinicke is beloved, his teammates rave about his underdog mentality and he is credited with raising the level of everyone around him despite his own play. Wilson’s play is always analyzed in the sense that the Jets and specifically the defense performs in spite of him. (6-9)

The expectations of each QB determine the reaction. Wilson gets no credit for the game winning drive against the Bills because he only threw the ball once or for the game winning drive against the Steelers because he had 1 TD-2ints in the game. More is always expected. (7-9)

Yet, Heinicke is given credit for beating the Eagles despite completing 58.6% of his passes with an int and a 66.9 QB rating.  You can dislike Wilson’s play and his post game comments and still understand the discrepancy in the reaction to a QB with similar results. (8-9)

High Draft picks get more scrutiny, that’s just the reality. Whether you think this discrepancy is justified or not is up to you. I would argue Wilson should be given more time to figure it out because he was a high draft pick and is 5-2 as the starter.

Starting with the ""get that sonofabitch out of here"" comments about Carson Wentz. I'm not saying Wentz was the long-term answer at quarterback, but trading your only QB with starting experience, with no plan to fill that position, at the whim of the owner, is a bad look, and double so after trading for that QB the previous offseason and only missing playoffs by 1 game.

[That, in turn, make our free agency period, quite frankly, non-existent. One of the few things Madden has gotten right in recent years is that most players are hesitant to sign with a team that doesn't have a franchise, or at least a starting, quarterback.](https://coltswire.usatoday.com/gallery/indianapolis-colts-free-agents-signed-offseason-2022/)  The only noteworthy player on this list is Gilmore, and he signed after we traded for Matt Ryan.

The same Matt Ryan that, while it seemed a stroke of good luck at the time, was really the only option the Colts had at QB while still trying to go ""ALL CHIPS IN"" on Irsay's 2 Championships in the 2020's claim. And while some people tried to convince us that we were getting an MVP caliber player for a 3rd round pick, Matt Ryan's been slowly declining for several seasons now. The writing was on the wall, but Irsay told us not to read it.

It was Irsay, not Ballard, who fired Frank Reich. It was Irsay, not Ballard, who hired an ESPN analyst with zero coaching experience, to be the interim HC. The same HC who was the first in history to lead their team to a worse record than they had under the person they replaced.

And now, we're picking 4th in the draft. Drafting, the thing that Ballard has done best in his tenure. The same Chris Ballard who's drafted:

* Rodney Thomas II
* Jelani Woods
* Alec Pierce
* Kwity Paye
* Dayo Odeyingbo
* Julian Blackmon
* Michael Pittman Jr
* Jonathan Taylor
* Bobby Okereke
* Paris Campbell
* Zaire Franklin
* Quenton Nelson
* Braden Smith
* Grover Stewart
* Shaquille Leonard
* Isaiah Rodgers Sr.

His top TE was a linebacker less than a year ago and he has had a carousel of running backs in the back field. He’s also been penalized by his coach being one of the most vanilla play callers in football. He’s done all of this and hasn’t flinched.

I’ve started a YouTube channel, and this is easily my favorite video so far. Andrew Luck is the player who got me into football, and it was really fun going through all of his games, and watching each of his touchdowns dozens of times.

In total, this video took about 25-30 hours to create, with over 8 hours dedicated to deciding the order of the plays! I am still far from confident on this ranking, and every time I watch it, I think of things to change. So, try not to take it too seriously, and enjoy these highlights of our gone-too-soon quarterback.

I don't know if its because the increased access to player/teams and the year round coverage the NFL dominates now, but the NFL season almost feels never-ending at times. I am sure we will see some form of load management in the NFL when they do expand to 18 regular season games.

19583,137962,137962,TurdWranglin,"Colts relevant part:

“The Colts’ process has been an interesting one, and, honestly, I can’t wait to hear more detail on what it was like when it’s over. The first round of interviews, which were done over Zoom, were run by Ballard, with vice chair Carlie Irsay-Gordon (Jim’s daughter), director of team development Brian Decker and PR and HR staffers involved. The second round, done in person, has brought in more people such as Dodds into the loop and incorporated the owner in a big way.

That, I think, is part of why it’s worked this way—the virtual interviews almost served as a preliminary round, with the real interviews happening with a whittled-down group of seven.

As for how those went? Well, they were long (12 hours or so) and involved (Irsay got one-on-one time with each candidate). They were also creative, with one person informed of the process calling it 30% football, 30% leadership, 40% other stuff. And so it seems like if the Colts are going to replace, rather than promote, Jeff Saturday, they’ll have done more than enough homework in getting themselves there.

The other thing that I’ve heard that’s interesting? Every candidate coming out of there, or at least the second-rounders, sincerely seem to think they absolutely crushed it. I’ve heard that Rams DC Raheem Morris, Bengals OC Brian Callahan and Lions DC Aaron Glenn did well, with Eagles OC Shane Steichen having gotten the last crack at it over the weekend.

There is background here, too, that’s worth noting. Callahan is close with Peyton Manning (he was with Manning in Denver), and Manning’s word still carries a lot of weight with the Irsays; and Callahan’s dad, Bill, was on the coaching staff at Wisconsin when Ballard was a receiver there in the early 1990s. Morris’s ties to Indy are logical ones, too—DC Gus Bradley (whom Indy’s blocked from leaving) was with Morris in Tampa from 2006 to ’08; and Ballard’s NFL upbringing in Chicago was with former Bucs people (Jerry Angelo, Lovie Smith).

So we’ll see where it goes. And, again, I’m excited to dig in to how it will have all played out in the aftermath.”",29.0,colts,t3_10vaemq,False,0.0,Big-Q,2023-02-06T11:13:50Z,colts,0.0365522829919746

2. Quinn Ewers ( Texas) he was the Highest Rated QB prospect EVER according to 24/7 Sports. He reminds me of Luck for what that’s worth 

3.Drake Maye (UNC) he’s an interesting QB with a big arm and outstanding mobility but others have talked about him here.

Others to monitor are

23046,158044,158044,bjaxkal94,"2023 QB takes

1. Bryce Young - comp for immediate impact - Alex Smith. Young shows hesitancy to throw the ball down the field. Seems to try too hard to aim passes downfield. A KC/ Alex Smith/ Andy Reid style offense that utilizes the screen game and quick passing would work best early on to help him get comfortable with game speed and hopefully develop into pass that’s will to push the ball as needed. Floor- Alex Smith: starter level QB that wont be a detriment to a franchise but also will have questions if “he’s the guy” Ceiling - Tony Romo: multiple pro bowler that will flirt with all pros mobile playmaker
2. Will Levis - comp for immediate impact - Carson Wentz. Levis has all the tools, size and athleticism that’s wanted in todays NFL. Entire field is in play with his arm talent. Needs time to develop more similar to Josh Allen. Processing issues show up on film and footwork needs cleaning up. These could be related to scheme and play design. Mechanics show he’s capable of firing bullets and the deep ball but struggles to layer passes. An early Philly/Wentz/Pederson offense that uses the RPO and play action game would suit Levis best for early success and give him time to develop his field reading and tighten up his mechanics. Floor- Jake Locker: struggled to stay on field as hits pile up due to slow processing and hesitancy. Ceiling: Justin Herbert: dynamic passer that threatens all parts of the field, perennial pro bowler, all pro considerations. 
3. CJ Stroud - comp for immediate impact - Ryan Tannehill. Interesting athletic profile that has every tool but doesn’t necessarily use every tool to its potential. Good arm, not elite. Good athlete, not elite. Prolific college passer that uses the entire field but tends to make throws harder than they need to be. A Tennessee/Tannehill/Vrabel offense that utilizes heavy run and play actions to limit reads and create one on one ones down field will be best suited for early success. Getting better with ball placement and leverage on throws is key to long term success. Floor- Jared Goff: inconsistent performances that show flashes but often disappoints. Long time starter that teams are looking to replace with the “right guy.” Ceiling - Joe Burrow: dynamic field general that distributes the ball over the field with uncanny accuracy. Pro bowler with all pro considerations. 
4. Anthony Richardson - comp for immediate impact - RG3. Hardest eval for me. Similar to Will Levis with more athleticism however does not play in a pro-style offense. In a true college spread system that is heavy in favor of the run out of the gun. Makes throws that make you go wow, both good and bad. A Washington/Shanahan/RG3 offense the runs a lot boot action and half field reads would help translate Richardson’s talent best for immediate success. Half field reads and the ability for him to use his athleticism would go a long way in building his confidence as he continues his development and learns pro offenses. Floor - EJ Manual: gifted QB that never catches on and disappears. Ceiling - preinjury Cam Newton: dynamic playmaker that’s either throwing bombs over the defenses head or running past the defenders.

3. Some of the blame has to be on the QB.

Ryan honestly looks like 2018-2019 Eli out there. 

Where I will give push back is 2019 Jacoby and the injury excuse.

1- When working at a convention hotel whose banquets department grossed about $30-35M annually, we lost our food and beverage director suddenly. Like I've never seen someone in that position just outright quit. But he quit. The company did interviews, but in the time it took them to do interviews, I think they realized nothing was operationally not happening at a high level. So a decision was made to NOT fill the position unless it became apparent that it was necessary. And literally until the day I left, the position was never filled. This $120k/year job (in a low price market) just wasn't needed.

That was the feedback on the candidate. Room blocks can be taught to someone in literally an hour. It is the simplest of tasks. The candidate that was hired instead within a year had a nervous breakdown, laid on the floor of her office and cried, and now is a stay at home mother.

1- Coaches are so much more the benefactor of their roster than the other way around. And we see examples all the time. As a Colts fan, Pagano was a ""defensive-minded"" head coach. Came to Indy and our defense was never better than average. Why? Well, in Baltimore, his roster was Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Haloti Ngata, Chris McAllister, Darth Sizzle, etc. In Indy, Grigson got us Laron Landry, Greg Toler, Art Jones, etc. They were all terrible pickups. Other examples would be Rex Ryan (same Baltimore roster that got him a head coaching gig) and Matt Nagy (had KC's offensive weapons and then went to Chicago where he got Trubisky to lead a lackluster squad). Coaches play a role, certainly, but not as big as people make it out to be.

2- This one is more about life than just football, but people overhype the amount of experience needed to be competent.

Pagano was a ""defensive mastermind"" on a roster that had Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Chris McAllister, Darth Sizzle, and Haloti Ngata. 

Nagy was the offensive coordinator with the chiefs when they had Alex Smith, Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce, and a good Eric Fisher anchoring the line. He leaves and the offense gets even better and his new team is a dumpster fire.

Rex Ryan is another example (albeit with the same roster as Pagano - a roster that got two guys promoted that shouldn't have). Sean McVay, as smart as he might be, has benefited from his roster. Donald, Ramsey, Stafford, Cupp, OBJ, that 45 year old offensive tackle, etc. And this year, same coach and a lesser roster, they sucked.

Honestly, if you can hold a team to about 14-20 points, I'd say that's a pretty damn good defense.

Look at the Broncos this year. That defense consistently held offenses down to the point where if the Broncos were able to score just 18-20 points a game, they'd be like 11-5 right now or something.

Who is to say that holding off on a QB and drafting other players aren't enough of an impact to make you draft at 14th or 15th in next years draft? The QB you want goes off and is suddenly a top 2 pick and you have to give up the farm for him, because the team did so mediocre. Or you tanked for this QB and he tears his ACL late in the college season and suddenly it would look foolish to draft this guy at number 1 or 2. What if you want a QB in the 2024 draft and you tank enough to get the 2nd pick, but someone trades up into the 1 spot and picks the guy you tanked 2023 for?

You draft in the present.

We are in a position where we can't really suck more than what we have, so any chance at an upgrade at the QB position is better than nothing.

Or, we hire an offensive minded coach who will leave his imprint on the offense similar to what Frank did, and it's more of a head coach-offensive coordinator tandem approach.

I'm gonna be honest. I like the Saturday pick, and that's because he reminds me of another coach we had. Tony Dungy. Dungy seemed like he was a very hands off type of coach and didn't interfere too much which is OC or DC, and trusted the X's and O's to them. He managed the game more or less, and focused on supporting the players after a big play or talk them back up after a mistake.

When I was talking about going to therapy, a friend of mine told me he’d grown up hearing that was a ~white people~ thing. 

A lot of Black people I know who struggle with mental illness didn’t even realize they had clinical depression or anxiety or whatever. My understanding is stuff like that is swept under the rug or passed off a lot of the time unfortunately. 

Plus, minorities have to deal with a whole other side of depression and anxiety that white people don’t have to, specifically because of the colour of their skin. The amount of bullshit unwritten “rules” that Black people in America are forced to follow just to be treated decently is staggering.

I still like Reich, I think he’s a great OC. Just probably not meant to be a head coach, which honestly kinda makes sense given we pulled him from the Eagles last minute when McDaniels fucked us. I still like Ballard, because he’s drafted a lot of the best players we’ve had in years on both sides of the ball. They both came into an already hectic situation and I genuinely believe they’ve made the best of it that they could.

That being said, it hasn’t been good enough. They’ve made big gambles that didn’t pay off. Ballard didn’t make big enough gambles, or made the wrong ones in terms of who he gambled on. Frank out thinks himself frequently. 

I genuinely believe that had Luck not retired, we could’ve won a SB by now with the team we’ve built. The risks taken at the QB position just have panned out poorly.

Yes, he for once finally appeared annoyed and agitated.

So let me get this straight. You’re telling me you’re sticking with your claim that Saturday “got more out of the offense than Reich” did based on a single data point, ppg, as I mentioned earlier? And then asked me some asinine hypothetical question about who I’d rather hire based on stats that favor Reich, which you cherry picked and don’t favor Saturday, despite your nice little attempt to justify Saturday by being worse because he didn’t have a full staff at his disposal. 

What are you talking about dude?

Not only is everything you’re saying and arguing ridiculous, but it’s so narrowly focused that all you’re doing is showing your biases. Although your motivations for going on this crusade are unknown, I just can’t help but think you just didn’t like Reich because you blame him for everything even though not everything was his fault. So each time someone tries to make an objective argument about him as a coach, your dislike of the guy clouds your judgment and you resort to just making stuff up. 

Looking at Reich’s years in Indy and evaluating its totality, I’m led to believe it was a success overall, especially for a first time HC. The situation he was provided during his tenure was even worse than Saturday’s imo. Some of that responsibility he has to bear, to which he was ultimately judged and fired accordingly. The rest of it was a calamity of errors that starts at the top.

32006,233538,233538,voyagerx420,"Roughly 12 hours after the Colts’ befuddling press conference Monday night to introduce Jeff Saturday as the interim head coach, owner Jim Irsay called me and Fox-59’s Mike Chappell to get a few more things off his chest:

• He took issue with the narrative that the Colts, who benched their starting quarterback, Matt Ryan, fired their head coach, Frank Reich, and hired an interim head coach with no coaching experience, are tanking to secure a better draft position.

“That’s the most absurd thing I’ve ever heard, that we’re tanking,” Irsay said. “That’s bulls—. We’re in this thing; 9-7-1 get us in, no question about it. … We’re not tanking the season. Whoever says these things, that we’re not playing Matt because (of an effort to tank), that’s all bulls—. That’s not true. … We’re going to do what it takes to win. I don’t know who people think we are, they don’t know us. We don’t tank in Indianapolis.”

•  A few weeks ago, Reich said the Colts were committed to starting Sam Ehlinger the rest of the season.

Irsay said Tuesday night that’s not going to be the case moving forward. He is open to the idea of playing any of the three quarterbacks — Ryan, Ehlinger or Nick Foles.

“When Chris (Ballard), Frank and I decided to go with Sam, Frank wanted to name him quarterback for the year, but I told them, ‘Look, we have three quarterbacks; we need to use them all to win this year,” Irsay said. “… If we decide to make a change, we’ll make a change. It’s not something we’re locked into. We’re going with Sam with his mobility and his playmaking ability since we’re struggling in (pass) protection and moving the ball, that’s what we all decided to do.

“There was never a notion that you wouldn’t go to Nick or Matt later in the season when (Ryan’s) shoulder is healthy. They’re all available to help us win, bottom line. … It’s always been about whoever can help us win going forward. We’re going with Sam, and if there’s a notion for Jeff to make a change … that’s Jeff’s prerogative, and it was always Frank’s prerogative. It’s wrong to say I mandated it (the move to Ehlinger) and it’s wrong to say they can’t go to the other guy.”

•  Irsay offered his appraisal of Ehlinger through two games.

“I’ve seen a lot of potential, a lot of movement,” he said. “We should have won the Commanders game; we let that slip away, up nine (points) at home with 9 (minutes) to go against someone who hasn’t moved the ball much. Defensively, we had a chance to put the game away. But again, we have the ball with 2 ½ minutes to go and we sit on it (punting rather than going for a fourth-and-1) instead of being aggressive.

“So you can see the plays Sam made against New England, we didn’t … give him a chance. We’ve got to get the blocking schemes down. We can’t block their best rusher (Matthew Judon) with a backup running back (Deon Jackson). We can’t pick up stunts inside, I mean, John Elway wouldn’t have stood a chance in that game.”

•  I asked Irsay if this season has convinced him it’s time to grab a quarterback in next year’s draft.

“We have to see what materializes with how Sam is playing,” he said. “That sideline throw he made to Jelani Woods (a drop against New England), that’s a big-league throw. That’s a guy with a strong arm.

“But if someone is there next year, sure, most likely we would probably take (a quarterback), but it’s too early to say. There’s no question that’s on our radar. Even if Sam’s playing well, you’re looking for an opportunity if there’s one, because quarterback is such an important position.”

•  Irsay was asked why there’s been such a dramatic regression in the offensive line play this season.

“I think there are a number of reasons, and I feel very confident Jeff can … make strides to get us playing great ball there,” Irsay said. “… That’s why Jeff is there. We know we have the people to do it, and we have to get it done. When you’re struggling, why, I mean, it’s a number of reasons, but in the end, you have to depend on your head coach to get those problems fixed. Bottom line, the head coach is your man. … He’s the guy everyone follows, so we have to get it right. Why it came apart and all those sorts of things, no one can really know. I have my feelings about how things have gone since the Raiders game last year and us being 1-4-1 in the division, not being able to generate any offense early in games. Who would think we’d go into Houston and give up seven sacks? But I feel confident we have the people up front to get it fixed.”



•  The reason for Irsay’s call, though, was to take issue with his former head coach, Tony Dungy, who offered his thoughts on Ryan’s benching on Tuesday’s Dan Patrick Show:

“Matt, I guess it’s the fact that it’s contracts and he plays so much, then you pay this money next year,” Dungy said to Patrick. “If he gets hurt, this much is guaranteed. So you think, ‘OK, we’re not going to make the playoffs, and we’re not going to win the Super Bowl, so we’re not going to do that (play and pay Ryan).’”

Irsay insisted there is nothing in Ryan’s contract that is tethered to the amount of playing time he receives.

“I don’t know how people report these things falsely. There’s no playing-time thing for Matt Ryan to get his $17-million bonus in the offseason,” Irsay said. “There’s no such thing. They’re all available to help us win, bottom line. There’s no bonus if Matt plays a certain amount of time, it’s ridiculous. Tony talking about it, it’s been mentioned in other columns, it’s ridiculous and completely false. It’s always been about whoever can help us win going forward.”

For the record, Dungy had more to say about the Colts’ situation. A lot more. He was asked what he would have advised Irsay, had the owner called him and asked.

“As a fan and former Colt, I would have have said, ‘Hey, Jim, you’ve got as many wins as the Rams, the defending Super Bowl champs,’” he said. “‘There’s no super teams out there. Get this going. Stay with Frank. Let’s see if we can win a few games here, get back in the race. You make the playoffs, you already beat the Kansas City Chiefs; everyone is saying they’re going to the Super Bowl. You already beat them. So if you get in, who knows what’s going to happen? So stay with the best course of attacking to get you in these playoffs.”",47.0,colts,t3_yq797b,False,0.0,:colts:,2022-11-08T21:33:46Z,colts,0.0045538802374605

You can’t absolve the players who are just bad this season and only blame the coach. They’re playing like matadors. Do you think Strausser is coaching them like that? Or, perhaps, are they just bad? Ballard is 99% responsible for the players on the team. There’s no doubt Reich and co have some say but they don’t negotiate the contracts. Ballard hamstrung the line by letting players go who were much better than guys like Pryor because he couldn’t afford to pay them since Kelly and Nelson were paid so much.

Everyone knew Pryor wasn’t good before the season started, so you can’t feign shock that he’s playing like garbage now. Raimann and Fries have minimal experience, and Pinter has only looked good playing center in place of Kelly. Smith has been surprisingly bad at times but he’s been the most consistent this season.

Everything you said is all hindsight and meaningless honestly. 

The pass rush was nonexistent last year and Ballard traded for a good pass rusher who is performing exactly as predicted. According to you, that was a failure. What should he have done instead?

Agree on Fayscon. Bad move. Should have never happened. 

No one saw the line regressing this bad. In hindsight, they should have at minimum kept Reed. But what else?

Nelson has been bad yes, but what was their option? Let him walk?

The Wentz trade was an attempt find the QB of the future and his familiarity with Reich was a bonus and should have expedited the learning curve and therefore his success. It didn’t work. But what should they have done instead? Just rolled with Ehlinger?

Ryan again didn’t work out as expected, and again I ask, what should they have done instead?

Regarding Hines, yes the colts “failed him” but that also applies to the entire offense and by extension the team. So what’s your point?

Obviously the colts haven’t performed as desired and the front office and coaching staff is certainly to blame. But so do the players. Like I’ve said before, it’s trendy to want Strausser fired, but he’s a good coach and I highly doubt he’s coaching the line to be matadors so what’s he supposed to do? You can’t coach bad players to elite status. 

My point is, the struggles are more nuanced than BALLARD REICH BAD FIRE THEM! The defense as a whole is pretty damn good even without a Rock. Bringing in Gilmore has been a godsend and I think Bradley’s scheme is great. Offensively, there are a lot of positives as well but there’s a lot of work to be done.

Point #3 is Ballard built this team, so despite the obvious successes, the consistent lack of preparation and poor starts, which is clearly a coaching failure, the players he has brought in need to share some of that blame. Imo, he has ultimate responsibility for that and should be held accountable accordingly.

For every great decisions he’s made there’s been an equal amount of bad ones.

Has Moore played poorly? Yes, there's no denying that, but my point about the entire team playing like garbage is also true. Kenny is one of the best slot dbs in the league and I have no doubt he'll turn it around, he's just too good of a player not to.

What drives me nuts about the simpletons around here, yourself included, is your fandom and opinions on players and coaches and their performance is unrealistic and ignorant. You guys operate on a zero tolerance policy and think that's ok. Well, I hate to break it to you, but it's not.

Players have bad games and rough patches, that's just the reality of football. It's absolutely insane to completely turn on a core player because he hasn't played up to his potential over a small span, in context with the rest of his career, and then throw out bullshit trade proposals as if that's going to be a win for the team as a whole moving forward. It's short-sighted and a testament to the fact that the average fan just needs to shut it and let the professionals do their job.

Edit - Also, the overpaid statement is laughable as well and further proves my point.

The ability to read a defense, go through his progressions, make the throws he needs to make, and improvise when necessary. That’s where Stroud and Young separate themselves from Levis and Richardson. They have the fundamentals. They make their reads and make the throw a vast majority of the time. Maybe Stroud can’t bomb a pass 65 yards down the field, but if he makes the right reads, most of the time he won’t have to.

He could go out there and go 11/13 for 115 and a TD and I think people would be like, “Yeah but can he do that consistently?” Or he could go 5/13 for 45 and an INT and tank his draft stock.

Vegas bases odds on what will make them the most money, not what is likely to happen. Sometimes those two things just happen to correlate and sometimes they don’t. A great example is the TCU vs Baylor last year. The line opened up at TCU just came off of a massive win against Texas, holding them to record lows. Baylor had just BARELY put up 3 points against Kansas state. Yet, TCU was only favored by -2.5, a ludicrously low number for a top 5 ranked team against an unranked team. They did that because they knew people would bet huge amounts on TCU -2.5 and they did. And if you recall, TCU didn’t cover that game so everyone who took TCU -2.5 lost big. Some people would use that as evidence that CFB is rigged, which is valid. My theory is not so much that it’s rigged, but that Vegas has insiders everywhere and can manipulate the people into losing big money. Practically, what was likely to happen was TCU would destroy Baylor. The fact they only won by 1 point is a miracle. All that to say, yes, it absolutely could be that odds were too one sided.
