Kwesi’s off-season resigning and additions allows him to be as flexible as possible when drafting, not forcing him to draft a certain position. We are quite lucky to have two solid tackles, two top receivers, two pro bowl edge rushers, and a QB under contract for the next two years. With Olive and Wilson projected to go high, in addition to the tackles Cross, Neal, and Ekwonu, and QBs Willis and Picket, we have a chance to have some top talent fall to the 12th spot.",22.0,minnesotavikings,t3_ttlssq,False,0.0,None,2022-04-01T07:51:38Z,minnesotavikings,0.2199367187499999

4121,31455,31455,DaFuxxDick,"After the Minnesota Vikings released their newest video in their “Introducing” series, a particular 2-second clip caught my eye. At exactly 6:26-6:28 seconds into the video, a shot of a laptop can be seen in the bottom right-hand corner. This very small screen is mostly blurred out, however, because of my amazing forensic skills I was able to determine the player that they were interviewing. I will present five pieces of evidence that lead me to my conclusion that this interview was indeed Cole Strange and why they will draft him as Garett Bradberry’s successor.   
1. On March 3rd, 2022, our favorite reporter Chris Tomasson tweeted the following: ""Tennessee-Chattanooga guard Cole Strange said at the combine he had a formal interview with the #Vikings in advance of the NFL draft.”  
2. In the attached screenshot, in the upper lefthand corner, a Caucasian male’s beard face can be seen and resembles Cole Strange’s NFL.com official photo.  
3. At the bottom and middle of the screen is two words stacked on to of each other, the first string of words being shorter than the second. This match’s Cole Strange’s name if you stack them.  
4. In a brief shot at the top right corner of the video, a logo can be seen that somewhat matches the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga’s colors.  
5. Finally, on NFL.com’s profile of Cole Strange, his NFL player comparison is JC Tretter.  
In conclusion, it is my belief that the Minnesota Vikings will draft Cole Strange as their “JC Tretter” and replace Garett Bradberry.

The top end talent drops off pretty quickly and some NFL scouts said there were about 15 guys with a 1st round grade in this year's draft class. Kyle Hamilton fell for a reason. He's also a slot CB/safety hybrid so why get him after signing Sullivan? Back to pick value which, conversely, stays steady through day 2. In other words, this is a deep class in terms of talent. These day 2 picks hold more value than in years past due to the depth so loading up on those is okay to me. As for the Cine pick though......would've rather had Pitre if we were going that route. But Kwesi said in his presser this week that it's all about taking guys at their best value, so I trust that the war room made the right choice and that he's going to work well in our new defense.

5943,37188,37188,Deserveyourneed,"This has been my stance from the beginning. 
Last year we lost a lot of close games, including;
Beating two playoff teams, Packers and Steelers.
Losing to the SB champs by 7 in the 4th qtr.
Lost to the Cards by 1 pt.
Competitive with the niners, kind of.
Plus close games against other good teams. 

Our offense delivered but was inconsistent. 

Our Defense was non existent. Especially with the lead  2 minute before the half and the final 2 minutes.

Plus we had criminally idiotic horrible coaching. A defensive minded coach that doesn't talk to his QB. And has rigid ideas about how the offense should be run. Who also let a top 5 D drop to 31st by being punitive and ruling by fear.

We have new offensive minded coaches who are modern and not set on what worked in the 90's. 

They have added new defensive players, plus Danielle is back and a new scheme. 

I think we will have a better more dominant Offense. And we have improved our Defense. If we between improved Defense and more consistent Offense improve by 4 pts a game last year we are undefeated. I know it doesn't work that way, but I do believe Cowherd is right.

We lost to the two the two SB teams by a combined total of 10 points. We were close to winning in several other games with good teams. Many of those problems have been addressed. Hunter is back, hopefully for a full season. We have added several FA to our defense that I think improve us. Last year it became clear how bad Zimmer has been.

So long story short. I think we have improved our defense. I think we have also improved our OL. I think we have improved our coaching and front office. For all of this, before the season starts, I feel optimistic.

Especially if the Vikings have a bad year, which they almost certainly will with Cousins because we will lose players on an already decimated defense and be unable to rebuild. So no matter how good Kirk plays, he will be seen as a QB that can't deliver with a high price tag.  Next year his value is diminished no matter what. So he may be willing to extend and restructure.

I know his targets averaged out to 10 per game, but 10 should be the baseline. Imagine they found a way to move JJ around and get him 10 targets in the Cowboys game and of those 6 additional targets he catches 4. He averages 15 yards per catch so that's possibly 60 extra yards, a couple extra first downs, an extra TD or a couple field goals. That all makes a huge difference in a game they lost by 4. Same goes for the Ravens game. 5 additional targets, 3 more catches, 40-45 more yards. That game probably doesn't even need to go to OT in that situation. 

There was also the game where he blew up in the first half against the Lions and then they stopped going to him in the second half. When asked about why they went away from him they said the Lions started putting a safety over the top and took him out of the game. That shouldn't happen with KOC either.

Kirk takes short-term guaranteed contracts so he can frequently restructure. This is a great move by him because it ensures that his contract keeps up with the rising salary cap.

But, there was no benefit to the accusers to press charges at all. For all we know, they could have dropped the charges because it was too traumatic. Obviously, I hope it isn’t true. 

What I would really appreciate is if Kwesi went in-depth about what research they did and clarified who they talked to. We have no reason to believe that the Vikings actually did any research outside of their interview with him. I know Kwesi claims they did. But he needs to be specific. When Dalvin Cook got drafted by us, Spielman to his credit, went at length about the research that went into Dalvin’s legal issue at FSU. And he did it all before trading up to grab him. And Dalvin’s issue wasn’t anywhere near as heinous as what Ingram is/was accused of. 

So until we get that clarification, I have no reason to believe anything the FO says about the work they did. But what makes this painful is that if the FO was dead set and confident about Ingram’s innocence.

29982,187875,187875,castletonian,"This was an awesome listen. Some reactions I have while listening:

* **Mental quickness can be more important than physical traits within the player evaluation process**. Especially for QBs. This is different than, for example, the Wunderlich, which tests players intelligence. The better metric is mental quickness, instinct and speed of decision making.
* **The MN Vikings are not/were not an analytically sophisticated organization**. Spielman describing the incorporation of testing/statistics into player evaluation is sort of shocking. Obviously things are high-level/proprietary, but the peeks we get behind the curtain are... not good. Saying stuff like ""we just run the numbers through the algorithm"", ""testing suggests that mental quickness is aCTuAlLy negatively associated with performance"", ""I gain confidence in analytics when I see it work!!!! LOL!!!"" are hardly reassuring for someone pretending to be an analytics driven organization. More on this later....
* **Organizationally, there was not enough cohesion across player evaluation teams**. Another peak behind the curtain we got was the described process for drafting players. At a high-level, Spielman would get reports from psychologists, doctors, analytics, scouts etc. across many different teams in the FO, then he would make a decision. I found this to be kind of alarming as well. Ideally, the process would connect analytics with health teams, psychologists with scouts etc., so reports don't just enter the void of Spielman's mind where a decision ultimately gets made.
* **Spielman traded up 9 times and traded down 29 times in his tenure with the Vikings.**  Robert tied this into analytics within the organization. Spielman said ""historically, the 17th pick in the first round through the 31st pick in the first round have approximately the same success rate in the NFL"". That's probably true, but is also already ""priced"" into the draft charts of FOs across the league... There's not a strong analytical advantage. My reaction to hearing that is mixed, especially hearing him bumble through the analytics/data part of the pod.. *IMO, the analytics department should be focused on player traits/performance/scheme, not necessarily hit rate on specific pick ranges*. We should be modeling players, not picks. Instead, a shorter way of describing the overall approach to draft/analytics is ""we model noise, not signal within our organization"". On the other hand, he is right that more bites at the apple in the 7th round is a good thing, esp. when college free agent market is expected to be tight. He does show great recall and sophistication anticipating need among other teams drafting after him (e.g. Raiders took a tackle in Leatherwood, so they wouldn't need Darrisaw, Colts signed Fisher/likely will take an edge, we can feel reasonably confident we will get Darrisaw). Spielman really wanted Slater too lol.
* **Misconceptions about trading up and down**. Spielman described situations in the draft where he's on the phone with 2-3 GMs on the clock trying to work out a deal, down to the final 60 seconds. That's pretty sweet to see him process all that. Trading up has gotten more expensive in his opinion.
* **The JJ pick**. Five WRs got off the board and Spielman is holding his breath. You can feel the anxiety/excitement in this discussion lol. Not a lot of conversation going on in the lead up the 22nd overall, they've mocked this over and over.
* **Danielle Hunter pick**. DH tested off the charts, but the production was not there (teeing up a discussion about Travon Walker where Spielman says ""AdRian Hutchinson is a very good player"" lol). We got Danielle in the 3rd round, which in hindsight is really remarkable. The point in the draft where traits outweigh production exists, but there's not great analytics around it.",26.0,minnesotavikings,t3_u9gg6t,False,0.0,None,2022-04-22T10:51:14Z,minnesotavikings,-0.0154635187168391

It was disastrous. We basically gave up 3 years of draft picks for 2 years of mediocrity at RB. And that's not even the half of it.

**The Fallout:**

\- Jerry Burns fired.

\- GM Mike Lynn fired.

\- Rich Gannon lost because he wasn't Denny Green's guy.

\- Could have had Emmit Smith, Darren Woodson, or Russel Maryland.

(We did draft Jake Reed tho)

\- The next season we went 6-10 and didn't even make the playoffs after 3 consecutive seasons of contending (in '87 we were an errant throw away from SB appearance). The season after that, we went 8-8 and then Burns was fired.

1. The CBs are a mess right now. The remaining FA corners are not top shelf, and rookies are rookies. They're more like to be green than the next coming of Deion Sanders or Darrelle Revis. 
2. Smith and Hunter are huge injury risks. If they finish the season healthy, we could get to double digit wins. But that's a big ***if***.

Saying the offense jumps to top 7 isn't a stretch, but I don't see Cousins carrying us to enough points to overcome this secondary, especially against the top teams on our schedule. Buffalo, Green Bay, Dallas, New England, and Arizona are all going to score a lot of points through the air. That's 6 games. 11 wins is a stretch, even with a healthy Hunter and Smith. 

I like O'Connell, but we haven't even seen him coach yet. He could be good, or he could be the offensive version of Jeff Fischer. We don't know.

I'm slowly buying in to the plan we've executed this off season, but unless there is a drastic shift on this team, I don't see a deep playoff run, or even a home playoff game.

No where, until right now, have you said anything that imply you've recanted that statement, but have twice posted that everyone else is wrong for not believing what you believe. Saying ""it's not a large gap"" doesn't mean you don't still believe that Chase is better. 

You're literally misrepresenting statistics to appear correct, but claim to want to be proven wrong. That's a take. Not a good take, but it's technically a take. 

I didn't edit that quote about the catch rates and drops. It's literally two sentences next to each other in the same paragraph. It was one cohesive thought, no mater how bad you want to pretend it wasn't. 

We can also talk about how you claim Jefferson is always running deep, and Chase is always running slants despite Jefferson being targeted deep on 20.4% of his targets while Chase was targeted deep on 23.4% of his targets. 

While we're dissecting these stats, why even mention Air Share yards in your other comment? What was the reasoning behind that in correlation to a player being a deep threat? Jefferson had more total air yards than Chase did and the Vikings threw less overall yards than the Bengals. Of course Jefferson had a higher air share than Chase. That's basic math, and has nothing to do with deep threats. Lets look at air yards per target, shall we? JJ averaged 11.95 air yards per target, Chase averaged 11.97. Which is oddly right in line with their average depth of target and 12 yards each. 

You really need to sit down and actually learn what these statistics are, instead of just spitting them out and hoping they'll prove you right.

Do people say ""No it's fine, the weather and the kicker, and Wilson is better than him and also did bad"" or do people say ""Kirk is dogshit. They never should have had to rely on a FG to win, Kirk should have gotten it done."" 

And I think there is a pretty clear cut answer to that question myself given as we beat the packers in something like 40 MPH winds, and Kirk got shit on for having a 14 attempt, 160 yard game, while they just just let run game handle it. But I'd like to hear what you think. 

And no, I'm not suggesting that Walsh shouldn't have made that kick. I'm suggesting that placing 100% of the blame on the Kicker as the majority of this sub does, is just pure insanity. People can't just say ""but but but, the weather!"" and think it's a valid reason for the offense not being able to find the endzone a single time.

And yeah, Kirk will look worse when the only stats you pick are the ones that make him look worse. It's the same thing a lot of ""Kirk Stans"" do, but reverse. They would say: Kirk did better because he had more yards, a higher passer rating and a better completion %, all while facing a higher pressure rate. And you can talk about Jimmy's high% of first downs, and ignore than 6 of the 9 first downs were short of the sticks and came from YAC. Stats can be manipulated. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Kirk did better than Jimmy G. I'm saying they were equally dog shit. 

But we can nitpick stats all day, it's pretty irrelevant to my point if they were equal or if Jimmy was slightly better. I'm conceding that Kirk was solid butthole that game. This isn't a ""oh poor Kirk is taking heat when he shouldn't"" argument from me. No the oline didn't help, and the play calling was questionable, but that game is on Kirk's shoulders, and he deserves a large portion, if not the majority of the blame.

And as I already said, you can't scream weather for one person and ignore it for others. Walsh scored all of our points, and misses his 4th kick in crazy weather. But it's unforgivable, and we should all get the pitchforks and head over to his house. But weather for is a prefect excuse for why Teddy was bad. No, that doesn't fly for me. And the argument of ""well Wilson did the same"" isn't an excuse either. I'm not even trying to argue that teddy deserves all the blame, or even as much as Kirk deserves. Hell I've even specifically pointed out APs 2 yards a carry as being problematic. Yes the weather was a factor. Yes the Hawks defense was good. Those things can all be true while Teddy also had a terrible game. But this sub is so obsessed with how good he is as a person (and dont get me wrong, as far as human beings go, hes arguably one of the best in the league) that they refuse to accept any negative comments about his play. 

But let me ask you one last question. If Kirk had that statline in that game with Seattle, do you think this sub absolves him of all blame like they do with Teddy?

As an example (with absolutely random numbers) if you have 1000 draft eligible players on average each draft, and say 50 of them are day 1 starters on average, and 15 are top level, franchise players. Now imagine a year where there 1500 draft eligible players, you would expect that number of day 1 starters and top level guys to also increase.",1.0,minnesotavikings,t3_ueld3r,False,0.0,Daddy Smooth,2022-04-29T09:15:23Z,minnesotavikings,0.15792890625

Football is probably the easiest because of big plays like pick 6 kickoff return etc. 

Basketball points come quick but you’d also need to stop the other team. Still id put it as second easiest. 

I don’t watch hockey but most games don’t have a lot of scoring. So 4 goals might be a good games worth. So to make it up seems hard. I’d say it’s the second hardest. 

Baseball is tricky because it’s not timed so you’re not up against the clock meaning you can be behind 7 at the halfway point and ahead at that same point.
