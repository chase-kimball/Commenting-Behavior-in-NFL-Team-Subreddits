3374,31491,31491,Caleb10E,"Some of Maiocco's points that stand out:

* Garoppolo wanted to avoid surgery, but his hand was forced after little to no improvement to his shoulder one month after the season. The surgery should ensure that Jimmy will be 100% for 2022 and beyond, but it means he's recovering during the start of free agency.

* Maiocco is no longer certain that there is a starting opportunity for Garoppolo available. Carolina and Seattle are two likely options, but it's unlikely that either of those teams would be willing to send draft picks to San Francisco and pay Garoppolo $25.5 million for one year while they have QBs like Darnold and Lock on their roster.

* *""The 49ers’ best option is to sit tight, wait for Garoppolo to get healthy and see if anything changes around the league where he might become more attractive to another team.""*

* Garoppolo has already said his public goodbyes after the NFCCG. Sudfeld getting a fully-guaranteed $2 million contract also indicates that he's to be Lance's backup. This could change if Jimmy is willing to come back with a pay cut, but that seems doubtful. *""Under his current contract, it does not make much sense to retain Garoppolo.""*

* Important bit for everybody complaining about our quiet free agency: *""If the 49ers had that $25 million cushion right now, it would not change their approach to free agency. They spent for cornerback Charvarius Ward. He was their big-ticket item. The remaining spots on the roster will be filled by lower-priced free agents and draft picks. There is no big rush to create that additional cap room because most of that money will be going to players already on the team.""*

* ***""Neither Garoppolo nor John Lynch nor Kyle Shanahan nor Paraag Marathe is to blame for this situation. Garoppolo was injured. He required surgery. A trade could not happen without a trade partner, and Garoppolo's inability to participate in the offseason program likely prompted some teams to pass.""***

* Maiocco believes that Lance will be starting for the 49ers in 2022, that Garoppolo will be playing elsewhere, that it's not likely the 49ers get anything in return for Garoppolo, but also -- after what we've already witnessed -- that anything can happen at this point.",104.0,49ers,t3_tk5prw,False,0.0,:navorrobowman: NaVorro Bowman,2022-03-22T10:36:38Z,49ers,0.0042887455456417

Yet San Francisco regretted all its blown chances:

• Incompletions on third and fourth downs from the Seattle 1 in the opening quarter.

• A fumble on a punt-return reverse botched by Arnaz Battle and Brandon Jones.

• Another fumble by Gore, when the 49ers finally dusted off the mothballed runner. It was forced by Jordan Babineaux at the Seattle 22 and returned 43 yards by Josh Wilson to set up Mare's first field goal of the final quarter.

• Davis having Smith's would-be touchdown pass zip through his hands and off his facemask in the end zone while down 17-14 late in the game.

He said he was the greatest route runner of all time, not the greatest receiver. Said he never felt like he had the physical tools to be dominant and worked extra hard during the off-season to perfect his cuts and catches. 

But he said in today’s NFL, receivers don’t focus as much on route running. There are route trees now, and it’s about getting to your spot on the correct coverage read. Even when the DB throws off your timing or positioning.

Definitely one of the better early Super Bowls, but given how many of those were blowouts, that’s not saying much. If you’re going by quality relative to other a Super Bowls of the era then fine, it’s pretty elite (though I would contend the next Pittsburgh victory in Super Bowl XIV was better — I believe that game still holds the record for lead changes in an SB).

Like I don’t know, imagine the exact same game happened today, but in the regular season — would people be getting **that** excited about a game where a team was down by 3 possessions with less than half a quarter to go, and never even had a possession with a chance to tie the game or take the lead at the end? You’ve got some great moments like the Smith drop, Swann’s catch, and Staubach’s close-but-not-too-close comeback, and it was a very high scoring game, but Dallas literally needed a miracle at the end of that game and didn’t get it.

Obviously that’s a flawed analogy since the historical context with Pittsburgh and Dallas playing to decide the dynasty of the decade is important.

Players are examined as a whole - you don't just get to ignore the downsides of a player and in Deebo's case the negatives are: injuries, drops and attitude. The latter being apparent in his coming to camps unprepared and out of shape, and now how he is handling contract negotiations.

This is undoubtedly a concern for Samuel and the 49ers. The conventional No. 1 wideout, of course, holds on to the ball much more effectively than Samuel.

He had an incredible 2021 season, my only concerns are if he can continue to stay on the field and do that for at least another year, and for what it's worth, I think Deebo knows that too which is why he's so adamant about getting this done ASAP while his value is high.

Lance as a QB has already shown that he will push the ball further down the field, so chances are he will look to throw to Aiyuk a lot. Jimmy would not even target Aiyuk much and would take shorter distance throws to Kittle and Deebo. There is game film from the NFCCG that shows Aiyuk was open a lot deep down the field in the game, if only the QB actually attempted those passes. Aiyuk hasn't been prolific yet because he doesn't fit well with how Jimmy runs the passing game, but that can change with Trey.

I'd strongly disagree there. There were stretches last season where he was the entire Niners offense, and carried us thru games that we otherwise would have lost, that's kind of the definition of a game changer.

And the fact that he did it without an MVP QB, while also taking the ball from behind the LOS or with very short passes. He's doing more of the work himself with an inferior supporting cast, and still producing elite numbers.

Nobody is putting Purdy on their roster to be QB2, not with zero OTAs or training camp with the new team. So automatically you can cross off teams that are only going to carry 2 QBs on the active roster. That narrows the list WAY down.

So you've got to find a team that wants to carry 3 QBs but hates the QB3 they have now, and would rather have Purdy with zero preparation be that guy. Is there a team out there that will do that?

Some of it is just luck.

Some of it is the players the team has acquired. A lot of guys had plenty of injury history to their name before putting on a Niners uniform, and then we all Pikachu-faced when they got hurt as Niners.

Bosa missed almost his whole final year in college.

Kinlaw had to bail on the Senior Bowl early due to knee tendinitis, then - shock of shocks - had to deal with knee tendinitis as a 49er.

Jalen Hurd ended his college career with a knee injury.

Deebo missed almost his entire junior season with a broken fibula. 

That's just a few names from recent drafts. Obviously, taking guys like Bosa and Deebo were worth it, and hopefully Kinlaw is too, but we should be under no illusions that we haven't been rolling the dice on the high-talent/questionable-health prospects.

Much the same in veteran acquisitions. Jason Verrett, Dee Ford, Jordan Reed... nobody gets to claim ignorance about the injury risks those guys were before becoming Niners. Weston Richburg missed almost his entire final season for the Giants. And let's not forget Jimmy Garoppolo himself managed all of 2 starts in New England before hurting something.

We may not be drafting Baalke's All-ACL teams anymore, but the Shanahan/Lynch era has absolutely involved taking on a higher than average amount of injury risk when building the roster (and they have [admitted this and are prioritizing durability more in draft prep](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-francisco-49ers/post/_/id/38950/how-the-san-francisco-49ers-altered-their-draft-approach-on-injuries)*).

Press man is hard to beat quickly. The threat to the defense is when plays take a long time and defenders have to carry their man for a lot longer. 

A strong pass rush prevents those long plays. And that pass rush paired with press man gives opposing offenses few good options. It's a lot easier to throw hot routes against zone.

Personally, I think Tom Brady should be in the 5 to 10 range. He can play at an elite level if he has an elite offensive line and receiving corps around him. However, if you can cover up his receivers and consistently get pressure against him, he will struggle since he can't really extend plays outside of maneuvering the pocket to get an extra split second to get a throw off.

2. IOL
3. Strong safety
4. IDL

Obviously, we have Trey Lance, who has a vast range of outcomes ranging from backup-caliber to top-10 QB and is playing the most valuable position.  

We have a new starting left guard (Aaron Banks), who was considered by many to be a questionable second-round draft pick last year and was not good in the very limited playing time he got last year (although he played at right guard last year with his natural position being left guard). Our starting center right now is Jake Brendel, who has been a career backup with very little snaps under his belt. Our right guard position is up in the air with the two candidates being Daniel Brunskill and rookie Spencer Burford. Brunskill is an underweight replacement-level guard who will get overwhelmed by any IDL who is remotely powerful. Burford is a college tackle who has great pass protection technique but also struggles against powerful rushers, which is not ideal for an interior offensive lineman.  

Our only options at strong safety right now are replacement-level players. Talanoa Hufanga is likely going to be our starting strong safety and while he's a good tackler and run defender, he isn't good in coverage due to his terrible athleticism. Our other two options are George Odum, who is mostly known for being a good special teamer and is unproven as a safety, and Tarvarius Moore, who has insane straight-line speed but bad tackling and instincts. Moore is also coming off of an achilles tear that caused him to miss all of last season.  

We are actually quite thin at IDL with a lot of unproven players. We have Arik Armstead, who is one of the better IDLs in the league. However, Javon Kinlaw hasn't been good so far after being a first-round pick in the 2020 draft and is coming off an ACL surgery.

Allen had at least 5-6 games last season where he was just average or even terrible. His two worst games were against the Falcons and Jaguars. Right now, I would rather have Rodgers, Mahomes, and Burrow over Allen.

Jalen Hurts because he'll give you some good highlight reel moments but he won't really give you a good chance of winning against good competition. If his first read isn't open, he'll either run or improvise. Good teams will keep him contained and clean up his scrambling/rushing ability pretty quickly. Yes, his rushing stats are very good but that's because he always takes off and runs if his first read isn't open. I also think his physical ability/theoretical upside (assuming he can actually learn to read defenses and go through progressions at even an average level) is overrated.

Trevon Diggs because he gives up a lot of yardage due to his aggressiveness. Yes, he got a lot of INTs last season, but INTs are typically a very volatile statistic. I think this upcoming season, his INT count will regress to the mean and without being one of the league leaders in INTs, he's a low-end starting CB in my opinion.

If Parham isn't available at pick 61, then I think we should take a safety in this order: (1) Pitre, (2) Brisker, (3) Cine.  

I think center is a good option at pick 93 or 105. My pick here would be Cole Strange if he's available there. Alec Lindstrom would be my second choice at center if Strange is not available at this point in the draft.  

If we don't get Parham, then I think Ed Ingram at pick 134 would be nice. Ingram, unlike a lot of LSU offensive linemen, is actually a good athlete and he has good size too. He has a good anchor in pass protection and good run blocking. His pass protection technique and footwork needs some work though. I think his pass protection is serviceable and better than Daniel Brunskill on day 1 just because his anchor is better than Brunskill's.  

Luke Goedeke could be a nice pick with any of our day 3 picks. He played tackle in college. At tackle, he doesn't have any major weaknesses. He's pretty much a C/C+ in like every aspect I would say. He's got decent pass protection, especially compared to other day 3 prospects. His athleticism is good enough but not exceptional. You get the idea... However, this was all based on him playing at tackle. I think he could be a great guard. Playing at guard might hide his weaknesses more (for example, his arms are only 32 1/4 inches). At worst, he would probably be a really nice versatile 6th man who can play anywhere on the offensive line without getting demolished. His upside isn't that great, but I think he'll definitely be a solid player.  

Abraham Lucas could be interesting if he's available at pick 61. He played right tackle in college. He was a great pass protector.

Are you looking for elite talent like you said in your last comment or are you looking for someone to fit out scheme right now your bouncing back and forth between two seperate thungs. Moseley fits are scheme very well and ward has been showing out in camp. Yes mahomes and Stafford get completions being elite QBs throwing to the best WRS in the league. They do it on every one. That's why they are elite. That's like saying a player is garbage because Aaron Donald's gets a sack on him or Nick bosa sucks because he has games he doesn't get a sack in. And know it wasn't every single time they threw deep on 3rd down because otherwise we would have lost all the games to the rams and wouldn't have been beating them up until midway in the 4th and we definitely wouldn't have held mahomes to just 10 points until late in the 4th quarter. You get elite talent like ramsey and watched him get cooked a few times on the superbowl by chase.

They rely on veterans and draft for next year. If they get lucky and a rookie outperforms the vet its found money. Thier plan was mcglinchey and Williams on the outside which is solid. Then I'm guessing initially it was Tomlinson and banks for guard but we lost Tomlinson so they were happy with brunkskill and banks since brunkskill had shown to be capable of starting at guard already. Center I assume they had hoped for Mack but had been watching brendall all year and thought he could come in. Other then that it's not much else they could do.

For example in a standard league rushing and recieving yards are waited the same. The reason why the rushing yards your counting are coming out higher is because for some reason your counting his rushing tds but not counting his tds he got from yac. It's pretty simple to do that since all his recieving tds came off yac. So add 6 recieving tds to his yac score and it's 113 pts due to yac which is thr bulk of his pts. Yes the rushing tds helped him get to 3rd but the bulk of his pts came from his recieving yards and yac.  You remove his rushing yards and he probably drops down to 8 or 9 seeing as how he was number 5th in the league in receiving yards but in a standard ppr league which most fantasy sites go by he wouldn't have the pts from receptions some of the players below him have.

Jimmy came through in the critical situations many times last season leading us deep into the playoffs, while Wentz crumbled against Jacksonville to miss the playoffs. These things matter.

If he’s cut, the Niners save a ton of cap space but the most likely landing spot for him becomes Seattle. He probably gets a lot more money to start in Seattle than he would as our backup (there’s no way we would entertain paying him $26M as a backup, we would wanna renegotiate) rendering that possibility completely moot. 

Of course, there remains a possibility that a team may lose its starter during training camp/ preseason. If that happens (not that I ever root for injuries) Jimmy’s trade value suddenly skyrockets, since he’s easily the best QB that can be traded for. Remember the Sam Bradford trade? Maybe the Niners don’t get that in return but I could see a truly desperate team coughing up like a second rounder and paying Jimmy’s full salary, or close to it.",0.0,49ers,t3_wcq3xl,False,0.0,:jerseyhome05: Trey Lance,2022-07-31T10:14:28Z,49ers,0.06390040836498

36959,245024,245024,hiiamyourfather,"I know we're looking at a potential sticky situation with Deebo and his contract, but I wouldn't be overly concerned about him not attending this practice.

Earlier in the year Matt Maiocco interviewed Deebo on the 49ers Talk podcast and asked about training with Trey during the off-season. Deebo was pretty quick to say he wanted to get Trey down to Miami to work out with him. Matt asked if Trey was trying to get Deebo to come to LA to work out and Deebo shot that down point blank and said he doesn't train in California, Trey has to come to Miami where he'd be.

I think Deebo just has more of a comfort factor on the east coast. Maybe he has a facility or a group of trainers that he really likes that are Miami based and he doesn't want to deviate from his program.

I think Nick Bosa, who did all of his injury rehab separate from the 49ers which was organized by his family, may have a similar mindset of being really specific about their approach to the off-season and this isn't that strange for these elite players. 

Maybe it would be a pain in the butt for Trey to travel all that way and maybe you can argue that Deebo is being overly stubborn by not wanting to come out to California, but it would be awesome to see Trey go down to Miami to accept Deebo's invitation and start to bond more with him as well and carve out his spot as a leader on the team.",3.0,49ers,t3_u0squc,False,0.0,None,2022-04-10T21:52:07Z,49ers,0.1013245403289794

I started with watching a super bowl highlight, which I think was Packers-Steelers, and watched the SB next year live. The game starts at 00.30AM on Monday for us, mind you.

By the next season I started getting into it a bit more, trying to figure out how the playoffs worked. By that time I kinda liked the Niners with Kaepernick and chose to follow that team. A friend started following Patriots but he switched to the Dolphins at some point. We both got into it more and more and actually play FF with friends, watch a games every weekend and setup a SB watch party every year! 

Also visited a game once (Dolphins-Jets) because MIA is easier to get to and much nicer weather-wise in October.

What I love the most is the depth of tactics and the ""reset"" of the game of every play. Every play you can switch everything up to keep it dynamic and try to outsmart your opponent. Coming from football (soccer for you weirdos) it was a nice change of pace as that game gets a bit boring down the stretch sometimes..

This year he'll have a base salary of $3M fully guaranteed plus a $70M bonus.

Cohn has repeatedly shown attempts to shame or embarrass players and even coaches, being snide and calling himself Kyles “quality control” coach or personally calling out Kittle and directly telling him in his videos to pay like he’s played to. It’s one thing to have a negative opinion, but he’s crossed into personal territory.
