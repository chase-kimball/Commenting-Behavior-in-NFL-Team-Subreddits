According to the presser, GM Beane was aware that allegations existed but, like us, had no idea of the seriousness or the evidence until the civil suit was brought forth, despite investigation. I don't know if that's the truth or not, but since he outright said if the civil suit hadn't been made Matt would still be on the team, I think that's a pretty candid response for something that would look exceedingly bad if he was aware of the seriousness of the allegations. 

In the official story, Bills FO was made aware of allegations and was unable to find further information that verified the claims, especially because the accuser is a minor which brings legal problems involving information privilege. Whether this failure of the investigation was ineptitude or malice I don't think we'll ever have a clear answer on. The only counternarrative I've seen presented to this is reddit users claiming it was an open secret on the CFB forums. If there's evidence of that, especially evidence of the seriousness of what's presented in the civil suit and not just vague allegations, I would like to see that. It would be a smoking gun against the Bills organization. Otherwise the only assumption is that their investigation turned up nothing and they knew as little about it, aside from unsubstantiated rumors, than everyone who was blindsided just a few days ago did.

EDIT: apparently in Beane's presser he mentioned that the client's attorney contacted them in late July. What was said then should probably be the focus of criticism since that's the point at which the Bills should have known better. I don't know what lawyers are allowed to talk about or what details were disclosed to them, but it seems like scrutiny should fall on what was communicated to the Bills during that calling regarding both the seriousness and the validity of the allegations, and what the Bills were able to turn up in their investigation in response to that phonecall (where Beane claims they were unable to independently verify whatever claims were made by the attorney on the call).",3.0,nfl,t3_wzh1xj,False,1.0,:Bills: Bills,2022-08-27T19:33:25Z,buffalobills,0.0374737608132429

Say you sign a $50 million, 4 year contract, $10 million signing bonus, $10 million/year salary over 4 years.  Year one the cap hit is $12.5 million.  Year two would be the same, but say you restructure (restructure means turning salary into signing bonus).  New cap hit is $2.5 million (previous signing bonus) plus $10 million/3 (3 years is the rest of the contract), so $3.3 million, for a total of $5.8 million.  Year three would be the original $2.5 million, the $3.3 million from year two, plus the $10 million salary.  Restructure that and you get $2.5+$3.3+$5 for a total of $10.8 million (the $5 million comes from $10 million salary over 2 years).  Year four is when shit hits the fan.  You can't restructure to push the cap hit down the line anymore, so you have $2.5 million from year one, $3.3 million from year 2, $5 million from year three, and the original $10 million salary for a total of $20.8 million in year four.  You could cut that player and not have to pay the salary, but you still have to pay the $10.8 million in what's now called ""dead cap"", aka cap space devoted to a player not on your roster.  Teams can basically always restructure a player's salary without approval from the player (not that it hurts them, it just means that the player in this example gets a $10 million check up front instead of spread out weekly throughout the season).

Our offense seems to be shifting to YAC, and Zone schemed running. (An evolution/change that builds on our identity and scheme, providing a new strategy to help continue to make defenses struggle)

Our defense seems to be shifting toward a more aggressive 4-3. When we had Klein, he was more of a depth piece, but his explosiveness for rushing wasn‚Äôt always great (older) and his coverage skills left a lot to be desired leading his utilization to be lowered.

Adding Bernard who is a great blitzer, has good cover skills, is going to be harder for Frazier to not scheme him in our game. He‚Äôll help our secondary and Edmunds/Milano by being able to drop back into zone for let‚Äôs say Tuas 5 yard slants, or play man to man on a Titan.

In 2022 the Bills are the favorite at +600 which is about +150 better than the second place Bucs.
 
 
The odds are based on the presumption that the Bills defense struggling in the playoffs was an anomaly while Allen showing out was not. You factor in the idea that the Bills are essentially adding 2 All-Pros (White & Miller) to that defense and it follows that it SHOULD be better. Meanwhile Allen has put enough consistent film out there for the consensus to agree that he is in the conversation for Top-QB as a proven player who can go toe-to-toe with Patrick Mahomes.
 
 
You add all that up and you have a Bills team who by all accounts should be better this season than last, where last season is one the futures market believed the Bills were a coin toss from a Super Bowl title and you have Buffalo at +600 this season.

27127,190090,190090,UberHansen,"**Possible Options at Pick #25**

* Roger McCreary, CB, Auburn

A player widely regarded as a reliable Man corner in this year‚Äôs draft, Auburn‚Äôs Roger McCreary stated to multiple media types that he looks up to current Bills superstar corner Tre‚ÄôDavious White. Definitely a good player to model your game after. McCreary‚Äôs main concerns are in his physical makeup, not being very long, especially in his arms. However, CBS Sports‚Äô Chris Trapasso made an interesting analogy in comparing him to White. Saying that McCreary is ‚ÄúNot big, probably won't test like a freaky athlete. Just an instinctive, chippy CB with loads of SEC experience and production.‚Äù With McCreary, The Bills would likely be looking at White and McCreary as CBs 1 and 2, with Taron Johnson maintaining his role as Nickel, if the Bills were to draft McCreary, I would like the outlook of the Bills‚Äô Secondary.

* Jordan Davis, DL, Georgia

Talk about a freak of nature. Georgia‚Äôs Jordan Davis crushed the NFL Combine, notably running a 4.78 40 yard dash at 6‚Äô6‚Äù, 341 pounds, Davis has everyone talking. With Davis‚Äô main benefit for Buffalo being the fact that many draft profiles of him describe him as a player needing multiple blockers, Davis would likely open up room for guys like Ed Oliver, AJ Epenesa and Greg Rousseau to feast. However, Davis‚Äô main draw is that he has little bend in his knees, preventing him from having much impact as a rusher. With the Combine performance Davis has had, there is little possibility he slides down boards to the Bills; however, if he makes it there, it is a definite selection in the eyes of many.

* Chris Olave, WR, Ohio State

With Ohio State‚Äôs Chris Olave meeting with the Bills during the combine, he is someone many consider to be a top Wide Receiver prospect in the 2022 NFL Draft. Olave is a phenomenal route runner with elite speed. He creates tons of separation, has great ability to track the ball vertically down the field and has okay hands. However, he has a smaller frame at 6‚Äô1‚Äù, 190 pounds, which can be likened to Philadelphia Eagles Wide Receiver DeVonta Smith. He also has a difficult time catching balls further out from his body. However, when you see a player with the big-play ability of Olave, and you have a human missile launcher in Josh Allen, you should look at rolling the dice.

* Treylon Burks, WR, Arkansas

Arkansas‚Äô Treylon Burks is like the anti-Olave, as in they are polar opposites. Where Olave is small, Burks is more bulky at 6‚Äô2‚Äù, and 225 pounds. Where Olave is rough in the hands department, Burks is unreal, making it so that if you throw it to him, he will almost certainly catch it. Another benefit for the Bills with Burks is that he played slot wide throughout college, meaning he would slide right into the Beasley-Shaped hole in our offense. However, Burks‚Äô big concern is something that Olave ironically excels at; Separation. Burks is rarely more than 2 steps from his defensive back, which can be an issue. If he does catch the ball, Burks is running like Satan himself with all defenders 2 steps behind. Utilizing a dirty stiff arm, he is very tough to bring down. Good news is that Burks will likely be there at 25, so Buffalo will have a shot at selecting Burks if they want him.

* Andrew Booth Jr., CB, Clemson

Clemson‚Äôs Andrew Booth Jr. is an impressive prospect. Booth is extremely versatile, having well-rounded skills as a run defender, and a Man corner. He has great football IQ, is a good tackler, and has the athleticism, speed, and ball skills required to match the better WRs of the AFC. However, he has 3 main flaws. Firstly, he lacks ability as a zone corner. Secondly, while he is a good tackler, he can sometimes lack control of his tackles. Lastly, he injured his quad at his pro day, meaning there is a possible injury concern. Booth is an excellent prospect, and the team that drafts him will be getting a corner who can step in and be a contributor.",14.0,nfl,t3_tv1rb8,False,0.0,:Bills: Bills,2022-04-03T01:38:06Z,buffalobills,0.0202947048926695
27128,190091,190091,UberHansen,"**Key Roster Additions**

* Von Miller, DE, Last Played for Rams

The motherload. Von Miller is a Buffalo Bill. Besides being a Super Bowl MVP for giving Cam Newton PTSD, Von is also an 8-time Pro Bowler, 3-time First-Team All-Pro, and 4-time Second-Team All-Pro. Miller has 115.5 sacks in his career, and Buffalo gave him a 6 year, 120-million-dollar contract with approximately 50 million guaranteed. The hope is that he can add large amounts to that sack number, as the Bills pass rush last year was inconsistent at best. It was put on full display against the Chiefs in the divisional round, as only Ed Oliver was able to get any pressure on Mahomes as he would tear the Bills to shreds. The Bills hope Von will remedy that issue. Von also looks to be a great mentor for their young pass rushers in 2019 1st round pick Ed Oliver, 2020 2nd round pick AJ Epenesa, 2021 1st round pick Greg Rousseau, and 2021 2nd round pick Carlos Basham.

* OJ Howard, TE, Last Played for Buccaneers

The Bills offense is one of the most explosive groups in the NFL. Spearheaded by Allen, Diggs, and now Gabriel Davis and Dawson Knox, one thing the Bills have lacked since Josh Allen became a Bill is the ability to run 12 personnel sets. Teams such as the Bears and Patriots have shown the usefulness of 2 TE sets in recent years, and the Bills wanted to go out and gain the ability to run 12 personnel sets. So, they signed the eternally underused OJ Howard from Tampa. Howard underproduced for the draft capital used on him. However, he was never really a target, as Tampa‚Äôs ball has always been split between Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Cameron Brate, and for 2 of his years in Tampa, Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown who also took up touches. Let‚Äôs hope this OJ Kills it on the field instead of off the field like another OJ Bills fans know all too well‚Ä¶

* Rodger Saffold III, OG, Last Played for Titans

One thing Bills fans can tell you about our 2021 campaign is that the guard play, for the most part, was atrocious. Moving Daryl Williams inside was a bad idea, Jon Feliciano, for being half decent, was often injured, and Ike Boettger, Cody Ford, and Ryan Bates ranged from serviceable to god-awful. So, the Bills immediately took aim at the position with their first free-agent signing of the year, poaching Rodger Saffold from Tennessee. Saffold was a solid guard who got cut due to his cap hit being a bit high for what he was producing. Now he comes to Buffalo with the hope of solidifying the line in front of Josh Allen.

* Tim Settle, DT, Last Played for Football Team

Tim Settle is definitely in the OJ Howard boat. He was a pretty decent player in Washington, and their fans absolutely love him. However, he was never going to break a Defensive line of Chase Young, Daron Payne, Johnathan Allen and Montez Sweat. So, Settle turned his eyes to Western NY. Washington fans immediately flooded r/BuffaloBills with love for Settle, and the hope within Bills Mafia is that Settle will immediately step in and help stop runners in their tracks, which the Bills tended to struggle with at times in 2021.

* Jamison Crowder, WR, Last Played for the Jets

With the Jets re-signing Braxton Berrios, they were certain to cut a guy out of their rotation. With Corey Davis recently being given a big contract, and Elijah Moore being an excellent player last year, that left Denzel Mims and Jamison Crowder. I think a combination of Mims‚Äô high draft selection (as a Round 2 pick two years ago) and Crowder being a Free Agent regardless led to him getting cut by the Jets. Crowder looks to fill the role Emmanuel Sanders filled last year; Vet Wide who can play the slot. Crowder should compliment Diggs and Davis rather well.

* Case Keenum, QB, Last Played for the Browns

Headed over from Cleveland after they traded for That Guy, the Bills traded a late-round pick for Case Keenum, a QB who many Bills fans should recognize as the QB who threw the Minneapolis Miracle ball to Stefon Diggs. Keenum has floated around the league since then, and has now found his way back to playing with Diggs. May we get another Minneapolis Miracle? Unlikely, since Allen is starting. However, from his time in Minnesota, Keenum proved he can step in in a pinch.

* Duke Johnson, RB, Last Played for the Dolphins

Duke Johnson has had an interesting year, that‚Äôs one way to put it. After Signing with the Jags in the offseason, Johnson was cut before the season started. Johnson proceeded to travel across the state, dodging Gators and Florida Men as he went, and signed with the Dolphins as a practice squad member. However, he ended up seeing playing time toward the end of the season, even hitting a career-high 107 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns against the New York Jets. Now, he has found himself signing in Buffalo. He looks to fill the role that the likes of Matt Breida, TJ Yeldon and Chris Ivory have filled in recent years; Vet RB only there for support or as a backup in case Zack Moss or Devin Singletary get injured.

* Jordan Phillips & Shaq Lawson, DL, Last Played for Cardinals & Jets (Respectively)

Jordan Phillips and Shaq Lawson have both returned. I‚Äôm lumping them in together for two reasons. Firstly, they both left and came back in the same year, and even came back on the same day. Secondly, I do not believe one would have come back without the other. Jordan Phillips was an excellent player for the Bills, notching 9 sacks in 2019. He then signed in Arizona that offseason. However, after a mutual parting of ways between Phillips and the Cardinals, he signed in Buffalo. Phillips looks to be a similar player to the one Bills fans remember, and will likely be used as a 3-tech pass rusher. Lawson is a bit more complicated. He also had a career year in 2019, with 6.5 sacks. He then got an offshore bank account from the Miami Dolphins in the offseason. However, after only 1 year, and 13 million of the 60 million dollar deal he signed for, he was traded to the Houston Texans, who turned around and traded him to the Jets. The Jets would cut him toward the end of the season. After flirting with signing in Buffalo during the playoffs, he‚Äôs now back. We can likely expect the same old Shaq though; probably 4 sacks or so.

* Matt Barkley, QB, Last Played for Falcons

r/BuffaloBills, rejoice. Matt Barkley is back. A fan favorite on the Bills subreddit he ended up not being re-signed in 2021 as the Bills signed the legendary NVP Mitch Trubisky in that offseason. So, Barkley took his talent to Tennessee‚Ä¶ Then Carolina‚Ä¶ Then Atlanta. After bouncing around a bit, he returns to the Bills, likely as a third option in case of a complete nuclear meltdown.",48.0,nfl,t3_tv1rb8,False,0.0,:Bills: Bills,2022-04-03T01:33:44Z,buffalobills,0.0001200869452866

**Offense**

* Daryl Williams, OG, Currently Unsigned

You have to feel some kind of sympathy for Daryl Williams. He started in Carolina, and was an excellent Right Tackle. So, when Taylor Moton came around, they tried him at Right Guard, and he couldn‚Äôt hold up. Then, he moves on to Buffalo, where he starts at Right Tackle, and he has a career resurgence year. So what do the Bills do? Draft 2 tackles to replace him. Spencer Brown ends up stealing the job at RT after Williams is extended, so he kicks over to Right Guard, and is once again not living up to his pay grade, so he gets cut. Whoever signs him, Please for the love of all that is holy start him at Right Tackle. Don‚Äôt kick him over to guard, keep him at Right Tackle. He is an excellent Right Tackle, and he should be able to rebound somewhere.

* Jon Feliciano, OG, Signed with Giants

This one certainly stinks. Feliciano was a guy many in Bills Mafia enjoyed having on the team. He seemed to gel well with the team, and before 2021 he was a very good player. However, injuries caught up to Feliciano in 2021, and he unfortunately had a poor year, leading to his release. Now he heads to New Jersey to join the Giants, where he‚Äôll hopefully help in protecting the next Michael Vick in Daniel Jones.

* Mitchell Trubisky, QB, Signed with Steelers

The ‚ÄúKisser of‚Äù...well, you know, is on the move again. Mitch Trubisky is headed to Pittsburgh. As a 1 year rental, Mitch did what he was asked to do for the Bills; Close out games with large leads and step in in case Josh Allen got hurt. Thankfully, since the latter did not happen, all Trubisky was tasked to do was close out games where the Bills had giant leads, and that he did. When called upon, he stepped up. Now in Pittsburgh he has a real shot at a starting gig, and will finally get his opportunity to show that the issues in Chicago are not solely on him.

* Matt Breida, RB, Signed with Giants

Matt Breida was certainly useful for the Bills. When he was needed he stepped up. He provided some good ol‚Äô fashioned veteranocity for the Bills RB room, which was lacking after the departures of  TJ Yeldon, Chris Ivory and Frank Gore. Now he moves on to the Giants. Not a major loss for Buffalo, considering they replaced him with Duke Johnson, but still stinks nonetheless, as Breida had this ability to provide a spark for Buffalo‚Äôs offense at points.

* Cole Beasley, WR, Currently Unsigned

Cole Beasley may have been a bit of a headache last year, but what he did in his 2 years prior to 2021 should not be understated. Along with John Brown, Beasley helped grow a budding receiver core for Buffalo, and even though he may be gone, his time with the Bills is underestimated by many. Members of Bills Mafia fondly remember Beasley for his big plays in 2020 to help take the Bills the farthest they have gone since the 90‚Äôs. Beasley will hopefully find a role on another team as a slot wide; after all, with teams like Green Bay, Pittsburgh and Atlanta out there with few to no Wides above Beasley‚Äôs level, it‚Äôs hard to say he won‚Äôt bounce back somewhere. Wherever it is, good luck Bease!

* Emmanuel Sanders, WR, Currently Unsigned

Emmanuel Sanders' time in Buffalo occurred during what was almost certainly a tough time in his life, post the loss of Demaryius Thomas. However, despite that, he showed up week in and week out. He did what was asked of him, and he gave the offense a deep threat wideout who struck absolute gold at times. Sanders will likely move on and fill a similar role to the one he played here; Vet wide used as a deep threat.

**Defense**

* Levi Wallace, CB, Signed with Steelers

Levi‚Äôs time with the Bills was a positive one. Early in his career he had his struggles, most memorable being a game against Cleveland in his sophomore season when he got burnt all game long. However, Levi Blossomed into a Confident corner who picked on opposing wides, not the other way around. Pittsburgh gets a player who will immediately make an impact as a CB2 if they can get a true CB1, or even bring back Joe Haden.

* Efe Obada, DE, Signed with Commanders

Obada was a serviceable Defensive End for Buffalo, being a backup who contributed when asked to during his time there. Now he heads to Washington to almost certainly serve the same role. A note to Washington; If needed, he is capable of producing, maybe not at an elite level but most definitely as an NFL caliber rotational player.

* Jerry Hughes & Mario Addison, DE, Currently Unsigned

These two are getting lumped together because it‚Äôs not out of the question that one or both won‚Äôt be re-signed towards training camp. Hughes especially, as he was still a very productive player for the Bills in 2021. Addison was also a productive player for the Bills last year, although less so than Hughes. If these two get re-signed for small deals, the Bills could look to get even better on defense. However, if they do leave, both should find jobs somewhere else, as they are both still solid veteran players.

* Harrison Phillips, DT, Signed with Vikings

This one Stings. Mini Meatball was anointed the next Kyle Williams early on, pretty much from the day the legendary Pancho Billa called his name during the 2018 NFL Draft. Harry was always a solid starter, and had a very good back half of 2021. Unfortunately, that back half of 2021 priced him out of our future. Shame too, as he was an excellent figure in the Buffalo Community, named the Bills Walter Payton Man of The Year nominee in 2021. Take good care of him, Minnesota.

* Star Lotulelei, DT, Currently Unsigned

This was a move that needed to happen. Star was an alright player for the Bills. However, he never really lived up to his potential in Buffalo. He missed the 2020 campaign as an opt-out, completely understandable. However, he never seemed to truly recover to his 2019 form, which was a major letdown for a Bills team desperate for a legitimate 1T DT. As a rotational player, Star looks to join another team soon, and should help whichever team he joins with stopping the run.

* Vernon Butler, DT, Signed with Raiders

Another bad contract the Bills needed to get out from under, Vernon Butler was another Carolina Connection signing by Brandon Beane that never panned out. Half the time he was a scratched player in 2021. He got lost in the Bills rotation after a while, and for the money he was given, it‚Äôs a parting that benefits the Bills from a cap standpoint.

* A.J. Klein, LB, Currently Unsigned

Klein being cut definitely hurts the Bills. However, at a roughly 6 million dollar cap hit, Buffalo couldn‚Äôt afford to keep him, especially not with the youth available at a lower salary. Sadly, this is just another instance where cap played a gigantic factor in a player‚Äôs release. Klein was good, just worth his price.",9.0,nfl,t3_tv1rb8,False,0.0,:Bills: Bills,2022-04-03T01:27:56Z,buffalobills,0.0087208958855029

In recent years Bills Mafia has become famous for the work it does not just with local charities but ones outside of Buffalo as well. Giving has become a part of being a member of Bills Mafia and the 2021 season was no exception.

**Food Bank of NWLA**

During the Thanksgiving game against the New Orleans Saints, Bills star cornerback Tre‚ÄôDavious White suffered a season-ending ACL injury in the middle of the 2nd quarter. Although the Bills came away with the win, the injury was a devastating  one for a team amid an already up-and-down season.

Bills Mafia, however, immediately turned the dismay over White‚Äôs injury into another round of charitable donations directed toward the [Food Bank of Northwest Louisiana](https://www.foodbanknla.org/), based in White‚Äôs hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. A group of loyal Bills Fans named ‚ÄúBills Mafia Babes‚Äù [started the donation campaign on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BillsMafiaBabes/status/1465802618001784833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and encouraged fans to donate in increments of $27.

By the following week, donations totaled more than **$120,000**.

**Visually Impaired Advancement**

Injuries were not the only inspiration for charitable donations in the 2021 season. Several weeks after the win over the Saints on Thanksgiving, the Bills suffered a [stinging overtime defeat](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/sports/buffalo-bills/live-gameday-blog-bills-in-early-hole-against-bucs/) against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs were not the only opponent on the field that night, however, as the Zebras showed up in full force to miss, in this author‚Äôs completely unbiased opinion, [several potentially game-changing calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wLqjvul_c).

Fans had been desperately hoping for a win against Tampa Bay, given that the Bills had just come off an embarrassing 14-10 loss to the division rival Patriots in which Mac Jones attempted only three forward passes. Nevertheless, losing to the Bucs sealed the deal on the only multiple-game losing streak the Bills would have in the 2021 season.

Utterly frustrated, Bills Mafia turned to what it knows best (besides smashing tables) ‚Äì donating! A Bills fan from Massachusetts named [Hunter Schinabeck](https://twitter.com/viawny/status/1470765156149993475) gave $17 to [Visually Impaired Advancement (VIA)](https://viawny.org/), an organization based in western New York that works to help blind and visually impaired individuals achieve independence.

Hunter‚Äôs donation kicked off a [surge](https://twitter.com/viawny/status/1472703290785812481) that ended with over **$65,000** in donations.

**Oishei Chiefs Donations**

I‚Äôve never seen a football game quite so electric as the Chiefs vs. Bills AFC Divisional Round Playoff this past January. Plenty has been said, and will be said, about this particular game, so I won‚Äôt bother harping on it too long here. Suffice it to say that even though the tragedy of ‚Äú13 seconds‚Äù is now cemented in the foundations of the developing Bills-Chiefs rivalry, it was not the end of the story. Nay, in bitter defeat, there is yet a silver lining.

According to [available sources](https://www.wivb.com/sports/buffalo-bills/chiefs-fans-sending-13-donations-to-oishei-after-bills-loss/), a Chiefs fan named Brett Fitzgerald drew inspiration from past Bills Mafia donation drives and, following his team‚Äôs victory in the Divisional round, posted the idea of donating in $13 increments to Oishei Children‚Äôs Hospital. You may remember Oishei from last season, when Bills fans donated north of a million dollars after Josh Allen's grandmother passed away.  In retrospect, Fitzgerald claims that he wishes he had changed the amount to $17 so as not to seem snide, but hey, Brett, no hard feelings. Fitzgerald‚Äôs idea soon ballooned across social media, and by the Friday after the game, Chiefs Kingdom and the rest of the donors had given more than **$400,000**.

Football is important to all of us, of course, and the highs and lows of the gridiron drag us mercilessly along with them. But just as Patrick Mahomes, a rival now if there ever was one, [immediately sought out Josh Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5nZ3-5Vmo) to exchange gestures of respect following the Chiefs playoff victory, it was amazing to see the Chiefs fan base make such an incredible gesture of generosity.

Bills Mafia hopes, and expects, that these waves of giving will continue throughout the 2022 season and beyond.

**Other Charitable Work**

While some big events were pointed out above it‚Äôs worth pointing out that there are multiple groups/people within Bills Mafia that are consistently raising money for charity. Alluded to earlier was the [Bills Mafia Babes](https://twitter.com/BillsMafiaBabes) who each month focus on a unique player‚Äôs charity. A brief list, not fully inclusive, of what they coordinated this past season includes:

* **$2,232** to Micah Hyde‚Äôs ‚ÄúImagine for Youth‚Äù
* **$4,700** to Jordan Poyer‚Äôs ‚ÄúKids Escaping Drugs‚Äù
* **$2,598** to Bills Muttfia (WNY SPCA)

Another incredibly important organization in Buffalo is [26 Shirts](https://twitter.com/26shirts). They design Buffalo themed shirts in an effort to raise money for local families and/or charities. Since their inception 26 Shirts has raised **$1,378,283** (At the time of this post) and continues to be a fixture in charitable giving in Buffalo.

27131,190094,190094,UberHansen,"**Front Office/Coaching Staff Review**

**Front Office**

The Bills geared themselves up for a B.I.G. 2021-22 season. Super Bowl or bust. Unfortunately‚Ä¶that went a bit bust. But, all things considered, a solid year and plenty of building blocks in place to keep this team competitive for the next several years. Brandon Beane and the rest of the Front Office have made move after move to keep this team moving forward. This year‚Äôs iteration of the free agency period was mostly marked by Beane‚Äôs ability to retain. Matt Milano was arguably the biggest ‚Äúsplash‚Äù in the FA period, earning a (essentially) 2 years/$20 million contract with incentives for play time, with two voidable years on the back end. Free agents brought in included Emmanuel Sanders, Mitch Trubisky, Efe Obada, and Matt Breida, all with an intention of plugging holes in depth and rotation. Beane‚Äôs major work came in restructure and contract negotiations this year, mostly in addressing the Josh Allen extension. I wrote about this in last year‚Äôs 32/32, and Beane came in right around those numbers. An average cap hit of $43.5 million dollars throughout the duration of the contract, with bonuses stretched out to add guaranteed money, and (absolute WORST-case scenario) a potential out/restructure in 2026. This is the way. This contract will look like a bargain in a few years when the NFL‚Äôs cap rises with new TV agreements. **Overall Grade: B-**

**Offensive Coaching**

Good coordinators are hard to come by. Great ones‚Ä¶get promoted. In the Bills camp, this couldn‚Äôt be any more true when looking at Brian Daboll and Leslie Frazier. Both had opportunities to move on to head coaching positions due to their success with Buffalo (and in Daboll‚Äôs case, his work with Josh Allen). This year may not have been the highlight of Daboll‚Äôs coaching resume, but he and Frazier had solid games that reminded the league to invite each to interview for a seat when the offseason coaching carousel is boarding. Daboll spent the last four years helping Allen improve into a consistent MVP candidate, and built the offense to his strengths. The offensive line issues/injuries did not help matters, and only resulted in a series of tough games where the Bills were overmatched in that area. A lack of creative play calling also was evident, and the ridiculously low use of speed-based offensive weapons like Isaiah McKenzie and Gabriel Davis only served to hinder production. It took until the last few weeks of the season to develop a stout running game, with Devin Singletary showing some of the promise that Bills fans have been waiting for along with the recovery of the offensive line. Daboll gets credit for the success of the last few years, but the fans will be interested to see what newly promoted Ken Dorsey brings to the table as his successor. **Overall Grade: C+**

Defensive Coaching

Frazier had a much better year at the defensive helm, as the 2020 version of the Bills lacked quality play, and often needed the offensive side of the ball to bail them out. If that was the case, welcome to Bills 2021: Electric Boogaloo. The Bills ranked first in: Total Defense, PPG, Passing Yards, Total Yards/Play, 3rd Down Conversion %, 1st Downs Allowed, and Passing Yards/Play. This unit was insane, and the fact that not a single Pro Bowler came out of this group shows what a sham the voting system is. Losing Tre White to injury was a massive barrier to overcome, but almost wasn't. That‚Äôs how good these guys are. The average margin of victory was 22.1 points. 3 touchdowns. Savor every minute, Bills fans. Because once teams stop hiring offensively minded coaches to compete with Allen and Mahomes, they‚Äôre going to need scheme defenses to stop them. And Frazier is going to be at the top of the list for candidates. The only thing keeping this grade from being perfect is a certain situational issue that I‚Äôll dive into below. **Overall Grade: A**

**Special Teams Coaching**

For all the Bills have going for them, it's going to be tough to get into those Super Bowl conversations if they can‚Äôt win during crunch time, and crunch time usually relies on your QB1 and Special Teams.

**DISCLAIMER: SKIP THIS IF YOU ARE STILL SCARRED FROM THE AFCDG.**

Okay, we‚Äôre gonna talk about it. 13 seconds. I‚Äôm pretty sure this has been seared into the memories of all Bills fans for the past few months. For context: I currently live in Fargo, ND (but I‚Äôve lived in Buffalo my entire life prior). I spent that night watching the game at a friend‚Äôs house, standing outside in -12 degrees (with a -35 degree wind chill) and screaming at the TV through the door in my Stefon Diggs jersey. Related note‚Ä¶I may or may not have to replace her door after jumping on it several times in both elation and overwhelming sadness.

I‚Äôve been a Bills fan, and a football fan, since I can remember. I‚Äôve watched countless games. I‚Äôve invested myself in getting up at 7am to watch a meaningless game between the Jaguars and whoever the NFL has suckered into playing in London. Hell, I‚Äôve watched Andy Reid stare at the play clock and just watch it run out with two timeouts on the board in a two-minute drill more times than I care to.

But the final 13 seconds of the AFCDG was the most mismanaged series of events I have ever seen play out live. That ball NEEDS to be live, and kicked into the ground. Sean McDermott is, at the end of the day, the head coach and responsible for that call. And he‚Äôs also going to be held responsible for how the defense got marched on twice during the end of regulation and the drive during overtime. But this was a failure all the way around, by both the defensive play callers and the special teams. The Bills were 0-6 in one-score games during the season. Achilles Heel? Maybe. But this is something that the Bills decision makers desperately need to fix prior to next season.

**DISCLAIMER: IF YOU SKIPPED PICK UP HERE**

Heath Farwell should not get all the blame for the consistency of this group, but he didn‚Äôt do enough to warrant another year to find out either. Did Matt Haack punt at all this year? Normally this would be a good thing, but for the sake of strategic field positioning, McDermott did everything in his power to not count on Haack. Bills fans would dread seeing McKenzie come onto the field to return a punt, and Marquez Stevenson hasn‚Äôt done enough to prove himself a reliable return man either. This unit‚Äôs only star is Tyler Bass, who is kicking at an all-pro level, and it will be only a matter of time before he is recognized for it. **Overall Grade: D**

**Head Coaching**

Sean McDermott and company had an interesting start to the season, and many thought the loss to the Steelers in Week 1 was a harbinger of things to come. The team stormed back to win 4 in a row (blowing out 3 of their 4 opponents including Kansas City during this time), before Tennessee brought them back down to reality and put into focus the Bills‚Äô main issue for the 2021 campaign, consistency. An inexplicable loss to Jacksonville, followed by a blowout win vs. the Jets, then followed by a blowout loss to the Colts solidified that this was a great team, when it felt like being one. McDermott continually fed the mantra of ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lot the team and I can work on‚Äù after each game, and he was correct. But this felt like a team that never really could hit its stride during the regular season. **Regular Season Grade: C+**

Having said that, the Bills were a team to be feared during the playoff run. An absolute dismantling of the Patriots in the Wild Card round. Quite possibly one of the greatest games in NFL history against your Chief rival (heh‚Ä¶sorry I couldn‚Äôt help the dad joke) that came down to a coin flip and change in the book that might be known as the Allen Rule going forward? McDermott deserves a hell of a lot of credit for getting this team prepared for these games. He needs to work on some situational awareness, but I hope that this past year was just one mistake and not a beacon of things to come. The Super Bowl was out of reach this year. But in 2022? They‚Äôre the frontrunners for a reason. **Playoff Grade: A-**",13.0,nfl,t3_tv1rb8,False,0.0,:Bills: Bills,2022-04-03T01:14:18Z,buffalobills,1.8429731308302063e-08

* Brian Winters, OG, Signed with Cardinals

Brian Winters played 57% of Offensive Snaps at Guard for the Buffalo Bills in 2020. In the offseason he signed a contract with the Arizona Cardinals only to be cut two games into the season.

* Matt Barkley, QB, Signed with Multiple Teams

Matt Barkley played an integral role in Josh Allen‚Äôs development during his time with the Bills. Still, Buffalo seized an opportunity to improve their backup QB via the signing of Mitch Trubisky which made Matt Barkley expendable. Barkley bounced around the league in 2021 spending time with the Titans, Panthers, and Falcons but will be returning to Buffalo in 2022.

* Lee Smith, TE, Traded to Falcons

A fan favorite during each of his stints in Buffalo Lee Smith acted more as a 6th lineman than a TE. With Buffalo looking to get more athletic at TE Brandon Beane found a trade partner in Atlanta, shipping Smith down south for a 7th round pick. Smith appeared in 16 out of the Falcons 17 games and announced his retirement following the season.

* Tyler Kroft, TE, Signed with Jets

Tyler Kroft struggled to stay healthy in his time in Buffalo but the potential for success was always there. In the offseason both the Bills and Kroft mutually agreed to part ways as Kroft signed with the New York Jets. Injury struggles continued in New Jersey where Kroft only saw action in 9 games this past season.

* John Brown, WR, Signed with Multiple Teams

‚ÄúSmoke‚Äù was cut as a cap casualty for Buffalo after an injury riddled down year. Universally loved by Bills Mafia it seems as though Brown‚Äôs career is coming to an end. Brown would be cut by the Raiders prior to opening day and saw just 19 total snaps, 12 with Denver & 7 with Jacksonville, in what may very well have been Brown‚Äôs last season in the NFL.

**Defense**

* Josh Norman, CB, Signed with 49ers

Josh Norman was a competent CB for the Bills but wasn‚Äôt in the team's plans for 2021. With the Bills electing to get younger at CB Norman would go on to find a new home in San Francisco. He would start an impressive 14 games in his age 33 season.

* Trent Murphy, DE, Unsigned

A healthy scratch for a large portion of the season it was a foregone conclusion that Trent Murphy would be a cap casualty heading into 2021. Since being cut Murphy has not found any suitors and at this point in time is pseudo-retired from the NFL.

* Quinton Jefferson, DT, Signed with Raiders

By all accounts the Bills made a mistake in cutting the 28-year old Quinton Jefferson in favor of the 26-year old Vernon Butler at the conclusion of the 2020 season. Jefferson would head to the Raiders and start all 17 games for them at DT for what was one of the more surprisingly impressive Defensive Lines.

* Dean Marlowe, S, Signed with Lions

A Special Teams Ace and important depth piece for the Bills secondary for three seasons Marlowe was stuck behind Jordan Poyer and Micah Hyde in Buffalo. Desiring more playing time Marlowe went to Detroit where he appeared in 16 games racking up 67 tackles for the Lions.

**Special Teams**

* Corey Bojorquez, P, Signed with Packers

In 2020 Corey Bojorquez led the league in Yards per Punt and finished 4th in NFL history with a 50.8 Y/P. Buffalo elected to move on due to stalled contract negotiations and a desire for a more ‚Äúaccurate‚Äù punter. Bojo would head to Green Bay where his punting continued to impress but issues with holding saw Packers Kicker, Mason Crosby, see his 2nd worst FG % (73.5%) of his 15-year career.

* Andre Roberts, PR/KR, Signed with Multiple Teams

Andre Roberts went to back-to-back Pro Bowls, and his departure left a gaping hole in the Bills return game. In 2021 Roberts would spend time with both the Texans and Chargers where it would become clear Roberts‚Äô return skills had not diminished.

It started just as scripted, with Buffalo jumping out to a 10-0 lead and looking to dominate the Jets. From that point onwards the offenses stalled until Zach Wilson hit Keelan Cole on a shallow crosser that Cole took to the house to make it 10-7. The Bills would score an FG at the end of the 1st half and a game that felt like it should be 28-0 was surprisingly 13-7. The Bills relentless assault of Zach Wilson continued in the 2nd half but the Jets were able to gain some extraordinary field position mainly due to an utter collapse of Bills Punter Matt Haack. The Jets somehow hung in and to begin the 4th even had the ball down just 3 points.Their offensive struggles would continue though as they were forced to Punt and the Bills responded with a TD. Buffalo would add a late TD but 13 points was more than enough for the W. The Bills defense held the Jets to just 8 Net Passing Yards and looked poised to make a Super Bowl Bills Mafia had been dreaming of all season. **WIN 27-10**

**Wild Card Round (11-6), vs. New England Patriots (10-7):** For Bills fans there was a singular round one playoff matchup that was capable of inducing severe anxiety while simultaneously rallying the fan base into a fever pitch. That‚Äôs the matchup they got. In sub-zero temperatures, in front of a restless home crowd, the Bills would be tasked with slaying a monster that had haunted them for nearly two decades. Many believed that Bill Belichick and his 4th ranked defense would design a recipe to slow down Josh Allen while rookie Mac Jones would do just enough to leave Buffalo victorious. That‚Äôs not quite what happened. The Bills would receive the ball to start the game and proceed to drive down field finishing with a TD pass from Allen to Dawson Knox that was meant to be thrown away. On the next drive the Patriots would find some success gaining three first downs and then taking a shot at the end zone after Nelson Agholor beat Levi Wallace deep. On one of the more ridiculous playoff Interceptions you will ever see Micah Hyde sprinted over from his deep safety position and made a diving Interception to save the TD. The rout was on. Buffalo would score a TD on each of its four first half possessions while the Patriots would kick a FG to end the half resulting in a score of 27-3. The Bills didn‚Äôt slow down after half scoring a TD on all three of their ‚Äúpossessions‚Äù producing the first ‚ÄúPerfect Game‚Äù in NFL history. The Patriots would score two TDs in garbage time to make the score a bit more respectable but the 47-17 outcome of the game was one Bills fans never even dreamt of. It also can‚Äôt be overstated just how impressive Josh Allen‚Äôs day was in arguably the greatest Playoff performance by a Quarterback in NFL History. In the full context of the moment, the opponent, and the weather, Allen‚Äôs stat line of 21/25 (84%) for 308 Yards and 5 TDs coupled with 6 Rushes for 66 Yards and 0 Turnovers was unbelievable. Buffalo moves on to the next round after a game Bills Mafia will never forget. **WIN 47-17**

**Divisional Round (12-6), @ Kansas City Chiefs (13-5):** The game everyone expected to happen at some point in the playoffs was here, a rematch of the 2020 AFC Championship, Bills vs. Chiefs. Reminiscent of [Round 1 of Hagler vs. Hearns (1985)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL2a2-8OHdg) the entire game was punch, counterpunch. The first half saw each team score 2 TDs as the Bills and Chiefs mirrored what each other was doing. Patrick Mahomes was an issue all game as he extended plays with his legs and in the 2nd half was able to produce a 9 point lead. With the game on the brink of getting away from the Bills Josh Allen would launch a rocket to Gabriel Davis for a 75-yard TD to cut the lead to 2. Both offenses would stall on their next possessions but the Bills would end in a punt that Tyreek Hill would return 45-yards ultimately setting up a Harrison Butker FG. That‚Äôs when things began to get wild. Down by 6 the Bills would take the ball and march down the field over a seven minute span. In that drive Allen would go supernova converting multiple fourth downs including a 4th & 13 where he would hit Gabriel Davis to take the lead. Kansas City would get the ball back down 3 and on their fifth play Tyreek Hill would take a short pass 64-yards to regain the lead. The Bills would get the ball back and Allen would lead yet another drive down field and hit Gabriel Davis for his fourth TD (A Postseason Record) with 13 seconds left on the clock. Bills fans knew better than most that the game was far from over and with 13 seconds left watched Mahomes drive 44 yards in two plays setting up a 49-yard FG to send the game to Overtime. Everyone knows what came next, coin toss, Chiefs won, Chiefs get ball, Chiefs score, game over. Arguably one of the most entertaining games in NFL postseason history was everything it was billed to be and is a rivalry NFL fans can expect to look forward to for years to come. As for Bills fans another season ending in heartbreak but confidence in tact that this team will yet again compete for a Super Bowl in 2022. **LOSS 36-42**

On that drive, as Buffalo pushed downfield, Josh Allen would scramble and after an awkward tackle would come up limp with what was later diagnosed a foot sprain. Somehow Allen remained in the game running, throwing, and doing anything necessary to get the Bills back into it. Through Allen‚Äôs efforts and a reinvigorated defense Buffalo wound up with the ball down just 27-24 late in the fourth. Allen would lead the Bills down the field again reaching the Bucs 7 when on a 3rd & 3 he would throw a catchable ball to Stefon Diggs in the endzone. The ref in the corner would miss a blatant PI and the Bills would settle for an FG. In OT the Bills would struggle on Drive One and give up a TD to the Buccaneers and lose the game. There assuredly are no moral victories in the NFL but something felt different at the conclusion of this game, the Bills were coming alive. **LOSS 27-33**

**Week 15 (7-6), vs. Carolina Panthers (5-8):** Leading up to this game it was questionable as to whether or not Josh Allen would be able to play through his foot sprain. With nearly every game moving forward being ‚ÄúMust Win‚Äù Allen took the field, sans his starting Left Tackle, in an effort to assure victory. During warmups the Panthers lost their Kicker to injury which would play a pivotal role in the flow of the game. The first quarter came and went at 0-0 with each team struggling to get close to the end zone as Allen‚Äôs injury was hampering his level of play and the Panthers lack of Kicker resulted in risky fourth down attempts. Both teams would settle in during the second quarter as the Bills would go up 14-0 only to be answered by a Cam Newton Rush TD making the score 14-8. From that point onwards the Bills would add an additional 17 points as Buffalo‚Äôs defense clamped down on Newton‚Äôs Panthers holding them to just 6 additional points. A game of one Quarterback being able to push the ball downfield and another incapable of doing so brought the Bills back to their winning ways. **WIN 31-14**

**Week 16 (8-6), @ New England Patriots (9-5):** A massive game where the winner would gain the inside track on claiming the AFC East. This time Buffalo & New England would play under normal weather conditions allowing for a better understanding of just who was the better team. It was a game of punch and counter punch with no team building more than a 13 point lead. The Bills first 7 points would be answered by the Patriots only to see Buffalo respond with a 10 point run to head into half. Post halftime the game would get much closer as the Bills 10 points would be answered by 14 from New England, 2 TDs from Damien Harris making it 3 on the day. With 7:37 left in the game the Bills would take the ball up by just 5 and begin a march downfield. Josh Allen would go 4/7 through the air completing two more passes to the new ‚ÄúFace of the Franchise‚Äù Isaiah McKenzie, who had the best game of his career (11 Receptions, 125 Yards, 1 TD). More importantly Allen was continually moving the sticks on the ground and on a 4th & 1 deked the entire Patriots defense out of their shoes all but sealing victory. The drive would end with a shovel pass TD to Knox and on the subsequent drive Mac Jones would throw his 2nd INT of the game to end it. Buffalo was back in control of the AFC East and would look to wrap it up with 2 more wins to end the year. **WIN 33-21**

**Week 17 (9-6), vs. Atlanta Falcons (7-8):** The Bills final two games seemed easy on paper but in the NFL nothing is ever as easy as it seems. An early muffed punt by the Bills resulted in a Safety for the Falcons giving them a surprising 2-0 lead. Buffalo would bounce back after that and see Josh Allen finish the first quarter with two rushing TDs. It seemed as though the Bills would quite literally run away with this game but on Buffalo‚Äôs next two possessions Josh Allen would throw Interceptions while the Falcons would score on each of their next three drives to go into half with a stunning 15-14 lead. The Bills received the ball to start the third and Allen amazingly threw an Interception on his third consecutive drive, his first three Interception game since a 2019 Week 4 matchup against the Patriots. Luckily for Buffalo, the Falcons would not turn this turnover into points and thus the tide of the game changed. For the remainder of the outing Buffalo pounded the ball on the ground, seeing Devin Singletary with the Bills first 100+ Yard Rushing Game by an RB in 40 games. After scores on consecutive possessions the Bills lead became nearly insurmountable but the Falcons would make it interesting late getting to the Bills 1-Yard line only to be pushed back after a slide short of the endzone, and Matt Ryan taunting penalty. Buffalo escaped this game with a Win and sat a victory, or Patriots loss away from their second straight AFC East title. **WIN 29-15**

On the opening possession the Jets would go three and out which was followed by a quick Bills TD. The Jets would keep the game surprisingly competitive (10-3) until the late second Quarter when an Allen to Diggs TD would open the floodgates. In the third quarter the Bills would score a TD on each of their first three possessions while Mike White would throw an Interception on each of the Jets first three. The game eventually got out of hand as Buffalo would blowout another division rival extending their division win streak to nine while ending the short lived legend of Mike White. **WIN 45-17**

**Week 11 (6-3), vs. Indianapolis Colts (5-5):** A game which in theory favored the Bills in reality would be incredibly difficult for them. Their two presumptive best run defenders, LB Tremaine Edmunds and DT Star Lotulelei, were both out with injuries which had an obvious impact from the start of the game. On the opening drive the Colts would run the ball down the Bills throat en route to a TD and eating up the clock in the process. Buffalo would keep the game relatively close into the middle of the second quarter but a series of mistakes would quickly push the game out of reach. On a 3rd & 8 Mario Addison would be called for roughing the passer which gave the Colts a new set of downs. The Bills would force the Colts into another 3rd & Long but this time see Addison whiff on a Sack and Wentz scramble for 18 yards. The drive would end in just 3 points but on the ensuing kickoff Isaiah McKenzie would fumble, untouched, resulting in Colts ball on the 1. A one score game quickly devolved into a three score one which proved too much for the Bills to recover from. Jonathan Taylor would account for five TDs and another poor showing would push the Bills to 6-4 with a short week before a game on Thanksgiving. **LOSS 15-41**

**Week 12 (6-4), @ New Orleans Saints (5-5):** This would be the second time the Bills have appeared on Thanksgiving during the Allen/McDermott era, this time against a depleted Saints team. From the beginning of the game it was abundantly clear that Trevor Siemian and the Saints Offense would be unable to effectively move the ball against the Bills. The Bills Offense on the other hand was putting up points fairly consistently hopping out to a 10-0 lead. The first half wasn‚Äôt without issues for Buffalo though as Allen would throw two Interceptions, including his first career regular season redzone pick, with just eight seconds left in the half. Coming out of the tunnel after halftime the Bills would score a TD on three of their next four possessions while the Saints were only able to muster a fourth quarter TD to avoid a shutout. The victory was an important one for the Bills but did not come without cost. Tre White, their All-Pro CB tore his ACL pushing him to the IR for the remainder of the season. **WIN 31-6**

**Week 13 (7-4), vs. New England Patriots (8-4):** The biggest game of the season, thus far, for both the Patriots and Bills would take place during one of the worst weather nights you will ever struggle to see. Precipitation levels were low during the game but wind gusts would occasionally exceed 50 MPH making it nearly impossible to throw. The Patriots countered the weather by almost exclusively running, throwing the ball just three times. This strategy proved fruitful early with Damien Harris executing a 64-yard first quarter TD Run. Buffalo would counter that TD after a misplayed punt by N‚ÄôKeal Harry set up a 14-yard strike from Josh Allen to Gabriel Davis for a TD. The rest of the game played incredibly sloppy with one of the primary determining factors being a missed 33-yard FG by Bills Kicker Tyler Bass. A winnable game slipped away from the Bills and left fans pondering why designed Quarterback Runs were not in the game plan on a night such as this. The Bills dropped further behind the Patriots in the AFC East, the chase was on. **LOSS 10-14**

The game began as expected with each team trading blows. Kansas City scored an FG on their first drive, Buffalo countered with a TD on theirs. On the subsequent kickoff Byron Pringle would fumble to Buffalo who was unable to turn the opportunity into points. On their next possession the Chiefs would drive downfield to go up 10-7, prompting memories of the 2020 AFC Championship and pushing Bills Mafia into full blown panic. Then things changed. Josh Allen and the Bills began to attack deep, hitting four 20+ yard passes between then and half resulting in a 24-13 Buffalo lead at the break. A rain delay calmed the temperament of both fan bases and seemingly flattened both teams who would combine for 0 points in the first 3 possessions after half. On the fourth, KC‚Äôs second possession, a ball would sail through Tyreek Hills‚Äô hands and into future All-Pro Safety Mich Hydes who would return it for a TD giving the Bills a commanding 31-13 lead. Mahomes of course would press for a comeback the remainder of the game and had some success but saw the game slip through his fingers when rookie DE Greg Rousseau went full Groot on a Redzone INT. Josh Allen would keep the clock running and Buffalo would leave Kansas City, at least temporarily, Giant Killers. **WIN 38-20**

**Week 6 (4-1), @ Tennessee Titans (3-2):** Another Primetime game meant another opportunity for Buffalo to avenge a 2020 loss. The first quarter would come and go with the Bills offense scoring just 3 points while their defense would hold the Titans to a single first down in their first three possessions. Early in the second quarter the Bills would extend their lead to 6 points only to see Derrick Henry take the Titans next offensive play 76-yards. The complexion of the game would be permanently altered as Buffalo‚Äôs defense would play the remainder of the game on their heels. From that moment forward the Titans and Bills would exchange blows with Tennessee scoring 3 Rushing TDs and Buffalo 3 Passing TDs. With 3:05 left in the game Buffalo would get the ball back, down by 3, and on the kickoff Isaiah McKenzie would give the Bills the lead via a kick return TD‚Ä¶had it not been for a called hold on Andre Smith. Still, Josh Allen would march the Bills down the field until a 4th & 1 at the 2-yard line. Kick it for overtime or go for the win, Buffalo chose the latter but on a QB Sneak would see Allen‚Äôs right foot slip short of the line to gain. Buffalo falls to 4-2 in heartbreaking fashion. **LOSS 31-34**

The first half was ugly for each team as they would score just 3 points a piece. In the Bills six possessions they would only cross midfield twice while the Dolphins would leave 10 points on the board after a missed FG and late Fumble in the Red Zone. The game would quickly shift in Buffalo‚Äôs favor after halftime as their offense would heat up. Via three Josh Allen TDs the Bills scored on four of their five second half possessions accounting for an additional 23 points on the day. Meanwhile the Dolphins struggles continued as Tua Tagovailoa and their offense were only able to score 8 points. Miami never really got close after halftime as Buffalo would continue their recent dominance over the Dolphins (9-1 in Sean McDermott‚Äôs career & 7-1 in the Josh Allen era). **WIN 26-11**

In the first five possessions of the game each team would kick two FGs resulting in a 6-6 tie. From there onwards each offense would stall and struggle to produce any success. Trevor Lawarence would temporarily be knocked out of the game and replaced by C.J. Beathard, who would have no less success than Lawrence. After halftime the game would get sloppier for Buffalo as Josh Allen would turn the ball over on 3 of their first four possessions. The second of those three would be an interception thrown from Josh Allen to Josh Allen resulting in another FG for Jacksonville. Buffalo would not score again and while the officiating was atrocious, specifically regarding ‚ÄúFalse Starts‚Äù, the Bills never earned the right to win. An embarrassing loss that would haunt the Bills for the remainder of the season. **LOSS 6-9**

\#54 ‚Äì A.J. Klein: [A.J. leaving the dining room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRFUZBXOWZI)

\#55 ‚Äì Jerry Hughes: A down year for Hughes, who played just over 50% of the team‚Äôs defensive snaps. But still shows the ability to get after the QB, and is disruptive in the passing game, which allows other players to take advantage. The Sacks might not be there, but the veteran presence would be enough to take another Super Bowl run with him.

\#57 ‚Äì A.J. Epenesa: [A.J. in the passing game](https://vine.co/v/e2dpQ0eDaA6)

\#79 ‚Äì Spencer Brown: The rookie had a solid season, and gave the coaching staff enough good film to not have issues with releasing several members of the line, with Brown as a replacement. Look for Brown to have a breakout 2022-23 when taking on a more full-time role.

\#88 ‚Äì Dawson Knox: THE breakout star of Buffalo‚Äôs offense this year. Knox was the safety valve that Allen relied on most of the year, with incredible catches almost every week. Set career high‚Äôs in almost every category. With Beasley gone, Knox is the man in the flat now.

\#89 ‚Äì Tommy Sweeney: And to every ying, there‚Äôs a yang. While Knox piled on the catches, Sweeney could barely be trusted to back him up. Beane has been trying to replace Sweeney with Jacob Hollister at least once every couple of months, so that should be a sign that an upgrade is going to be needed.

\#91 ‚Äì Ed Oliver: The stats don‚Äôt tell the whole story with Oliver, but he is a formidable force in the middle of the defense. Opposing QBs and coaches have to scheme specifically for him, which allows the heat to come from other parts of the kitchen. 100% passes the eye test.

\#93 ‚Äì Efe Obada: Mostly rotational DE, but his claim to fame is being one of our International Pathway players. For someone who didn‚Äôt play organized football until 2014, Obada has carved out a nice place for himself in the NFL.

\#94 ‚Äì Vernon Butler: Well‚Ä¶there‚Äôs [this](https://heavy.com/sports/buffalo-bills/vernon-butler-raiders-reaction-twitter/)

\#96 ‚Äì Carlos Basham: Boogie had an up and down rookie year, but he took advantage of his limited playing time and showed solid technical ability. More of a work in progress at this point, but definite starter potential.

\#97 ‚Äì Mario Addison: Great play recognition that more often than not resulted in him sniffing out the ball carrier, also added 7 sacks this season to lead the team. Versatile, and adds that veteran presence to any locker room.

\#98 ‚Äì Star Lotulelei: \*[glances at injury report](https://vine.co/v/iL55uzPbWWn)\*

\#20 ‚Äì Zack Moss: Didn‚Äôt offer enough of a difference to Singletary to have a steady role toward the end of ‚Äô21, but I would expect him to be used as a depth piece if (when) Buffalo finds another back through the draft or a trade.

\#24 ‚Äì Taron Johnson: One of the better slot corners in the league, Taron made a few splash plays this season and was rewarded with a 3-year extension.

\#25 ‚Äì Taiwan Jones: One of Sean McDermott‚Äôs favorite special teams contributors; he has played over 75% of special teams snaps over the past 3 years in Buffalo

.#26 ‚Äì Devin Singletary: Motor is finally showing the skills that were touted when he came out of college, with consistent pressure on his runs for the final third of the season. Averaged in the top half of the league in yards per carry, and should come into ‚Äô22 as RB1.

\#27 ‚Äì Tre‚ÄôDavious White: Unquestioned leader of the defense before his injury, and undoubtedly missed afterwards. Would the playoff loss have happened if White was covering Hill? Get Well Soon, Tre!!

\#30 ‚Äì Dane Jackson: Played well after White‚Äôs injury, and his ability to read coverage kept him from getting burned by speedier players. Should be a solid CB2 candidate coming into next season in place of Levi Wallace.

**Week 1 (0-0), vs. Pittsburgh Steelers (0-0):** The Bills would start their 2021 campaign as clear cut favorites expected to dominate a lesser opponent. That sentiment was reinforced on the opening kickoff when Bills Return Man, Isaiah McKenzie, returned the ball 75 yards, setting Buffalo up for an early score. Buffalo would dominate the remainder of the 1st half but only to the tune of a 10-0 lead. The 2nd half would present a different trend as the Steelers began to methodically inch back, scoring on each of their first 3 possessions (FG, FG, TD). Meanwhile Buffalo‚Äôs offense would continually stall as the Steelers pass-rushers would overwhelm the Bills protection schemes. The dagger came with just under 10 minutes remaining in the game when Pittsburgh would block a Matt Haack punt and recover it for a TD to take a 20-10 lead. The Bills would score a late FG to cut the deficit to 7 but ultimately would walk away with a loss. One team did everything right on this day, and the other simply did not do enough. **LOSS 16-23**

**Week 2 (0-1), @ Miami Dolphins (1-0):** The results in Week 1 made this early divisional matchup for Buffalo much more pressing. A win would propel the Bills to 1st in the AFC East while a loss would put them in a 2.5 game hole just 2 games into the season. Seizing on that urgency Buffalo‚Äôs defense came out on fire, sacking Tua Tagovailoa on the first play of the game and twice in the first drive. This pressure would ultimately knock Tua out of the game and wouldn‚Äôt relent when backup QB, Jacoby Brissett, entered. The Bills defense would go on to sack Dolphins QBs 6 times, force 3 turnovers, and hold Miami to 0/4 on 4th down. On offense the Bills still weren‚Äôt playing up to their potential, consistently committing errors including two first half turnovers which fortunately did not turn into Dolphins scores. Still, via a balanced attack, Buffalo saw 3 TDs on the ground (Moss x2, Singletary x1) and 2 TDs through the air (Diggs x1, Knox x1) resulting in more than enough points for a victory. A game which never really was in doubt continued the recent trend of Buffalo dominating Miami. **WIN 35-0**

**Week 3 (1-1), vs. Washington Football Team (1-1):** At 1-1 the Bills would return to Buffalo looking for their first win in front of a full home stadium since Week 12, 2019. While a victory remained the primary goal Bills fans were highly focused on witnessing a dominant performance from their franchise QB, they‚Äôd get one. On the opening drive Josh Allen would go 5/6, completing passes to 4 separate receivers, and culminating in a 28-yard dime to Emmanuel Sanders for a TD. Buffalo‚Äôs onslaught would continue as they hooped out to a 21-0 lead but it would quickly evaporate to 21-14 post a 73-yard Screen Pass to Antonio Gibson and botched Buffalo kick return. Before half Buffalo would tack on 2 more FGs, one the result of driving 51-yards in 24 seconds, to push their lead back to two scores. The second half was all Buffalo as the Bills would rattle off 16 consecutive points to emass an insurmountable lead. Josh Allen would end the game with 5 TDs and while Taylor Heinicke was clearly outmatched he quietly produced an impressive fight. **WIN 43-21**

**Week 4 (2-1), vs. Houston Texans (1-2):** The Bills offense started Week 3 with a bang but Week 4 would start with a dud. On his first pass of the game Josh Allen would throw an Interception and on the subsequent offensive possession would fail to score. A concerning start to the game for a Bills team who looked a bit off against one of the worst teams in the NFL. Luckily for Buffalo the Texans Offense was led by a rookie in Davis Mills who, in his 2nd career start, was clearly not ready for the complexity of the Bills defense. The result was Mills finishing with just 63 Net Yards, 4 Interceptions, and 0 Scores. Meanwhile Buffalo would reach the Red Zone 7 times but on 4 separate occasions had to settle for an FG. This is a bit of nitpicking as Buffalo would go on to trounce its third straight opponent and begin prep for one of the biggest games of the Regular Season in Week 5. **WIN 40-0**

To summarize: Once an agent agrees to a deal, it's generally understood to be ""done"" even if it's not official until the player actually signs. If another team tries to offer a deal after a verbal agreement, there's a gentleman's agreement that the agent isn't supposed to consider other offers.

36413,260567,260567,gthirst,"Yankee Stadium was built in 2006 (finished in 09). Different time, different pressures, and it was likely just not on people's radar. Though I gotta wonder how it wouldn't be with the housing bubble burst and the economic strife at the time, even though the plans and money had been paid already prior to the bubble. This is all just supposition and I didn't care because I was in Afghanistan.

What is a fact is how people reacted to something almost 20 years ago doesn't really matter to the argument now and is just dumb whataboutism.

These concerns are very real about the Bills Stadium and are just as valid about Yankee Stadium. I think if you're on the side of ""no public money for vanity sports teams that are dubious investments"", then you probably aren't a fan of Yankee Stadium either. But it was almost 20 years ago and a lot of world events have happened since then (and were happening then) so the fervor for that probably died down.

I don't really know where I stand on this yet. I've been a season ticket holder for years and I see the PSLs, increased ticket costs, and tax hit pricing me out of the seats.

I'm not really interested in the supposed ""other events"". A classic rock band formed in 1960-70 is pushed onto the stage, or a soccer tournament, etc. Maybe a few times a year. Not interested and the ability to make money back by selling events you don't want to go to is dubious at best (also fuck scalpers).

So at the end of this, Pegula will have a shiny big Stadium and I won't go to Bills games anymore and some of my tax money will go to the Pegulas. It doesn't sit well as a Bills fan or a person concerned with the ethics of public money for sports teams.

That's not even considering where the money could be going elsewhere in terms of helping people or fostering positive economic change. 

Is a sports team/stadium worth the investment in an area or is it a detriment overall? Research suggests that no, a stadium is not a good idea and sports teams are not the best investment choice. Those studies weren't focused on Buffalo though and it stands to reason to consider that other factors may push the data in another direction.

There is a huge discussion to be had here and people are being very immediately dismissive of people with other opinions.

Each player is different, the beginning of their careers does not define how good they are compared to others. You need to let their careers play out before you start comparing stats like this. 

Let's take Joe Burrow for example. 
Had spent 5 years in college, and was widely known as the most 'pro ready' qb in NFL draft history. Spent time at both Ohio State and LSU behind some of the top coaches in the sport. 

Josh Allen's turn. 
Had spent 3 years in college, and was widely known as a 'raw' prospect with elite talent. Spent time at Wisconsin with subpar coaching staff, leaving plenty of room to improve on fundamentals and knowledge of the game. 

You can do this for every QB, and you'll see how it impacts the START of their NFL careers. It takes a lot of time, support and work ethic to become as great as each of these players are today. Just because it didn't happen year 1 for Josh Allen doesn't mean he's worse than Kirk Cousins, Dak Prescott or some others who rank higher on this list.

If you trade him, you guarantee to get something- but you can not convince me you will get a starting middle linebacker with the youth and upside of edmunds. Maybe you get a player, or a pick- but nothing likely that will immediately increase the talent of this team. 

The other thing to note is the value of continuity on a defense. These guys pretty much all know each other and the coaches at this point. Your defense was solid last season, and although edmunds has had up and down moments that continuity means something. 

Just my humble opinion, but I am ok with having edmunds this year EVEN if he walks next year because to trade him would almost certainly make the team less talented- and right now were in the business of acquiring all the talent we can. Beane got us in this very spot for a reason.

Hate to say it, but the key to getting an autograph at camp is having a kid. Bring your own or borrow a niece/nephew. While it‚Äôs not a 100% guaranteed way, it significantly increases your odds of getting one.

In past years there has always been an autograph tent where 2-3 players sit to give autographs. I think day of the Bills post who will be there. Im pretty sure that is strictly a kids only tent where they are accompanied by an adult. 

Your next shot would be standing along the fence line with a kid. You‚Äôll have to do your best to get the players attention as you are shoulder to shoulder with other people. Any time I‚Äôve been to camp it‚Äôs always 10 kids get an autograph before 1 adult.

The whole bar was obviously a ball of emotions from the second the feed switched to the Ravens-Bengals game. That final Bengals drive started out well for us, and the whole bar started to feel that something special was going to happen. I specifically remember after the 3rd down play right before, when I believe the Bengals were flagged, someone at the bar said something along the lines of ""Oops, looks like Pegula's check just bounced"" and the whole vibe of the room sort of flipped to the ""same old Bills"" mentality that dominated the drought era. 

THEN... It happened. Boyd makes the catch and gets to the line to gain... the entire bar goes into a frenzy. My Fiance and I both jumped up from our seats. Then he got past a defender and scored. It was one of the most euphoric, cathartic, weight lifting emotional rushes I have ever felt in my life. I remember my fiance going in to give me a high five and I just looked around and uncontrollably just bursted into tears. Like full on hunched over sobbing. My fiance and I just hugged and started hugging all the people in the bar.

 In taking all of this in, it felt like the 17 years of mediocrity made that one moment worth it. In that moment I was like ""This is why we put ourselves through this. For moments like this."" Truly, albeit somewhat sadly, one of the most euphoric moments of my life.
