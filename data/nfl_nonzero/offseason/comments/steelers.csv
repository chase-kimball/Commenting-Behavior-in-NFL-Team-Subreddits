The cost to move up for a QB, especially one who is generally thought of as QB 1, is going to be higher even for the same distance.

The depth at LB was non-existent after Bush. The next guy coming off the board was Tavai 33 picks later (and even he was considered a reach at that point) and after that, it was Germaine Pratt at 72.

The 2019 pick was trying to make one last run and was being aggressive about getting a piece they thought was a win-now player. Now they're in the middle of a rebuild/reload/reset and have a longer-term trajectory in mind.

They also had a surplus of picks in that draft after the AB trade (KC even said this was part of the calculus in electing to move up), while in this draft they actually have less than the normal allotment of picks.

As a Steeler fan I'd be ecstatic if they took a flyer on him considering we are desperate for edge depth and following an injury his conditioning would likely be his biggest weakness.

They should keep Gentry as an extra blocker on the weak side so he doesn't get beat on the speed rush 15 times a game in an offense that holds the ball more than 2 seconds on passing downs.

8208,48495,48495,D0ctorMantisToboggan,"We have many friendly disagreements and that is fine.

I dont think Davis **isnt** a 3 down player, rather he was on a team with so much quality depth he didnt need to be stretched so thin as the season wore on. They knew they would need him down the season wore on and hes obviously a large human, he was playing at 360lbs by most accounts and thats not sustainable. Im sure he can drop 20 in the pros with better facilities and nutrition programs. Hes just too unique and elite an athlete to pass up on, you need to take that raw talent and harness it if he fits what your team is trying to do and he absolutely does.

I also am still hoping Edmunds will be re-signed but if he isnt that 2nd round pick absolutely becomes a safety. I think WR/CB are interchangeable in rd2/3 but i just like the way the board falls better taking a CB in rd2. Obviously thats speculation based on draft boards and mocks i could very much see it going the other way if the board falls differently.

I really just like Zappe/Woods in terms of value at that range and i agree an edge defender makes much more sense but i was kind of going for recognizable names seeing as i was trying to adhere to the ""mock draft"" outline but didn't feel like diving into day 3 player profiles.

Also i dont get the LS hate. Even Belichick made a pretty clear point to recognize elite talent at the LS position has much more value than given credit for. Tomlin wants competition at every position and i think he takes Kuntz job just like Kuntz took Canadays job last year. Kuntz looks like an all around quality practice squad player while Cal Adomitis is a expert at his position and that Pitt connection to that amazing OL theyve had the past season or 2 could prove him to be a 15 year starter in this league and overall hes one of the most high character guys you will find.

They both were drafted fot thier great measurables because thats what the Steelers look for often. Green had great speed/quickness and athleticism while Moore was a mauler with good size who did a ton of work out of the 3 point stance which is uncommon to see in LTs but valued by the former OL coach.

Moores technique never developed as the season went on nor did Green. They may work with trainers over the off-season and show up to camp more prepared and vie for a starting role once again but the team simply cant expect that to be the case. They went into FA and filled Greens spot and many expect them to do the same at LT in the draft at some point.

 Its strange how many people were adamant they address the OL in the draft including LT but once they pay Chuks, get a guard to replace Trai Turner and a center to replace Green they no longer need to fix the 2nd worst part of the OL. Makes no sense.

Jordan Davis would be my ideal pick although they have Tyson Alualu returning for what is likely his final season along with Montravious Adams at NT.

Also Moore filled a hole as a rookie and performed at the lowest and was often a liability in the pass game.

Devante Parker trade from the Dolphins could be interesting.

Offer up a 7th and the Dolphins would save around $3m (which is what the Steelers would pay him in 2022).

Dolphins should be making a final push to sign JC Tretter at center who could be the final piece needed to have a functional, if not quality offense this upcoming season. Clearing up some cap space to get it done while getting anything in return following that costly trade for Hill would be ideal.

Its a win-win for both parties considering Parker looked elite in 2020 before being derailed by injuries as he has seen throughout his career.

Since losing Juju and McCloud (i know... but Matt Canada had him as WR3 most of the season) we cant roll into 2022 with only DJ and Chase as legit recieving options outside of Friermuth who is a safety valve and still learning a notoriously slowly developing position.

Im not saying WR in the 1st round but day 2 has the be a serious consideration and if they dont get one by rd4 the board was probably a disaster for them and they will have to reach in rd4.

Also Bonito is a great player but they started to get decent production out of Tuszka by late in the season as depth with some clutch sacks and a couple of FFs. I feel like he could make the roster again as well as Taco Charleton who made some nice plays as well even as a mid season pickup.

Kuntz was primarily LB who picked up long snapping to try to keep a roster spot and while he picked it up quickly he isnt perfect. I remember his high snap on an XP FG in the Bears game that would have lost them the game if they hadnt scored with less than 2 minutes to play.

I could see Schobert going to the Seahawks as a fill-in for Wagner actually.

The Saints have a quality OL for the most part and the Broncos have a ton of young talent that can be reigned in with coaching and more experience same with Washington and the Bucs are in a weird position as well but i think they go with a vet to back up Trask rather than draft a QB.

I know most of the fans ive interacted with are against drafting a QB in round 1 because the idea the QB draft class is weak or whatever but you cant go into the season with Taysom as QB1 and no quality depth behind him and you cant afford a decent QB2 such as Winston in my estimation.

Why are fans so against the idea of Matt Corrall or Kenny Pickett or Malik Willis being drafted in the 1st round? If they can take snaps away from Taysom by mid-season the team could potentially start to heal the cap by lowering Taysoms cap hit by quite a bit in his ""hybrid contract"".

I really like Rachaad White in that day 3 category hes almost a big slot receiver playing RB. Definitely a swiss army knife player.

I dont like Justyn Ross over Eric Peirce. Ross should be the top of the day 3 picks because of serious injury concerns as well as his awful issue with drops this past season. I think he falls to the mid-late rd4 especially in such a great WR class.

Jelani Woods also needs to be higher after his combine performance. Hes 6'7"" and ran a 4.61 40 along with being viewed as one of the best blockers at TE. Hes starting to give me George Kittle vibes. Hes going to be a steal on day 3.

You are really that high on Damone Clark? Devin Lloyd is the 4th ranked LB? I love Leo Chenal as a prospect but I'm seeing him as a late 2nd rounder to a late 3rd by most seeing he is more of a Buck ILB which isn't valued as highly as a Mack ILB like Dean or Harris. 

Final note is that i really hope the Steelers get a guard early because after Green and Zion the drop off is crazy.

Even if that does happen i tend to agree the contract price is a matter of principle for the team and i agree it could be a problem to give him that type of contract while other players like Minkah are still waiting to get paid.

Rather than push DJ or Pickens inside and put in a 170lbs rookie in the slot where hes less familiar, to get pushed around. Hes a boundary guy but will need to play some underneath if he wants to get reps. I dont think he does a ton of that in 2022.

9823,55314,55314,Dang026,"Agreed. Also the same people who follow analytics (i definitely recognize their value but realize they need to be taken with a grain of salt) will tell you that, sure... RB can be viewed as a luxury pick in todays NFL as a 1st round pick because of the shortened career of the position group on average.... BUT running backs drafted in the 1st round have the highest boom/bust rate of any position not including punter or kicker, meaning its a more surefire pro-bowl talent than any other position drafted in the 1st round

Just because we cant expect Najee to be an elite talent or even earn a 2nd contract that isnt a franchise tag beyond his roomie deal because he was 24 on draft day at a position that has a shorter shelf life, doesnt mean he doesn't help as a long term piece to a young OL and a young QB who need to have the pressure taken off of them to allow the offense to operate and give the WRs a bit of freedom while the defense is stacking the box against the run.

Player development should never stop even in a down season. Abandoning the run would have crippled the development of the team as a whole, even on the defensive side seeing as they had enough trouble staying off the field as it was with a pro-bowl rookie RB taking 350 touches on the season. Najee was absolutely a solid pick and a necessary one at that, ""positional value"" be damned.

Also 5th year deals and franchise tags for positions of perceived lower value add to the benefit when you are getting a stud.

Spread out the defense and limit the amount of carries between the tackles for McCaffrey seeing as he spent most of last season injured. They should want him as fresh as possible for when Pickett takes the field.

They would have to dial back the designed runs for a young franchise player like Pickett and tell him to play a bit more conservative but he also is a strong runner and young mobile QBs can use that ability to develop as a passer.

I think he could be a steady starter for them for a long time in that division with domed stadiums and nice weather.

After getting watson you have fans dying on the hill that he’s mother Theresa, the same people screaming that Ben was a rapist.

Honestly for me, up until the last couple seasons the Bengals have been somewhat irrelevant. Like they have swings of being good and bad (particularly under dalton) but their fans are trash too. Tossing beers at an injured Ben, the way they’ve acted for the last 2 seasons in one of their good swings, they’re obnoxious too.

If you look at the numbers, Metcalf is the better player. Both had a season with their QBs being injured (DJ’s played more games with a backup/third string QB though) but it’s most definitely not a stretch to compare these two. Also DK really only has Lockett to compete for in terms of touches, and maybe Carson. We’ve had Juju, Claypool, as well as both Najee and Muth last season being contributors in the passing game, something Carson really wasn’t in Seattle, and Dissly only was for a stretch of games.

If you REALLY sit back and think about the roster construction of this team:

2008 Super Bowl

2010 you go back to the Super Bowl and lose which sucks but at the end of the day is forgivable. We were the best team in the conference.

Then from 2010 till ~2016 this team had just a fucking awful defence. Ross Cockrell. Antwon Blake. Jarvis Jones. Sharknado/Sean Davis. Anthony Chickillo. Most of those guys left the team and went on to be backups/ST contributors, or out of the league as a whole meanwhile they were our starters. This same time the offense was being very well constructed to the point where we were just amazing, but the team just wasn’t complete.

Finally we get a complete team and go 13-3 just to lose arguably our biggest defensive piece in Shazier and the defense just completely fell apart. Can’t blame the coach for a career ending injury. Give up 7 scores to a Bortles led Jags team. It’s like if the Rams this season lost Donald in like week 12. I doubt they go to the Super Bowl or win without him.

Only other year I feel that we really fielded a roster competitive enough for Super Bowl aspirations was 2019, but Ben goes down with a season ender and we still managed to go .500 with a CFL QB. 

Tomlin might not win as many championships as some may like (this is due to NE clouding peoples judgment on what success looks like) but he most definitely gets the most out of what’s put out on the field, and THATS what you have to take away from a record like he has with no losing seasons.

16685,101289,101289,ItsYourBoyD,"I’m torn with Davis so to be honest with you, I don’t really know.

He’s a physical freak. He’s a mountain of a man with tremendous speed for his size. He’s great against the run, eats blocks, can play 0, 1, 2 and possibly even 3 tech as he also possesses a decent pass rush ability that he can work on culminating with his size and athleticism. From what I’ve seen though, he’s definitely not a 3 down type player and would most likely spend a majority of his time 0/1 tech. You have Adams who signed and Alualu, so it’s something you’re good with this season, and can look to FA or next years draft for a pure block eating run stuffer.

I think regardless, if a QB you want is there, you take him, no questions asked. It’s far and away the most important. I’d probably look at something like: QB>any big drops (Sauce Gardner, Kyle Hamilton, Hutchinson, Evan Neal, guys who 99% won’t be there, but if they fell would be too good to pass up) >Davis>WR>CB>OL

16686,101291,101291,ItsYourBoyD,"I think it’s a great time to draft a QB. The defense looks very good.  A front 3 of Tuitt - Alualu - Heyward, in front of Watt - Jack - Bush - Highsmith, with decent depth in the secondary which can still be addressed if needed in the 2nd or 3rd round. Drafting defense would be taking a strength and making it stronger. When this group is healthy, it’s one of the best in all of football.

Offensively, it seems like Dan Moore can be a long term answer at LT, they resigned Chuks at RT and heavily addressed IOL in FA. You essentially improved on what we had last year and have solidified the day 1 starters. It can get better but it’s not as pressing of a need. It’s not an area you’d rule out completely, but I doubt they go Oline in the first. 

RB isn’t a round 1 type need. Neither is TE. WR could be - although again, that’s something that you can find in the second or later and I’m confident in our ability to develop the position. Another position you can’t really rule out. I think looking at this team, the pick has to be on offense, because that’s where you need the injection of talent. Our offense was putrid. 

I think the question is: are any of the QBs available THEIR guy. Do you basically see Corral, Willis or Pickett as the future of the franchise? The QB is the most important position on the field. If the answer is yes, you take them. You also give them the opportunity to win the starting job and if Mitch wins it, they get a clipboard year and Mitch can back them up next season. 

If the answer is no, I still think you take a QB, but a day 3 flyer to add depth and competition to the room where you might also be pleasantly surprised (a la Brady). Next season (2023-2024) the only guy we’ll have under contract would be Mitch so you’ll need bodies and I’d rather have a day 3 rookie type contract than a Mason Rudolph who will command more. It’s getting to crunch time in paying guys out, after this season: Tuitt, Bush, Sutton, Boswell, Minkah, D. Watt, Diontae and Alualu are all due (these are the main names - there are others) so you need to think of replacements and paydays to keep the bones of the team in tact as well. Rookie contracts help.

We’re not in a GB situation where you have rodgers and are in win now mode and should spend a first to do that. We can field a competitive roster this season that also gets a long term answer to stay competitive.

TLDR: The bones of this team are in place. Defense would just be making a strength stronger - which isn’t bad. I think the pick needs to be on offense, and with the investment in FA on Oline, the Najee pick and the ‘muth at TE, that basically leaves you with IOL (less likely), WR and QB. If they believe one of them is their guy, you do anything to get him.

16698,101312,101312,ItsYourBoyD,"Let me start off by saying, Wilson is a great QB make no mistake about it, but I definitely did not want to see this team trade house to get him. Rodgers - the same thing. It seems to be the general consensus on the sub that while it would’ve been great to see either of them in a steeler uniform, we didn’t want to give up that much to get them.

That being said, I don’t really want to see Mason as the starter…  

This is a guy who was literally benched when he was thrusted into the starting job for a fringe CFL guy who runs a podcast now… we’ve seen his body of work. He won’t magically transform into a bro bowl calibre QB when he isn’t even starting calibre. While yes, he dealt with injuries when he was the starter, look at the 49ers game where he was benched due to performance reasons, then look at the Lions game this year. Not just the stat line - the tape. He’s awful. We had the 31st ranked passing offense when he was the starter in 2019, and that was behind a respectable offensive line. Also, the guy we have behind him in Haskins is probably worse. 

We know they’re adding to the room, but unless they get an actual starter like Jameis or go draft a guy, adding someone like Trubisky to this room isn’t going to make it that much better. We can’t go signing back up QBs to be the starter and expect them to play better than a future hall of famer. Ben was criminally underrated last year. Lost a bunch of weapons, played behind turnstiles with 0 mobility and no arm strength yet he still led the league in comeback drives.

In the AFC right now, who can we honestly say Mason is better than? Davis Mills… that might honestly be it. If the Watson saga ends and he suits up for the Texans, we have the worst QB in the conference. Our offense last year was abysmal. On top of that, we are probably going to lose our RG, WR1, WR4, WR5, RB2 and TE2… we also might lose our RT, and we haven’t even gotten to the defensive side of the ball. This offense is only going to get worse before it gets any better, which is saying something when they were historically bad last year. 

My issue is, this defense is too good to actually “tank” (which we won’t do regardless and shouldn’t) so we probably won’t draft in the top 10… meaning why not draft a guy this year at 20? We lost out on the North by 1 game to the AFC representative in the superbowl. This team is closer to a championship than a first overall selection, so when FA rolls around, we need to actually make more than bargain bin signings.

Alualu I still have hopes for, I just don’t know how well he’ll play coming off of injury. IDL could very well become a huge need quick, just like WR will if Juju, Washington and Ray-Ray all leave.

I started smelling gasoline 5 gallons into pumping the fuel into my work truck. I stopped, paid for the fuel, then filled the remainder of the tank 30 gallons with diesel. 

She’s running a but rough but its a work vehicle and I didn’t have the time to drain the tank. I am going to keep diluting the gasoline with diesel. I reckon the *worst* thing that could happen is I’ll have to change the fuel pump. But again, its a work truck and I don’t spend a dime on it.

So for instance, if there is a 40% chance of rain in your town, it does not mean that 40% will get rain and that 60% will stay dry. It means that in any particular area covered by the percentage, you have a 40% chance of getting rain.

Basically, in the example above, it means that your neighborhood has a 40% chance of rain and your friend’s neighborhood has a 40% chance and their friend’s neighborhood has a 40%.

Since each neighborhood has its own 40% chance, all, some, or none of them could get rain because they all get their own separate “rolls” against the chance. With how probability works, the entire town could get rain or the entire town might not see a drop.",4.0,nfl,t3_vao9l3,False,0.0,:Steelers: Steelers,2022-06-12T12:23:51Z,steelers,0.049376903292181

You are conflating your evaluation of Malik Willis with the Steelers F.O and saying they shouldn't think there's a problem at QB because you don't like Willis as a prospect. You are not an draft scout for the Steelers. Your evaluation seems to be based on his school instead of his traits and tape. 

2. That point is meaningless because you don't know the draft product(it could be worse or guys don't declare), and you don't know where we'll be picking next year. We could **still** be wasting a year TJ/Minkah with no succession plan in place.

3. Giving Mason/Mitch their best chance of success and giving the team their best chance of success are not the same thing. If they think Willis has a higher future upside, and believe they can get him there then you pack Mason's bag. This is a sunk cost fallacy.

28148,190873,190873,TheGrat1,">$19m a year seems like a random number

It is around what Michael Thomas is making and nearly 10% of the salary cap. Considering most teams are going to want a franchise QB to go along with that receiver, and the going rate for them is 40+ million, that is tying up 28%+ of your entire team's cap in two players and that is on the lower end of contracts for elite players at their positions (19 and 40 million respectively) as it stands today. Paying WRs QB money is crappy team building and these teams paying it better hope the cap explodes. We already saw the Cowboys have to trade Amari Cooper for peanuts and his average salary is only 1 million over my threshold.

TL;DR: The WR market is overvalued right now and only an explosion of the salary cap or a wholesale correction like we saw in the RB market will fix that. Until then smart GMs are not going to be caught up in it, even if they have a cheap QB room like the Steelers currently have.

It is also not only that his highs are declining, it is that his lows are increasing. Sacks and INTs increased each year from 2019. The most sacks and picks came in 2021 despite playing fewer games.

Kyler has been improving in the passing game every year. Had his first major injury but also made the playoffs for the first time. Overall the arrow is pointing up.

Lamar though, has been declining in most statistical categories since his mvp season, most importantly wins. Had his first major injury, missed the playoffs for the first time, and his contract extension still has not been settled despite the Ravens supposedly wanting to have it finished for some time now.

You might take a loss the next week against a better team but you always knew your starter was coming back in a week or maybe a couple weeks and could still make the playoffs. The playoffs are one and done so if your top 3 guys on offense are out you probably ain’t gonna win. But Ben always came back and kept us in the running in the regular season.

I do watch the team, and believe me I want both lines to be way better. But the truth is also Ben limited our offense significantly and did make things a bit harder for our O line what with him being a sitting target like he was. 

In spite of all of our flaws we made the playoffs and with a couple of other breaks in the season would have won the division. We have cap space and picks this off-season, what we don’t fix with one we can fix with another. 

I understand people wanting the patient route and to draft both lines this year, but those picks could bust too. If Tuitt and Alu are coming back I’ll be fine with just drafting a body sometime after the 3rd for the D line considering the strides worm and loudermilk made last year. If we use our draft capital on a QB (either draft or a trade) then we for sure will want to bring in at least one extra vet on the o line whilst seeing if Penning/Raimann/Zion Johnson/ whoever else slides all the way into the 2nd. 

This team isn’t perfect but also we have more than enough ammo this off-season to fill those gaps and allow our stars to shine even more. If we come out of this off-season with 3 new starters (one on OL, one ILB and one QB) and two serious depth additions (one in secondary one on DL) then I think we will have improved significantly, set ourselves up for the future AND be able to compete now.

Not saying Malik is gonna take to it like Herbert did but there are definitely some mitigating circumstances in that Liberty offense.

31002,212456,212456,WetalkinboutWillis,"Why do we think Watson’s people would want to spread false rumours about PIT being interested? Watson gains nothing from the trade price being driven up, and I’m sure his agents would know that telling teams like CAR, NO and CLE that we are interested could very likely discourage them from making serious offers (we’re clearly a better situation than most teams on the least). 

What does Watson stand to gain from spreading a false rumour that PIT are interested in him if in reality negotiations/ the bidding war is between say CLE and SEA? 

People like Dulac have been wrong often enough that we can reasonably infer that either his well-placed sources in the Steelers aren’t above using him to put false information out there or that he occasionally tweets/reports from a position of imperfect knowledge. 

I don’t understand the copers in here acting like it will never happen and this is all smoke with no fire.

31003,212457,212457,WetalkinboutWillis,Agreed. The one argument that cannot be made against Watson is that he isn’t worth his money. Relative to other contracts in the league Watson at below 40mil is a BARGAIN.,5.0,steelers,t3_tc1xzh,False,0.0,None,2022-03-11T18:35:30Z,steelers,0.115774074074074
31004,212458,212458,WetalkinboutWillis,"OK so it is “illogical” because of your own subjective opinions. 

Obviously all discussion of trading for him is based on the hypothetical that he isn’t criminally charged by the grand jury so that’s a strawman argument.

As for “assets we don’t really have” we either have them or we don’t, and the price is 3 1st rounders which we absolutely can pay. I want us to draft Malik Willis- and obviously we can’t do that if we trade for Deshaun- but I don’t get why people can’t state their point without resorting to strawmanning and total exaggeration. 

Reasonable people can disagree, it’s far from illogical or any of the other words being thrown around here to trade for one of the best QBs in the league IF he is cleared of criminal charges.

Ben wasn’t great this year, Tuitt was never around but taking up salary cap room and we lost Alu early. TJ missed time and JuJu most of the season and we made the playoffs. Next season even without drafting a QB we likely get about the same level of production from that position or better as well as seeing improvements elsewhere. To get a top ten pick with this roster (plus picks in this draft and some FAs) and coaching staff you’d need to actively, nakedly tank. We’re not going to do that.

He’s obviously a great talent evaluator but he may be an even better person. When I would see him on school visits or at all-star games, he would always take time to talk to the younger guys who looked up to him. That’s what I’ll probably remember most. For all of the success he’s had, there is no ego and he treats everyone the right way!”

Saints GM Mickey Loomis: “I’ve known Kevin for a long time. I’ve served on a number of committees with him, and he’s one of the great general managers that this league’s had. And yet, he’s one of these guys that’s never sought the spotlight, he’s always behind the scenes, obviously he likes it that way. He’s just one of these unsung guys in our league that doesn’t get the accolades he probably deserves. He’s had, what, 15, 16 straight years of winning records, and obviously that’s a tribute to the entire organization, and he leads that football operation and has done a fantastic job. I always appreciate his intelligence, his point of view. He’s one of the guys that people seek out for his opinions, they listen when he speaks, and he’s got a great perspective and an unselfish perspective. … My guess is, I don’t know this, he probably sees himself as a spoke in the wheel and just wants to do the best job he can to help the entire building. … And he’s really been instrumental in a lot of things we do at the combine, the way pro days are run. He’s got a lot of influence on things behind the scenes. He’s never sought credit for any of it. But he deserves credit.”

49ers GM John Lynch: “Kevin Colbert is class personified. Great at his job and is equally great as a guy. He operates with integrity, works his tail off and is excellent in his job. I found it so cool that he worked in league committee meetings at Indy as a co-chair of the GMAC [General Manager Advisory Committee] as if he wasn’t retiring.”

Titans GM Jon Robinson: “Kevin is such a great example for every person in the NFL personnel profession. Hard-working, genuine, competitive, intelligent—all while being accepting of young scouts, helping us along the way. Congrats on an outstanding career and thank you for the lessons in the personnel business. Even when you didn’t know we were watching, we were, just trying to learn how to do it the right way from one of the best!”

Eagles GM Howie Roseman: “When Kevin’s number pops up on your phone or you call Kevin, it’s like, What’s he doing? Always got a story, always got such great perspective, such a great dude, and he’s obviously had tremendous success, winning two world championships. He’s a Hall of Fame GM. No one with more integrity. … The COVID year, during the draft, everyone’s at their house, and we all were on this GM email, because we do this charity thing. I wore a suit and tie the first night of the draft, and nobody else did—like no one else did. And so they were all busting my balls on it. And Kevin calls me, and he’s like, ‘Hey Howie, I was wearing a suit, too, I just didn’t have a first-round pick, so no one saw me!’ He’d traded it for Minkah [Fitzpatrick]. That’s who he was. Great guy. Hall of Fame executive.”

Seahawks GM John Schneider: “I first met Kevin in 1993, as we were both working in pro scouting for rivals—the Packers and the Lions. Kevin was always so, so kind to me, and I considered him, and still do, an older brother. In a highly competitive business, he treated me and everyone so kindly. A man of faith, awesome family man and obviously a great evaluator team builder/evaluator, we all have looked up to Kevin for such a long time. I wish him the best in retirement and can’t wait to continue to pick his brain for information. Kevin, I can’t believe how fast the past 29 years have gone. God bless you and your family. We’ll all miss you dearly.”

Rams GM Les Snead: “When you hear people say, ‘football man,’ Kevin is the gold standard. When you hear people say, ‘good man,’ Kevin is the gold standard. We were watching pro days in our draft meetings this year and Kevin was front and center where he always is on the pro day circuit. I don’t shed a tear often. But seeing Kevin and realizing this is the end of his impactful run, I definitely shed a silent tear.”

I can’t tell you how many times I ran into him, Thursday-night games, Saturdays; I mean, he was always there. He’s a true-blue football evaluator that puts a premium on scouting players. He had a very soft-spoken, humble approach, but the way they built their teams over the number of years he was there speaks not only to him as a person, it speaks to his relationship and rapport with Mike [Tomlin]. We were fortunate to compete against them on a fairly regular basis, and we always knew the type of people and types of players they built that program on. The one thing that they’ve been able to do over the years is maintain their level of success and performance, regardless of the level of player they lose. It speaks to how well they scout players, how well they evaluate players, what they look for in players. And really that starts at the top with Kevin and Mike, and just the mutual respect they had for each other was apparent, in the spring especially. They were together so often at pro days, so they were working in tandem, in unison. And I think that’s why they’ve had as much success as they’ve had, because they view things through a similar lens. … At pro days, he would record everything, he would time everything. He would time 10s, he would time 20s, he’d be right in the mix gathering information when the scouts get together in the middle. He was always willing to listen and help.”

I hate that he’s made our job in Baltimore so difficult over the years, but I have great admiration for his career.”

Jets GM Joe Douglas: “Everyone respects and loves Kevin; it doesn’t matter what team you’re with. The coolest thing about the Ravens-Steelers rivalry is that it’s twice, and sometimes three times a year, where you want to just destroy each other. But after that, there’s just so much respect. I know just sitting in those draft rooms in Baltimore and we’re talking about, Who are the guys that are gonna rise to the challenge in Heinz Field when Renegade is blaring in the fourth quarter and all those fricking yellow towels are waving in the stands? Who’s going to rise to the occasion and who’s going to melt? Those conversations ultimately made Baltimore better. That’s the culture that the Steelers have built and Kevin’s put together. … He’s a special guy, salt of the earth, consistent. He’s just a good person, and he’d give you a shirt off his back. You always respect him because he puts the work in. He’s at the school sitting next to you. He’s got time for you, whether you’re a director of college scouting or you’re a personnel assistant. … He’s just an awesome, awesome person.”

He’s got just such a good presence about him. He’s so approachable. He’s a lot like Ted Thompson. Everybody respects him. You can’t find anyone to say a bad word about him. Just an unbelievable person. … The first time I met him, I think it was the Whistle Stop at the combine, like 20 years ago. I think he was with the Lions at the time.

Since returning to his hometown as director of football operations in 2000, to replace Tom Donahoe, Pittsburgh has gone 226-143-3. The Steelers have won the consistently tough AFC North in 10 of Colbert’s 22 years, with six trips to the conference title game, three AFC championships and two Super Bowl titles. And taking over a team coming off consecutive losing seasons, he’s had just one sub-.500 season since (way back in ’03).

Now, here’s where you’d usually get the stock line … As good a football executive as he is, he’s an even better dude. In this case, it’s not lip service. I can tell you from my own dealings with Colbert that it’s true, and that fact can be backed up with what just about anyone in the NFL will tell you about him.Wanna see? Well, on Saturday, I shot texts out to peers across the NFL to ask for their own tributes, mostly because I thought he’d enjoy reading them. Happy retirement, Kevin.”

Colts GM Chris Ballard: “Kevin is one of the real special men in this league. His contributions to the Steelers’ organization and to the game of football have been truly special. I have such great respect for him not only as one of the best general managers in NFL history but also as a man. Anytime I needed advice or guidance, he was there to help, and I feel very fortunate to consider Kevin a friend. If you look at the entirety of his career, I don’t think there is any question that he should be enshrined in the Hall of Fame. Kevin is so humble he won’t agree with this, but he has done the job as good as anyone who has ever sat in the GM chair.”

Bills GM Brandon Beane: “Kevin is the most humble, hardworking GM that you could ask for. All the success and the steadiness of that organization, Kevin is the foundation of it. Sometimes when guys have success, you see maybe they don’t grind as hard, maybe they didn’t go in the weeds as much—like, I’ve got it figured out. Kevin, all the way through the end, was still grinding his way through the fall. And he doesn’t just go to the big schools; he’s out on Tuesday night at MAC games. First of all, he loves it. Second of all, there are people who enjoy parts of this process, but there are hard parts, and Kevin, whenever I saw him, his work level never slowed down. … I’ve gotten to know Kevin well because we’re one of the teams in BLESTO, as well, so we have meetings together—in May, we go, and we’re hanging out, and you get to know people even better. And he led that group, he’s been a senior statesman, and BLESTO at times looked like it was gonna fold just because some teams were going independent or to NFS, and if Kevin wasn’t leading that, I’m not sure BLESTO wouldn’t have folded.”",47.0,steelers,t3_ugvklo,False,0.0,:sb::b9::b2::sb: DEEBO,2022-05-02T13:00:00Z,steelers,0.0077708675574173

He’s got just such a good presence about him. He’s so approachable. He’s a lot like Ted Thompson. Everybody respects him. You can’t find anyone to say a bad word about him. Just an unbelievable person. … The first time I met him, I think it was the Whistle Stop at the combine, like 20 years ago. I think he was with the Lions at the time. And I can say he’s the same guy now as he was 20 years ago, the first time I met with him. … He hasn’t changed a bit. Just an unbelievable person.",1.0,steelers,t3_ugvasq,False,0.0,:sb::b9::b2::sb: DEEBO,2022-05-02T12:52:37Z,steelers,0.0044955559968505
41259,291718,291718,meganutsdeathpunch,"“Usually, this is a quick sign-off spot for the column—but you’ll have to excuse me here, because I’m going to let this one breathe a bit and finish up our postdraft piece by honoring Steelers GM Kevin Colbert, who just finished up his 23rd and final draft in Pittsburgh.
Colbert’s record speaks for itself. Since returning to his hometown as director of football operations in 2000, to replace Tom Donahoe, Pittsburgh has gone 226-143-3. The Steelers have won the consistently tough AFC North in 10 of Colbert’s 22 years, with six trips to the conference title game, three AFC championships and two Super Bowl titles. And taking over a team coming off consecutive losing seasons, he’s had just one sub-.500 season since (way back in ’03).

Now, here’s where you’d usually get the stock line … As good a football executive as he is, he’s an even better dude. In this case, it’s not lip service. I can tell you from my own dealings with Colbert that it’s true, and that fact can be backed up with what just about anyone in the NFL will tell you about him.
Wanna see? Well, on Saturday, I shot texts out to peers across the NFL to ask for their own tributes, mostly because I thought he’d enjoy reading them. Happy retirement, Kevin.”


Colts GM Chris Ballard: “Kevin is one of the real special men in this league. His contributions to the Steelers’ organization and to the game of football have been truly special. I have such great respect for him not only as one of the best general managers in NFL history but also as a man. Anytime I needed advice or guidance, he was there to help, and I feel very fortunate to consider Kevin a friend. If you look at the entirety of his career, I don’t think there is any question that he should be enshrined in the Hall of Fame. Kevin is so humble he won’t agree with this, but he has done the job as good as anyone who has ever sat in the GM chair.”


Bills GM Brandon Beane: “Kevin is the most humble, hardworking GM that you could ask for. All the success and the steadiness of that organization, Kevin is the foundation of it. Sometimes when guys have success, you see maybe they don’t grind as hard, maybe they didn’t go in the weeds as much—like, I’ve got it figured out. Kevin, all the way through the end, was still grinding his way through the fall. And he doesn’t just go to the big schools; he’s out on Tuesday night at MAC games. First of all, he loves it. Second of all, there are people who enjoy parts of this process, but there are hard parts, and Kevin, whenever I saw him, his work level never slowed down. … I’ve gotten to know Kevin well because we’re one of the teams in BLESTO, as well, so we have meetings together—in May, we go, and we’re hanging out, and you get to know people even better. And he led that group, he’s been a senior statesman, and BLESTO at times looked like it was gonna fold just because some teams were going independent or to NFS, and if Kevin wasn’t leading that, I’m not sure BLESTO wouldn’t have folded.”",1.0,steelers,t3_ugvasq,False,0.0,:sb::b9::b2::sb: DEEBO,2022-05-02T12:51:55Z,steelers,0.0070062956294232

Green, I would argue, has preformed at the same level as Leatherwood. The Steelers and Raiders are almost entirely different in terms of the way their teams are run. The Steelers don’t make changes a lot and opt to stick with the process, which has been an advantage and a downfall on multiple occasions. The Raiders aren’t that way. The Raiders can also clearly afford to get rid of Leatherwood, while we can’t. 

And for what feels like the 70th time, i wasn’t stating my opinion on who should be cut and who shouldn’t. I was just saying Green shouldn’t be held at the same level, when one has preformed DRASTICALLY worse then the other.

The Steelers are the one team that have truly and consistently figured out Lamar. [“Lamar Jackson has a passer rating of 66.7 with 622 yards,  4 touchdowns and 6 interceptions in 3 games starting versus the Steelers in his career.”](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/starter-lamar-jackson-win-loss-record-against-steelers-when-starting)

The one win he does have was when we were without Ben and starting either Duck Hodges or Mason Rudolph. And even in that game he threw 1 TD to 3 Picks (and this was during his MVP season I might add), and to finish it off he has never had a passer rating above 70. We also consistently are able to sack him far more then most NFL Teams. 

Now onto the notion that Ben carried the Steelers. First off we have the obvious example of the 2019 season, where he carried a depleted roster to 8-8 without Ben. With Duck Hodges, a random undrafted guy, and Mason Rudolph, an undeveloped third rounder who really wasnt good. Second is the fact that [Tomlin is 18-15-1 without Ben as the starter](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-march-31-x8205). This is far better then the Packers, who have [a 6-12-1 record without Rodgers since 2008 when he became starter](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/packers-record-without-aaron-rodgers-since-2008), and the [Falcons who have an 0-3 record since 2008 without Ryan](https://www.statmuse.com/nfl/ask/falcons-record-without-matt-ryan-since-2008). 

So, in conclusion, the Steelers for the most part have Lamar’s number barring a drastic change, and Ben and Tomlin equally made each other. You need an equal balance of both to truly make a run, which is why we see 6-10 team turn sometimes turn around with a coaching change, and why we don’t see Belichek dominating teams like he used to without the core he once had. 

With all of that being said, I understand why you said what you said lol.

But I also think Tomlin and Colbert were spoiled to some extent by the fact that Mike Munchak seemed to have a gift for turning no-names into solid players and even pro bowlers in some cases (Villanueva, Foster, Hubbard, Feiler, Finney, etc).

I would've done WHATEVER it took to get Munchak back. Obviously if he doesn't wanna be here then they can't. If he wasn't interested though, then go find someone that's proven something in this league before. Doug Morrone was a name thrown around that intrigued me.

After that? Invest in the damn unit! 

What should they have done? Something!

**2021 Free Agency**

Free agency was totally jacked up in the off-season before last. The covid year really screwed them with the cap so I give them a pass for not doing much there. Seeing **Matt Feiler** walk did hurt though. I personally would've taken the $ given to JuJu and seen if that would be enough to keep Feiler here.

I know this is when my argument is going to start to lose some people because they love the guys we go. I do too. But I still hate a RB in round 1, ESPECIALLY when your OL totally sucks. 

**2021 Draft**

Hindsight is often 20/20 but I was ALL-IN on **Creed Humphrey**. So much that I wanted him at pick 24. He was there in the 2nd and obviously was a homerun for KC but I'd have been pumped to grab him in the 1st round. They could've thrown out probably a pick like a 4th to move up a few spots for Darrisaw too. Or, I also would've loved a move down and taken **Teven Jenkins** to add some nasty to the unit.

I'm good with the value they got in Friermuth in the 2nd. **Quinn Meinerz** was another guy I liked that was sitting there in the 3rd but I can't really argue one OL for another. I wasn't a big fan of Moore but it was a deep tackle class so he was an ok swing in the 4th round. It just felt like this team needed premium talent to plug in NOW, not projects that you can sit behind a vet. Moore and Green weren't ready at all. 

**2022 Free Agency**

THIS is where the team could've really made a move. Especially if they knew they were taking a QB early. Ben is off the books. So many Yinzers still haven't fully grasped how HUGE that is when it comes to roster building. Armstead and Scherff aren't their style.. but they could've made a move there if they wanted to. 

I loved the Daniels signing. So far it hasn't worked out. Hopefully he turns it around. **Morgan Moses** was a guy I liked over Chuks. He's older but I think a vet presence in the room would have been nice. He's also a better run blocker. If we're going to be a run-first team (and you better be after spending a 1st on Najee) then I think a guy like Moses makes more sense. There were rumors about **Ryan Jensen** being available. I'm not sure if those were ever true but he would've been a great signing for the same reasons as Moses (and with more upside).

**2022 Draft**

This is where I had to just accept what they thought. I wasn't (and still am not) convinced that Kenny Pickett is a good enough QB that you can win a Superbowl with. I'm just not sure he's physically gifted enough. 

I wanted them to give Mitch a year. Improve the trenches. And try to model yourself after what the Titans have done recently behind Derrick Henry. If they LOVED Kenny though, and thought he's the MAN then I can't argue with taking a swing that late in the round. But, if that's the way they knew they were going then why not be more aggressive in free agency??

Personally, I'd have taken **Tyler Smith** or **Tyler Linderbaum** at that spot. I know hindsight is 20/20 but you KNOW you all would've lost your collective minds if the team had come away with Linderbaum/Pickens/Willis in the first 3 rounds. I personally would've wanted Smith/Travis Jones/Willis.

We can agree to disagree. I know lots of people love Najee, Pat, Kenny, and Pickens.. I do too.

I had a football I was getting signed by mostly smaller-name guys because if you went for Ben, Hines, or Troy you’d miss out on everyone else and probably end up with nothing. 

I spot **Mean Joe Greene** in the center of the field (who I think was with the scouting dept at the time) making his way towards the fence at the far side of the field.

I BOOK IT around this field to try and get in line where he’s heading and I just happen to be wearing HIS #75 jersey!!

I was so pumped. I’ve never been big on autographs but I was daydreaming of framing it already. I am out of breath but get there relatively close because I don’t think many people realized he had made his way over. He’s going down the line signing things people are holding out and I take the jersey off and drape it over the fence grinning ear to ear. 

He finally get 1 person away. Signs their item. Without even looking up growls “NO” and walks past and signs the person’s item after me and keeps moving down the line. I didn’t know what to say or so. I was stunned and confused with my mouth pretty much hanging open.

He's more experienced.

Ridder's biggest flaw in my mind is his accuracy (which Willis also struggles with) but when you watch him sail passes it's usually because his feet are a mess. That, in my opinion, can be fixed with good coaching. And if he does? We've got a guy that checks A LOT of boxes.

I dunno. The guy's career earnings are somewhere around 45 million. I wish I could have things ""not pan out"" and have that in my bank account.

I agree he wasn't the villain he was made out to be. But I also disagree that he made some monumental mistake. He made practically nothing on his rookie deal in Pittsburgh, had a TON of wear and tear on his body from his time in Pittsburgh, and he was doing everything he could to cash in when he got the chance. I would too!

Part of that was the Steelers bristling at guaranteed money beyond the first year. What if LeVeon blew out his knee in year 1 of his new deal in Pittsburgh? 

His play dropped off for sure. But the Steelers' OL also QUICKLY fell apart not long after he left. I'm not sure he would've continued playing at a pro bowl level in Pittsburgh either.

Maybe he regrets how things went down but Steelers fans like to dunk on LeVeon because he was no longer a stud RB in Pittsburgh but I think they assume he'd want that just because THEY'RE Steelers fans.

I believe particularly, in *September football*, people make a commitment to stopping the run. It's easier to make that commitment in September when everybody feels good and you have all the horses in the stable. I think over the course of the long haul, you see who's good at it week in and week out. It's usually tough sledding early in the football season, and that's been my experience. That was my intent when I was a defensive play caller. In order to be a good defense, it starts there; making people somewhat one-dimensional, making people struggle if they're running the football.

45939,332777,332777,terrybradshawsballs,"22. Pittsburgh Steelers  
Biggest strength: It's hard to find many better duos along the defensive front than T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward. Over the past three seasons, both Watt and Heyward rank among the top three players at their respective positions in both quarterback pressures and run stops. Their ability to make impact plays regardless of the situation is at the center of Pittsburgh's defensive success over that three-year stretch.  

Biggest weakness: The Steelers' offensive line has deteriorated from a unit that five-plus years ago was one of the best in the league under offensive line coach Mike Munchak. Now it profiles closer to the bottom of the league. This group was aided in pass protection by Ben Roethlisberger's 2.2-second average time to throw over the past two seasons (fastest in the NFL), making how it fares in what should be a different-looking 2022 offense something worth monitoring.  

X factor for 2022: The two-year, $8 million contract Ahkello Witherspoon signed to remain in Pittsburgh this offseason doesn't scream No. 1 outside cornerback, but that's what the Steelers are counting on him to be when looking at the rest of their roster. From Week 13 through the end of the season, Witherspoon allowed a passer rating of just 20.2 on throws into his coverage. His play has been hot and cold throughout his five-year career, but the Steelers will be hoping he carries over that momentum into 2022.",2.0,steelers,t3_vnitvh,False,0.0,:sh::h3::h2::sh: Harris,2022-06-29T11:10:03Z,steelers,0.0599936405749399
