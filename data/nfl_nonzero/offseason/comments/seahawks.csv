We immediately stopped and went to get him. There he was, laying down face first on the road with his ass still hanging out. He ended up being fine but needed a LOT of stitches.

4135,35325,35325,Caulibflower,"Nah, I don't think you can separate the two; landing a painful hit and refusing to give up an inch are both hard-wired into defensive players since Pop Warner. And literally every inch can be significant in football. So long as Carson's momentum was carrying him forward, *any* defensive player's mindset is going to be 'I need to put him into the turf ASAP - and if I can, I'm going to make it hurt.' Like, if you're saying you don't like the 'cultural' aspect of the latter... not trying to be antagonistic by asking, but are you sure you like football? A major, major aspect of the game is draining the will of your opponent by causing pain. It's *absolutely* a psychological thing, and again - is absolutely a psychological thing that's hard-wired into defensive players from the earliest stages of play and coaching. I guarantee you *Carson Wentz* knows that as well as anyone.

You can't expect defensive players to hold back *in a playoff game* if they're *not sure* a hit is going to definitively limit a gain. That's nearly as ridiculous as the other poster below claiming that a player *diving forward* is the same as *giving yourself up* \- as though a QB who's diving forward for additional yards should simply be allowed to do so! There's a reason that QBs are protected when they're sliding but not when they're diving (and that the ball is spotted from the beginning of the slide and not the end - everyone knows that the inches *matter).* 

You've been reasonable in your replies even if I don't entirely agree with the sentiment, but there's a real undercurrent of QB protectionism around this particular play which is really hard to square with the fundamentals of the game. When the QB is running with the ball and trying to gain yards - as Carson Wentz very much was - then he's just a football player playing football. Defensive players are going to try their best to knock the shit out of him, and that's what happened. It's unfortunate he got hurt, but that's how the game is meant to be played.",1.0,nfl,t3_vfxc45,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-06-21T03:55:57Z,seahawks,0.0027387243490494
4136,35326,35326,Caulibflower,"yeah, I don't feel like this actually contradicts anything I said (not sure if it was meant to, but the up/downvote split suggests that people read it that way). I'm not trying to argue that there 'wasn't anything dangerous' about the play, but players suffer catastrophic injuries on routine plays all the time - it's a violent, dangerous game (I know this ought to go without saying).

Basically, I think the *only reason* that people even remember this hit is that Carson got hurt on the play. If Carson popped back up and ran right back to the huddle, everyone just goes: ""YEAH! THAT'S PLAYOFF FOOTBALL, BABY!"" and it doesn't become a core memory for Eagles fans. But it really doesn't take much to cause a concussion. Just think back to Donald Parham's scary one last year - looked like a normal play, didn't even contact another player, just landed weird. We can't even know if Wentz was concussed by Clowney's helmet or when he kind of bounced off the ground.

It's actually a case where I think [the refs' subsequent explanation is truly straightforward](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/seattle-seahawks/nfl-referee-explains-why-jadeveon-clowney-wasnt-flagged-hit-carson-wentz):

""He (Wentz) was a runner and he did not give himself up,"" Smith said via pool reporter Zach Berman. ""We saw incidental contact, and in ourjudgment, we didn't rule that to be a foul.""

Crucially, Wentz *didn't give himself up*, and the refs ruled the helmet to helmet contact incidental (which is at least plausible - and as you note, *we can't know what Clowney was thinking -* the video is pretty ambiguous). Whether that's truly the case is hard to know, but again, that's almost the point (and, I think, similar to the other point you're making); defensive players aren't trying to tackle anyone *gently,* and Wentz was still a live runner. It's unfortunate that he got injured and I totally understand the frustration from Philadelphia (or anyone else who wanted the Seahawks to lose).",1.0,nfl,t3_vfxc45,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-06-20T04:46:36Z,seahawks,-0.0601130659842938

Or ""hit him differently?"" - at full speed and with limited options? It always looked to me like Clowney was trying to put his shoulder into Wentz' upper back and drive him into the ground so that he couldn't extend for more yardage. Until Wentz is actually \*down,\* he can reach the ball out for another yard. Clowney tags him in the back to put him down faster and close that opportunity.

6985,55202,55202,DiamondDash2k,"In case people hate reading images:

***Top needs: QB, OT, DE***  
*Seattle had three picks in the entire 2021 draft. This year? It entered Round 1 with three in the top 41, thanks to the trade of Russell Wilson. I always struggle with what the Seahawks are thinking; they stick to their board and don't worry about a leaguewide consensus. That's why it was good to see coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider also saw their hole at left tackle and went that way at No. 9.*

*Charles Cross is the best pass-protecting tackle in this class, an easy mover with great fit and long arms. (And this is a rare Seattle mock draft pick that I nailed, even if it was from March.) He'll replace Duane Brown immediately. Say what you want about moving on from Wilson, but at least the Seahawks got a lot of capital in the deal, and they now have a left tackle who can be there for 10-plus years.*

*On Day 2, I thought there was a prime opportunity for the Seahawks to take quarterback Malik Willis and develop him into a future star. They ended up passing three times on Willis, which I suppose means they're OK with Drew Lock and Geno Smith being just average in 2022. Carroll and Schneider must think the roster is farther along than I do.*

*As for whom they got on Day 2, I like the players, even if it's not what I would do. Kenneth Walker II (41) is a bowling ball of a running back, and he is going to play in an offense that values those kinds of players. Boye Mafe (40) has some raw pass-rush traits off the edge. Abraham Lucas (72) might be a rookie starter at right tackle, which is rare for a third-round pick.*

*On Day 3, the Seahawks doubled up with cornerbacks Coby Bryant (109) and Tariq Woolen (153), who in particular fits what Carroll likes in his defensive backs. Woolen is 6-foot-4 with a huge wingspan, and he ran a 4.26-second 40-yard dash at the combine. The former college receiver is just very raw. Wide receiver Bo Melton (229) has some speed that makes him a potential seventh-round find.*

*There are several good prospects in this class, but it's not quite an A because the quarterback issue could linger into 2023.*",65.0,seahawks,t3_uhn2j5,False,0.0,:sea1:​,2022-05-03T13:58:34Z,seahawks,0.0007025096200859

Whoever trades for him is on the hook for:

If we were to trade for him I imagine we'd restructure his 2022 contract to make whatever room need for other signings. If you drop it down to $14m in 2022 then it becomes $44m/$39m/$39m for the final three, which is essentially the mid tier going rate for a QB nowadays. Whatever happens the contract is as manageable as any for a QB not on a rookie deal.

Since he comes with 4 years of control on a reasonable contract I would expect his price to be above Wilson's. $32m in 2024 and 2025 is going to be a steal once we get there. The other side of this though is that Watson has shown that he's perfectly capable of refusing to play so playing on a reasonable contract might not be something he's willing to do.

There was a real sense that the winner of this game would be in the driver's seat for a wildcard appearance, while the loser would have an uphill battle to make the playoffs. We had not yet been on a run of dominating the 49er's - up until this point they had been a frightening opponent and this felt like the game that would show who us who both teams truly were. And we absolutely dominated them.  


After winning this game, the Seahawks went on to win out their remaining games, holding all three division rivals to single digit scores. We stole the division from the Cardinals, and beat the Packers in a miraculous comeback on route to a second straight super bowl appearance.  


For the 49er's, this was the exact moment of their collapse. They lost 4 of their remaining 5 games, finishing 8-8. Coach Jim Harbaugh was fired at the end of the season, and a mass exodus of players drained the team of talent. The 49ers would not have another winning season until 2019.

It's insiders jobs to be first to report news worthy tweets and headlines. There's a very real possibility he caught wind of the deal, inquired with Penny/his agent on the details to report on and got information about the other offers. 

There's also a reason Ian or any other insider won't report the alleged offers. Those offers are trusted private information that front offices don't want available to everyone.

I'm really liking their adjustment to the modern NFL. Everyone is going to complain about running the ball but they fail to realize that's the very foundation of the Shanahan/Mcvay schemes. With a good run game, and good usage of play action then it should take a ton of pressure off of whoever is at QB.

To put in the almost the laziest terms possible; Solari is all about power and overwhelming your opponent, Waldron/Dickerson is all about angles and creating lanes. 

We currently run zone under Waldron. Last year was weird cause we had Solari but clearly wanted to transition from his scheme. You could see it happening at the end of last year, players have been on record saying that is when Dickerson really started to take hold of the offense. Pocic went as far as crediting Dickerson for the success of Penny late in the season. 

Solari relies on the Chris Carsons of the game (power backs) where they get north and south, hit A or B gap, lower there shoulders and chunk off plays. To me that's not the player Homer is. He can certainly do that and clearly enjoys contact but he's a speedy outside zone kind of back that makes the first guy miss and then creates with the lanes given to him instead of a ""It's you and me in the box, let's see who wins"" kinda guy.",27.0,seahawks,t3_uqig94,False,0.0,:lockett2:,2022-05-15T22:34:28Z,seahawks,0.0888101514317799

With no backup plan if Penny and/or Carson go down, Pete would be forced to sign a FA off the street or trade for one within the window.

They can be inside or out depending the alignment of the outside LB/EDGE defender and need to be solid in their base as a run defender as well as have an adequate pass rush ability when needed. With Green gone, we really only have Collier and perhaps Shelby and Poona at those spots. A guy like Robinson could move inside depending on what weight they have him play at this year.

Ultimately it was to disguise their coverages better since in a 3-4 it's easier to show the same package and subpackages with light DE/LB who are harder to predict whether they're rushing or dropping back but it back fired because the guys we had dropping back were polar opposites of what that role needed so offenses could count on them either rushing or being a liability in coverage.

He's mobile like Russ and real ra-ra kind of leader like Russ but has no where near the accuracy, touch or zip. I also worry about his size, he's not thicc like Russ and as a mobile QB who has frequent designed runs, he's gonna end up getting hit a lot. He's got a killer arm and if he can find a way to be more accurate he might be able to step up to the next level but accuracy seems more like an innate QB trait. Like Teddy Bradshaw said, ""It's the kid in the neighborhood that could hit the stop sign with the snowball everytime"". I'm afraid he might be stuck in kind of a tweener QB mold; not an elite runner like Lamar and doesn't have an elite arm like Rodgers, Mahomes, etc but is pretty good at both. In the NFL you at least need one or the other. As you alluded to as well, Liberty used a TON of designed runs for Malik and he rarely stepped up in the pocket to deliver passes to his receivers.

I want him to be on the roster because he's a demon. A machine. I don't like his outbursts, especially the ones that cost the team. He was drafted for one thing: to Beat Jalen Ramsey.

The draft haul should be similar to Hill.

I'm not happy about the trade, but I understand it. People who think Russ will play into his 40s are wrong, which makes the Broncos window to win with him tight.

2022 is clearly a rebuilding year so the cap hit isn't a big deal. It looks a lot better in 2023. The Adams trade isn't something I'm thrilled about, but if you look at what the picks turned into it brings it into perspective a bit. Also, yes he had a down year last year but he's been an all-pro caliber player throughout his career, not impossible he returns to form.

Lastly, regarding drafting that is fair for a good amount of our drafts in the past. There is a sense of optimism with this year's class. It's too early to tell but it's been pretty widely accepted as one of the league's stronger draft classes this year. Reports out of camp have been more positive than usual for a rookie class in Seattle.

OL: Sure they are two rookie tackles, but I think you are completely discrediting the starting unit. I agree, before preseason I would have said F, but you have to give some credit to their performance, I think a C is reasonable overall, could go way worse or better though. But I am expecting this line to be much better than you are. I felt Cross and Lucas were absolutely bulldozing, which is what you’d expect from an above average starter in the regular season to do against scrubs… regardless you are right theyre rookies so we will see some games like game 2 where Cross was STRUGGLING. I think the interior is far better than the credit you are giving as well. Lewis is a promising guard playing LG for the first time in his career. I think Jackson loses his position to Curhan at some point during the season potentially.

CB: I dont think artie burns is your starting corner… so starting off poorly there IMO. I can easily see Woolen and Bryant starting, but more likely one of them do. I think they outperform expectations by a bit.

My point being, Geno can’t make the tight-window throws. He can’t hit the contested downfield strikes. Not only that but no fans really want to see him start. He isn’t very professional - often tweeting his displeasure at a decision that doesn’t go positively regarding his status with whatever team he’s currently employed with (including the Seahawks.)

25745,202040,202040,Wolc0tt,"I’ve been mulling this whole thing over all day. The trade is decent. It really is. I don’t love the players we got in return (lock is a backup, Shelby is 30, fant is a year away from a big contract as a former first rounder). I would have thought we would have gotten 3 total first round picks and that one of Chubb, Surtain, or Jeudy would have needed to be involved. That being said. I think the big point we are all desperately trying to avoid is that Russ didn’t want to be here any longer. He made statements two years ago that started all of this drama and while he back-peddled those statements, at no point did he ever say, “I don’t want to be traded, I want to spend my entire career here, I will decline any trade through my trade clause.” He danced around questions, and so did Pete and so did John. Last week Pete said (paraphrasing), “we have no intention at this time to trade Russell Wilson.” Well, intentions change and wording was very specific from all parties. At the end of the day, I truly believe Russ wanted to leave and if that’s true, I am at least glad that we got a return for him, rather than see him walk after his contract is up. Oh, he also reportedly wants “Mahomes money” on his next contract.

The last thing I’ll say on this matter is that I think everyone in the FO knew exactly what was going to happen. As someone who got into football, became a Seahawks fan because of Russell Wilson, I can’t help but feeling let down by the media antics of the last few weeks and last offseason. It sucks to see my favorite seahawk of all time dance around questions and pretend like he wanted to be here. Say what you mean and want.

But, McLaurin is due for a new contract soon, and Chase is only a couple years away. Let alone, we have to pay Diggs, DK, a LT, and possibly CB. We also just paid Lockett a lot of money. The three first round picks are great but they are a shot in the dark. There’s no guarantee one of those picks translates into a franchise QB. And worst case scenario, if one of those picks doesn’t work out at QB, then we payed a bunch of guys a ton of money to lose because we have a QB who can’t win. I’m not saying I’m a worst case scenario kind of guy, maybe it would work out but I just think we’re better off keeping Russ than go through the hassle and stress of trading him and hoping the rest of our pieces fall into place.

Also, they picked up one of the top 2 RB's in the draft, some say the better of the two, in a position that is ACTUALLY needed, despite what media and pundits were expecting. Chris Carson is a sneeze away from paralysis, and Rashaad Penny has yet to stay healthy and play for an entire 16+ game season. Having the most elusive, highest yards after contact RB, in addition to an improved O-line to take pressure off the fill-in QB in Lock or Smith will be doing wonders.

The WR's they took in the 7th round have some incredible promise compared to other early round WR picks (come @ me in 1 year about how Bo Melton pans out)

29973,249167,249167,gavincantdraw,"So let me combine what Toad and I have said and break in down in the simplest summary.

The more a team loses in a season, the higher their  draft pick. When the Seahawks traded Wilson, they received several picks and players. One of those picks is Denver's first round pick in the 2023 draft. Thus the Seahawks have 2 first round picks (their own and Denver's).

If either of these teams does badly, the Seahawks will have a high first round pick, which they could use on a QB.

Not many people believe Lock or Geno is a long term solution. So the argument becomes should the Seahawks tank (intentionally lose games) to guarantee a high pick for drafting Young or Stroud.

Now it is still possible for Seattle to win games and get one of the highly coveted QB's. There are two scenarios:

29991,249188,249188,gavincantdraw,"Hawks fan in TN. Was watching the game last night, and I disagree. He wasn't awful, but he wasn't special. There's a three plays that stand out to me:

***6:45 in the first, 1st and 10***  
*Willis drops back and faces pressure. DT Michael Pierce barrels towards Willis and Willis avoids the sack (yay!). With Pierce turning around, Willis has a chance to step up in the pocket and deliver a throw. He instead takes off (boo).*  
This is one of the big concerns in drafting Willis. He had such a bad line at Liberty that he developed a habit of scrambling early. Admittedly I don't have All-22 access to see if everyone is covered, but I suspect there would be someone given the Ravens' blitz heavy scheme. This is something he can learn and improve though.

***5:35 in the first, 3rd and 5***  
*Willis drops back and pressure comes hard and fast. TE Chigoziem Okonkwo is running an in route with an LB trailing him. Okonkwo has his man beat pretty early. With better anticipation,  Willis would have hit him and had the first down. Instead, he takes off. It should be noted that it is about 3 seconds when Willis splits. That's not an unreasonable amount of time for an NFL QB to make a read.*  
This one is a little less forgivable because it is right in front of him. It's a throw that will take some power, but that's one of Willis' strengths. This may just be a speed of game thing that he has to figure out.

***14:26 in the second, 2nd and goal***  
*Willis once again faces pressure right off the bat. Six men coming with a spy in the middle of the field, and best I can see, the few defenders who have dropped back are covering tight enough to deter any reasonable pass attempt. Willis is dead to rights. He spins against the direction of the play and runs towards the sideline. The defenders ease up a little expecting him to step out and he instead bounces inside and powers towards the endzone.*  
This was a vintage Russ scramble. Play is dead. Throw it away. Live to fight another down. Willis just decides he wants a touch down and makes it happen. However Hawks fans can also identify the risk that is involved in that.

While Willis' first preseason game was not special, in my opinion, he does have promise and as a third round flyer, looks like a good decision by Tennessee. My concern is that there are dozens of rookies who have come in and just can't adjust to the speed of the game, instead panicking and forcing bad throws or scrambling unnecessarily. If he learns, though, I think the special things will pop for me.",3.0,seahawks,t3_wm9raj,False,0.0,None,2022-08-12T12:29:12Z,seahawks,0.0108854340611633

1. If the article is simple fact, then Lock and Smith are both bad options to start. Cam in his prime was an unstoppable force who could elevate a team. Regardless how you felt about him, you could not deny that his highlights were just insane athletic skills that you may only see once in a lifetime. But that's an unfortunately bygone era and he's not a viable option to start at an elite (or even serviceable) capacity.
2. The two teams who were talking to the Browns about Mayfield are now looking at a different quarterback? If this is just ""leaks,"" then they may be pressuring Cleveland to take on Mayfield's salary so the team at least gets a late pick in return.
3. This is one that's complicated, but hang in there. Carolina and Seattle both have interest in Mayfield. Carolina then showed interest in Newton. This prompted Seattle to ""leak"" that they too are interested in Newton to pressure Carolina into signing Newton sooner rather than later.

In fact, I would love to learn that I'm wrong and that this was actually a brilliant move. So instead of being dour about about it all, I'm going to get excited about the new Hawks. Because I can almost guarantee you one of those rookies impressed PCJS, and that was the only reason they were willing to trade. I know that this QB class is supposed to be a weak one, but if drafting QB's (or any position for that matter) was a science, then there wouldn't be arguments about Trevor Lawrence being good or not, Mahomes would be in Cleveland, Herbert in Miami (if not Cincy), and the Hawks never would have had a chance at drafting Russ in 2012.

So, it sucks, but I'm going to be optimistic. If this trade results in the Seahawks getting [the guy who took time out of his Combine schedule to help a homeless individual](https://twitter.com/rlacey23/status/1499432347208400901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499432347208400901%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.upworthy.com%2Fmalik-willis-video-clothes-homeless-person),\* then I will be happy to root for the new QB.

Our run blocking was also pretty mediocre due to talent issues at the offensive line. Finally our RB room hasnt been considered healthy since Marshawn left, and we rarely adapted to that challenge.

That big issue I have right now is with how much the starting offensive line has played in the pre-season.

Geno doesn't seem to put great touch on his passes, to my admittedly untrained eyes they look a bit hot. I totally agree the WR talent hasn't been there in the preseason, and that's a problem, but Noah Fant, Swain, Homer, and Colby have all shown they can catch stuff before so it's not all on the receivers. This isn't just Geno either, Lock was firing lasers towards the end of the Steelers game, and Eason came out a bit Shakey with some hot balls too. Oddly Eason kept hopping back and forth between ugly duck moon balls and lasers and nothing in between. 

The reason everyone is calling him boring is because he won't take any risks and try to push the ball. Sure playing it safe can be a great trait, but this team right now is struggling to move the ball on offense and convert 3rd downs when Geno is in the game and it needs a QB to take a few risks and make plays happen. This is the NFL not highschool, waiting for other teams to make a mistake before you are willing to make a throw means you are going to be doing a whole lot more punting than scoring. The biggest problem here is that Lock and Eason have both came in trying to win us games in situations where the offense wasnt converting. For them to prove themselves they were forced to make the offense go. While for geno to prove himself it seems more about just not messing up, with little regard for if the offense could move the ball.

Finally I do think the WR play and available players has been a massive issue for the hawks this preseason. You can't truly evaluate any of these guys if they don't have anyone to pass to. I know Goodwin, Swain, Eskridge and a few other guys have been hurt, and it's likely not worth the risk to play lockett, but man we haven't even seen targets for the likely WR 1-5.

This isn't inherently bad, but it's insane considering we have Lockett and DK. Our season is squarely mediocre with Geno under center, he won't ever go down the field and win us close games, but we will manage a few victories if the defense and run game play to their potential.

Drew on the other hand represents hope for a season will more deep balls, more action, and the idea that a QB could win us a few close ones. To me he represents the hope that we could find a diamond in the rough and get lucky enough to not have to trade both of next year's firsts for a lottery ticket on Stroud or Young. Imagine if Drew could grow into a serviceable NFL QB with a powerful arm, and allow us to spend those two firsts on filling more gaps in this roster next season. That would be huge. It's why I wanted to take the risk on a rookie QB this season or Baker, getting a guy now as unlikely as that could have been would have set this team up for a pretty special run.

Its not worth debating if pete or Russ was the right person to keep around because we are going to find out this season. That said, I truly believe you would be a fool to think russ didn't love Seattle and it's fans. His gripe was always with the coaching staff, and I'm sorry but how stupid would it be if you left your long time job because you didn't like your boss and then all of your coworkers shit on you and decided that now you are a bad person 

The front half of the 2020 season just 1 football year ago our offense lead by Russ was on pace to be one of the best in NFL history. We finished that year 12-5 and we're down 4 running backs by the end of the season all while our defense was absolutely terrible. That was a good season marred by some bad coaching. Just one season ago we looked like the best team in the NFL through the first 8 weeks, and no one questioned Russ. You think in one season he changed that much? Or do you think Pete neutered that offense?

This fan base has become sooo incredibly toxic since russ left and that is a hill I will die on. This fan base at least the reddit portion right now could convince themselves that any negative thing about russ was true right now if it helped them feel better about the fact that he is gone. Heck the toxicity doesn't end there either, people are convinced we should try to tank for a high draft pick, and they completely overlook all the other negatives of tanking for a season. This place is so toxic that if you have an opinion right now that isn't publicly shared by Pete Carroll and you share it then say goodbye to any karma you had. I love the Hawks, not one player, not our owner, not Pete Carroll, and I refuse to be hate a former hawk because they left. I also refuse to blindly follow a coach who hasn't proved themselves in 7 years just because they are here and the other guy isn't. 

I want two things for this franchise in this order 1) Do good for the community of the PNW and set great examples for young people watching this beautiful sport. 2) Win.

The Patriots played in a division that was consistently weak and honestly Brady is just the GOAT. Brady does perhaps show that a great relationship with players can go a long way to keeping a dynasty alive. Tom can get players to follow him and seems to mostly create lasting relationships with people he has played with. I like Russ and defend him more than most, but Russ definitely wasn't building those kinds of relationships. I just don't think the reason for that is quite as malicious as some want it to be. Russ just doesn't have the cool factor and when he tries it feels forced, he also is overly calm and level headed in sport that tends to evoke everyone's passionate side making him seem at odds with the most passionate players like Sherm and Doug.

Injuries, consecutive bad drafts, mental health issues, and a few poor trades like Percy Harvin and Jimmy G combined with the eventual retirement of Marshawn and then 2 years of running back hell are what did our dynasty in.

B) Our receivers are not as talented as we want to believe they are ( I don't think this is true) or C) Our play calling and scheming is a bit to basic either because of coaching or because of a players lacking the skill or football iq for more complexity. I think C is the best answer here, I have said multiple times that in 2020 our offense was strongest when we were spreading the ball around, we had multiple games where Russ targeted 10+ WRs, TEs, and RBs. Utilizing that many players is very indicative of a more complex scheme. By the end of 2020 in the Rams game Russ targeted 5 players. The scheming the last 3 years has consistently gotten simplified the moment we struggle.

So with that in mind I don't totally hate us going for it with Adams. But where it just falls apart is in the same way that it fell apart with the Jimmy G trade years ago. We picked up a massively talented player that plays in a specific niche for their position and does one thing super well. Then we asked said player to do something other than what made them great. Then instead of adapting to their strengths when things weren't working we just kept wasting time expecting them to improve instead of scheming to their strengths. We are sometimes terrible at adapting to a players strength especially if it's not a strength that Pete built.

With Jimmy G for example we could have easily opened up the offense to allow for more TE passes, but instead we played our same game and expected him to block and only utilized him in RedZone downs.

Save our two firsts next season to build around someone. I think next year's first go to defense while everyone else is focused on QBs and WRs. Draft a QB and CB or RB in the second this year and bring in a lot of speed and youth.

Another QB I don't like that much, but could be interesting is Coral, bring him in and use him a bit like Lamar with a very dynamic fast offense with limited deep threats and lots of RPO and designed QB runs. Put some heavy miles on him until we find our guy, both Locket and DK have proven they can be threats underneath and don't require the moon ball to thrive which is Corals great weakness. I would still prefer Wilis or Ridder, but even coral I think has a lot more upside than geno and lock.

As for Baker, a 4th is to much unless they are eating a big chunk of his contract (not because I think he isn't worth 20mil, but because we are in a position to leverage the Browns if we want him).

Immediately use one of those picks to take a WR like London or Williams. If you get the jets 4 then trade it down to either a pair of late firsts or some other sweet pot. Use our 9 on a CB. Then use either a 2nd or a late first for Malik or Ridder at QB. I truly believe that either of those guys could mid tier nfl qbs with a competent team around them. Even better is that they could mature with a new WR and a vet like Lockett.

Furthermore my guess is that next year we will have probably an 8-10 and a mid 20s from Denver. Neither is getting us first dibs on one of the better qbs in that class. That means trading and hustling at the same time every other team is doing that.

Right now Pete and JS are being loud saying Russ wanted out, they tried everything ect ect. Russ on the other hand has been extremely reserved. 

That said I think both sides wanted to be done with it and at the end of the day the hawks never had to trade Russ. If he isn't traded he shows up to training camp and plays for this team. I think russ wanted a change of scenery and told the organization that he wouldn't re-sign with the team unless there were some changes (Pete). He probably also said he would be open to a trade earlier than that if they preferred. I think he really thought the organization would side with him especially at the end of the season when he was saying how much he loved Seattle. Then they kept Pete and traded Russ. Russ wanted to feel valued in a way that he shouldn't have expected in the NFL.

The Pete side of the story just makes less sense to me, he acts like the rift wasn't there, that this was out of the blue. That all of a sudden at the final hour they did everything they possible could to keep him. That Russ just had an itch that needed to be scratched. I think russ is more calculated than that, and while nuanced in comparison to some NFL drama the rift has been there for awhile now. Pete acting blind to the reality of this either makes me think Pete is the biggest lier in the room or the biggest idiot.

Pete is undoubtedly a good coach, but pre Russ this team even with an incredible defense and Marshawn couldn't get to a super bowl. Russ was that x-factor that pushed us over the edge. As a rookie he played Pete ball and for cheap, by year 3 we had just started to realize we had something special. Then in the midst of all the drama surrounding a Superbowl loss and the realization that we couldn't afford all of our aging defensive talent we started making some moves to build around Russ more.

Finally the clearest sign he needs to go is that he has been gun shy since the superbowl, he rarely gets agressive anymore, and when he does it is rarely in the right moment.

On the same accord, an human that chooses not to get a vaccine, that would otherwise protect them, not only endangers themselves, but endangers others. While opponents of the vaccine state that the vaccine does not supply immunity, it can be argued that the vaccine is steadily increasing the speed of herd immunity across the world. A virus spread from a person who is unvaccinated will likely have serious side effects and destroy cells in the body, when it is spread to others, its virulence stays constant and will endanger others who are not protected or vaccinated. If a virus infects a person who is vaccinated and boosters against covid, the virus that they could potentially spread to others has been fundamentally weakened by the protected immune system. This means that when it is spread, it's effects won't be felt nearly as severely if the recipient of that transaction is also vaccinated. 



In short. The vaccine is what will relegate covid to a flu like issue in the future, once the majority of the world is vaccinated. Until then, it will continue to spread and develop within people who have no protection and those stronger strains will continue to effect society. 



So when you say your body, your choice. Sure. Whatever. But if you think that your choice to avoid a vaccine ethical in any way, or more ethical than a woman choosing to abort her fetus, then you are sorely mistaken. They are incomparable, a child potentially a life endangering commitment, one that has many physical, mental, social and financial consequences that can be detrimental.



The vaccine's potential consequences are exponentially less severe than that of bringing a child to term, only in specific cases should a vaccine not be received. Otherwise, you are simply a fool for not getting one while actively endangering society. Aborting a fetus has zero impact on the structure of society, only on religion and people who don't understand that a fetus has no guaranteed right to exist.",1.0,nfl,t3_vjuj2u,False,0.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,2022-06-24T20:10:28Z,seahawks,-0.0180015667080581
