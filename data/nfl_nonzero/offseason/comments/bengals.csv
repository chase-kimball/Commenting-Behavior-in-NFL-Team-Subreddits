In Jessica's case, why did she change her mind? Did she change it because her boyfriend is no longer in the picture and will no longer support the child? Did she find out from her OB/GYN that she could be in danger health-wise if she carries the child to term? Did she finally sit down and realize that she cannot raise the child on her (and potentially her boyfriend's) income? Did she realize putting her child up for adoption in our current climate could have a statistically significant negative impact on the child's life?

In Marie's case, do you want this type of woman to raise more children? Do you think this is behavior that would be repeated if she had better education in school about safe sex as opposed to abstinence? Side note on this one, this one is a pretty weak argument as abortion tends to be a very painful and traumatizing experience for the majority of women and most don't go through it more than once, so this situation is much more rare than most pro-lifers make it seem.

In Alice's case, what caused the lover's quarrel? Is it possible that that quarrel was the result of physical or emotional abuse and she does not want to have this person in their life continuing that behavior? Was that a result of her partner going back on their word to provide financial responsibility for that child?

I think he showed some promise, he certainly has all the physical tools to play the position, but the mental side needs work. The good news is he was a rookie and only 21 years old, he has time to work out the kinks and tighten the screws. 

Going into year 2, I like to think about the jump Clint Boling made. He was dreadful in limited snaps year 1 only to turn into a nice solid piece year 2 and got better every year after. The Bengals didn't bank on that happening, they signed Travelle Wharton that offseason to compete for that spot forcing Boling to spend the offseason prepping for competition, and when Wharton went down in the 3rd snap or so in the preseason, Boling took the job and ran with it. I'm hoping the Bengals take a similar approach and Carman can shed that ""lazy"" label he seems to have picked up since college.

9909,68021,68021,ExCollegeDropout,"Justin Smith with the Bengals vs 49ers is pretty much the textbook example of when you have a talented player you try to force fit into a specific scheme vs scheming around the talent.

It's not like Smith went to the 49ers and he's suddenly a different player, he was just as good Cincy, they were just square pegging him as a true 4-3 DE. With the 49ers, he finally got the opportunity to play his more natural game, which is rushing more from a 5-tech position where he could either split the tackle and guard or just eat space and double teams to free up the faster EDGE players to get home in 2 seconds.

Simply put, Smith was super talented in both places, the  49ers not stubbornly sticking to scheme > player is what made Smith unlock his true potential.",36.0,nfl,t3_t8oz5h,False,0.0,:Bengals: Bengals,2022-03-07T09:44:12Z,bengals,0.292584765625

9911,68023,68023,ExCollegeDropout,"The guys we have in theory are ideal guys to have as backups. Carman is 21, has all the physical tools, and potential for positional versatility. D'Ante Smith showed promise before ill-timed injuries derailed his season. Adeniji I think is better than he showed this past year, he's a guy a full offseason will do a lot for. Even Trey Hill showed promise, he got push from the C spot, he just needs to clean up the penalties. 

All these guys are on rookie deals and they may even draft at least 1 more guy, there's no reason to think they can't get better, but the plan just can't be for them to be penciled in as starters like they tried this past year. The Bengals may not be the best OL talent evaluators in recent years, but if those 4-6 are competing for the first guy off the bench, logically 1 of them will rise above the rest, and if 2 of them have a Clint Boling-esque turnaround in year 2, you're in a really good spot for the future.

>relying on Reiff to start when he already is a average offensive lineman coming off injury who just getting older isn‚Äôt smart.

If he's the only plan, yes. If the plan is for another 1 year deal for Reiff with the intention of drafting a guy in the 1st or 2nd to take over in 2023 (or earlier if he's that promising) and start the year as the eligible tackle role this coming year to get experience, that's a plan worth getting behind.

15854,104894,104894,Kanusian,"ok im obviously a bit pessimistic here. But from the few twitter videos and reports from our beat writer you can clearly see that the d-line was feasting to start camp so far. The D-line Unit was good last year and i believe improved a bit, but it wasnt as good as pressuring as often as the writers noticed so far. I havent heard anything about cappa. Collins hopefully will be a massive improvement, but i dont know if lady luck will be on our side with him all year long. Karras at center is kind of my biggest worry though. Bellichick himself said he is a better Guard then Center, everybody who watched film said he is better at Guard and yet the Bengals will try him at center. I dont think that he will fail, i just think pushing him to LG and finding a Center in the Offseason would have been a better Solution. Better than trey still isnt enough though. 

The Fact is that the Bengals FO has tried to sell us a ""good"" Oline for the last 6 years and did so through the Draft and some low key Free Agents. This time around they are betting on more high Key Free Agents. I just hope it doesnt end up in disappointment again.

15855,104895,104895,Kanusian,"bengals. we literally had so many factors go right for us last year: Eli Apple was playing good football for a good stretch, but only against bad qbs, we werent hurt at all, we had a rookie wr in an all time season. Our D was pretty spectacular and probably overperformed. 

now this year it might look like the bengals went out and solved their o line, i believe it when i see it. From what im seeing: center is not better than last year, RG might be and RT is a injury concern in itself. Our LB are SUSPECT. so are our DB's, especially with Bates sitting out we are banking on our rookies to ball. Also the playcalling last year sucked. Every bengal fan will tell you that we ran it up the middle all regular season when we couldnt get more than 1 or 2 yards. And then in the most crucial situation that caught up to us in the SB. 

I mean somewhere between 8-10 wins is realistic, more is surprising and below wouldnt shock me.

Im a negative kind of person tho,

Ever since cousins left the play was inconsistent. i dont like watching games played at fedex because its just so depressing looking. IDK maybe if u actually take away the skeleton part of the stadium it gets better. But from an onfield perspective i would say the same. The defense seemed to be in a good spot but then last year threw me off a little and i dont know what to think. Becuase this could be a situation, where when u get a passable offense the defense isnt on the field so much and they get better. But that where my main problem is: your offense is depressing. Like i watch when your defense plays. But as soon as that offense is on the field i just dont wanna watch anymore. So lucky for me that i dont have to watch you so much rn. But i was at that point with my team as well a couple a years ago. From my point of view i think the wentz trade could land you at 3-5 in next years draft. or. maybe in a wc spot. no idea, that man is a god in one minute and then peterman in the next. 

the organization leadership is a shithole which is tough.

Snyder aint it. Rivera aint it. Fedex aint it. Wentz aint it. 

So currently: Commanders aint it.

The main reason he did not receive more individual awards comes down to the Bengals being asked for the majority of the time he played.

16823,115106,115106,Lionheart_513,"The Logan Wilson call is the only thing that haunts me. I'm completely okay with the loss, but the Logan Wilson call was absolute bullshit.

The entire call hinges on the fact that Cooper Kupp's hips were turned and then Wilson Propelled himself forward. The assumption is that because these two things happened at the same time, it must've been because Wilson forcibly turned Kupp's hips and launching himself forward. Nobody considers the fact that maybe Kupp turned his hips on his own power to maybe... I don't know... CATCH THE FUCKING PASS????? YOU TURN YOUR HIPS SO THAT YOU CAN PULL THE BALL IN TOWARDS YOUR CHEST AND SECURE IT. Every NFL WR has only been doing this for the past 80+ years.

Let's entertain the idea that Logan Wilson WAS grabbing Kupp's jersey. Where is the picture of Wilson noticeably, beyond a reasonable doubt, grabbing the jersey? Most people reference [this image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLz5ON6WYAItTJ9.jpg) to defend the call, but this plain and simply isn't holding. Here is the text of the rule:

* ARTICLE 6. DEFENSIVE HOLDING. It is defensive holding if a player grasps an eligible offensive player (or his jersey) with his hands, or extends an arm or arms to cut off or encircle him.

You CAN see the jersey being stretched, but there is no evidence that the jersey is being stretched because Wilson is grabbing it. The gloves that DBs, WRs, LBs, anyone who might have to catch a ball at some point, wear create a shit load of friction, it makes catching balls a lot easier. It is far more probable that Wilson had his hand on Kupp, and the jersey got caught on the palm of the glove as Kupp was shifiting his hips while running. No other angle shows Wilson with a closed fist CLEARLY AND BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT grabbing the jersey in such a manner that would've given him an unfair advantage. As for his other hand, [you can clearly see his other hand is not even on Kupp.](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a0f7b518ce014f26f3455807bff6f423) That picture is actually the view that the ref who threw the flag had. There is no fucking way that a ref in the back of the end zone noticed the jersey getting subtly stretched from an angle he couldn't even see in real time. The ref who threw that flag did not even have a clear view of the angle that everyone says makes it ""obvious"". This is football. This is a full contact sport. Logan Wilson is allowed to have his hands on Kupp.

If there is no such image of of Wilson obviously grabbing Kupp's jersey ([something like this, which wasn't called](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLhB2NHXoAAY7r0?format=jpg&name=900x900)), then any advantage gained by whatever jersey grab may or may not have been present was negligible at best. Furthermore, penalties are meant to be called when there is an obvious violation of the rules that gave one team a clear unfair advantage. If the advantage is negligible, or the violation of the rules isn't entirely clear, THEN THE CALL IS BULLSHIT. An offensive lineman jumping the gun early is a penalty because it gives the offense a clear, unfair advantage. If the lineman's foot moves literally a frame before the ball is snapped, that should not be a penalty because the advantage given to the offense by giving the OL a 0.03 second head start is negligible. Penalties don't exist to give the refs a moment of spotlight, they exist to keep the game fair. The ref can't just throw a flag because something looks like it may or may not be a penalty, the ref can only throw a flag when he believes he has seen an obvious penalty and then the review is there as a safety net.

Logan Wilson made the play of his fucking career that night and was robbed of it. It's honestly a crime that he will never get the recognition he deserves for having made that play. That should've been one of the greatest pass breakups in the history of the Super Bowl, and the refs robbed him of having that play.",18.0,bengals,t3_vhgfvx,False,0.0,#JusticeForIrwin,2022-06-21T22:51:17Z,bengals,0.0255787739498284

16831,115117,115117,Lionheart_513,"Chase will not take the crown.

Cooper Kupp had a great season, no doubt, but the reason he won the triple crown was largely down to volume. Robert Woods went down early on and OBJ came in pretty late so Kupp got way more touches than he otherwise would‚Äôve. The Rams offense basically ran through him, and even though it worked, having your entire offense run through one receiver is a really bad spot to be in. The Rams were always just a minor Cooper Kupp injury away from their season being over. The Rams only won their division by one game, so if Kupp goes down for A GAME then it‚Äôs very likely they don‚Äôt win their division and if Kupp goes down for 2+ games we might even be talking about the Rams missing playoffs altogether.

The Bengals coaching staff has shown that they don‚Äôt really care about passing volume. Joe Burrow was 6th in passing yards, and every QB ahead of him had AT LEAST 80 more pass attempts. There have been games where they leaned on passing volume more than others, the week 17 Chiefs game comes to mind, but for the most part, all this coaching staff really wants to do is get a comfortable 2ish score lead and then manage the game down from there. Think the Steelers home game we won 41-10 and yet Burrow only had 190 passing yards. That‚Äôs the style of game you‚Äôre going to see behind the new OL. It‚Äôs not gonna be the deep ball offense that people loved from last year (unless it‚Äôs a close game) because you don‚Äôt need to throw deep balls when you‚Äôre up by 2 scores in the 1st quarter.

The game plan is: establish the run, take a deep shot or two, get ahead early, park the bus. Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase will be lucky to have a 100 yard game every once in a while.

17122,120474,120474,McWitt,"Here's a breakdown of the picks + a guy who was in the discussion from each round in my selection.

**R1: CB - Andrew Booth Jr**

One of the few guys who could actually win a starting job on this roster.

Debated: S- Cine, Georgia

**R2: DL - DeMarvin Leal**

- Listed as edge but at 6'4 280 has played inside as well. His skillset and versatility is appealing with him spelling Reader on passing downs while providing rotation at DE. 

Debated: Edge- Paschal, Kentucky

**R3: Safety - Nick Cross**

- Cross is raw and an absolute freak. Bates and Bell are both FA in '23. This pick was between Cross and Bryan Cook from safety. Cook is more of a strong box safety imo, like Bell who I think we will resign. Bates however, I feel is headed to FA. So decision made.

Debated: S - Bryan Cook 

**R4: T - Rasheed Walker**

- 3 year starter at LT for Penn State. I know we really need an interior guy but I had no value there. Impressive player with good size, I wonder if we landed a good enough LT, if we would slide Jonah in to ~~compete~~ win at LG. 

Debated: TEs but no value.

**R5: TE - Daniel Bellinger**

- Give me a D-, idc. Bellinger ran a 4.6, had 22 reps (most I've seen so far by a TE) and has good hands. Hurst is TE1 though I'm not drunk.

Debated: nobody.

**R6: C - James Empey**

BYU Football is a zone heavy scheme. Empey has great size(6'4 305) and above average initial quickness. Fits the scheme here and can play C/G.

Debated: CB Chamarri Connor

**R7: WR - Devin Thompkins**

- I have no idea why he would still be here outside of size and durability concerns.. But click the highlights.. Go on, click it.

https://youtu.be/gr3S9LFcuVA

Debated: WR Rambo, S Kenderick Duncan

**R7/252: Ed Tyree Johnson**

- I first noticed this guy watching Leal and Clemons. His past 3 year he's tallied 4, 4 and 8.5 sacks despite competing for those stats vs Leal, Clemons and Peevy who are all NFL bound this year. Pass rushing specialist.

Most of the feedback is either:

- Makes perfect sense

or

- We shouldn't go with depth our first pick.

But I'm having a hard time seeing any guy win a starting job on this roster before week 1 outside of LG. I don't think we go OL at 31 now. Many mocks have 4/5 corners taken prior to our first pick and while there are still plenty of guys who can challenge CB2 and possibly win that spot, it just seems unlikely imo before week 1.

17175,120541,120541,McWitt,"I was writing this for a post, but f it I think this fits the op post.

Here's my take on why I think we will go Safety in first round.(I'm personally hoping for a trade back)

**Calculated Cap Casualty Strategy**

We cannot retain all this young talent with the bill that's coming. I've been calling it, we are going safety at 31. BPA at 31 I think will be a safety. KC will determine a lot for us, at pick 30 it looks like DB is very much in play for them. 


**D Daxton Hill (Michigan)**

A great tackler (probably his best attribute imo), has crazy ball skills for a DB (see int vs Wisconsin) and ran a 4.38 forty. For those reasons, his position at the next level is debated mostly to the need of whoever selects him. He's versatile like Mathieu in that he can play NCB where he logged a ton of play at Michigan, most say FS and some believe he would be there SS. I think he'd be a perfect fit in our single high look heavy scheme. Consider the following:

**Reasoning**
1. **Bates and Bell both set for FA**

With no news of a Bates payday and as much as I'd hate to see him leave, we need to accept that as a real possibility. Vonn has one year remaining (6.1 million in 2022) and in need of a new deal. He will be cheaper then Bates but who knows what will happen. If we lose one or both, Hill is able to fill either position.

2. **Depth**

In 2021 we were incredibly healthy and that isn't typical or expected again. Ricardo Allen retired and if Bates, Bell or Hilton were to go down, who would be filling in? Hill imo, would be our next best on the depth chart at all of these positions for the 22 season.

What makes this year fun is that this is a perfect storm of things going down. First, there is no bonafide top pick. I've seen maybe 4 or 5 different guys in expert mocks going to the Jags. Second, there isn't even a bonafide top QB either. There are only a few QB needy teams, so watching that group play out will be very interesting (just keep Ridder from going to Pitt, please!). Third, the NFL has taken the madness approach it seems. The free agency period was nuts with draft picks being thrown all over the place. That was fun to watch, especially seeing the Bengals making aggressive, smart moves. Fourth (at least for me), is that the Bearcats have a number of draftable guys including Sauce and Ridder who could both go in the first round. So it's fun to follow where all those guys go in the draft.

Honestly, outside of Gronk, I really do not like any of the remaining TE's available. It might be okay to take a flyer on Jared Cook. He's got the size and athleticism that should translate to a great TE, but he never seems to work out with any team it seems. He was decent with LAC.

I also hate the idea of drafting a TE. There's too much value to be had in other playmaking positions in the draft or just bolstering the OL. Reaching for a TE never seems to work out. Remember drafting Gresham over Gronk? Heck, we found value in getting Uzomah in the 5th round and he took over for 1st round pick Tyler Eifert and kept his job over 2nd round pick Drew Sample.

At this point, I like the idea of bringing Kyle Rudolph home. He's had a decent career at being a good redzone target including catching that playoff TD for the Vikings when they beat the Saints. Also, he was the Pro Bowl MVP a while back too. I think a lot of his game was overshadowed last season by the fact that he was on possibly the most inept offense in the NFL. I really think his blocking abilities are underrated as well which we could obviously use. I say let him come in and run the TE1 and then try to develop a young guy in the meantime or see if Thaddeus Moss or Sample can be the TE of the future.

The bonus here is that Rudolph would be obviously a lot cheaper than Uzomah ultimately cost and Gronk would cost more than that. So hopefully with this plan, we spend the money elsewhere like another upgrade at OL or signing Bates long term. I hate Uzomah leaving, but I think this also opens up some other possibilities.

Salyer at 63 is fair because he has positional flexibility and can be plugged in at LG, but there‚Äôs better options at this pick. 

Jones at 95 is a terrible pick because he can only play cornerback in the slot, a role currently occupied by Hilton. If we drafted him, his only value would be on special teams.

Elliss at 136 is acceptable, but is more of a NT than a 3T and therefore doesn‚Äôt really provide us with much DL depth behind Hill.

Anderson at 174 is a great pick and there are other alternative safeties likely available at this pick such as Weatherford, Bell (Not Vonn), O‚ÄôNeal Jr., Corker, Woods, Monday, Bolden, McKinley III.

27216,206583,206583,UnitedIndividual6768,"If I could order them: 

1. TE: Our only proven tight end, Hurst, is on a one year deal and we have no legitimate depth behind him. Drew Sample was a bust and simply does not provide the pass-catching skills we require in a tight end.

2. LG/C: Although the offensive line has been greatly improved through the free agency revamp, there is not a proven starter at one of our interior positions. Carman disappointed last season and is still undergoing his positional change from tackle to guard. We need a starting calibre player LG or C (in which case we can move Karras to LG, where he graded better at and has more experience than C). This allows Carman to be an immediate backup for the entire line and asserts a safety asset in case of common offensive line injuries.

3. CB: We could really use a new outside cornerback. Honestly, Eli Apple provided good value at CB2 last season; but he failed to perform during the playoffs and Super Bowl. Resigning him was the right move and gives us a very solid CB3, but we need another man between Awuzie and Apple that can start right away.

4. S: Both Bates and Bell are set to be free agents next off-season. Bates performed mediocre during the regular season, but thrived during the playoffs and Super Bowl. Bell had a pretty decent season, as well. However, various players are set to be extended next off-season and I‚Äôm not sure we can bring both of these guys back. It‚Äôs for this exact reason I hope we sign a mobile, deep-set safety that can start in the near future. 

5. DL: The defensive line is looking strong after the off-season resignings, but lacks depth in case of the usual injuries. We lost Ogunjobi and could use a decent interior defensive lineman to provide depth under Hill and Reader and also perhaps rotate snaps with them. A 3T player who can pressure the quarterback and replicate Ogunjobi‚Äôs stat line last season is preferred.

‚Ä¢Zion Johnson is arguably the best IOL in the entire draft. It‚Äôs either him or Linderbaum, and Linderbaum never appears to fall to 31 by PFF‚Äôs draft logic, so Johnson is the pick. He put up the best combine of any offensive lineman; boasting 32 bench press reps, a 32‚Äù vertical jump, and top 5 times in the short shuttle and 3-cone drill. This gives him an overall RAS (relative athletic score) of 9.59/10, which is absolutely insane when you consider it ranks him 58/1406 OGs from 1987-2021. This guy is an athletic freak who is supercharged with strength and intelligence. He also has positional flexibility and has essentially lined up across the entire line during his college career.

27276,206679,206679,UnitedIndividual6768,"Kenyon Green - Green fell down the ranks a bit after a fairly poor combine saw Zion Johnson become G1 of the class. We still need an IOL to replace Spain, unless we re-sign him of course. That doesn‚Äôt seem guaranteed at this stage so I went with Kenyon Green. He can play across the entire line and compete for the starting position at LG. Green will infuse the interior of the line with an elite youth prospect.

Trey McBride - The best TE in the class. Not only did he rack up 1100 yards last season (has that vertical threat we‚Äôve been lacking in the tight-end department), he is also a monster blocker. His overall PFF grade was approximately 94 so this guy can be an instant starter if he stays healthy. I like the trade up with the Buccaneers became it lets us snag two critical positions of need.

Marcus Jones - The best returner in the class. Special teams was concerning this season. They essentially lost us the 49ers game (as well as our o-line, but that‚Äôs a given). Jones is slightly undersized at 5‚Äô8‚Äù, but he has unbelievable speed and talent. Combine that and you get the best punt/kick returner in the class who can also play the outside cornerback role; exactly what we‚Äôve been looking for. He will likely play snaps at the slot as well. His dimensions are very similar to Mike Hilton and I love Jones as an experimental prospect.

Tyreke Smith - The Bengals are very interested in Smith. Multiple scouts has their eyes on him during the Ohio State pro day. He‚Äôs listed at ED, but realistically can play any defensive role in the box. He only had 3 sacks last season, but his display of pure strength and motor have swayed many, including me. He‚Äôs a solid depth option as an edge rusher who will definitely get his handful of snaps.

Jelani Woods - It isn‚Äôt often that a team drafts two TEs (Ravens did this with their 1st and 3rd round picks back in 2018), but I simply could not pass on Woods. He is arguably the best athlete in the draft class. No other tight end came close to combine performance. He dominated the bench press with 24 reps and at an astonishing 6‚Äô7‚Äù, he ran the second fastest 40 yard dash for tight ends. He has the physique, hands, and skillset. Now, it needs to be put altogether in order to generate production.

Brad Hawkins - With Bates on the franchise tag and both of our starting safeties expected to be free agents next season, it‚Äôs acceptable to explore options at safety. Hawkins is no superstar, but he‚Äôs a solid guy with a decent PFF grade. Ricardo Allen retired last season so depth is minimal at the safety position. At this later pick, Hawkins fits the scheme and provides us with the safety depth and security we‚Äôve been looking for. Could legitimately be developed into a starter next season if we let Bell and/or Bates walk. 

Matt Araiza - This pick is very controversial, but it is always an option. I understand that we‚Äôve had Drueman on and off the practice squad, as well as the fact that he is a serviceable, young punter. But if Araiza is available in the 7th round, there‚Äôs no reason not to draft him. He has a disciplined leg that can launch balls from one side of the field to the other. Combine him with McPherson, and you have the best young special teams duo in the league. Also, if McPherson ever goes down, Araiza is a legitimate substitution at the kicking position. He‚Äôs scored 50+ yard field goals in college, and he‚Äôs only going to get better in the NFL. Definitely worth a 7th round pick.

Michael Woods II - Couldn‚Äôt find much on this guy. He had the highest PFF grade out of the remaining WRs, so I took him. Very little tape on him so it‚Äôs hard to grade him. He put up 400 yards last season and 619 the season prior, so he‚Äôs a honest piece at receiving depth.


Darien Butler - Another late-round depth guy. Butler put up a decent statsheet last season, totaling 2 sacks and 3 interceptions. He also racked up an impressive 68 total tackles. He was the best remaining linebacker, so I took him. Provides solid depth and can be found easily developed in the future.",2.0,bengals,t3_tomv21,False,0.0, Tee Higgins #85,2022-03-26T07:20:04Z,bengals,0.0096328698472745

Claypool probably has the talent to be better than Boyd but let's just look at last year's stats because they are comparable. Claypool was the #2 option and Boyd was the #3 option. 

Claypool went for 59 catches, 860 yards, and 2 TDs. His catches and yards were basically the same as a rookie but had 9 TD. 

Boyd went for 67 receptions, 828 yards, and 5 TD. His yards and TDs were similar in 2020 but had more receptions without Chase. 

Here's a key difference. In the past 2 years Boyd has 2 dropped passes. Claypool has 11 drops in that same timeframe. 

Before Claypool entered the league, Boyd had back to back 1000+ yard seasons.

Chad is number 1. Green is 2. After that you‚Äôre looking at Curtis, Houshmandzadeh, Collinsworth, Pickens, Brown, even Boyd as top receivers. 

Chase has all the potential in the world and should be the greatest Bengals WR of all-time. Based off of pure talent, he‚Äôs definitely near the top.

The Bengals also showed that having great weapons on rookie deals and a solid defense could get you to the Super Bowl even with a bad offensive line. Jim Irsay tweeted throughout the playoffs how you have to have a QB to compete. Then he went out and traded for Matt Ryan. 

If you have the bulk of what you need, a couple of trades for solid talent that are good fits can put you over the top. If you hit at key positions like QB and have them on a rookie deal, you can also build through the draft and free agency to make a run. 

Both of the Super Bowl teams showed different blueprints on how to get it done. Miami still has their QB on his rookie deal and are trying to add the pieces. Denver feels they were missing the QB. I have no clue what the hell Cleveland was thinking. The Raiders felt they needed another weapon to pair with Renfrow. So I understand the logic of how some of these teams are approaching this. 

Things will change soon, but we are in a very lucky position that our QB, WR1, and WR2 are all on rookie deals. It‚Äôs allowed us to build a defense and finally an offensive line.

43225,326337,326337,muskiesfan1,"Let‚Äôs start with this. Brown‚Äôs $1b net worth is from Forbes in 2015. As of 2022, the Bengals are valued at 2.275b. Considering he owns the overwhelming majority of those shares, his net worth should be pretty close to that at least. I understand the difference between assets and cash, but let‚Äôs work more closely with the actual numbers. 

Next, in December 2011, he had no problem coming up with $200m cash to purchase Knowlton‚Äôs 186 shares of the Bengals. It had to be a cash purchase because an investment group in New York made the same offer. The Brown family was given the opportunity to match an offer for the shares for Knowlton‚Äôs estate and they did. If Mike Brown could find a way to get $200m cash 11 years ago to buy shares of the team, he can figure out a way to get $20-50m cash to put in escrow for players contracts. 

With the potential exception of 2020, the Bengals turn a profit yearly. July 2021 every NFL team was given $309m from revenue sharing. That‚Äôs after a season during the pandemic that drastically impacted attendance. Teams are projected to receive at least $335m in July 2022 from revenue sharing. With the Bengals Super Bowl run, they surely made a nice profit this season with a playoff game and the amount of merchandise sold at PBS. 

I‚Äôm not saying Mike Brown doesn‚Äôt have less money than other owners. However, him being able to come up with a large sum of money in cash to serve his family‚Äôs own interest shows the ability is there for him to get large sums of cash. Also, Mike Brown cried poor and was sued by Hamilton County. Instead of opening up his books to prove his claims, he fought very hard to prevent his financials from being made public. So either he is doing better financially than he claimed or maybe he‚Äôs concerned the league would find out that he shouldn‚Äôt run an NFL franchise. After all, he has paid himself to be the GM of the team since he took over as owner. 

People can argue all the want or say I‚Äôm calling the team cheap or that I‚Äôm not supportive enough after a Super Bowl run. I‚Äôm not trying to say any of that. I‚Äôm not even trying to talk bad about Mike Brown. I‚Äôm just saying when it suits him, he has been able to raise the money needed. He needs to be making sure it suits him with free agency as well.

Designating him as a June 1 cut will still allow Collins to be a free agent right away, but Dallas would not get the cap relief until June 2nd.

There seems to be a popular opinion that he could be had for less on the market. I‚Äôm not sure I see it. Even if he could be signed for a little less AAV, there will be guaranteed money. Trading for Collins makes his deal a 3 year/$30m deal with absolutely no guaranteed money. He could be cut at any time with no dead cap. So in my opinion, reading for him is better. You may pay a little more per year, but you can move on with no dead cap at any time. 

Dallas is getting desperate and looking for a late round pick. New England just got a 5th for Shaq Mason and rumors are they may try to flip that 5th for Collins.

We could bring back Spain, bring in a RT, and still at least cover part of a TE or CB for the same cost. That‚Äôs 3 new offensive line starters (Karras, Cappa, and RT), plus a new TE/CB. Sometimes top quality is a risk to take when you‚Äôre just a player or two away. We need more than that. I know we just played in the Super Bowl, but we are extremely light at CB, lost our starting TE, need DT depth, and our current RT is a revolving door at best. I would rather have more quantity of somewhat lower quality to fill holes than 1 player considered of high quality but depth concerns at multiple positions. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, if Armstead could actually play every game for the entirety of the contract, it would be great. It‚Äôs never happened though. Having no real glaring holes across the entire roster is a better idea than bringing in 1 top tier player. We had 5 free agent CBs and people want to cut Waynes.

43285,326437,326437,muskiesfan1,"According to the rumors, the Bengals were all in on centers at the combine. It sounded like that included free agents and potential draft picks. They have been linked to almost every free agent offensive lineman, but mainly because everyone saw Burrow got sacked 70 times last season including the playoffs. However, Hobson has put out an article that the team is only looking to spend $20m in free agency and they‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúbang for the buck‚Äù as opposed to high priced talent. If they do get a solid center, expect nothing more than an addition Reiff type signing at best. The team is already putting out that they have to save for Burrow‚Äôs extension. 

Also look at the fact that offensive line has been an issue since at least 2016. They can continue to fail through the draft and have only opened the checkbook for defense. Reiff is the highest priced offensive lineman they‚Äôve brought in in years. 

Obviously Burrow needs just an average offensive line at best. Mixon would also flourish with average run blocking. The message being put out a week before free agency appears to be the same spin used almost every year; Hobson says the team has cut their available cap by more than half. Tobin said they need to bring back some guys and add some free agents. It seems they are looking at third tier or below on outside free agents though from the tone of Hobson‚Äôs article. Especially considering Hobson says the team is only looking to spend $20m AND wants to continue to front load contracts. That makes me a bit nervous that we may get a single decent offensive lineman in free agency and go back to relying on the draft for help there. I also feel like the team may spend more on defense again this year than offense.",9.0,bengals,t3_tab9fr,False,0.0,None,2022-03-09T10:58:50Z,bengals,0.0192248235174892
43286,326438,326438,muskiesfan1,"The Bengals have to save $7.6m to sign draft picks. They want to roll over money for Burrow‚Äôs extension and they generally save around $5m for in season injuries to sign players. All of that is before cutting Waynes. I‚Äôve mentioned this in other posts as well. 

Hobson said something else I‚Äôve mentioned several times on this sub, the team likes to front load instead of pushing money down the line. Obviously they could do things differently to better use the cap to get needed upgrades. However, this is how the team has historically attacked the cap. Front loading allows them to be able to show more cash spent in a season to hit the cap floor or even spend over the cap by cash numbers. Even though a bonus can spread over the life of the contract, teams can count the entire bonus to year 1. That also allows them to quickly drop the available cap space. 

All of this is to say that the last 2 seasons the team has spent big on defense. We saw the difference this year. If we added a JC Jackson and brought back Hill and Flowers, our defense is pretty stout. Weak on depth at some places, but still stout. The leaks saying the Bengals are interested in Jackson aren‚Äôt surprising. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs out of their price range, but they have shown they will spend on defense. 

On the flip side, the offensive line has been an issue since at least 2016. They have tried to use the draft and have missed the majority of the time. In free agency, they have not attacked the offensive line at all. That‚Äôs nothing against Spain, Reiff, XSF, or anyone else but the team has not made a splash signing on the offensive line in years. Since they‚Äôre already using a Burrow extension as an excuse to cut the cap I worry they may go defense again this year and once again try to fix the offensive line through the draft. 

As for the small market narrative, people really need to leave that mentality behind. This is the NFL. The last concrete numbers I can give is that each NFL team received $274m in 2018 from revenue sharing. That‚Äôs just the shared portion of NFL money. That doesn‚Äôt include the 60% each home team keeps from ticket sales of every home game, or the parking revenue that they get to keep, or the concessions money that they get to keep, or the merchandise sales they get to keep. So that‚Äôs almost $300m that the Bengals brought in BEFORE including the other revenue that they don‚Äôt have to share. They are not a poor franchise and the NFL generates so much money that market size really does get offset. Not to mention that there is a hard cap that every team has to follow. So the Brown family gets more than enough to cover the salary cap PLUS some operating expenses just from revenue sharing. That doesn‚Äôt include the other revenue that goes directly to them. The Brown family makes a profit from owning the team. Claiming that small market has any relevance in the NFL just isn‚Äôt true.",44.0,bengals,t3_ta19xk,False,0.0,None,2022-03-09T07:03:02Z,bengals,0.0131774880772745
43287,326441,326441,muskiesfan1,"Pay the man. Signing him this season to a long term deal is in the best interest of the team. If they tag him and he plays well he will cost more next year. Not just because of his play, but there is an expected big jump in 2023 salary cap due to tv money. If they pay him $14-16m AAV this year, that will seem like a deal in 2 years. You have to look further than looking backwards at last regular season. 

As for the contract being in his head, I‚Äôm sure it was. He‚Äôs still young. This is a physically demanding sport and an injury can altar or end it quickly.

43288,326447,326447,muskiesfan1,"Everyone knows we need offensive line help. Carman could battle for a spot, Adeniji was better his rookie year as a swing tackle, Smith showed promise and it better than Prince, Hill got better with more time but still needs to clean up a lot. That‚Äôs 3 depth pieces and a potential starter depth piece. Prince has no business protecting above a pee wee QB. If they bring in a C, G, and RT we‚Äôre done. Let‚Äôs Reiff go, maybe bring back Spain, draft a lineman or 2 and call it a day. 

We have several free agent CBs. If all is spent on OL then we need to drafting quite a bit of CBs. We have 3-4 free agent defensive lineman. If we follow the thought process of spending all money and draft picks on OL then we have a big need at DL. I shudder to think we let CJ walk and/or don‚Äôt bring in another TE and Sample is the starter. That‚Äôs nightmare fuel. 

The offensive line will get help in free agency and the draft. We also need to re-sign some of our own, sign other free agents, and draft other positions. We have to do these things. People wanting to spend the bulk of the cap on OL and the bulk of the draft picks on OL are just creating other weaknesses and holes that need to be filled. 

I‚Äôm not trying to be a jerk, just realistic. We‚Äôre not signing Armstead, Scherff, Williams, Moses, Jensen, trading for Bechton, and drafting 5 more offensive lineman.

I bet the refs will call more OPI on these guys this year, somewhat stimulated by the SuperBowl play with Higgins.  So there will be a little regression here probably.

Lest anyone thinks I'm down on my boys, I own a Higgins sweatshirt :)

The combo of a better offensive line, a healthier Joe Burrow, and a better running game (from the better o line) will make the receivers almost impossible to stop.  Higgins is tall enough to simply climb over anyone in traffic.
