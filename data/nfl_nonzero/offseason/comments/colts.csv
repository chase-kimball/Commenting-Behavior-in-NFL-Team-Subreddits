437,3329,3329,A_Massive_Mistake,I don't think we can even confidently say this is correct?  Everything I've gathered is the Colts were gearing up to trade for Matt Ryan and have never even considered Baker.  Now that's all been flipped on its head and they have to start over.  Jimmy G and Mariota are their fallbacks and they're patiently waiting to see if something better comes along,-1.0,colts,t3_thgh9j,False,0.0,Jimmy from the Colts,2022-03-18T17:17:03Z,colts,0.111962109375

Not saying this is how I feel, just that people with sources are saying the Colts aren't showing interest in him and the Browns aren't looking to deal him. He also has shades of Wentz 2.0.  I like Jimmy G but the Colts want someone who will be ready for OTAs.  So not him.  Jameis has said the only 2 teams that have contacted him are the Saints and the Colts.  Not a fan of that.  At this point, I want Watson to choose ATL so that the Saints go back to Jameis, and the Colts are dealt Matt Ryan.  This dude is a SOLID qb, does everything right, and will be a 4 year starter while we find the next guy in the draft.  He's Jimmy G minus the injuries.

443,3335,3335,A_Massive_Mistake,"For the record, I thought the Wentz trade was a win. I was very optimistic about him being the QB heading into the season.  Then he immediately needed surgery and refused to get vaxxed.  That killed a lot of the optimism.  By the end of the second Rams game he had once again gotten himself hurt (because of reckless play, mind you) and couldn't finish the game.  People talk about poor o-line play but film study shows that plenty of the sacks he took were because he was missing wide open players underneath in favor of looking downfield for a non-existant home run ball.  I was seeing very few routine timing routes and his accuracy was all over the place-- I judged Carson to be completely ineffective at elevating the talent around him.  He was very underwhelming.  And we're 0-2 at that point.

He helps out in the community all the time, he’s started a program called “Kicking The Stigma” which helps people recover from mental health issues, he connects with the fans all the time, and the players, coaches, and Indianapolis Colts fanbase loves him.

• Venturi is concerned about the depth at WR, and just the unit we have in general. He isn’t sold at all on our WR’s yet. He also said that Ogletree “will be pressing the door here” on Mo Allie Cox if he continues his drops.

Take it with a grain of salt, but from what I'm seeing... 

 

- They have one blue chip WR still available on the board!!!!!! I would not be shocked if we trade up for him. This WR is the only blue chip prospect visible on the board(WRs. TE. RB, QB, OT positions are visible).

- There are 2 WRs with red flags. No other red flag for a position visible on the board.

- There are a ton of WRs that are designated as ""gold"" - 3 of them regular WRs, if I'm not mistaken 4 designated as slots. 

- There are 3 visible TEs with ""gold"" designation - 2 of them Y TE, 1 of them F. 

- RBs(!!!!!!!!) There are 5 ""gold"" RBs left on the board!!!! Do not be shocked if we draft a RB withone of the day 3 picks... possibly even early day 3. 

- 2 OTs designated as gold, but they are very low on the board - I would guess, we are not picking one on day 2.

- There is ONE QB designated as ""gold""... if the blue chip WR is not on the board, or we can't trade up for him... be prepared... he's also highlighted with dark theme... seems like the leading player at each position is highlighted with dark theme. 

- There are several other categories that I cannot make out... one is under the gold category but almost noone is in it - it's possible it's another type of red flag category - for example - first one might be off-field red flags, other one might be medical red flags. Almost noone is in it - there is one QB in it and 3 OTs visible. 

- There are a TON of players in the ""black"" category. And then then a ton of players in the following category that is illegible(cannot read the designation).

11597,90812,90812,MidLevelExceptional,"Pretty much every single rotational CB Ballard has ever gotten has arms longer than 32"":

- Quincy Wilson - 32 1/4""
- Rock Ya-Sin - 32""
- Marvell Tell III - 33 1/8""
- Isaiah Rodgers - 32 7/8""
- Kenny Moore - 32 5/8""
- Pierre Desir - 33""
- Xavier Rhodes - 33 3/4""
- Brandon Facyson - 32 5/8""

The only ones with arms under 32"" were TJ Carrie, who is just a hair under - 31 7/8"" and Nate Hairston - 31"" . This has been a threshold for the Seahawks for a while now and Ballard has tried for a while now to implement some elements of the Legion of Boom defenses the Seahawks had over the last 10-12 years. Gus Bradley was one of the originators of it, so I would expect this to continue to be a measurement the Colts heavily rely on.  

So... when looking at prospects, I would strongly lean towards ones with long arms(over 32""). According to that list:

- Ahmad Gardner - 33 1/2"" - not gonna happen. He's not falling to us.
- Tariq Woolen - 33 5/8"" - this is an interesting one, especially considering there are numerous reports about the Colts showing interest in him

- Akayleb Evans - 32""
- Josh Jobe - 32 5/8""
- Jaylen Watson - 32 1/4""

None of the options being discussed will get us far, so we should go for one of the cheaper ones that can run an NFL offense and give us a functioning offensive unit.

Franchise QBs don't hit FA and they don't get traded unless they are at the end of their career or serial sexual predators. 

Just... be patient, scout the QBs in the draft and if you like one and think he can be our franchise QB of the future, target him and make sure you get in position to draft him on draft day. And if you don't like any of the QBs in this draft, keep the powder dry and target one next year.

13651,103921,103921,OladipoForThree,"I can say that if we we able to put together a competitive package for Russ (losing 1st for Wentz made this impossible), I would totally give this to him. When you trade that kind of capital for a QB you have to to show your confidence in the move. Especially for a team like the Broncos that have started the likes of Bridgewater, Osweiler, Siemian, Keenum, Flacco, Lynch, and Lock over the last 6-7 years.

Furthermore, this is the price of a top 10-12 QB nowadays. Look at what Carr, Kyler, and Dak got. Most would agree none of these guys are All Pro level QBs but are franchise QBs, and those are few and far between - so you have to pay for what the market dictates, and at this point it’s in the 40-50mil range. And I’d say Russ is a tier above those 3.

Our own QB Ryan signed a similar record breaking deal for 5/150 and that wasn’t long ago. And I’m sure everyone here remembers when we made Luck the highest paid NFL player ever… and that was for what? 25mil? QB prices are going to rise linearly until there’s some sort of CBA cap.

13714,104034,104034,OladipoForThree,"#IX. Offensive and Defensive Schemes
  
The Colts figure to run a run-first offense due to the strength of that group. Last year, in games where Carson Wentz threw over 30 passes, the Colts only won once. While I believe Matt Ryan to be more adept at managing and controlling games than Wentz, I still believe the Colts will focus on running over 35 times per game between Taylor, Hines, and Lindsay. The overall weakness of the WR core cements this fact, as Pittman is the only proven guy. The Colts frequently run 3 TE sets, more than any other team in the league. Granson, Jelani Woods, and Mo Alie-Cox should make for some killer run blocking. Sadly, Jack Doyle - one of the best run blocking TEs in the league - recently retired, and the Colts have a tall task in replacing him.

Defensively, they will most likely run Bradley's famous Cover-3 mainly instead of Eberflus' Cover-2. ""There's probably some similarities now – effort-based defense,"" Bradley, who praised the work Eberflus and the previous defensive coaching staff did, said. ""A team that plays with great effort. Great effort, great enthusiasm. I think enthusiasm is important on the field to create energy."" (From a Colts.com article on the addition of Bradley) Bradley was notoriously anti-blitz in Las Vegas, however he has stated he will blitz whenever the situation calls for it. In fact, when the Raiders did blitz, they were one of the most successful teams doing it according to PFF. The Colts are loaded with defensive talent: Yannick and Buckner on the line, Leonard with the LBs, and the Pro Bowl CB duo of Kenny Moore and Stephon Gilmore, so Bradley has plenty to work with to keep his defense flexible. More is stated about Bradley’s defense in the Coaching Additions section.",7.0,nfl,t3_vytyn2,False,0.0,:Colts: Colts,2022-07-14T06:59:47Z,colts,0.0099013041476474

I’m told there’s a recording of an interview with the adult son of 1 of 12 women the NFL interviewed in the Deshaun Watson case —stating his mom initially was complimentary of Watson in their conversations after the massage, but later switched her account and tone after 1/4

[Cont.] negative allegations surfaced about Watson. The son intimated his mother intended to reward his silence, per league source. There's a feeling that the NFL was initially cagey about details they learned from the woman’s son—after only mentioning they interviewed him 2/4

[Cont.] in their report. The son’s recording was later reviewed by Watson’s side revealing the aforementioned details —presumably illuminating why this particular accuser was not included with the 5 women the NFL ultimately focused on at the hearing. 3/4

* Stafford: 30 sacks, 5 fumbles
* Murray: 31 sacks, 15 fumbles

So collectively, Wentz combined for 15 turnovers, to Stafford's 22, and Kyler's 23. And he took virtually the same number of sacks. 

Also, here's a list of every Colts offensive player to miss multiple games last season: 

* LT Eric Fisher only played in 15 games
* C Ryan Kelley only played in 14 games
* LG Quinten Nelson only played 13 games
* RT Braden Smith only played in 11 games
* WR TY Hilton only played in 10 games
* WR Paris Campbell only played in 6 games.

In fact, the only Colts offensive players to appear in all 17 games last season were: 

* QB Carson Wentz
* RB Jonathan Taylor
* RB Nyheim Hines
* WR Michael Pittman Jr.
* WR Ashton Dulin
* TE Jack Doyle
* TE Mo Alie-Cox
* TE Kylen Granson
* OT Matt Pryor

You can blame 2021 on Wentz all you want (Irsay sure seems content to do so) but the fact of the matter is, the offensive line was injury-prone as hell, our passing game was constantly being changed because of injuries, and we were one of the run-heaviest teams in the league last year. Wentz wasn't perfect, but he sure as hell wasn't as bad as the media portrays him. 

That was the same reason Philadelphia was such a train-wreck in 2020: Major injuries to almost every starter on the offensive line and in the WR room. Sure, you can make the ""great quarterbacks elevate the guys around them"" argument, but that requires consistency, something Wentz had none of in 2020 and minimal of in 2021.",-1.0,colts,t3_x7bjnl,False,1.0,COLTS,2022-09-06T14:24:16Z,colts,0.035684399986267

15628,115454,115454,RelentlessRogue,"So let me get this straight; this offseason the Browns have: 

1. Signed Jacoby Brissett, Joshua Dobbs, and Josh Rosen in Free Agency, none of whom they apparently trust to lead the team for 18 weeks.
2. Traded for DeShaun Watson, and gave him an insane amount of money
3. Traded away Baker Mayfield, and are going to pay him $10 million to beat them Week 1.

With all that said, the Browns are out: 

* Three first-round picks, one third-round pick, and two fourth-round picks that they sent to the Texans for Watson
* $230 million guaranteed to Watson over 5 years. 
* $4.5 million they guaranteed to their backup, Jacoby Brissett
* $10 million they're still paying Baker, after trading him, AFTER picking up his 5th year option. 
* Plus WHATEVER the 49ers can get out of them for Jimmy G. And don't forget that Cleveland will have to pay some, if not all, of his $24.2 million base salary

In total, over $240 million in guaranteed money, plus three first-round and three additional picks, PLUS whatever they need to trade to San Fran to acquire Jimmy G...

...all for the most controversial QB in the history of the NFL, who for all we know may never play another snap in his life, a conditional fourth rounder from Carolina, a 6th round pick from the Texans, the quickest collapse of a franchise in modern sports history, AND any respect the previously worst team in professional sports might have gained in the last 4 years. 

Every single person who signed off on that trade should be fired and banned from the league for gross incompetency, the ownership should be severely punished, and Watson should be suspended for at least as many games as Josh Gordon collectively has been, if not more.

>If our free agency is being held up by other teams, then trading Wentz was a mistake.  


What I mean by that is, we haven't made a single move in free agency (probably because nobody wants to play for a team without a starting QB), and it seems to be because Ballard is waiting to see where the other QBs fall before making moves. The problem is, anyone who thought we were serious contenders for Watson, Wilson, or Rogers, is delusional.

Second thing I do: I call Washington and cancel the damn trade. We're not finding a better QB than Wentz this year and I'd rather have him than nobody and a tank season. 

Third thing I'd do: Restructure Wentz's contract. Sure, we don't wanna pay him $28 million, but lowering his cap hit and adding a no-trade clause for the next say, 2-3 seasons, should solve our self-induced QB issues for a couple of years. 

Fourth thing I'd do: Toss a bag at Terron Armstead; let's solidify our line with the best available FA. While I'm shopping at the Big n Tall Linemen store, I'll sign Pryor as a swing tackle and get Chris Reed back to hold down RG. 

Fifth thing I'd do: Sign Juju Smith-Schuster to a 3 year deal, $10 mil/year average. Pray to the football gods that the Jags haven't completely fucked the receiver market and get a 1B to go along with our 1A Pittman. 

Sixth thing: Go get Casey Hayward to lock down the opposite outside corner spot from Rock. Give Rodgers another year as a solid backup and another vet to learn from. 

Seventh: Lock down some solid rotational players on defense. Bring back Zaire Franklin to be our 3rd LB; bring back Lewis, Muhammad, Stallworth, and Woods to be the 2nd string D-line. Make damn sure Odum doesn't go anywhere, either. 

Eighth: I'm damn near out of cap space, so I start doing GM bulllshit and restructuring contracts.  Stewart, Buckner, Moore, Kelly, hell, even Leonard and Smith, I'm calling them up and seeing what extra space they'll make for us. 

Ninth: More Cap Space! Perfect. I'll sign TY Hilton to a cheap 'I swear this is my last year' reunion tour, as is tradition. I'll go sign Corey Clement to be our 3rd RB, he's a Wisconsin guy and a former Eagle, what more could we ask for there? I'll also go get the Packer that nobody expected us to get: ISU alum Big Bob Tonyan. He'll be cheap coming off the ACL anyways, and god knows the Packers have no cap space. Hell, just for fun, I'll go out and get a veteran pass rusher too. Who'd you all prefer, should I go get Justin Houston for a 2nd round here in Indy? 

Tenth: Draft Day comes. I take a project LT in the second round to develop behind Armstead; in the third round, I grab David Bell, who's stock plummets because he ran a 4.6 at the combine. Don't worry, he'll be a 650 yard receiver as a rookie. In the 4th round I'll take an edge rusher nobody's ever heard of; 5th round, a safety. 6th round will be a sneaky good linebacker, and in the 7th I'll take an interior lineman.

2019 Wentz make it work with garbage recievers because the Eagles line was amazing and they had a great 1-2 run game with Sanders and Howard, along with Ertz and Goddert both at 100%. 

Considering Washington has Logan Thomas, Terry McLaren, Antonio Gibson, and a passable line, they should be just fine.

I don't know if anyone better then Fisher is realistic since we probably don't shell out 20 mil plus for Armstead. I'm good with signing him, bringing back Glow/Reed to play guard ([although Alex Cappa is intriguing as well](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/tampa-bay-buccaneers/alex-cappa-25193/#:~:text=Alex%20Cappa%20signed%20a%204,average%20annual%20salary%20of%20%24842%2C176)), and drafting a prospect in the 3rd/4th round that needs a year. 

I absolutely think we need to get a proven WR in free agency and take another one with our 2nd round pick. I will scream for David Bell at the top of my lungs, but this draft is so deep at receiver it'll be hard for us to not get good value there. Christian Kirk is a guy I could see Ballard signing, and I'm not against trading for Calvin Ridley either. 

Tight End is the lowest need of the 5 positions I listed; especially if Doyle runs it back. Re-signing Mo is gonna be important, and if either of them walk, we need to bring in a veteran presence at the position. I'm a big advocate of getting Zach Ertz, he has a relation with Frank and Wentz both and he's a high character guy. 

Currently our only Edge rushers are Kwitty, Dayo, Ben Banogu, and RJ Macintosh. We absolutely need some veteran depth & mentorship at the position. To a lesser extent, we also need DT depth, but Edge takes priority.

Seemed like Xavier/Rock would be the physical corner spot, Rodgers was the off man, and Kenny was lurking in the slot. The issue I had then was we lacked depth for those roles (not necessarily the players but what they were supposed to do as a part of the overall scheme).

All that to say this - whether or not we have ""depth"" depends on what's going to be asked of the corners. There's as much a chance Isaiah Rodgers is one of our top 2 corner as there is a chance he'll be #4 (since his glaring weakness is physicality). I really think we'll either draft a corner or a safety earlier than people think, and it'll either be the writing on the wall that Rodgers doesn't fit the new scheme OR that Khari Willis doesn't fit the new scheme.

Of course we saw that with Andrew but it was crossing my mind that really the same thing happened again with Phil. 

It will of course be interesting to see how the next two years go with Matt and what he ultimately decides or his health and performance provide in terms of longevity. Many already seem to be planning for him leaving in two years but that is very much yet to be determined. Regardless, Ballard has to decide how to approach this so that he isn't once again caught flat footed if it turns out we are in the market again soon. I expect that he will be looking for value in this and next year's draft and should someone fall to him he would pull the trigger. Saw this with Eason and Ehlinger. I wonder what we may have learned from those attempts. I think certainly we had to have taken something away from the Eason experience. 

If we aren't able to find a gem for cheap (seems unlikely), I just cant see us continuing to build and then when the time comes, leveraging multiple picks and assets to get to the top of the draft for an unknown rookie quantity ala San Fran. Ballard seems too in love with the draft to burn that many picks for a guy he isn't sure can play at a high level.

I don’t think the likelihood of injury increases dramatically with age. Football is a violent game and every play has potential of career ending injury for any player on the field. Matt Ryan should have one of the best OL’s he’s seen his entire career. If we had scrubs in the trenches I’d put weight into what you’re saying, but he’s managed to stay healthy with far less protection. I am not any more concerned with Ryan getting injured than I am with anybody else.",1.0,colts,t3_w2irb7,False,0.0,Edgerrin James,2022-07-19T12:05:58Z,colts,-0.0446337843925575
24828,165807,165807,chrismellor08,"The colts backup LT was honestly better than Fisher last year. He’s the starter this year. Glow will leave a hole in my opinion, but line depth has been a strength for the Colts and I think there is a good chance we see very little regression there. 

Hilton was absolutely not WR2. He hardly showed up. They drafted a young stud, have Campbell coming back from injury, and have talent that has developed another year. I’d say the WR room has improved. If (and it is a big if) Campbell can stay healthy, I think he will be on a level that nobody is expecting. He is incredibly talented. 

Julian Blackmon is a young safety who was playing lights out before he was injured last year. Incredible talent and probably one of the players I am most excited to see this year. Also the defensive scheme we expect to see from the new DC will allow Gilmore to play in a safety type role at times as well. The retirement wasn’t a huge loss, and they also added McLeod from the eagles who is still a very solid piece at safety. I see this as an overall improvement. 

To add on to all of this, Ngakoue may be on his fifth team but he has put up better numbers on all of those teams than we’ve seen from any EDGE guy in recent memory. He will be an upgrade. There is also the expectation that we see improvement from the 2 early round EDGE guys that were drafted last year. Paye started to look the part at the end of last season and I expect he will continue to develop into the first round level talent he was drafted to be. If there is more pressure from the outside, that reduces pressure on the secondary and should make the loss of Rock Ya-Sin much less impactful. 

Matt Ryan may be old, but I absolutely believe the dude can still play. One of the most important things about the passing offense Reich runs, that I wouldn’t expect casual colts fans or fans of other teams to realize, is that it is VERY much timing based. Carson Wentz was horrible at this. Like.. catastrophically bad. I think this is an area where Matt Ryan’s game is the strongest and I think he will compliment the system incredibly well. Though the WR room isn’t top in the league by any stretch, a quick and accurate quarterback, who isn’t afraid to hit a check down, should be able to make these guys shine. 

I will admit, I’m as big of a homer as they come. My rose colored classes are colts blue and I am convinced we are Super Bowl bound every single year. But. I also know football and I genuinely think that despite a lot of pieces being moved around, the colts have had a net improvement this off-season, and a pretty significant one.",44.0,colts,t3_w2irb7,False,0.0,Edgerrin James,2022-07-18T23:07:59Z,colts,0.0272937328029617

Second- Ballard has to do something to keep his job. I’m not saying he’s on the hot seat but it’s clear that if he brings in another mid-level vet qb that leads to us missing the playoffs he will be. That could potentially be the final nail. If you bring in a guy like Jimmy G and we miss the playoffs again, I think either the coach or the GM is gone. And I don’t think Jimmy G/Cousins/Minshew/Trubisky have shown you a single thing to give you the confidence to take that risk. You can’t gamble your career on another middle of the pack guy. Or at least I wouldn’t. So, assuming he wants to keep this job, he has basically two options. Find a young guy that can be developed into something better than Wentz within the next 1-3 years. Or. Yolo on a guy like Carr. If we bring in a young guy, maybe move up to draft one, he will have to trust his scouts and his gut that they’ve got the right guy. If he shows promise by the end of the season, that’s enough to keep fans happy and optimistic. If he doesn’t, he’s in trouble, but probably not gone since you can’t always make a decision on a rookie after year one. If he yolo’s on Carr and it works out, his job is safe for a while. If not, he’s gone since.. well… Yolo. IMO, What gives you the highest chance of keeping your job safe is bringing in a guy like Carr. He’s the safest bet. Regardless of what it costs. Either he risks it on a rookie in an especially subpar draft class or he mortgages the future on Carr. We already know that Carr checks most of the boxes. Unless he is SURE about a jimmy g type player, it seems to me that the lowest risk move, from a Ballard career standpoint alone, is going all out for Carr. If you’re risking it all no matter what you decide, wouldn’t you take the most likely path to a home run? Giving up a haul for Carr seems much more likely to work than literally anything else. We have the cap to put solid weapons out there for him. If we have the cap and the rest of the pieces in place then it’s worth the next couple early round picks.

Regardless of whether you want to hear it, it doesn't matter whether you or anyone else thinks it was a bad joke, in poor taste, too soon, or whatever. It was a joke. A joke is a joke. Some jokes are good, some are bad, some are funny, some aren't. That's all subjective. Chris Rock was hired to tell jokes, because he's a comic. For you or anyone to assume he wouldn't tell jokes at the expense of the guests is just silly, first off. The joke shouldn't even be a topic of discussion. The ONLY thing that should be discussed is how much of a loose canon Will Smith is. That's it.

You alleging it was a shitty thing to do and you don't know anyone who wouldn't agree is complete bullshit. It was a joke. Do you actually think Chris Rock has a personal vendetta against Jada Smith or people who are balding and intentionally made a joke directed at her with malicious intent? No! That's not what comics do ffs. How is this not understood by now?

And I think it was adlibbed if I had to guess. Like he saw her, and as we all know she's battling, what, alopecia."" Then he's confronted by one of the other guys on the set saying, ""Now we don't all know that."" Then Rich concedes that point and retorts with, ""Bottom line is, ok, it is well known for a bunch of people, and, you know, he takes a shot at her...""

That's the classic ""well I didn't think it was funny and it was a cheapshot"" argument. That's victim blaming in this specific scenario. Chris Rock is a comedian and the victim. Period. Part of his comedy is to rip on people. The GI Jane joke was, as he said, a nice one in the grand scheme of his comedy. It was a joke. Regardless of anyone's personal thoughts on the matter, it was a joke. Jokes are not to be taken seriously. Rich Eisen clearly doesn't understand this and his complete failure to understand the basic tenets of comedy. That mindset is how assholes like Will Smith wind up on stage slapping one of the greatest comics of all time.

So when Rich begins the discussion running through his thoughts on how awful the joke was and how he was taking shots at Jada Smith for her condition, he completely undermined everything else he said about the subject. It doesn't matter if Rich ultimately believes Will Smith's actions are inexcusable or not, despite it being an objective truth, when he inherently believes Chris Rock did anything wrong.

This is the point people don't seem to understand and why so many comedians are irate about what happened and how Will Smith essentially got away with it.

2. He's not going to prison. There will be no criminal prosecution, unless he fails to adhere to the terms of a potential settlement.

Having said all that, people really do need to chill the fuck out on this. Yes, I agree, 22 people coming forward with their story is suspicious. However, as you've alluded to, no one knows what actually happened. There are motivating factors on both sides for someone to falsify statements and to try to protect themselves or seek a pay day. And then there's also the possibility that he may have had encounters with them, and they consented at the time, and now they're trying to take advantage of him and by joining in seeking a pay day. Again, no one knows. These are all possibilities but yet people refuse to think logically and rationally about this and want to jump on the side that fits their narrative. With incidents like the Jussie Smollett trial just recently coming to and end you'd think people would be more cautious but apparently not.

32231,234208,234208,voyagerx420,"The simple fact is quarterback is priority. Doesn't mean it gets done first, but most of the teams' time should be spent on sorting out that situation.

Outside of the top tier quarterbacks that were available/potentially available, such as Rodgers and Wilson, no one is worth the ridiculous asking prices teams may be asking for certain QBs. Additionally, despite most people talking themselves into thinking other QBs who may be now available who really aren't worth anything and would be a Wentz 2.0 experience (cough Mariota, Mayfield, Jimmy G), there's just not much out there.

Ballard said he wants to do what's best for the team in the short and long term. Signing Mariota may fit that bill as he could potentially be signed for cheap and has starting experience, but I think we know his ceiling, which isn't the highest. From what I've heard, he's a great teammate and has proven he's willing to do what's best for the team, so I think he'd be a culture fit. He also intrigues me just from a scheme perspective. He'd be much more dynamic in Reich's offense than any of these other QBs since he has decent wheels. But holy hell is that an uninspiring idea. He'd be cheap enough the Colts could pay their own and bargain shop for free agents. 

Jimmy Garoppolo has the best resume as far as wins and experience, but his injury history and inconsistency is noteworthy. 

Baker Mayfield I think would be a waste of time. There are so many red flags with him, even more so than Wentz, that I just don't see how any Colts fan talked themselves into thinking he's a good idea.

My personal favorite of the quarterbacks who may still be available is Matt Ryan. He'd be the best fit culturally, his experience is great, he's won an MVP and been to a Super Bowl, and he's very intelligent and willing to do the right thing to make the team better. I see him as a slightly younger version of Philip Rivers. If they could get 3-4 years out of Ryan and look to find the next franchise QB in the meantime and/or find him in the first year or two of Ryan's tenure so he can learn from a consummate pro, that'd be ideal.
