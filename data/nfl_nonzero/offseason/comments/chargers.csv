1517,3626,3626,2wenty-3hree,"It was good to get back to SoFi stadium and see if anything has been changed or updated since last year. Parking felt just the same, maybe a bit slower for us getting into Pink lot (tailgate section) than last season but we didn‚Äôt arrive until 6:30. We didn‚Äôt plan to tailgate for this one. We come up from SD. 

Entering the stadium was smooth, they seem to have the devices to scan tickets improved. 

Lots of street vendors close to the stadium. Not sure if they will crack down. I don‚Äôt mind it. Loved they had hot dog carts already out before the game. It‚Äôs my favorite post game snack before the 2 hr journey home. 

Navigating the stadium for us now has gotten easier. They weren‚Äôt very strict on the Toyota Terrace so we were able to easily navigate to and from our seats without the up and down stairs/escalator it normally takes to get from one end to the other due to where we park and where our seats were. I am sure they will tighten that up ahead of the season opener. 

It was also a good way to rub in how much better the food is inside the Toyota Terrace and Club Level VIP sections. The concessions behind us had some new options for this year but it was still very much the same trash food we had last year. The cheese fries were really good though and I did see some much improved looking chicken strips and tots that we didn‚Äôt have. Club level had some bomb tacos and other more tasteful looking options. Very disappointing if after all the complaints they stick with the same utterly disgusting food they had in the concessions last year with the lack of normal stadium snack options including a food ice cream option. We have devised ways to sneak our food in and will continue to do so until the sort their shit out. 

The cookies are still our favorite and guaranteed go to! 

The team stores have some new options. I was bummed. We went to the cool satellite store by our seats to scan but knew we would hit the main Equipment Room on the way out. In the satellite store I found a couple sick hats I planned to purchase when we hit the main store only to find them not available there. But overall there were a ton of new and existing options and the prices have gone up as you could probably expect. But that‚Äôs where I have some advice. I compared pricing and found that buying online via the chargers team store (I navigate through the chargers app) will save you money on many products. Example was a pair of shorts I compared and some jerseys that were on avg about $10-$15 cheaper online!! So don‚Äôt just get excited and waste money at the store. 

Also, two other tips I have for you that some of you may or may not know. 1. If you have season tickets you get an additional 15% off products. You just present your ‚Äúmembership card‚Äù at checkout either in store or using the code that it has when buying online. They will not ask or remind you usually when checking out so make sure to remember. 

The membership card can be accessed via the chargers app under your profile. You need to make sure you are logged into the app via your ACCOUNT MANAGER login. I had a login for the app and then had my account manager linked to the app. Not the way to do it. Log out of your profile and login via the tap that says account manager and it will then show you the membership card option in the message center of your profile. DM me for screen shots. 

Also, this is a big one too that my wife and I have now done since getting our tickets ahead of last season. Apply for a SOFI Credit Card!! This not only gives you access to the SoFi entry lines into the stadium, it also gives you 25% cash back on all purchases you make at SoFi. Being it‚Äôs a cashless stadium, everyone can benefit from this. There is also a SoFi hospitality area we have yet to check out. I‚Äôm sure there other perks. 

Anyway this is a lot to type here lol but hope it helps a few of you save some money. If I think of anything else I‚Äôll share. 

Last thing. When we are defense, and I don‚Äôt care about preseason so much, but when the season starts‚Ä¶ GET F‚ÄôN LOUD PLEASE!!! Nothing is more depressing then when we are defense and it‚Äôs like a library in the stadium. Put your cool guy pride to the side and make some f‚Äôn noise and help our team create a real home field advantage for the first time since we were still in San Diego. 

Also - if you own SZN tickets. Please try to sell to chargers fans first if you need to sell!!

Are our potholes and homeless issues fixed? Nope. Hoteliers are still making their money though. Maybe Faulconer didn't interfere with the lies because he immediately announced SoccorCity as soon as the Bolts left. Chargers even offered to pay for overruns on their Measure C.

""They have since admitted there was no real money and it would have required another election even that hadn't been lying. But it's irrelevant because Ron Roberts has already confessed he was lying about County money.""

‚Äê----------------------

The vote could not have been county since City money and County money are two separate pots. Sadly, I had too many co-workers who live in SD city who could vote say they would vote no thanks to Petco Park screwing our tax payers over pretty good in the early 2000s with overruns. 

I was very upset when the Bolts moved but at the same time I understood why. I followed that stadium saga from being a young teenager until when they moved. I remember my dad explaining it to me as a 14 year old in 2004 how if we won a Superbowl it would help convince all to build the new stadium. I decided I wasn't going to let inept politicians and a businessman ruin what I love doing with my family every fall. StubHub was a fun tailgate and unique stadium but constsntly being over ran sucked. Us moving to SoFi has really reinvigorated myself and family with loving the whole experience. Home field advantage. Fun tailgating. Big stadium. It takes us back to the prime years at the Q. 

Also, I live in Oceanside and the stadium is 1.5 hours away so for most San Diegans I would guess its 2 hours away. I work in San Diego city and it takes me about 30-35 minutes to get to downtown on a Sunday. 

Also, the Chargers did offer in 2004 and 2006 to build the complete stadium by themselves just for a discounted price on the Mission Valley land. SD said no. I believe 28/32 teams rent a stadium so please don't come at me with the rental rebuttle

Herb isn't a one-trick pony like Michael Vick & other speedster quarterbacks. He has the accuracy of Peyton with the strength of Rodgers, so not only is he mobile, he is an excellent pocket passer.

Herb is a good kid. He has his head screwed on straight, so I don't anticipate him having legal trouble, PED issues or just general irresponsibility. He's the kind of kid you can expect 15-20 years of year in year out performance.

Finally, he seems rather cognizant of what's going on around him on the field, so he is less likely to get clobbered and injured to a point where it will negatively impact his playing ability. So he should last a good long while.

The Bolts got lucky with Justin Herbert, my friends. We could see him pulling Tom Brady levels of longevity, provided we give him the on-the-field protection he needs.

I would definitely look to lock him up before he can hit free agency. Right now, Herb is the face of the Chargers, like LT once was.",17.0,chargers,t3_x14wgu,False,0.0,None,2022-08-29T22:14:00Z,chargers,0.0351249126680428

It was part (along with the JC Jackson signing, obviously) of what moved Michael Davis to the likely CB4 going into training camp. The previous CB1 going into 2021.

The fact that Davis has been getting a lot of first team reps on the outside, versus ASJ, is a VERY good sign. Davis was disappointing last year, but coaches have said the whole time it's gonna be a competition - they wouldn't be giving him those reps if he didn't earn it. So Davis & ASJ or Callahan starting on the outside, with ASJ/Callahan in the slot looks like a much better proposition than it would going into training camp.

1) Inexcusable INTs during a couple game stretch during the regular season - and it was during crunch time too. Playoff crunch time - when seeding and playoff berths are on the line.

2) We all saw what McVay was able to do with Goff. They guy is a great offensive coach. He was able to make Goff look like a much better quarterback than he is/was.

3) The rankings do their best to remove the QB from the team, and judge them on their own. I think Stafford has always been in that tier 2 spot.

9461,48682,48682,DrewDonut,"Even from a cryptocurrency perspective Bitcoin is completely impractical and outdated. The limited number of transactions will keep from ever becoming something viable. The fact that Bitcoin was basically a proof of concept project, that then became THE cryptocurrency, shows that a vast majority of boosters are not interested in it for it's intended purposes and its special properties for that purpose (like giving the ability to people in 3rd world countries access to some sort of banking that traditional banks won't service). It's already outgrown it's capabilities, but it can't be moved away from because it is entrenched as THE bitcoin, and it's making them too much money.

And those same boosters will say it is the currency of the future, and then treat is like a speculative asset. The best joke I saw about this was ""pulling out my dollar bill and whispering 'to the moon! to the moon!' before every transaction."" People just need to admit that 90% of people into crypto are just into trading it (aka gambling). There's nothing wrong with trading assets, it's just people need to realize you can lose with regular stocks, and bitcoin, but if you lose - you'll lose your house a lot faster with bitcoin than even an aggressive stock portfolio.

When it's clear that a significant majority of cryptocurrency stuff out there is a scam, it's a bad thing, it makes it hard to take it seriously, and it becomes a joke. The problem is that there are some legitimate people who are into it out there, but essentially they end up unwittingly giving cover for the grifters.

And it's massive carbon footprint basically makes any small positives for it completely irrelevant. Who needs a currency for the future when the future is the world on fire?

Even with Ethereum and their ""smart contracts,"" it doesn't change anything. It was held up as a potential future for contracts; example being that artists often get screwed by record labels and ""smart contracts"" could help prevent this type of thing. Bullshit.

To say one is smarter than the other at this point is unfair as Justin is only in his second year. Rivers sat behind Brees for his first two so he wasn‚Äôt adjusting at the line at that point either. Who is smarter remains to be seen with time but I‚Äôm glad to have had both as my QB ü•π",3.0,chargers,t3_x5tbh7,False,0.0,former Staley apologist,2022-09-04T21:21:23Z,chargers,0.07182426657723

13611,75934,75934,JSchnizzle,"My point is that you can't really encapsulate everything in just one Stat. You have to consider these stats in context of each other along with the film and other intangible factors. Yes herbert has marginally worse efficiency stats in several key ways but when you look at the volume of both qbs and where that volume largely came from I think you get a slightly better idea of why herbert is imo better than dak. Even if his numbers were only very slightly better in terms of volume when you look at where that volume was being produced you can see how much running up the score in those specific games helps dak's argument as, if you just take his volume stats at face value, yes he would seem to be a better qb but when you consider how much of that volume actually mattered you can see why herbert is so highly valued. To me, Herbert's volume in context of his still very good efficiency in addition to his record tell me that he was asked to do more for his team to put them in a position to win than dak was.

Not to mention the film and stuff like that where most film analysts I've seen seem to rate herbert extremely highly and his physical traits are obviously superior so you kinda have to take into context how much that opens up the playbook even if that isn't super visible to fans. That's not to say stats are useless or anything like that but part of the beauty of football is how much of it isn't really objectively quantifiable so imo any discussion of how good a qb is where you don't consider how they look on film and the specific contexts of individual games misses a large part of the equation.",1.0,nfl,t3_wueppx,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-08-21T22:06:34Z,chargers,0.1342306181947997
13612,75936,75936,JSchnizzle,"Imo it's worth noting that a lot of dak's numbers came from beating up on shitty nfc east teams and running up the score, not to say that herbert didn't benefit either as the chargers did play the nfc east this year but dak put up a huge amount of his volume stats against really shitty teams late in the season or when the games didn't really matter anymore for at least one of the teams or just against teams that were just not very good last year. Like obviously I'm a very casual fan and I'm a chargers fan so I can't know for sure but the cowboys were putting up 40 and 50 burgers against teams like the commies when they were already out of the playoffs, the eagles who I think already locked up their playoff spot in week 18, and the falcons. Imo even if dak slightly edges out herbert in the vast majority of statistical categories that difference is more than made up for by how much of those stats come from shitting all over significantly worse opposition. Not to mention stuff like epa where herbert significantly outrank dak which imo demonstrates just how much he carried that chargers roster even if it seemed very talented last year when you just look at the names.

Not to mention herbert just has more highlight reel plays and significantly better arm. Imo it's kind of hard to quantify exactly what it is that makes herbert significantly better beyond like ""just watch his games bruv"" and like look at what teams they played when most of those stats were accumulated. Herbert's highest scoring games last season were nailbiters where they literally came down to the final couple drives and he had to singlehandedly drag his team kicking and screaming to wins whereas dak's highest volume games in terms of scoring were in games where the cowboys blew out the other team and imo a lot of his numbers were ""empty numbers"" in a similar sense to how we view garbage time stats from the losing qb.",1.0,nfl,t3_wueppx,False,1.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-08-21T20:23:43Z,chargers,-0.0512203702781761

Context matters and herbert was dragging his teams to victory and any game he was off they lost. If herbert threw 4 ints in a game his team would've let up 50 points for sure. Stats get talked about so often because they are one of few relatively objective ways to measure an individual players performance in a game where the team matters so much. I think it's fine and I even welcome people debating lamar over herbert if you can talk about stuff on the field like ""oh I value lamar's legs and ability to make defenses have to adjust"" or ""oh I think herbert too often misses or doesnt throw with touch on short throws"" stuff like that that requires actual analysis but holy fuck can we get some criticism that doesn't revolve around ""he just doesn't winzzzzz"" as if Ben fucking Roethlisberger played better than herbert last year because the steelers made the playoffs.",-2.0,nfl,t3_wub4i5,False,1.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-08-21T19:04:35Z,chargers,0.1104082840363511

*In December, when Herbert rolled deep to his right and calmly heaved a deep ball that traveled 61.2 air yards (per NFL Next Gen Stats) across the field for a Jalen Guyton touchdown against the Bengals, I texted a screenshot of the play to a high-ranking NFL source.*  
  
*""You'll become less and less surprised as the game goes,"" the source said. ""He'll be the best QB in the game.""*  
  
*The following week, Herbert rolled out to his right and made perhaps the play of the year, throwing the ball 63.8 air yards -- via NFL Next Gen Stats tracking -- while being tackled from behind to hit Guyton in stride for a score against the Giants.*

*Winning helps in the voting, which explains Herbert's standing. The two quarterbacks ahead of him are coming off the Super Bowl, while Herbert's Chargers fell short of the playoffs. But he probably won't be outside the top five for long. Consider that his 65.6 QBR last season was No. 3 in the NFL, behind only Rodgers and Brady.*

*Since entering the league in 2020, Herbert has the second-most completions (839) and attempts (1,267), along with the third-most passing yards (9350). He also ranks fifth in passing touchdowns (69), and his 25 completions gaining 40 or more yards trail only Stafford.*

*Highest ranking: 4 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10*

*Long unheralded in Green Bay, Linsley was a catalyst for the Chargers after signing a five-year, $62.5 million deal in free agency in 2021. The Chargers believe Linsley was worth every cent as a calming force for quarterback Justin Herbert.*

*Here's the best way to quantify Linsley's value: The Chargers ranked fourth in the NFL in expected points added at 116.4, a sizable jump from the previous year's 14th-ranked EPA (99.42). Internally, the Chargers credit Linsley as a big part of that jump.*  
  
*""I think for what they do, he's the best center because he's so smart and instinctive that he makes life easier for Herbert,"" said a high-ranking NFL official unaffiliated with the team.

15158,85986,85986,LedZepp42,"from his nfl draft profile: 

&#x200B;

Overview  
Interior lineman who plays with heavy hands to pop and separate for an early advantage, but heavy feet that prevent him from doing enough with it. He can handle some of the heavy lifting, but not all. Ogbonnia will flash as a one-technique or tilted nose but lacks the pad level and parking brake to hold it down as a 3-4 nose. He has very average quickness and does not profile as a mismatch defender. He is not an NFL pass-rush threat. He had splashy moments at the Senior Bowl and has a shot as a backup 4-3 nose but could offer some position flexibility for teams running varied fronts.  
Strengths           
Dense body type with proportional limbs and thickness.  
Good worker with high football character.  
Talented shot-putter with explosive hips.  
Length and strength to set an edge and spill the run.  
Fires punch through blocker's pads for point-of-attack separation.  
Slides and swims into the A-gap for quick win.  
Uses forceful rip power through the edge as rusher.  
Possesses adequate bull-rush potential.  
Weaknesses         
Just a single season as a full-time starter.  
Struggles to maintain lowered pad level.  
Early movements are too elongated.  
Lacks agility and plays with heavy feet.  
Base fails to stay rooted to the ground.  
Has trouble maintaining balance on the move.  
Fairly easy to elude if he finds the pocket.",29.0,chargers,t3_ufh9nc,False,0.0,13,2022-04-30T13:44:10Z,chargers,0.0200158571881334

Second, you could tell by the first drive of his career that everything everybody had said about him to that point was wrong. No joke, he just cut through that defense like a knife through butter. He was making throws with anticipation, poise, accuracy, he was running the ball, knocking out linebackers (ok that was a few drive later). He was threading the needle and getting the ball to Keenan, and Herbert had never thrown a pass to him, even in practice. It was great. 

He didn't pull of the win, but there's no shame in losing in OT to the defending SB champs in a spot start. Even setting aside it was a loss, I don't think I've had that much fun during a game over the past few seasons.

20640,110125,110125,Orgasmo3000,"Yes, Tom Telesco is going into his 10th (& final contracted year) as General Manager or GM. 

The team's budget is determined by ""the cap"". This is the total amount of money teams are allowed to spend on NFL players in a given year. This number is set by the NFL HQ and is the same for all teams. Teams can be under the cap, but they cannot be over the cap. Unused money can roll over to the following season.  

If a team is over the cap, they either need to renegotiate player contracts or let players go (even if they're good players) in order to bring their team budget under the cap. A good website for figuring this out is called OverTheCap.com.

No, being drafted doesn't guarantee playing in games. Think of the draft as a really long job hiring process. Job recruiters (i.e. team scouts) travel the country all year looking for the best applicants (college football players) for the job openings (football positions) they have. The ones they like best, they call for an initial interview. This interview is the draft. 

Basically, each team's GM and Head Coach is telling each player they draft ""OK, you've impressed us. Now prove you can do the samething at a higher level & we'll give you the job, but you'll have competition (from veteran players & undrafted free agents) & you're going to have to fight to prove yourself.""

So starts rookie minicamp, Organized Team Activities (OTAs) & training camp.  All these 3 combine to form one long probationary period of on-the-job training. The players who stand out from the rest are chosen to be part of the 53-person roster. They got the job. They may not be a starter (i.e. guaranteed to play), but they're officially on the team.

Those who spent the entire training camp with the team only to be cut, do not make the team. (Usually these are undrafted free agents or veteran players. If a team cuts a recently drafted player, the team's scouts didn't do their job very well, so that's not likely to happen.) Thus, they have even less of a guarantee to play with that team. They may make it onto the practice squad (think of it as an apprenticeship or paid internship), with a hope of being elevated to the team though, so they still have a shot at playing games.

o lineman are graded on pressures given up and consistency.

The Holy Grail of Chargers hats. I was able to snipe this one from Poshmark last year and I didn't have to pay out the ass for it. It's a 9Forty stretch. It doesn't fit the greatest (growing my hair out) but it'll be in my collection for a long time.

The black on black is another one I wear a lot. It's my only standard 59Fifty so I'm trying to get used to the look but I enjoy it.

Chargers have 5(?) new starters on defense though and they were 10th against the pass last year but were atrocious vs the run, 30th in the league. They were also worst in the NFL on 3rd down because early down runs often left short yardage and 3rd and short was like a give me for 2-3 yards by the RB.

I think the reason a lot of Chargers fans are really hype is the improvement against the run and players that can run Staleys scheme. Khalil Mack was #1 at his position at stopping the run and Sebastian Joseph Day was #1 heighest run stuff % in all the NFL under Staley.

27920,155253,155253,TrueJP,"TLDR: Last year, teams could dictate the terms of key moments on both sides of the ball because our personnel was still comprised of players meant to fit previous coaches' schemes, not Staley's. This is unlikely to be the case in 2022.


I think you're asking if the defense will implement scheme changes away from the lighter boxes and heavy DB sets of last year. Of course you may also be asking about the scheme change from Bradley's Seattle defense to Staley's Fangio-inspired, Rams defense.

In either case the answer is the same: last year's personnel matched Bradley's defense, not Staley's. There were two issues here.

First, we didn't have the versatility from our personnel. Staley uses a lot of disguised fronts which have to be equally effective against run or pass. The idea is that you rely on post snap rotation to confuse the opposing offense. In theory you don't even need world beaters, just versatility; equally good, run v pass, a bunch of hybrid safeties and LBs. Last year we had too many traditional position players. CBs who couldn't stop the run. LBs who could defend the pass. It didn't matter how well we disguised our front because opposing offenses could count on even our run heavy sets being ineffectual due to personnel. And in those obvious running downs, they could either ram it down or throat or exploit or LBs. That shouldn't be the case this year given our additions.

Second, we consistently failed to control the line of scrimmage, especially in the later downs. Particularly in influencing what part of the line would be contested. 

Teams would just double Bosa and throw or run away from Derwin/ASJ, exploiting our lack of depth and neutralizing our best defensive players. There was too much relative safety in too many parts of the field.

I'd also add, we had a similar problem offensively. For us, the right side of our O line suffered via lack of talent and injuries. The Raiders game showed just how much influence a single weak spot (RT) can have in limiting options offensively. 

Overall, there's reason to expect this Chargers team will be very different than previous years.

I'll admit it's still an open question whether Staley's system works without a generational DL player to disrupt the point of attack. He had prime Mack (Bears, in Fangios D) and AD (Rams). Bosa and Mack may not be enough if either has lost a step or gets injured. But, this doesn't seem as likely and they're not the only additions.

On offense, there is concern that Telesco has a history of blowing his offensive line selections. But, these were almost exclusively later round picks (he's been open about not valuing early round offensive linemen). Staley has influenced him these past two drafts and that's worked out so far (Slater). I believe it's reasonable to expect this continues.

Lastly, are injuries and our cursed luck. I'd refer you to the ""All-In,"" YT docuseries the team puts out, for both. It gives a good accounting of how Staley is completely changing the team culture and organizational structure. It also gets into the recovery programs he's implemented. This and the depth we've added this off-season should greatly reduce the risk of injuries.",5.0,chargers,t3_uuqhdb,False,0.0,ASAP,2022-05-21T13:11:26Z,chargers,-0.0089669746091265

30220,164229,164229,WyldeBolt,"A combination of bad luck, shitting the bed, overachieving and running into a superior opponent, or not capitalizing on windows of opportunity. 

The 1979 Chargers shat the bed in the Divisional Round against a Houston Oilers team that was missing like half their starters, including Earl Campbell, to injuries. Fouts also threw 5 ints, although there's rumors that the Oilers coaching staff stole Coryell's hand signals for the offense. Another fact about this particular Chargers team that also rubs salt in the wound was that during the regular season, they would defeat the Rams and Steelers 40-16 and 35-7, respectively. Both of those teams would go on to play in that year's Super Bowl (Super Bowl XIV). The first window is open. 

The 1980 Chargers lost at home in the AFC Championship game to the Wild Card Oakland Raiders, who would then go on to handily defeat the Eagles in Super Bowl XV. 

The 1981 postseason was the one that featured both the Miracle in Miami and the Freezer Bowl. Star DE Fred Dean also got traded to the 49ers during the season, so their already-shaky defense got even worse. 

1982 was a strike-shortened season. They made the playoffs, but lost in the divisional round to the Dolphins. 

Leading up to the 1983 Draft, Dan Fouts had a contract dispute, and the team almost traded him along with additional first round picks to the Colts for the chance to draft John Elway, but it turned out that the team was not really serious about the trade; they simply leverage in the contract negotiations. Fouts would get an extension and remain with the team until his retirement in 1988. We all know what happens with Elway. The window ends up slamming shut, and the Chargers would not make the playoffs again until 1992. 

ETA: Fouts also missed 6 games in '83, supposedly due to getting shot in the arm. The story goes, that he and possibly a teammate or two (either Chuck Muncie, Hank Bauer, and/or Doug Wilkerson, it always changes) went to a woman's condo to ""party,"" only for the woman's husband to come home early. Obviously upset, due to the lack of an invite, the enraged husband would then shoot Fouts in the arm. The San Diego police then supposedly covered it up, due to the amount of drugs that were found, and to spare Fouts the embarrassment. To this day, Fouts vehemently denies that this happened. 


'92 to '96 was the Bobby Ross and Stan Humphries era. They made the playoffs 3 times, made it all the way to Super Bowl XXIX after the '94 season, only to get curb stomped by Steve Young, Ricky Watters, and Jerry Rice. Honestly, these teams were not in the same class as the Bills, and probably not have done well against the NFC teams, either, as shown by Super Bowl XXIX. The window opened, but only a tiny bit. 

2004, they make the playoffs, and this is when the window start to break back open. Despite trading for Philip Rivers, the fire is lit under Drew Brees' ass and he plays well. Antonio Gates breaks out, and we're all reminded for the next 14 years that he was a college basketball player. Nate Kaeding shits the bed (this would become a recurring theme) in the Wild Card round vs the Jets. Even if they had won, I am doubtful that they would've beaten that year's Steelers or Patriots teams. 

2005, despite defeating a Colts team in Week 15 that was, up until that point, undefeated, LT would suffer injuries, and they would drop the final two games, and miss the playoffs. Drew Brees also suffers his shoulder injury in the final game of the season vs the Broncos, resulting in him departing in free agency. Who knows if they do damage in the playffs, maybe they do. 

2006, enter Philip Rivers. Now THIS was certainly the most disappointing season. The window is wide open again. 14-2. Probably the most complete team in Chargers history. LT breaking records. And then Divisional Round vs the Patriots happens. It's not just Marlon McCree fumbling a pick or Nate Kaeding being Nate Kaeding. Eric Parker was muffing punts. Marty decided to stop running LT in the second half. Rivers threw 3 picks. A shit show all around. Also doesn't help that after the game, a bunch of Patriots players (supposedly led by Ellis Hobbs) decide to do Shawne Merriman's Light's Out dance on the midfield logo. Fuck Ellis Hobbs. Had they held onto the lead and defeated the Patriots, the AFC Championship game would've taken place in San Diego and they would've played either the Ravens, or Colts, with the latter being a much more favorable matchup. They would've easily defeated the Bears in that year's Super Bowl, let's be honest here. 

ETA: Tensions between Marty Schottenheimer and then-GM AJ Smith would finally come to a head, with Marty losing the power struggle. He gets replaced with Norv Turner. For all his talent at drafting and finding UDFAs, AJ was definitely not a people person. Smith being a hard-ass GM will end up biting him in the ass later

2007, they make it to the AFC Championship game, but with LT, Rivers, Antonio Gates, and Shawne Merriman all playing injured, they can't defeat the then-undefeated Patriots. They did play them close, though, losing 21-12. Maybe a healthy roster gets them past the Patriots, and possibly a Super Bowl victory. 

2008, their defense takes a massing dive with Shawne Merriman missing the whole year due to his ACL injury (and not being the same player, afterwards), and with Antonio Cromartie playing with injuries. They barely make the playoffs with an 8-8 record. Win the Wild Card round vs the Colts, but lose to the eventual Super Bowl champion Steelers in the next round. They were clearly not the best team in the conference that year, but the window is still open

2009, despite a rocky start, they finish 13-3 and get the 2nd Seed in that year's playoffs. Lose at home in the Divisional Round vs the Jets, with Nate Kaeding missing kicks (again) and Shonn Greene running wild. LT's last game as a Charger. Also, keep in mind, from 2004 to 2009, they would have a 28-8 record against their divisional rivals, including a 13-game winning streak against the Raiders, starting from the 2003 season. This kind of success vs the rest of the AFC West would change at the turn of the century. 

2010, this is the ""1st in Offense and Defense but missed the playoffs"" season. Of course, we all know that bad special teams inflated those stats and contributed to them missing the playoffs; at least 4 games were lost due to bad coverage, blocked kicks, missed FGs, etc. Winning at least one of them would've put them in the playoffs. It also didn't help that they would get their shit kicked in Week 16 vs a Bengals teams that would finish 4-12. Maybe this team would've defeated the Jets, Patriots or Steelers that year? They played that 14-2 Patriots team close in the regular season, losing mainly in part to (you guessed it) bad special teams. 

ETA: Pro Bowl Left Tackle Marcus McNeil and breakout WR Vincent Jackson both had contract disputes with the team, and had lengthy holdouts that would last well into the 2010 season, mostly due to AJ Smith's stubbornness. 

2011, they finish with an 8-8 record and in a three-way tie with the Broncos and Raiders, only for the Broncos to win the division due to tiebreakers. This was also the year where Rivers fumbled a snap in FG range (contrary to popular belief, it was NOT a kneeldown) vs the Chiefs on Halloween night, which resulted in a loss. They also lost one game vs the Broncos by 3 points during Tebowmania. Had one of those games gone their way, they'd be in the playoffs. Dunno if they would've gotten past that year's Pats team with Gronk breaking records, although they did handily defeat that year's Ravens team. This is where I believe their window of opportunity shuts, pretty much for good for the rest of the decade. 

ETA: All-Pro Guard Kris Dielman and Marcus McNeil both suffer career-ending injuries during this season. The Chargers would then struggle put together another high-quality offensive line for the rest of Rivers' tenure as the Chargers starting QB. 

2012, Peyton joins the Broncos. 2013, Andy Reid joins the Chiefs, with both Alex Smith and Patrick Mahomes starting at QB up until now. They've only made the playoffs twice during this span, and would suffer losing seasons for the first time since 2003. 2012, they finish 7-9, despite a 3-1 start, with both Norv Turner and AJ Smith getting fired at the season's end. 2013 had a wild card berth, due to a rejuvinated Rivers and rookie Keenan Allen, but also a lot of luck and tiebreakers. They win in the first round vs the Bengals, but lose to the Peyton-led Broncos. There were flashes in 2014, but ended up losing out towards the end of the season and missing the playoffs entirely. There were rumors that Rivers suffered a back injury early in the season vs the Jets, affecting his play down the stretch, and severe enough to where almost considered retiring after the season. 2015 and 2016 were a shitshow, with relocation discussions going on, Eric Weddle's antics, and a struggling Melvin Gordon. The rest of the AFC West takes advantage of this. 2017, they move to LA, start 0-4, but rebound. They were in contention for winning the division in 2018, but ended up with a Wild Card berth. They lose to the Patriots (again). Losing record in 2019, with it being Rivers' last season as a Charger. 

That being said, there's some hope in the Herbert era. The team is finally in a position to cash in on an all-world QB whose on a rookie contract. The past two seasons, they've invested in oline (signing Corely Linsley and Matt Feiler as FAs and drafting Rashawn Slater), as well some defensive help (trading for Khalil Mack, signing JC Jackson, among other additions). Hopefully this actually translates to post-season success, but the AFC West looks to be way tougher, certainly not like the mid to late 2000s.",40.0,nfl,t3_vxbrsj,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers,2022-07-12T15:19:24Z,chargers,0.0073222103432216

30251,164281,164281,WyldeBolt,"Basically here are the main points that I saw and remembered:

1. Weddle ***HIMSELF*** was the one himself who said, during the 2015 preseason that if he was not signed to an extension by the end of that summer, he and his representation would cease all negotiations with the team and consider that season to be his last. This was after Telesco himself said that he and his agent spoke, but did not want to pay him a third contract at his asking rate (which already amongst the top safety salaries in the league), but were open for a more favorable price, or to revisit once the season ended. So for him to go on and say that the Chargers were the ones who discarded makes no sense, given that he and his agents were the ones who walked away from negotiations completely. 

2. After that, Weddle's agent throughout the season would completely trash Brandon Flowers on Twitter, saying that he sucked and that he didn't deserve an extension. A few years after this, the same agent did an AMA on r/nfl, and did a 180, and refused to trash or criticize the team, which makes me believe that he was just acting as a mouthpiece for his client. 

3. We have the halftime show incident with his daughter. Weddle claims it was unfair that he got fined for skipping out on halftime meetings to watch his daughter, even though BOTH Mike Scifres and Antonio Gates watched their kids and didn't get fined. Both of them also insinuated in later interviews Weddle knew what he was doing and expected to get fined (most likely because he was in ""I ran out of fucks to give"" mode at that point), and were confused as to why he would complain about it. Which brings me to the next point. 

4. He only brought up the fine weeks after happened, when he got placed on IR (supposedly against his wishes), and according to his agent, he might've tried ""blackmailing"" the team by saying he was going to go public with news of the fine if they placed him on IR, and they basically called his bluff on it. 

5. After the season ended and he was still meeting with other teams, he apparently got really upset when it was announced that Gates got an extension and he didn't, and either to the SDUT or BleacherReport, he called Gates a ""cheater"" and didn't deserve an extension (he got suspended for PEDs earlier in the season) and went on a mini NiceGuy^TM rant. This was probably influenced by Gates' comments from Point 3.

Mini-note: There were also stories where he threw Rivers under the bus after a loss at press conferences, and instances where he made fun of Jason Verrett's injuries, but I haven't been able to corroborate these. 

7. When King Dunlap got released because of injuries, in 2016, he sent out a really passive-aggressive Tweet saying that the Chargers always ""tossed legends aside"" or something to that effect, even though the context was completely different. 

8. When the team moved to LA, he tried getting a bunch of San Diegans to become Ravens fans, only to delete his Tweets when people pointed out the irony. 

9. When Derwin James got drafted, he liked a bunch of Tweets from his fans, saying that Derwin would never be an All-Pro or as good a safety as him because ""he lacked intelligence and leadership qualities"" 

10. He suspiciously did not freak out when the Ravens ended up releasing him due to declining play, and was rumored to be in danger of getting cut by the Rams before retiring the first time. 

11. Of course, there's the incident of calling out Telesco, unprompted, right after winning the Super Bowl, where even former teammates like Shawne Merriman criticized him for doing so.",6.0,chargers,t3_tpdsx6,False,0.0,Chargers,2022-03-27T18:35:05Z,chargers,0.0298786667366997

Eventually my buddies and I got into playing football video games a lot. Playing different franchises here and there was a total blast and we would be up all night doing that. 

Then came NFL Fever 2004 (which btw was super underrated as a football game still to this day). My buddy and I started our own franchise as we usually did and we would usually do a fantasy draft.  Week 1 came around and I got DESTROYED by LT.  I‚Äôm thinking it was like 200+ yards and multiple TDs.  After that game and the week was up, I said.. I don‚Äôt care who I have to give away.. I‚Äôm getting that dude in my team. And did just that and was pretty much love at first site. 

From that point I looked him up and was floored by how good he was. I made a point to see how many games or highlights I could see for the following season and I was off. While looking him up I learned a bit about players outside of him like Brees, Jammer, Donnie Edwards, Lorenzo Neal and was just super excited. I remember reading about some undrafted guy the Chargers grabbed named Antonio Gates but didn‚Äôt think much of it because he was primarily a basketball player. üòâ

33160,192019,192019,bt3k,"If you want an actual answer to your question is that we moderate pretty closely to our published rules.  Some other reasons are:

\-Low-effort memes. Sure, not all memes are removed, but at least put some effort into your shitposts and you'll be rewarded if you put at least an ounce of creativity into it.

\-Threads that are addressed by a mega-thread. Same as posts when there is a Gameday/Postgame thread. We'll be doing this until the end of time and we feel strongly about it so don't go chasing waterfalls. Stick to the rivers and the lakes like you're used to.

\-Discussion about players that have zero connection or chance of joining the Chargers. If only you knew how many ""What if we traded a 20th round pick for Jalen Ramsey and sign him for a five hundred year contract and pay him in olive garden breadsticks?"" type of posts are removed on the daily. This also includes wild speculation about situations that will never exist. No, we will not be trading up to the #1 spot. Sounds crazy, but there have been threads.

\-""How many of you followed the team from San Diego and why are you still a fan"" Every. Damn. Week.

\-Threads that really shouldn't be threads. i.e. ""I think we'll win the Super Bowl"" <eom>. Cool story Gary. I hope so too.

There are probably more but the majority of them fall within these. Hate us if you must, but I hope you understand how much inane bullshit gets posted as we get more popular, which just increases the threshold for what is considered a quality post. And despite what some people say, you probably actually want to see quality posts on the sub and not an unmoderated wasteland. We've tried it before. There's pain behind these eyes, trust me.

If you have a post removed, just modmail us and ask us why. More often than not if you're not an asshole in modmail and have a genuine concern, the md who took it down will tell you why. There's usually a reason. Or you know, create more threads like this I guess. Or complain to my manager. They'll take it out of my paycheck.

Forget the specifics of the interactions with such a player thus far, it's not a slap in the face to guage the market on players who aren't going to get snatched up early anyway. It can be if you go about it whatever way you're imagining, but it's not like players aren't signed late annually, and it's not like that can only be the result of not having a plan or every plan you had falling through.

The same as they've done enough homework to have a sense of who may or may not fall, they also likely have a sense of what players will still be available post-draft and what players may or may not get cut post-draft. Keeping one of those players as a backpocket option would still align with having a targeted gameplan for the offseason. That's my whole thing. You make signing someone late and planning to be mutually exclusive, but I'm just not seeing why that has to be the case.

Aside from the situational nuance we spoke of, I just try not to separate strategy and execution anymore. Tbh the fact of the matter is it would‚Äôve been a good play call had we made it.

I just feel like not every 4th down is worth going for and I do believe Staley feels differently.

2) 4 times against the chiefs - not all were bad but the one at the end of the half was as atrocious and if it‚Äôs not working on 4th that consistently you adjust and take points.

42680,241809,241809,miquiztli8,"Yes. I might be completely wrong, but the Rams haven‚Äôt ‚Äúthroughly‚Äù conquered the Los Angeles market IMO. If you watched the NFC championship game last year when they played the 49ers, there was 75% red in the stands. Los Angeles is a transplant city so there‚Äôs going to be fans for a ton of different teams, and sadly Raiders and 49ers fans make up a huge portion of these fans at the moment. The Rams and Chargers aren‚Äôt the most popular NFL team or sports team in general in LA, at least not yet. 

However, the Chargers have the most potential when it comes to picking up new fans. We have a charismatic, elite young QB for the next 15+ years and a lot of really young elite pieces who are going to make our team really exciting. Plus our marketing and social media teams are the best in sports, which in today‚Äôs day and age, will 100% help to bring in younger fans. The Rams on the other hand, have an old QB and a lot of their top level talent are getting older too. Not to mention, their shitty cap situation and no high end picks for the foreseeable future.

People and the media and the league are wrong on prospects all the time.

I'd rather pay middling money for a vet rental and see how it goes, and let the new staff next season pick the QB they want to develop instead pf being stuck with whoever from this regime.

Yes most people say willis now but pickett and corral are both given top rankings depending on who's scouting/making the list.

The closer we get, the more convinced I am that Carolina will do something else with the 6 pick, and that takes the pressure off Atlanta.

I also think the saints just need cheaper talent now with their cap craziness and they seem to think they can just bolster the roster around a hopefully healthy Winston. They need a WR bad, hell they might need to draft a couple.

The Steelers at 20 are clearly interested in Willis, so he will go if still available.

Trey McBride; Colorado State: The dude tops PFF‚Äôs TE draft rankings after a great season, has a basketball background which we all love for our TEs. He had 109 yards of his team‚Äôs 110 receiving yards in a game against Toledo. Even when everyone knew he was the guy to stop, they couldn‚Äôt. His stock seems to be rising but he may still be there for a mid-to-late 1st round selection. (Chargers at 17) But is fixing this position more important than defensive woes so early in the draft?

Later Round highlights: Isaiah Likely, Greg DulcichI believe the best TE solution for us is to sign a discount veteran (we‚Äôve since gotten Everett on a good deal, discussed in the Additions section) alongside a draft pick in the 3rd or 4th, or 2 discount vets. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if McKitty ends up cut. Also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he gets a lot of playing time out of nowhere, it‚Äôs hard to know when a rookie sees the field so little. Obviously, the fan in me wants to swing for the fences with McBride Round 1, but that is only an option if the holes on defense are addressed almost entirely through free agency, which we currently are on a good track for. Otherwise, let‚Äôs move on to the next position group of need, another big early round need.

&#x200B;

*LB:*

Yo we got Khalil Mack I‚Äôm happy nevermind. [Here watch this sick highlight video instead of worrying about Kenneth Murray not being good enough at MLB.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUxn4fpXDy8)

In all seriousness, this is a position I expect to see multiple day 2 and 3 picks spent on. The depth is bad, and starting talent is not any better for our ILB positions. Drue Tranquill has done very well, but is not a standout talent. Kenneth Murray has been mediocre.  

*T:*

With Bryan Bulaga cut, Telesco and Staley DESPERATELY need to find a starting option at RT that is not Storm Norton. Who‚Äôs still out there? As of writing:

*Free Agents:*

Duane Brown showed his age last season in Seattle, cooling the market for the 37 year old. He has been relatively healthy, but his performance declined sharply in 2021, allowing 8 sacks at left tackle, tying him for 6th most. He is rarely penalized though. A 1 or 2 year deal may be possible if the Chargers staff thinks he hasn‚Äôt just aged out of his top level play completely, but so far there is no buzz at all that I have seen about a possible signing here.

Eric Fisher came off an achilles injury to have one of his worst seasons in his career after being picked up by the Colts. Maybe some value to be had another year removed from that injury, but he‚Äôs reportedly trying for bigtime money, as well as being a LT most recently. Unlikely in my opinion.

&#x200B;

*Draft Prospects:*

The picture isn‚Äôt clear yet, but there seems to be a lot of talent at OT in the first few rounds of the draft, potentially with many taken in the first round. Not being a scout, I‚Äôll list the top prospects here:

Evan Neal, OT/G, Alabama

Ikem Ekwonu, OT, N.C. State

Charles Cross, OT, Mississippi State

Trevor Penning, OT, Northern Iowa

Tyler Smith, OT, Tulsa

Nick Petit-Frere, OT, Ohio State (This guy‚Äôs last name is literally little brother in french. I learned that when trying to find the pronunciation, and having learned that, and having shared it with you, I‚Äôm just going to let you figure out how to pronounce it in what is likely your most stereotypical french accent.)

43696,248975,248975,omnimater,"Already Signed:

Khalil Mack OLB: A 2022 2nd and a 2023 6th is a small steal of a price to pay for a top of the league pass rusher to pair with your other top of the league pass rusher. We have loads of cap space, and can re-sign him in a way that lightens this year‚Äôs cap load (probably have by the time of posting, I hope I remember to update this). I love this trade. Our defense was the weak point. Let‚Äôs fix it.

JC Jackson CB: Jackson will certainly help fix it! A fantastic signing of an elite Corner skilled at both man and zone coverage. He got PAID, signing a 5 year deal worth up to $82.5 Million with $40 Million guaranteed. We had plenty of cap space entering the offseason and it has been great as a fan to see this money used aggressively and smartly. A true number one corner was a need. This allows Asante Samuel Jr. to develop under less pressure after a promising rookie season.

Sebastian Joseph-Day DT: Joseph gets a 3 yr deal worth up to $24 Million with $15 Million of that guaranteed. He might have the easiest free agency team change ever as he doesn‚Äôt have to move at all or get used to a new stadium. He comes over from the Rams after 3 seasons, though 2021 was a season marred by a pectoral injury that limited him to 7 regular season games and the Super Bowl. That said, he reunites with Brandon Staley, who had been the Rams defensive Coordinator just 2 years ago in 2020. More scheme familiarity for a defense that has gone through a huge scheme change. (See Defensive and Coaching Reviews for further explanation)

Austin Johnson DT: As of writing the details of Johnson‚Äôs contract have not been made public. He‚Äôs a 5 year vet previously with the Titans for 4 years then the Giants last season. He‚Äôs a solid run stopping nose tackle, a skillset very much needed on our defense. He started all 17 last season for the Giants, racking up 90 tackles, 4.5 sacks, and 8 QB hits.

Gerald Everett TE: Everett gets a 2yr/$12mil deal with $8 million guaranteed to replace Jared Cook as our top TE presumably. Donald Parham is still likely to see significant play alongside Everett, or perhaps another TE addition down the line, but I like taking the chance on an inexpensive, athletic TE.

*Others to mention:*

  
Josh Harris LS: 4yr up to 5.6 Million, 1.92 Million guaranteed.  
  
Chase Daniel QB: Re-signed for 1yr up to 2 million, 1.12 guaranteed.   
  
Jalen Guyton WR: Tendered for 1yr 895,000. He had a solid campaign last season as our WR3/4 with 448yds and 3TDs. Herbert seems to like him, he performs well on the field, and is well liked by the fans. He‚Äôs likely to slip to our WR4 or even 5. Expect him to be overtaken by Josh Palmer, a 3rd rd rookie who finished with very similar numbers and got more snaps in the latter half of the season, as Guyton‚Äôs snaps decreased and as he dealt with an injury from week 15.  
  
Donald Parham TE: Tendered for 1yr 895,000. Watching the games last season, it felt like Parham was constantly making clutch catches and was developing into a major offensive weapon. The truth though, is that he had 27 targets for 20 receptions, 190 yards and 3 TDs on the season. Very respectable, if typical TE2, which is what he appears to be for our roster again. I would not be surprised if another draft pick is used on this position still, potentially bumping Parham down.  
  
Storm Norton OT: Tendered for 1yr 895,000. This is keeping depth at the position. Norton started basically all last season after Bryan Bulaga got injured in week 1. Norton got his ass kicked all year. Most notably against Maxx Crosby in week 18, but he got pushed around all season by whoever lined up across from him. He allowed 9 sacks, tied for 2nd most in the league. He‚Äôs a serviceable backup, but the skills don‚Äôt match the name unfortunately. We‚Äôll see the Chargers add a tackle to start over him on the right side, with Slater on the left",7.0,nfl,t3_tohk4i,False,0.0,:Chargers: Chargers :Jaguars: Jaguars,2022-03-26T01:19:10Z,chargers,-0.000270242317919
43697,248976,248976,omnimater,"**Free Agency**

Losses:

Uchenna Nwosu is so far the only major loss in free agency. As an OLB/DE, he played decently well for us, being used primarily rotationally until this past season, where he saw much more action. His highlight of the season came against Cincinnati where he logged two sacks, including a forced fumble and recovery. He goes to Seattle on a 2yr $19 million deal with $10.5 million guaranteed. However, due to limited career production this is actually a safe deal for Seattle, who has a 1yr out option. I personally will miss him, as I always liked him and his awesome name, but this was an expected loss, and I can‚Äôt complain about Khalil Mack as a replacement. Here‚Äôs hoping he is a very successful Seahawk.

Side Note- New Seahawks DC Clint Hurt has a background not just of the Seattle Scheme defense, but also the Vic Fangio 3-4 schemes. Nwosu now has play experience in both, making this a smart signing with little downside.

43698,248977,248977,omnimater,"*Week 18: Chargers @ Las Vegas Raiders: L/OT 32-35*

Oh boy. I‚Äôve been debating hard over how to talk about this game. Part of me is still so heartbroken over it that I want to just leave a grumpy salty remark and skip it. I really thought that would be my approach.

But I cannot do that disservice to what was one of the greatest, most dramatic and crazy games I have ever witnessed. Probably the greatest, most dramatic and crazy. I can‚Äôt think of anything like this, (I was delivering pizza for the Falcons-Pats 28-3 SB year, and got off shift just as overtime started, and walked in the door of my buddy‚Äôs house just as the confetti dropped. Can you believe that? Timed it perfectly. Wrong.) so I‚Äôm going to say it is. Which is why it hurts so much more!

Ok, let‚Äôs begin the pain. Despite a FANTASTIC punch-out by Nassir Adderly, the Raiders maintain possession and get a field goal on drive 1. Adderly absolutely came in clutch though, preventing the touchdown. Our first drive goes nowhere, then Andre Roberts fumbles on a punt return. Hunter Renfrow cashes in that second chance moments later, for a 10-0 lead.   
Austin Ekeler barreled in for our first score on the very next drive, then another one a drive later, his 20th TD, and Chargers lead 14-10. But it took Carr and the Raiders 7 plays and barely over a minute to get 75 yards downfield for another TD to respond. OH WAIT, that‚Äôs because Chris Harris Jr. was called for a PI in the end zone, a 41 yard mistake in coverage of Zay ‚ÄúNude Brawler‚Äù Jones of all people. This was a game heavy on Charger penalties, with 10 penalties for a total of 108 yards, the most penalty yardage all year. A big disadvantage to have for the most important game of the season.

The second half opened with a Charger drive capped off with a missed field goal (been a sec) from Dustin Hopkins. He was pretty consistent for us this season after arriving from Washington, and this one was 51 yards. I can‚Äôt be too mad. Just disappointed. Oh! I almost forgot! Staley called the most bizarre 4th down attempt most of us have seen; from our own 18 yard line in the 3rd quarter down 17-14. It failed, and Vegas got the best starting field position one could ask for: ALREADY IN THE RED ZONE. Baffling. It was a rough 3rd quarter for us, and the 4th didn‚Äôt start any better, with a 2nd TD from Renfrow, and Casey Heyward grabbing a pick for Vegas on the following drive while Herbert was running from pressure. There was a lot of that actually, as Maxx Crosby played with Storm Norton like play-doh. Miraculously only 3 sacks; Herbert has great movement in the pocket, but he was pressured basically every drop back.

It‚Äôs 29-14 Vegas leading, 4:35 on the clock, 4th and 21! Somehow, Herbert fires a missile straight to Josh Palmer at the goal line for a spectacular score, keeping us alive against all odds. [I highly recommend a look at ESPN‚Äôs Win Probability chart on their page for this game here](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401326600). Absurdity. We‚Äôd made it 75 yards down the field to score, but it took 2 4th down attempts to do so. That‚Äôs too many, you can‚Äôt count on that, especially not longer distances like 6 and freaking 21. Our defense manages to hold the Raiders down, but it‚Äôs a long field for our last attempt for a scoring drive to Win or tie. It took 19 plays, 2 minutes, and THREE CONVERSIONS OF FOURTH AND TEN (One by penalty, thanks Raiders Safety Roderic Teamer) to get 83 yards downfield for yet another Mike Williams TD catch. Oh as time expired. Yeah, we scored by the skin of our teeth. As in that last play was snapped with 0:05 left after an overturned incomplete pass that Jalen Guyton managed to hang onto and roll out of bounds with. What a crazy finish Except it‚Äôs not over, and every NFL fan has creamed their pants.

I really don‚Äôt have to address this because we all remember it consuming the whole final week of NFL media, but it‚Äôs important. The Steelers‚Äô own overtime win earlier in the afternoon had left a weird door open in this playoff hunt: if the Raiders and Chargers tied they both got into the playoffs. The internet swarmed with all kinds of speculation and theories on tie-based shenanigans. Even going so far as to suggest both teams just kneel out the whole game. But when it came to the teams and their fans, it was quickly brushed off as the game began. They are here to play, and they are playing to win. But then they actually tied from a miraculous comeback in the fourth. How do you proceed?

The Raiders drove down, and flashbacks of the Chiefs played behind my eyelids. But they were held to a field goal. There‚Äôs still a chance. It took a fourth and 9 conversion bomb to Williams to get downfield for a responding field goal. 4:30 left, 32-32 and the clock is ticking down. Once they hit about midfield, the Raiders focus turns to just chewing clock on the ground trying to get downfield as much as they can. The drive definitely had the look of ‚ÄúIf we get close enough for an attempt at a kick, great. If not, we‚Äôre still in the playoffs anyway. Let‚Äôs wrap this up.‚Äù

And then Brandon Staley calls Charger timeout at 0:38 left with Vegas at the LA 39. The most controversial timeout of the year, without question. We‚Äôll never truly know why it was called, or what the Raiders would have done if it hadn‚Äôt. According to some players, they would have just let the clock run and the tie happen. Others say they would have let it run and just tried the kick from further back. But the clock stopped. Supposedly because, ‚ÄúWe needed to get in the right grouping. We felt like they were going to run the ball, so we wanted to get our best 11 personnel run defense in, make that substitution so we could get a play where we would deepen the field goal.‚Äù But as the world immediately noted, that substitution that stopped the clock and may have encouraged the Raiders to actually run a play allowed 10 yards on the run. You know how it goes, I wrote up until the stockade, there‚Äôs not much interesting about this hanging. Season over. In dramatic fashion. Hope you took your blood pressure meds beforehand. All I had was alcohol.

Let‚Äôs talk about a thriller instead; one of the games that is behind the push for overtime to ensure possession for both offenses. It‚Äôs also one of the games that put the most focus on Staley‚Äôs 4th down calls. By now, he had the reputation for it, and was being judged on that tendency. Andre Roberts brought the opening kickoff back all the way inside the KC 25, just for the offense to not finish the job, and fail on 4th and goal as well. ‚ÄúThe quickest way to win a game like that is to score touchdowns not field goals, especially considering who's on the other side.‚Äù That was Brandon Staley after the game, defending the decision to try for the TD and not easily go up 3-0. This has been a heated topic around the league, especially after this game, and even among Charger fans. Most are behind Staley and the aggressive attitude on 4th downs, and I generally am as well. But points are points. And the fact of the matter is that this game went to overtime. An extra field goal means a win. So failing twice in this scenario in the first half alone is a BAD look, and not great for morale on the field, I would think.  


This was a fun, even matchup. Both teams had the big plays on offense we all tuned in for. Both teams made dumb mistakes. Way more interesting to see than to read, so I‚Äôll see you in Week 16 after you watch these‚Ä¶

*Week 16: Chargers @ Houston Texans: L 29-41*  


This was the actual most embarrassing loss of the season. Week 18 might have been the most overall painful considering the circumstances. But if this game had been a win, which everyone in the nation thought was surefire, week 18 wouldn‚Äôt have mattered. Instead, fucking Rex Burkhead had his way with our covid-ravaged roster. Joey Bosa, Austin Ekeler, Mike Williams, and Corey Linsley were all out for this game, among others. Davis Mills honestly just looked good this week, and was aided by facing a team with major missing pieces and a brutal demoralizing loss the prior week.

But there is no excuse for any rush defense allowing Rex Burkhead 149 Yards and 2 TDs on 22 carries. I‚Äôm shocked this guy is still on a team, and we‚Äôre out here making him look like a pro-bowler. Herbert struggled, underthrowing Josh Palmer deep downfield in tight coverage for an interception that gave the Texans the drive to take the lead late in the 2nd. And he tossed a pick 6 during the late comeback attempt, missing Jared Cook by a mile. This may have been Cook's fault, he ran a curl that Herbert seemed to think was going to be a corner route. We‚Äôll never truly know. Either way, this was a stunning embarrassment of a loss that no one saw coming.

Respect to Davis Mills though. Everyone just kind of counted him out as a lame duck QB for a franchise in the toilet and moved on, but he actually showed development and skill last season. Kind of weird that many media people will say ‚ÄúHe was the best Rookie QB other than Mac Jones,‚Äù but then will not ever talk about him at all besides that, still writing him off. Shoutout to Texans fans with the underrated QB to look forward to. Alright, enough of other teams, it‚Äôs the Chargers time to shine damn it. On to week 17.

*Week 17: Chargers vs. Denver Broncos: W 34-13*  


The Chargers were whole again this week as the many who had been out due to covid the previous week returned. Also this game was Drew Lock, not Teddy Bridgewater. Makes things a little easier (sorry Seattle?). Surprisingly, Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams were held in check, with neither having much production. Only Courtland Sutton and Noah Fant were able to give our D a challenge. Denver was able to move the ball, but was unable to finish for the first half, walking off for the half with a field goal to make it 3-17. The Chargers did have 3 scores in that first half yes, but honestly hadn‚Äôt looked that great, as the other 3 possessions were 3-and-out. All or nothing baby.

The second half had more but less meaningful scoring, as LA increased their lead, and Denver got what garbage points they could. Andre Roberts got a 101yd Return TD to start off the 4th quarter, coming right off of Denver‚Äôs second field goal. 27-6. [Justin Herbert broke the Chargers Single Season Passing TD Record with this strike to Mike Williams.](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx62LemUntqApkMqcGgMfv0OeyGpQaIxS8) It was his 35th TD of the season, and the last score of the game, well on the Chargers‚Äô side. 

Sorry Noah Fant, it was just too late to matter.

This game was a lot like the Giants game, where the Broncos seemed to know this late in the year that, especially with their backup QB on the field, they weren‚Äôt at the same competitive level anymore. Just something I felt like I could see in the highlight film from time to time. Guys not pushing as hard, prioritizing the body for next year and the like. At 7-8 coming in, they were not technically out, but definitely a longer shot. In my book though, great payback, and a win that we desperately needed after the Texans loss. From here, it was win and in, right? Oh if only it were so simple.

This game started off quiet, with not much to speak of besides a Joey Bosa strip sack on Cousins and a big run by Alexander Mattison in the 1st quarter. The Vikings did go up 3 immediately into the 2nd, but Breshad Breeland gave up a pretty egregious DPI while trying to cover Mike Williams on the following drive. 3-3. There were a total of 9 penalties between both teams by 6:00 left in the 2nd. Not exactly a clean game. First play after going down 6-3, Justin Herbert throws a pass just behind Keenan Allen over the middle in tight coverage, and LB Eric Kendricks makes the pick. Oops. Kirk Cousins fires a laser straight through the secondary to Tyler Conklin on the following drive. TD. Down 13-3 with 2 minutes left in the half. In a game where I think most Charger fans thought would show that we were legit, but also that the Vikings were frauds (their season had been rocky, at 4-5). The vibes were negative. But a fast, 8 play, 75yd drive on the back of two more MIN defensive penalties led to a TD rush from rookie Larry Rountree. Suddenly it's 13-10 going into half and you can see the swagger immediately in the offense upon return from the locker room. The 2nd half opening drive began with a 22yd dart to Keenan Allen, and ended 9 plays later with a TD catch by Austin Ekeler where Herbert threaded a needle through extremely tight double coverage. Everyone touched the ball on this drive basically. Parham, Cook, Williams. The whole offense was humming. And then the next Charger drive was a weak 5 plays and 8 yards. Cool. And after a 3 and out to start their half, our defense folded again, specifically Chris Harris Jr. who on 3rd and 10 was called for an 11yd DPI on Justin Jefferson. With Tyler Conklin nabbing a second score, it was now 20-17 Vikings. And again on the next drive the defense caved, with a 12 play, 7 minute possession to start the final quarter only ended by a Dalvin Cook score. The Chargers fought hard for 12 plays on offense, only to come out with a field goal at 4:36 in the 4th putting the score to 27-20. We never saw possession again. The Vikings never scored again. Our defense let the Vikings play keep-away for four and a half minutes down one score. Embarrassing. Our defense truly let our offense down this week, who kept up despite only ever really having positive momentum for a brief stretch in the middle of the game. To this point in the year, in my eyes, this loss hurt the most. It felt the most in reach. The most disappointing.

*Week 11: Chargers vs. Pittsburgh Steelers: W 41-37*  


Three defensive penalties on the opening drive would assist Big Busted Ben and the Steelers in marching 13 plays downfield to notch a field goal. You know what beat the Chargers Defense in 2021? Well everything really, but do you want to know what really beat it? Rushing the ball and dink and dunk passing. Hey, that‚Äôs convenient because that‚Äôs ALL the 2021 Steelers could do! A match made in heaven. Well, Offense, we‚Äôre putting all our chips on you again, good luck.

And while Herbert was undoubtedly awesome, putting up 30/41 for 382-3-1 in addition to another 90yds on the ground, it was Austin Ekeler‚Äôs day to shine. 50 yards and 2 TDs on the ground, 65 yards and 2 TDs through the air. This was a fun game to watch with all the scoring of course, but our defense even made the Steelers look entertaining. But their performance early in the game was the bare minimum required to keep us just barely ahead in this shootout. Charger wins are rarely comfortable, and despite having a lead most of the day, and watching a fantastic offensive spectacle take place, we certainly did not feel comfortable today. Especially when a late 4th quarter interception leads to a tied ball game. But this [backyard casual TD pass to Mike Williams for the game‚Äôs final score](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxXgH74jD5Wc_WUV8TT4pQW63Rdatb6ODm) makes it all better.

*Week 12: Chargers @ Denver Broncos: L 13-28*  
		

New candidate for the most embarrassing loss of the season is here! Our offense just couldn‚Äôt manage anything, and Drew Lock wasn‚Äôt in the game long enough for our defense to be any help here. Javonte Williams and Melvin Gordon are a strong combo against a glaring weakness. But honestly, Denver had very little offensive production. They had three scoring drives, and the rest were pretty underwhelming, topping out at 32yds. ‚ÄúWhat about their 4th score?‚Äù I hear you ask, having already seen the final. Well a Denver CB named Patrick Surtain II seems to be pretty damn good, picking off Herbert twice, taking the second for 6. The Chargers were somehow just never in this game. Denver‚Äôs defense was just too much. And ours was not enough to make up for it against a mediocre offense. I want to stop talking about this game now.

*Week 13: Chargers @ Cincinnati Bengals: W 41-22*  
		

It's the opening drive, 4th and goal from the 4. What do you do? If your answer is ‚ÄúGive Herbert the ball and watch,‚Äù then you‚Äôre ready to be a Charger fan. That laser to Keenan Allen was just the way to cap off a drive that returner Andre Roberts had set up at midfield. Uchenna Nwosu nails Burrow for a strip sack to get the ball back for a field goal, and then Jamar Chase bobbles up a deep bomb right back to CB Michael Davis. Back to back turnovers for Cincinnati, back to back responding scores for the Chargers, including Allen‚Äôs 2nd TD on the day, setting up 16-0. That‚Äôs just the first quarter.

This game looks like a blowout on the final, and in a way it was, kind of in the way that like a cat plays with its food. LA went up 24-0 in the second, only for it to be 24-22 halfway through the third after the team just fell asleep for a while and the Bengals came alive. And then Joe Mixon coughed up a fumble, Tevaughn Campbell scooped it up and took it for 6, and the game was over. Well, not yet. We still wanted more points. And we would get them, adding 10 before the game was out for a total of 17 unanswered. Our defense got to look good against a bad O-line, with 6 sacks, 2 FF and 2 Interceptions. Obviously we weren‚Äôt perfect, this game should never have gotten back to so close after such a huge lead, but this was a statement win in a matchup of the 2 rising electric offenses in the AFC. And that is proof that statements are meaningless (actually that proof is the Cleveland Browns) as the loser got to go to a SB. Good run Cincy, honestly, much love.

With about 9 minutes left in the 4th quarter, the score was 37-7, so plenty of garbage time points here too. Our offense looked good, but didn‚Äôt really have to step on the gas too hard.

This game was ugly. I mean, you can tell that by the final score. But the Ravens didn‚Äôt exactly look great either. Kyzir White managed 2 interceptions off Lamar Jackson, who was also sacked 3 times. Baltimore ran our D into the ground over the course of the game with their rotating backs of Murray, Bell, and Freeman, each of which found the end zone, alongside Lamar Jackson‚Äôs rushing ability. Oh and to make things worse, those 6 points were not two separate field goals, but 1 TD with (say it with me class) yet another missed PAT from Tristan Vizcaino. And other than that touchdown (which was on a 2 play drive from the Baltimore 27yd line so, kinda handed to us) our offense never got anything going at all. Our longest drive was 38 yards. Let‚Äôs just move on from a loss that was so completely crushing that you can hardly even analyze, and come out of the other side of the bye week strong. At 4-2, we were still tied for the top of the AFC West with the Raiders.

*Week 7: Bye*  


I would like to dedicate this time to thank Tom Telesco and Brandon Staley for FINALLY removing Tristan Vizcaino from the team like the tumor he was. His replacement, Dustin Hopkins came in and was consistent for us, missing two PATs (I almost wish I could know the count Vizcaino would have racked up) and only missing 2 field goal attempts, both from 50+ yards, over the rest of the season.  
  
*Week 8: Chargers vs. New England Patriots: L 24-27*  


This game was won and lost on defense for both teams. It was lost by a weak showing from the Chargers, only 4 QB hits all game with 1 sack from Jerry Tillery. Our safeties in James and Adderly were able to force and recover a fumble, but our offense couldn‚Äôt make anything of it. Why? Because while Belichick played conservative on offense, his defense was stout, with former Charger Adrian Phillips getting 2 INTs off Herbert and bringing one back for 6. The Chargers led the game through most of the first half, with the score at 14-13 at halftime. But the discipline of those Bill Belichick defenses gave our overall young offense a hard time, and the Pats were more than happy to lean on their ground and short pass games to eat up the clock. I think this game really is that simple in the end. See? I said I‚Äôd shorten these up.

*Week 9: Chargers @ Philadelphia Eagles: W 27-24*  


Nothing like a game against the Eagles to get you back on track right? Philly‚Äôs defense against the pass to this point really hadn‚Äôt been great. This was also as Philly was transitioning to a more run-centric offense. Our defense was in a bind as not only were we in the bottom of the league in rush defense, but also both Michael Davis and Asante Samuel Jr. were out for this game with injuries. Honestly these teams are very similar, having gone through coaching changes prior to the season, being largely younger on the field, building their identities. But there is one thing that tips scales like no other in the NFL: star QBs. And let‚Äôs face it, Justin Herbert is in another league compared to fellow JH-QB Jalen Hurts. Herbert put up an impressive 356-2 with an extra score on the ground. TE Donald Parham scored his 3rd and final TD of the season this week.  


Should this game have been so close though? The Chargers failed 2 4th down attempts in the first half, the first on the PHI 2 yard line, and the second on the PHI 27 yard line. 6 points gone. Following the second failed attempt, Philly managed a field goal to put them up 10-7 at half. The second half is a back and forth for the lead or tie. Culminating in a 4th and 1 on the PHI 28, 1:45 left to play, tied at 24. Again Staley keeps the offense out instead of taking a 45yd field goal attempt. Fortunately, Herbert is successful in his QB sneak, and Hopkins nails the 29yd field goal with :02 remaining moments later, and the Chargers come out on top. But why? Probably because Hopkins had missed a PAT earlier in the game, despite being fairly solid throughout the season so far (Hopkins honestly wasn‚Äôt that bad with Washington, a surprising cut given his tenure with their team looking back now. He had missed 2 XPs and 2 FGs before being cut, only 1 in the week before his release in a game where Washington was being blown out by KC). It worked out for the Chargers to get the win, but for me this is the first point where the 4th down aggression is questionable, and may negatively be impacting the team‚Äôs chance to win.

Mahomes opened this game slipping between our defenders, rushing for 22 yards on their first drive, seemingly moving our defense to his will‚Ä¶. Until a tipped ball off the hands of the hands of Chiefs 2017 UFA Marcus Kemp (the play-by-play read M Kemp, so I had to look this guy up - I thought Matt - anyway I learned this from his team website page‚Äôs google result, but if you click on that, you get [error 404](https://www.chiefs.com/team/players-roster/marcus-kemp/), so I‚Äôm guessing he got cut lol) led to a spectacular interception catch by Asante Samuel Jr. (Are you noticing a pattern? Well too bad he never has another INT all season.) The Chargers offense just couldn‚Äôt get going in the 1st quarter, opening with a 3 and out, and netting just 53 yards before the 2nd quarter. However a Tyreek Hill fumble late in the first and a Clyde Edwards-Helaire fumble on their very next drive, both lead to Herbert TDs to Allen and Ekeler. Suddenly it‚Äôs 14-0 halfway through the 2nd quarter, despite Vizcaino missing the PAT of the first score. The Chiefs only manage a field goal due to a false start penalty stalling their drive, and the half ends quietly 14-3.

The second half is a different game. A Kansas City team that had so far been more a victim of themselves than our defense (not that our D wasn‚Äôt good in the first half) found its balance and hit the gas in the second half. The Chiefs would find the end-zone on their next three possessions, while the Chargers struggled to keep up, with a punt, a TD catch by Mike Williams, and a field goal to match with. It‚Äôs tied at 24 with 1:50 in the 4th when [Mahomes launches a bomb downfield on 3rd and 8, only to be intercepted by Safety Alohi Gilman.](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx5Fh5En7LfWdA6M50zI4I_Q1d-TZNJwR5) The Chargers make it downfield again, Mike Williams gets another TD, Tristan Vizcaino misses another PAT, and with 0:32 left on the clock, the Chiefs get the ball back down 6. Our defense held up, allowing only one play of any gain (a classic Mahomes 21yd scramble and 5yd defensive holding on that same play; there were plenty of defensive penalties this game). A huge win that puts the [Chargers as the lead dogs in the West](http://sportige.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Big-Balls-Chargers-e1544779189168.jpg). Actually that‚Äôs a lie, can you believe that the Raiders and the BRONCOS were 3-0?

*Week 4: Chargers vs. Las Vegas Raiders: W 28-14*

So much for 3-0 suckas! The Chargers went into Vegas on a Monday night and ran the table. Donald Parham capped off the 12 play, 7 minute opening drive with a receiving TD. Let‚Äôs see the following drives: Punt, Punt, Punt, Turnover on downs, Punt, Punt, Turnover on downs, Punt, Punt. For a full 15 minutes of play, there was a total of 59 yards between BOTH teams. That includes a Raiders 3-and-out for -8 yards on the drive. [Talk about a snoozefest.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/89/31/7a89313173554546370fa636cbf4f3df.png) But the Chargers came back to life as we neared half, with back-to-back touchdown passes from Justin Herbert. The half ended with the Raiders still in a coma and the Chargers up 21-0.

The second half flipped, with back-to-back Raider TD drives and Chargers forced punt drives through the 3rd quarter making it 21-14. But Dan Carlson‚Äôs missed 52yd field goal turned the momentum in the 4th. The Chargers ground game kicked in to run out the clock, with Ekeler adding another score, but it was Derwin James picking Carr off on his way to Waller with 3:22 to go that was the backbreaker. A Raiders down 14 2-minute drill goes nowhere, and now, at 3-1, the Chargers are on top of the AFC West‚Ä¶ or at least tied for it.

*Week 5: Chargers vs. Cleveland Browns: W 47-42*

While former Sheldon High School Fishing Club President Justin Patrick Herbert had picked up where his record setting rookie campaign left off, this was the real debut of the gun show. However, Cleveland came in with at-the-time the #1 ranked rushing attack in the league behind Chubb and Hunt. And that put on display the Charger‚Äôs difficulties defending the run from the opening drive. Combined, the Brown‚Äôs backfield would rack up 222 yards and 3 TDs on the day, opening up our defense for Baker to pick apart for 300 yds and 2 TDs of his own. But it was the opposite story on the other side of the ball where Herbert took command (no not that ‚Äútake command‚Äù) of this game with 398 yds and 4 TDs through the air, and another TD on the ground. Austin Ekeler wasn‚Äôt racking up the yards (as if 119 total from scrimmage is mundane), but had a nose for the endzone with 3 TDs of his own, 2 on the ground and one from Herbie.

But this game wasn‚Äôt just an even shootout, oh no, in classic Charger fashion, it was a desperate comeback with 26 of those 47 points being scored in the last 12 minutes of game clock. The Chargers offense was clicking. [Check out this sick bomb to Mike Williams for example.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxEvG27_H_U7pF_M3APL_7cvSX6MrSiPjz) Our D couldn‚Äôt hold the Browns off though, especially on the ground. I swear every Browns highlight play is either rushing or play action. Also, Austin Ekeler had a rare fumble, and Vizcaino had a not so rare missed PAT (what about this pattern, have you noticed this one?). But 20-13 at half isn‚Äôt too terrible of a hole to dig out of, but boy did Cleveland make us fight for it. But the 4th quarter is of course the highlight. It opens with Cleveland up 27-21 with possession. They proceed to have a 3 and out drive, followed by FIVE STRAIGHT TD DRIVES between both teams; this streak would of course be murdered in it‚Äôs peak by TRISTAN VIZCAINO MISSING YET ANOTHER PAT. But it‚Äôs fine, everything is fine as the Browns finally falter against our defense, and Herbert leads a 48 yd TD drive in 30 seconds to reclaim the lead.

This game was insane and super fun. Cleveland was viewed then as a rising power in the league, so a lot of pride came with this win. Which is why week 6 hurt as bad as it did.

43705,248984,248984,omnimater,"**Season Recap:**

*Week 1: Chargers @ Washington Football Team (Commanders): W 20-16*

The Chargers started off strong on offense with Ekeler punching in a 3yd TD to cap off the opening drive. This game showed from the get go that Mike Williams was a serious piece in this offense and that the coaches seemed to have seen something in 6th round pick Larry Rountree. Rookie Asante Samuel Jr. is called for a huge PI to start the 2nd quarter on a deep shot to Dyami Brown. Our defense holds the Football Team to a field goal keeping things 7-6. Despite being contained by the Washington D to an extent, you could tell this offense was legit. Herbert looked great, no matter who was on the receiving end. This is when most fans learned Jalen Guyton‚Äôs name for the first time. That said, we couldn‚Äôt punch in the TDs in the red zone, being held to 3 field goals in the first half. Washington was struggling on offense, especially as starting QB Ryan Fitzpatrick was injured halfway into the second quarter. Taylor Heinicke in for relief, couldn‚Äôt take over the first drive in, but came back to close the half with a field goal, and open the 3rd quarter with a TD drive with fantastic passes to Mclaurin and Logan Thomas (TD). Suddenly the Chargers went from up 13-6 to down 13-16. Our offense leads a nice downfield drive, marching down the field in 11 plays to the Washington 9. Then Herbert is hit as he throws and a pass which lands just shy of the feet of intended receiver Jared Cook in the end zone is ruled a fumble through the end zone and a turnover? Very stupid call that I don‚Äôt understand how it could have been made as both the arm and the ball were moving forward. But I digress; congrats to Montez Sweat on the FF i guess. Our defense in the second half dissolved and Heinicke looked like a savior in Washington‚Ä¶ until the drive stalled at midfield and Dustin Hopkins missed the 51yd field goal. But as soon as we hit the red zone on offense is when things fall apart again, this time an interception from the Washington 20 by William Jackson. However the very next play Kyzir White forces a fumble from Antonio Gibson, recovered by Kenneth Murray for the Chargers. A chaotic 12 seconds of game clock for sure. Follow it up with a TD catch from Mike Williams, and the Chargers go up 20-16 and are able to hold up on defense after that fumble. Herbert looked phenomenal against what at the time was thought to be one of the better rising defenses. Though Bryan Bulaga was lost halfway through this game, and his replacement at RT Storm Norton, let‚Äôs just say wasn‚Äôt as good as his name, and will be discussed elsewhere.

I‚Äôll have to shorten the rest of these recaps going forward, as that was far too long, but I wanted to keep week 1 long for a reason. People say you can‚Äôt take too much away from week 1 (especially in the fantasy world), but this felt like the average, baseline Charger game of 2021. Reviewing the game, it was very similar to what I recall seeing and feeling about Chargers games late in the season. I found myself wishing that I could see more difference and change in the offensive strategy between week 1 and the latter weeks of the season. I found myself wondering if the team's intermittent success was perhaps due not to a lack of talent on the field, but a lack of variety in offensive play calling. And of course, the defense disappointed often, though this was perhaps an outing of average or slightly above. For more on these thoughts, see my reviews of Head Coach Brandon Staley, OC Joe Lombardi and DC Renaldo Hill as well as some of the players mentioned here, particularly Jalen Guyton, Larry Rountree, and Josh Palmer. There you‚Äôll see the accuracy (or lack thereof) of those feelings. Now, on to week 2.

*Week 2: Chargers vs. Dallas Cowboys: L 17-20*

The Cowboys offense came out hot this game, marching downfield to open 7-0. This was followed by traded picks between both teams, with Diggs picking off Herbert and Rookie Asante Samuel Jr. flashing with an interception of Prescott. Samuel also had a nice end zone pass breakup on the first drive. However the first quarter ended 14-3 with the Chargers having given up 178 total yards already. But the 2nd quarter is a new quarter as the offense fights its way to a Mike Williams TD and an Ekeler 2pt conversion. The rest of this quarter goes by without scores as both teams‚Äô defenses seem to catch up. That is until a sequence that begins with a roughing the kicker penalty against Dallas on a LA punt, granting LA a new set of downs, which leads to a doink by Vizcaino from 44yds off the left upright in his tie attempt. Dallas, now in possession with 3 seconds in the half, runs a pass play that goes to Ceedee Lamb, who Kenneth Murray completely whiffs the tackle against, and is nearly a TD play, with Lamb tossing a lateral to Elliot who is knocked out AT THE 1! Yikes, ugly for both teams, but especially LA. Vizcaino did end up tying the game at 14 in the 3rd with a 32 yd kick. Donald Parham‚Äôs first touchdown of the season gets called back on a Jared Cook hold, right after Jim Nantz credits a first down catch on a 3rd & 6 (according to broadcast, espn says 3rd and 5?) to Jalen Guyton, even though it was actually rookie Josh Palmer. 15, 5, what‚Äôs the difference? Okay, I did say this would be shorter. No time to talk about Herbert‚Äôs second interception, this time in the end zone. Pollard and Elliot continue to run all over the Chargers terrible run D, combining for 198 rushing yards and 2 TDs on the day, but in the 4th quarter both teams are kept out of the end zone, exchanging field goals for the rest of the afternoon until Greg Zurlein hits the walkoff to end the game.

48546,284955,284955,woodhikorn,"I would agree with bringing in another rotational EDGE via the draft or free agency. Hopefully Rumph continues to develop as well.

IMO SJD is a better interior pass rusher than Linval & Justin Jones. And Tillery's problem was that he was terrible against the run, but was always a decent pass rusher. If the addition of Austin Johnson reduces his playing time, it could allow him to be more fresh when they bring him in on pass rush packages. Staley also got creative with plays where he lined up Bosa on the interior with some success, so we may see more of that with him and Mack.

I also think the acquisition of JC Jackson will aid the pass rush by virtue of better coverage downfield. In addition, if he can ease the burden of coverage off of the safeties, we could see more utilization of Derwin's pass rushing ability as well.",23.0,chargers,t3_u9zo1x,False,0.0,None,2022-04-23T02:56:15Z,chargers,0.0963594107806682

I used the restroom multiple times, but not at halftime. Went between quarters & maybe missed a play or two, but no lines then. I encountered one line, it was immediately post-game and the wait was less than 5 minutes.

There are also portable restrooms outside the stadium that I suggest you use before leaving, because it'll take a while getting out.",3.0,chargers,t3_trn6cn,False,0.0,None,2022-03-29T17:32:14Z,chargers,-0.001834632201646
