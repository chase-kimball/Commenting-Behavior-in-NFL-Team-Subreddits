>Does the versatility factor go into your decision of the type of players that you want in your locker room?

>**""I probably shouldn't have even brought that up. That probably wasn't a good move.** That's the good part about the offseason. First off, you have a player that is a team guy where it doesn't matter, like Tytus. Our conversations, 'Where do I need to play to help the football team?' We have two outstanding coaches that have been doing it for a long time with a great coordinator. We will figure it all out. I'll just tell you he will be out on the field somewhere. Excited about the year. Guys working hard. **Talk about those big athletes? He's a big athlete.

Edit: Lovie could be saying he shouldn't have brought this up during camp but why would that matter if Tytus is a team player.

That being said, I do have a bit of insight on the team. There are a few pieces on their defense that would be worth picking up.

AJ Terrell, who is rated as a top 5 CB last year, arguably the best in the league and is on the 3rd year of a rookie contract. Incredible young talent. Best available option IMO.

Richie Grant is coming off of a pretty productive rookie season as a safety. With Reid officially gone, I could see him as an immediate starter if we don't go for Kyle Hamilton. He really shines against the run, but is pretty solid in coverage as well.

Marlon Davidson is a young pass rusher that's an absolute animal, but had nagging ankle/knee injuries that caused him to miss a little bit of time. Not a super concerning injury history, but it's worth noting. Also got a pick 6 on Tom Brady, so that's pretty neat.

Where to stay: somewhere along the light rail (MetroRail Red Line), between University of Houston-DOWNTOWN and the Museum District.  Reason: you can get to and from the game with the train, and it‚Äôs EXTREMELY convenient.  Get there a couple hours early to walk around the lots for tailgating parties!

For your NASA day: rent a car to drive yourself down to Webster/Clear Lake (where the Johnson Space Center is).  If you go on the weekend, get there EARLY, as it‚Äôs a popular place. Also, you can go to the Kemah Boardwalk, or venture down to Galveston to see Moody Gardens, The Seawall (disclaimer: it‚Äôs not a pretty beach, but it‚Äôs ours), and The Strand.  Don‚Äôt forget to eat some fresh seafood!  

Houston is an EXTREMELY vast city, but it has amazing cultural areas, fantastic museums, shopping, and restaurants. Let us know what game you‚Äôre planning on going to!  If it were me, I‚Äôd go to the Commanders game (Nov 20th) or the Browns game (Dec 4).

The Ravens took Kyle Hamilton with their number one pick passing on their biggest needs in pass rusher corner and offensive tackle. A safety that lacks elite athleticism and may not be able to put a cap on elite deep threat receivers, but hey, he‚Äôs tall!

They then picked up Tyler Linderbaum, a center in the first round! A first round center!? Many people question whether his athleticism will make up for his lack of height, weight and arm length and have success in the NFL.

With their third pick the Ravens select David Ojabo an athletic edge rusher out of Michigan. The only problem with drafting this athletic edge rusher is the fact that he‚Äôs coming off a torn Achilles. Returning from a torn Achilles is nothing like returning from a torn ACL. All this athleticism they hoped to gain from him could be permanently hampered due to losing the burst that a healthy Achilles gives you!!! Who knows if he‚Äôll return to his former athletic self.

Ekwonu: Sure, give me a solid lineman that can play guard or tackle and maybe help instantly in the run game.

Evan Neal: Sure, I‚Äôll take the biggest human I can take that also has insane technique and all the potential in the world. He will upgrade us at tackle (if he beats out Howard) or guard.

Kavon Thibodeaux: While I‚Äôll be excited about his potential, I would be concerned about so much noise we hear on his motivation and focus. I still have JJ Watt as my ideal person when it comes to focus and passion and I don‚Äôt see that in him. 

Aidan Hutchinson: Sign me up if he falls. I don‚Äôt care if he doesn‚Äôt have endless potential but his passion and production is enough that I feel like he‚Äôs about as safe as can be for a long term starter and cornerstone personality.

Travon Walker: Sign me up. I know there are red flags but none of them scream bust. Him being a ‚Äúbust‚Äù is he‚Äôs a great edge setter, run stopper, can play inside or outside and is an athletic freak that under performs in terms of sacks.

And, to be clear, I'm not saying that the Texans couldn't be a bad team this year. Mills could regress, Pep's offensive play calling could be bad, our rookies could be slow to get acclimated to NFL play, and so on and so on. But there is surprisingly little optimism offered to the Texans whatsoever and I think a lot of that comes from people really not paying attention to us.

I literally watched one of these yesterday and as soon as the first Texans possession came up, I said ""He's gonna get sacked for a loss of like 8 yards"" and, sure enough, Mills just stands there and runs backwards into a sack for a big loss.

And it's really ironic when you see them play the Jaguars and suddenly Lawrence is super accurate and rarely throws interceptions as if he didn't go 12-17 in the TD-INT department last year. Obviously the Jags were a dumpster fire organizationally in 2021 with Meyer behaving like a lawyer who's offices are in a strip mall next to a smoke shop going through a mid life crises, but Lawrence still did not play well last year.

If you haven't watched any of his tape, I strongly recommend checking out a highlight reel or his performances against the Patriots, Chargers, and our final home game against the Titans. He showed a lot of good decision making in those starts, doing a great job of avoiding INTs and keeping the ball safe. He also showed the ability to place a really beautiful deep ball at times (had 2 back to back deep balls for a TD in the Chargers game that were immaculate). During the Titans game he managed to put together a pretty big comeback, rallying from a 21 to 0 deficit in the 3rd Quarter to an eventual final score of 28-25. Might have still lost, but it sounds like they just let Mills do his thing in the second half of the game and he nearly upset the Titans to deprive them of the #1 seed.

And it's important to note that he did not look good at first. There were reports out of training camp that he put together some really awful performances. I think one Houston sports writer even called one training camp performance of his the worst he'd ever seen. Couple that with a few really rough performances earlier in the year and it looked like he might be completely out of his depth, but to his credit he just kept grinding and got much better down the stretch. Have seen multiple reports from people in Houston sports circles that he just moves on to the next game, learns from his mistakes, and just keeps working. Even after the first day of training camp this year he spent time after the practice to work on his deep ball with Brandon Cooks after he had missed Cooks on the same exact route during scrimmages.

The Lions don't need offensive line help, certainly nowhere close to the help they need rushing the passer.

Ickey also isn't strictly a guard, he has the versatility to play both at tackle and at guard in a way that Neal, Cross, and Green do not. So we can either have a solid competition for the right tackle spot and if Ekwonu wins over Howard, so be it. But if Tytus beats out Ekwonu or it becomes clear he is a substantially worse guard than tackle, you can kick Ickey inside and he then becomes insurance moving forward if we part ways with Tunsil.

And this doesn't even touch on how Ekwonu is an absolute monster in the run game in a way that I'd argue no other lineman is in this class.

If he's getting sacked less and we can be a more dynamic offense that can actually move the ball, odds are he continues to grow like we saw at the end of last season.

That being said, I think your points are valid, I think all of those options could be part of it but until I see what cause of action he sues under then it becomes difficult.

What I do know about Tony Buzbee is that he likes the spotlight and a show‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm interested to see if there is any supporting evidence to actually support him adding the Texans or if it‚Äôs optics.

20986,161254,161254,Wiseguy888,"I think an important point w/r/t the NDA to mention is the legal concept of respondeat superior (essentially, in short, that an employer is responsible for the actions of their employees **acting within the scope of their employment**). This is important because of the context. 

If the director of security was asked to give it to him by in house counsel then the Texans may have some responsibility if they knew the purpose. However, it is outside of the scope of their respective employment responsibilities (or you could at least make that argument) because the director of security isn‚Äôt in house counsel and in house counsel is there to represent the Texans and not Deshaun Watson in an individual capacity against any of these women. 

I have a feeling this won‚Äôt be imputed on the Texans. It seems like Deshaun probably showed this head of security this threatening message because he thought maybe he‚Äôs worried about safety and being threatened by anyone.

Negligence requires 4 things: (1) duty, (2) breach, (3) causation and (4) injury.

You need to first establish that the Texans had a duty to investigate (I don‚Äôt think you can easily establish that).

If you can establish that they did in fact have a duty, then you‚Äôd need to prove they breached that duty (probably easier to establish) and that such breach proximately caused the injury (likely easier to establish too).

Besides amazing restaurants, we also have world class museums and our zoo is too notch, but do skip the downtown aquarium.

Staying Downtown will provide decent transit and is walkable, the light rail runs from downtown, through the museum district to NRG. Downtown is also a fairly short distance to other great neighborhoods, Montrose, East Downtown, Heights, and Washington. All of those neighborhoods offer slightly different things depending on what you're into. The downside is downtown itself is a little dead since COVID, still a decent amount going on but not as lively as 2019.

A lot of people will recommend the Galleria, it is a massive mall with an ice rink. I would recommend skipping it unless shopping is your thing. 

Depending on your means, you may want to look into doing a [Level 9 tour of the space center](https://spacecenter.org/exhibits-and-experiences/level-9-tour/) you will need to book that in advance. 

Food recommendations, I usually recommend people BBQ, TexMex, and Vietnamese food. There are plenty of great spots around the city.

BOB wanted Deshaun to spread the ball out more, that's why he attempted to replace DHop with Brandon Cooks, Randall Cobb, and another pass-catching back in David Johnson. DHop has the best hands in the NFL but he also is terrible in YAC on most plays. Deshaun was often too locked in on getting the ball to DHOP, which locked down the playbook and limited what we could do offensively. The thing that is frustrating, is that BOB was right in that Deshaun is a good enough QB that giving him more solid targets actually made him better. Deshaun posted his best numbers that year. This is plan is exactly what the Patriots did for years with Brady, they were top spenders on WR despite having few household names. 

Like others have said, BOB was terrible at calculating player values. He did some combination of not valuing DHop high enough, David Johnson way too high, and not highly valuing draft picks. Additionally, BOB had an affinity for vet players that had tape, he was pretty notorious for not giving rookies playing time.

I think he would be perfect to test howard. he might actually be amazing at RG with howard at RT.   I seriosuly doubt between goedeke, parham and kinnard that they are all going to be bust tho. but you know i would still love icky i just wouldnt pass on getting someone who might be the best corner in the draft when our secondary is swiss queso and arguably in way worse condition than our o line.

¬†Im not sure if sauces tackling issues are as bad as you say them up to be. sure he can improve but if you look at his draft profiles from scouts you see stuff like this

""He beats blocks with savvy, length and decent play strength for his size. He will pop bigger ball carriers but he also can struggle to come from high to low in the open-field and make form tackles. The ball-carrier will brush through high, arm tackles. He doesn‚Äôt shy from contact and is certainly physically tough, but he could show better tackling technique and take advantage of that length again here, in this part of his game, as he does so often in other areas. He stays gap disciplined as the outside CB and plays well as the force player as he is able to hold up with his length at the point of attack.""

""Beyond his abilities in coverage, Gardner is a sound tackler. He has good tackling form overall, and he wraps up well in 1-on-1 situations. The Cincinnati CB is also an aggressive player when coming downhill. He attacks ball carriers stranded in the flats, and his explosive burst can be a death knell for receivers trying to rack up yards after the catch.‚Äù

if he can improve in his tackling like you said i would argue lovie is probably the best coach to teach him that.

 nc state in not necessarily in the sec either they do go up agianst some good teams but last year cincinati went up against more ranked opponets than nc state.
