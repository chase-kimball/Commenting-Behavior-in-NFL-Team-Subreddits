26,1305,1305,311411,"The Giants signed Tyrod Taylor to a 2 year 11 million dollar deal with about 8 mil guaranteed. He's clearly not a player with unexplored upside or going to be the Giants franchise QB of the future. 

I think Schoen signed Taylor for the following reasons:

1- if Daniel Jones needs camp competition to play his best football, Taylor is the biggest competition he's had since Jones was named starter.
2 - if Jones stinks this year, Taylor can come in and start so the team doesn't look like the same old crappy Giants to the fans.
3 - if Jones stinks this year (or is injured), Taylor can start and his presumably more competent QB play would give young offensive players on the Giants more opportunity to grow and develop than under Jones, so 2022 would be less of a loss season for other Giants players. I think this is the main reason and actually dovetails nicely with the theory that the goal is to put the best team together in 2023. 
4 - if the Giants draft a rookie QB next year, Taylor provides a safe veteran option as a starter for 2023 at a reasonable price they'd pay next year anyway. 

I don't disagree with the strategy of signing Taylor. We saw last year how unacceptable the team looked with Glennon starting instead of a Colt McCoy level back up.  I see signing Taylor as a somewhat departure from the rest of the Giants strategy regarding free agents and snaps this season. That strategy is giving young players the opportunity to develop or show who they are, as opposed to better vets with less upside.

4755,48776,48776,DoABarrowRoll,"I mean I watch the all-22 pretty much all year, at least until they're completely dead in the water (like I stopped last year when Jones got hurt because there just was no point after that). So I'm looking for concepts and schematics that work but are fucked up by players, basically. 

Offensively, I am looking for plays like that one that got posted from last week's game where Johnson is wide open and Jones just missed him; good playcall, poor execution. Same thing with the play Golladay dropped: good playcall (maybe would rather it be to someone else because of what the task is), poor execution. I want to come out of it feeling like ""okay if you can get the right players, then this will definitely work"" whereas with Garrett I was feeling like ""it doesn't matter if you have all the best players, this is not working in the 2020s.""

The results aren't that important because if our personnel is a problem, there's only so good the offense can be. On this sub, we're generally in agreement we don't expect an impressive season from Jones, there's health concerns with a lot of players, the IOL is still a work in progress including with their health. If there's individual games they pop off then that's nice, but overall I expect to be in the like 20s in terms of points per game. Think like WFT, DET, ATL, NYJ, DEN, PIT in 2021 kind of territory. Not entirely putrid, but not good, still below average. That's just what happens when you still have work to do on offense personnel-wise, you have a new system that is (according to reports) a lot different and asks different things of the players, and you don't have a QB that's equipped to overcome those things.

As long as the process is valid and by getting another year in the system and continuing to upgrade the personnel, we can see how the offense will continue to improve and get to where we want to go, then I think I'll be satisfied. Offensively, results won't matter until either Jones proves it or we have a new QB anyways.

Defensively, I want to see Wink do what Wink does, honestly. I want to see the blitzing and simulated pressures up front. That stuff helps your defense a lot and a lot of times doesn't require the best players; you don't need a great player to rush free by creating a 3 on 2. There will be high risk situations, especially with the non-Adoree' Jackson CBs on the roster. I am fully prepared for some situations like what happened last week, teams just picking on Aaron Robinson and there's not much you can do about it. If whoever ends up being across from Adoree' on any given day just can't play, then they can't play.

You'd like to see some adjustment in that sense, and we'll see what they do, but that's still something that's fixable. You can go get a CB that can play.

I'd also just say in general: I want them to be more aggressive in everything. That doesn't necessarily just mean ""go for it on 4th down and throw the ball down the field."" It's a mentality. I'd rather the team play like they're being told ""go make a play and if it doesn't work it doesn't work"" than like they're being told ""don't fuck up.""

I'd personally rather a more volatile team and range of outcomes (we could win 3 games or we could win 9 games with a bunch of those being knife's edge single decisions that didn't work) than a ""safely bad"" team (we could win 5-7 games but we're just kind of sitting back and letting the wins/losses happen).

Someone needs to do something to get us out of the rut we're in, someone needs to instill that lack of complacency in the team and get them to be constantly looking to make a play and never just settle back.

4756,48778,48778,DoABarrowRoll,Right but then it wouldn't be in the progression at all. You wouldn't come back to it after reading the check down like they suggested.

4757,48779,48779,DoABarrowRoll,"Obviously I can't tell you with 100% certainty because I do not have a copy of the playbook, but I highly doubt that the go is the 3rd or 4th route. Two reasons:

1. Go routes by nature are not routes you can get to late. You can get to the checkdown late, and you can get to the in later than you can get to the go. If you're reading the checkdown before the go, even if the checkdown is covered, there's absolutely no way you're ever throwing the go. By the time you're throwing that, if you went out to flat to go, the receiver is running through the locker room by the time the ball gets there. Not a QB on the planet has the arm talent to hit a go when by the time they run a playfake, turn, hit the back foot, read the out to the checkdown then back UP the field, and then hit a guy on a go. It just doesn't happen (unless maybe if the play is broken and turns into a scramble drill, which it's not here, or maybe if you're running a boot action off of it, then you're using the go to clear out and it's not even really part of the progression and the boot to suck a defender in), especially from the opposing 25 yard line!

2. Every scheme head I've ever talked to or read their stuff has always explained it as high to low, go, out, flat. [The Eagles themselves put out a video where Ross Tucker explains it as go, out, flat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BWZaPsjIyw) Every time I've seen JT O'Sullivan break one down he's explained it as high to low. I've never seen it represented with the out actively being the first read on the throw and the go isn't an option. Maybe in Madden they made the out the red route but that isn't really a reputable source for scheme knowledge so I'll say I've never seen it. It's always been represented as ""quick check if the go is an option (and in this case it definitely is, Johnson waved him down pretty quick), then move down the line.""

I don't know where you got 4-4 from. Sure they lined up that way presnap, 4 guys down and the 3 LBs + the safety rolled up, but they quickly rolled it to a 2 high look and it looks a hell of a lot like cover 2 to me.",7.0,nygiants,t3_wnnm6v,False,0.0,None,2022-08-13T21:11:12Z,nygiants,-0.022314160678224

honey-hole: this is a kind of old school term used to describe [a gap in most cover 2 defenses](http://cdn.insidethepylon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/honey-hole-diagram-fix.jpg). in a cover 2 the corners usually play up towards the line and then you have the half field safeties over the top. the honey-hole is the gap between them. no one on the defense is going to be able to cover that spot where it's over the CB's head and far enough to the sideline and not too deep so the safety can't get there.

If you remember [this throw](https://youtu.be/DGU6Tkx-CtA?t=64) from the 2020 season, same idea. CB plays it shallow, safety over the top, get it in that gap, that's the honey-hole.",3.0,nygiants,t3_wnnm6v,False,0.0,None,2022-08-13T20:42:18Z,nygiants,0.0982793784902549
4759,48781,48781,DoABarrowRoll,"It really broke down when I started to feel like he wasn't the coach I thought he was and he didn't have the same goals in mind that I had. When he was hired, I was happy they went with a more CEO, oversees everything type coach than just an OC turned HC, because I thought the issues with this organization stemmed deeper than just ""we need a new scheme"" (and I think most of us agreed on that). I was hoping he would bring some new ideas and thoughts about how to structure the roster, how to empower his assistants and create a coaching talent pipeline (like Belichick had done for many years in New England), and how to emphasize and develop young players (which is something he talked about often in 2020).

I think that it really happened sometime around the win against the Eagles actually, just based on how he managed the offense.

He didn't fire Garrett after 2020, which was bad, but there were rumours he wanted to but couldn't get a replacement he wanted, fine, whatever. Then you carry him through the bye week leading up to that MNF game against Tampa despite only having what 1.5 competent offensive games? Against Washington and the back half of the Saints game? But that game coming out of the bye on prime time against possibly the best defense on your schedule is the must-win, must-score game that decides that you're going to fire him?

I get that they won against LV going into the bye, but that doesn't mean you can't fire Garrett then if you wanted to. Then to waste the bye on a lame duck OC you were just waiting for an opportunity to fire, instead of setting up the interim to have any chance to help save your job when you're 3-7? Just made no sense.

Then you play against Philadelphia and barely squeak out of that game with a win, pretty much only winning because of some turnover luck and Nick Sirianni making sure to throw the ball as much as possible. Jones gets hurt and from there I just could not be arsed about the season anymore. It wouldn't matter what happened the rest of the way because no matter what anyone did they could just say ""we didn't have our QB.""

The first sign should have been when Nate Solder got the start week 1 over Matt Peart. I'm not saying Matt Peart would have played well enough to make us not pick Evan Neal, not even saying Peart is good, but he was not worse than Solder, I don't care what anyone says. 

That's when it really should have started to become obvious to me that Judge wasn't different and he wasn't the guy that I wanted. He wasn't invested in changing the way this organization ran and wasn't invested in developing young players; he was invested in winning as many games as he could as soon as he could, he wasn't really interested in finding a long term solution at the cost of the short term (if that's what was necessary). And then we saw some stuff like that with things like Toney not getting reps until injuries force him in, stuff like that.

I could live with losing, I could live with embarrassing losses at the hands of an incompetent offense with an incompetent offensive coordinator and a QB that I didn't believe in (or backup QBs that sucked). I could live with a bad offensive line that was the product of them trying to develop young players, and then pivoting to a more aggressive approach when that didn't work. I could live with bad results and bad records and the ""fake tough guy"" routine if I believed in the people in charge (and Judge definitely was partly sunk because Gettleman was the GM and I had less than zero faith in him to begin with; though I knew Gettleman was getting the boot by the time I was fully out on Judge) to have the right focus and those bad results would lead to better results in the future.

4764,48786,48786,DoABarrowRoll,"I loved Rosenblatt's reporting personally, he was probably my 2nd favorite beat reporter behind Duggan. He does a really great job of finding fun and interesting stories, as opposed to just being a robot who posts practice and game notes or makes stuff up or stuff like that. He's written a lot of cool off-field features, really digging into the people as opposed to just the football players/scouts/coaches.

I found him to be really fair to the team; some people thought he was biased because he's from the Philly area but he really wasn't more negative than anyone else. We just sucked, and he got labelled as biased because of where he was from; if he wrote all the same pieces but was from Manhattan, no one calls him biased. 

He's not the type to be wildly speculating and throwing crazy shit out there, he's definitely been more towards the ""getting it right is more important than getting it first"" side of the spectrum.

He was also a frontrunner for the ""Not Sure if you’re a Good Person but Best Giants Reporter presented by Kadarius Toney Award presented by Talkin’ Giants"" coming into this year after Duggan (The Athletic's Giants beat reporter) took it last year.

I definitely would give him a shot (maybe give it a day or two so his mentions slow down after the news, he's liking and replying to a lot of tweets about his new assignment so maybe you'd be happier waiting till that dies down) and see if you like him.

Herbert: 1293 passes in 43 games

And then I think they're stacking on top the COVID offseason(s) with a new regime when talking about ""developing QB play with a truncated offseason."" But even then, he wasn't that stellar in year 2 of that offense either in my opinion, so that kind of goes out the window for me.

4769,48791,48791,DoABarrowRoll,"First of all, I'm really just addressing the yards after the catch point. His placement was not ideal for getting yards after the catch.

Second of all, all 4 of the plays I actually referenced were on concepts that are not stop routes.

The first play to Rudolph he's running Y-Option. Rudolph reads the LB and breaks it into an in route. Jones throws high and behind him instead of leading him into it. This is the same concept Jason Witten toasted us on 80 times a year.

The play at 0:49, they're running Drive out of a bunch set. Shep is running an over/deep in route with Toney running a drag underneath it. Rudolph running an angle route to try to set a natural pick and get a late release and be the 3rd option. 

Shep is not supposed to stop on this route; there's no reason to in context of the concept or the coverage. There's an ocean of open grass in front of him and he should keep moving with the window in the coverage. He doesn't stop his momentum until well after the ball comes out. He has to stamp down and jump to stop his momentum enough to adjust to the pass. 

If you put the ball out in front of him and let him run under it, you have a much better shot at YAC; The boundary WR (the 1 in the 1x3 set) is running a vertical route to keep the CB on that side out of the play and it leaves Shep 1 on 1 with the deep safety. 

Shep's TD vs the Broncos in week 1 is a solid example of what that placement should be like; it's a similar concept (drive, but without the angle underneath it). They run the two receivers on the opposite side of the set deep to clear it out (and this is a super common beater for both Fagnio's Palms coverage and the type of C1 man that Washington is running in the clip. Jones lays it out in front of Shep, who slips his man and then is 1 on 1 with the safety for the last 20 yards.

Also on this play he's literally all by himself in a huge patch of wide open grass, don't say he barely had separation.

The last play in the package is just flood, Shep is running a 15-18 yard out. You're supposed to lead the player to the sideline. This is the same type of concept he threw the pick vs the Rams in 2020 because he didn't put it out on the sideline like you're supposed to. And in this case, that placement limits Shep's ability to pick up yards after the catch because he has to stop instead of catching it in stride and turning upfield; Shep's TD vs the Broncos shows what that part would look like too, how leading him to the sideline gives him space and momentum to turn it upfield instead of having to turn around from a standstill.

Also, Shep has at least 10 yards between him and any defender. There is absolutely no lack of separation on this play.

The Kaden Smith one, like I said, is an excellent throw. And again, it's not a stop route. Hard to say exactly what it is because the beginning of the play wasn't included but that is an accurate and well placed ball.

To me, Jones did not throw these balls with the right placement to maximize yards after the catch. They were accurate, on target, and obviously more than catchable. But the placement was not where I would want in order to specifically get yards after the catch.",8.0,nygiants,t3_w30ilk,False,0.0,None,2022-07-19T19:49:25Z,nygiants,0.0037231149009525
4770,48792,48792,DoABarrowRoll,"I know this may not be that well received in this thread at this time of year, but it's something I've thought for a long time.

Look at where some of these ""dots"" are actually placed.

The first throw is above the defender's head and a bit behind Rudolph. Not that he's going to be exploding out of that cut or useful getting yards after the catch but you know what route he's running and you clearly see the green grass. Put it out in front of him, lead him to the open grass. If he has to catch it back behind his head, it's not a well placed ball in my opinion.

Look at the play that starts at 0:49 of the video. Shep does a great job adjusting to this ball and sitting down but look at all the green grass around him. The safety over the top is a full 10 yards away, and on an angle, he has to close 12+ yards to that. You want yards after the catch, put the ball where your guy still has momentum instead of making him stop and then start running again.

Then look at the last play in the video. I will say the concept is stupid; Flood with a deep out from the far hash is just not a smart thing to run. Jones' arm is fine but that is just not a concept I like unless you've got an absolute rocket. It is hard to hit this in stride. And it's not like Shep has much room to catch it and turn upfield. But still, look at where he catches the ball and how his body has to be angled to do so; he has to stop and turn and basically look right at where the ball is coming from, as opposed to catching it stride. It kills all of his momentum and lets the defenders close on him instead of being at full speed through the catch.

For contrast, look at the throw to Kaden Smith; great ball. Gets it out in front of the LB, right at Smith's face, hits him in stride. And what do you know, he gets 6-8 yards after the catch.

It's definitely not all on Jones, it's not even mostly on Jones, in context of the whole season. The concepts the Giants put forth during the Joe Judge era were not designed to maximize yards after the catch. A lot of routes were broken back towards the line of scrimmage; you're not going to get yards after the catch on those. But Jones' placement and timing need to improve on top of that. When people ask for plays that were left on the field, these are usually the things that come to mind for me with Jones.

All of this is really to say I'm not blaming the pass catchers for the lack of YAC. It doesn't matter how wide open a WR is if the ball is late or behind them, or if the concepts force them to go in reverse instead of turning upfield.",8.0,nygiants,t3_w30ilk,False,1.0,None,2022-07-19T14:53:42Z,nygiants,-0.0005776043533249
4771,48794,48794,DoABarrowRoll,"thought experiment courtesy of the NFL Stock Exchange guys:

The NFL is adding an expansion team. You get to protect 4 offensive players and 4 defensive players. Who are you protecting?

For me, on offense:

* Andrew Thomas
* Evan Neal
* Kadarius Toney
* Wan'Dale Robinson

I'm protecting youth and term over everything else. Wan'Dale is probably the weird one.

I thought about Golladay but losing him vs any other WR doesn't hurt that bad imo, even though I think I'm higher on him than a lot of people here. Ditching that contract wouldn't hurt.

I thought about Saquon and Jones too, but since I think they will have to be replaced after this year anyways, I'm fine losing them now. Would the team be better in 2022 protecting one of them over Wan'Dale? Quite possible. But I'm not really worried about that right now.

Defense:

* Kayvon Thibodeaux
* Xavier McKinney
* Azeez Ojulari
* Adoree' Jackson

This one was tough too. I think Thibodeaux and McKinney are 100% locks. I kept Azeez because of term/youth as well. The last spot for me came down to Adoree', Dex, and Leonard Williams.

I think Leo's contract really hurts him. I don't see him as some elite piece we can't live without personally and him costing 26/27m vs the cap the next couple of years, I'd be fine with dropping that contract and I think that even for people who want to keep him, the contract would probably turn an expansion team off to some degree. He's not a piece you build a defense around, so I'm not sure they'd want to spend like it.

Dex and Adoree' I had a really hard time. Both have the same remaining term. Dex is younger and cheaper, and I've been a big Dex fan since before he was a Giant. But I ultimately decided on Adoree' mostly because I valued the CB spot higher. We don't have anyone behind him for any amount of term (if you're worried about ARob/Holmes/Flott as the platoon behind him, imagine projecting that group out for multiple years), and if the expansion team can only pick one player, I at least get to keep one of Dex/Leo no matter what. I think I'd rather have one DL and one CB than two DL and no CBs. But honestly, I could go either way.",4.0,nygiants,t3_w1xr5t,False,0.0,None,2022-07-18T09:18:10Z,nygiants,0.0240039498678192
4772,48799,48799,DoABarrowRoll,"Hard question, honestly. Most of my answer is just randomly word vomiting.

I think we look fine right now, but the next 2-3 years will be really telling. Sounds like a cop out, but I do truly believe that. Things will change a lot when even more of the Gettleman era players are phased out. You have guys like Shepard and Martinez who took massive paycuts to stick around, guys like Kenny Golladay, Adoree' Jackson, and Leonard Williams who are good players, but at numbers you may not be happy with (personally I'm fine with Adoree's number but that's just me). 

Rosters turn over fast, and it's been the Giants' MO to just go out and purchase talent to fill those holes. Imagine what this roster looks like without all of those guys. That's kind of how I see the team moving forward and comparing to other rebuilding franchises. It's kind of unfair to compare the Giants' roster to teams like the Lions and Falcons where when you think of those teams, you're thinking of almost exclusively players that they've chosen to retain through their rebuild that they drafted or developed (with a few exceptions; the QBs for both teams, Michael Brockers and Big V for Detroit, but those guys don't match up in quality to those Giants players).

I think I am fine with how the Giants have chosen to really start their rebuild, though. They've chosen to invest primarily on the offensive side of the ball, which I think is right. The defense might be a problem but they will need to continue to invest there over time; you only have so much capital to fix a team with one of the worst records in the league over the last few years.

I would say true All-Pro players, you're looking at Andrew Thomas, Xavier McKinney, Evan Neal, and Kayvon Thibodeaux, really. I'm hard pressed to find other players I feel that confident about being that upper echelon of player. And I feel bad putting Neal and Thibodeaux in that group too, honestly. But I'll settle for guys who are just impact players, even if they're not necessarily all pros. If a guy is going to perform the way that say Adoree' Jackson performed for us in 2021, that's a win, aside from the players I listed above, I think.

So I'd add in Kadarius Toney (assuming he can stay healthy) and Azeez Ojulari (it appears I'm higher on him than many others; I don't think he's going to be a superstar necessarily but if he could be say Yannick Ngakoue, I think we're very happy about that). Also Leonard Williams, Dexter Lawrence, and Adoree' Jackson in that ""these guys are good starters"" category, but how long they'll be around is a question mark.

I don't think we're fucked or anything, but it's also far from a guarantee. I probably will feel more comfortable answering a question like this once we see how this season plays out, how these players perform in their new schemes, etc.",3.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-09T11:31:03Z,nygiants,0.0374063115637207

4774,48801,48801,DoABarrowRoll,"Baker is not a starter for the Chief, he has started 2 games in his 2 seasons with the Chiefs and only appeared in 12 total games with them (including 3 where he totaled one single defensive snap across all 3 games). He played just 27 defensive snaps for them in the playoffs this year and was inactive for their AFC Championiship loss to Cincinnati. He plays on average 35-40% of snaps in games he appears in, only logging >50% snap shares in 2 games in 2021.

Over his 2 seasons with the Chiefs he's allowed a 72.5% completion percentage, 7.52 yards per target, somewhere around a 110 passer rating.

Flowers' tenure since his first season with Washington has been way better than Baker's tenure with the Chiefs, played 90%+ of snaps all 3 seasons, including 100% in both seasons with Washington (2019 and 2021).

I agree that for us Flowers was worse because a) he was more important (as the franchise LT when they were still trying to win, vs a CB they could develop into a CB1 role while they developed a new QB) and b) I won't hold Baker getting cut against him as a draft pick because that's impossible to predict.

4775,48802,48802,DoABarrowRoll,"Apple: higher pick, worse player. Wilson only turned out ""so bad"" because of injuries, Apple just flat out struggled.

Flowers: As much as I did not like Baker as a prospect, Flowers also was not a super well liked prospect. Flowers was the higher pick, and picked at a time we were trying to really compete, while Baker was picked to really grow into a CB1 role to hopefully take off when their pick at QB hit his stride. And like with Wilson, I won't hold the off field things that are really hard to predict against him. If anyone tells you they saw Baker's situation coming, they're full of shit.

Jones: Whiffing on a QB pick is the biggest mistake a GM can make. Engram was a peripheral piece they drafted to try to extract as much juice out of the end of Eli's career as possible. Jones was the guy they banked the future of the franchise on. They could have just shitcanned the Engram experiment at any point. But with Jones, they handcuffed themselves to him for years, to the point where we STILL, going into his FOURTH season, can't seem to all agree on what he is.

Like I know I'll get shit for saying this, and there's a lot of butterfly effect stuff going on, it's impossible to say it would go exactly like this, but you could make a real argument the Giants would have been better off picking Haskins than Jones. We already sucked with Jones, so who cares if we sucked that little bit extra with Haskins. And instead of sitting here in 2022 with Daniel Jones as our starting QB, seemingly counting down the days until we can finally replace him, Gettleman might have been fired after the 2019 season, maybe the 2020 season. Maybe the Giants would have Herbert or one of the 2021 QBs. Obviously other things might have changed in that context too; if they had Herbert they wouldn't have Andrew Thomas, if they had one of the 2021 QBs they wouldn't have Toney and one of Thibodeaux/Neal.

And it's not a guarantee at all, but I think it's an interesting thought exercise and a fairly compelling argument.

Saquon: Availability is the best ability and Saquon just hasn't had it. Saquon's peak was obviously better, but he was the 2nd overall pick and has definitely not lived up to that billing. Lawrence hasn't lived up to the 17th overall pick, but he's much closer to the bar imo. He's missed one game in his 3 seasons and that was from being on the COVID list, not an actual injury. He's played at least 40% of snaps in every game, and over 50% in his last 31 games.

4776,48803,48803,DoABarrowRoll,"I think it was mostly Mara trying to at the very least keep up the appearance of being patient, of really wanting to keep Judge, to keep his promise of giving him more time than he gave the previous two head coaches. And I think deep down that is in fact what he wanted.

By waiting the extra day, he makes it look like they slept on it, deliberated, and then slept on it again, that it wasn't a decision they took lightly. I think they also did really talk to Judge on Monday, trying to figure it all out. Or at the very least they wanted to make it look that way.

I also think an underrated part of this is: The Giants, as much as they might like to claim otherwise, really care what the fans think. I truly believe they've used the media to float out possible strategies and feel out fan response. So when you hear the reporters saying ""I'm hearing that Judge is staying, I'm hearing that he wants to run it back and have Kevin Abrams be his GM"" that's stuff that someone within the organization wants them to say. 

Who those things were coming from in particular, good question; did Judge want it out there he was coming back to put pressure on the team to follow through with that? Did Mara want it out there so he could gauge fan reactions? Did Tisch want it out there so he could show Mara how much the fans hated the idea? Who's to say? But I do think that when you see those things, it's put out there on purpose. People like Leonard and Vacchiano don't just make shit up and pull it out of their ass, they were told these things, and what the purpose of telling them those things was, only the source would know.

And then other factors other people have mentioned; maybe the GM back channels were going poorly on that front and GMs were threatening to decline interviews if they didn't get to hire their own HC. Maybe Mara was going to force Judge on the new GM anyways but then saw Flores fired and wanted him instead (though I don't 100% buy into this just because he could have had Flores but let Schoen pick Daboll).

Barkley, it's a little bit greyer just because there's still the possibility he plays really well this year and the Giants have a lot of cap space for 2023, but based on Schoen's comments and how Buffalo did things and stuff like that, I'm expecting Saquon to walk too. Plus I'm not sure he's going to be able to stay healthy or play at a top of the league level if he does stay healthy.

No, we don't know if that will work out, but we never know if it will work out. We didn't know when Buffalo drafted Allen or Baltimore drafted Lamar or the Chiefs drafted Mahomes. But it's an important step for any team trying to get back to winning games and trying to make playoff runs; finding a QB that will be able to take you there and win you the games. It's the most important position on the field for a reason, and (almost) every great team has it figured out there. We think we have the GM and HC figured out, they need a QB to be aligned with as well, and that's the main foundation for any team.

Really, the Giants have been falling off since after the last Super Bowl win. They picked 32nd after that obviously, then 19th, then 14th, then have picked in the top 11 for 7 of the last 8 years (the only exception being McAdoo's playoff year, where the defense was absolutely incredible and his offense was ""just throw it to Odell""). 

The Giants absolutely could not land a hit in the draft after the 2nd round, and it really depleted the depth on the team, which trickled into the starters because we had more holes than we could fill. Then they turned to free agency to help and that only really made things worse.

But that's why we needed a guy like Schoen to replace Gettleman. He's not just a scout, he understands the whole process of roster building and evaluating the process and all that. Gettleman was just like ""I know football, I will pick good football players"" but he never adapted to the way the league works now compared to when he got his start in the 80s and 90s. He thought the Giants' failures were just not being right, and not the rubric they used to figure out if they were right or not.

1. They'd be wasting the year with any of the alternatives. Who could they have signed that would have made the year a waste? Wasting the year is a feature, not a bug.

As bad as we think he is, he's at least started a bunch of games in the NFL and been not a complete dumpster fire for some period of time.

4781,48808,48808,DoABarrowRoll,"I think Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll are well aware this is much much closer to a ""blow it up"" situation than a win-now situation. Yeah, they're sticking with Jones for this year, but it's less about their true confidence in him and more about the lack of alternative options; the draft class was viewed very negatively around the league, as evidenced by how late most of them were picked, and they were never in on the win now QB options like Wilson and Watson. They signed Taylor to a deal that has a much higher cap hit in year 2, and is mostly guaranteed; he's going to be back with the Giants in 2023. He's their security blanket/bridge QB for 2023. They're prepared for this to be the rebuilding year. Cap is much clearer for 2023, they can move off of most if not all of their big contracts after this year if they so chose.

They know what they signed up for, and Schoen in particular has been really clear that he knows what he was brought in to do, and that's reset the organization and bring them into the modern era.

The goal is always to win games, but they know they have to make tough decisions with the salary cap (like cutting James Bradberry) and that it's not going to be easy or a quick fix, they want to do this right. The 2022 season isn't going to be the ""excuse to rebuild"", it's the first season of the rebuild. 5 picks in the top 100 in the 2022 draft, a bunch of cap clearing measures and dead money eating. They're already in the thick of their rebuild, they're just going to *finish* the rebuild with the QB question instead of *starting* the rebuild with the QB question like many other teams have.

If you think this team is an 8-9 team this year, that's way more positive than a lot of us feel about it, even. More positive than me, at the very least. I tend to believe that Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll are here to make this team great in the end, I don't think they'd hesitate to be aggressive in acquiring a new QB if they're not really wowed by Jones.

Remember, when Sean McDermott first was hired by the Bills, Tyrod Taylor took them to the playoffs with a 9-7 record. After that season, Doug Whaley was fired and Brandon Beane was hired, bringing Joe Schoen with him, and they replaced Rick Dennison with Brian Daboll. They then went on to trade away Cordy Glenn, who at the time was their LT (who missed most of the 2017 season) and 2 2nd round picks (with some auxiliary pieces mixed in as well) in two trades to move up from 22 or so to 7 and pick Josh Allen.

4782,48809,48809,DoABarrowRoll,"I mean, if you want to play that game, we got away with one against the Saints, between the one play TD drives that were incredibly rare for the Giants last year, to the holding penalty that took a TD off the board for them, to being down 21-10 with 12 minutes left, to winning the OT coin toss. It took a Quincy Roche strip sack to seal the Raiders game, and Nick Sirianni remembering that running the ball can be good could have cost us the game against the Eagles, putting us at 1-10 instead of 4-7. If things were different, they'd be different.

I think this team is horrible because every year we gas ourselves up only to have one of the worst records if not the absolute worst record in the NFL over the last 5 years, and you are what your record says you are.

4785,48812,48812,DoABarrowRoll,"Honestly, I don't think it's complicated. I've watched and rewatched every snap Jones has taken since his last year at Duke and every time I've come to the same conclusions.

First off: I agree he's hard-working and everything like that. But that makes me ask another question: how hard can you work, how good of a teammate can you be, how perfect can you be off the field, but still not produce on it? Why is the guy who everyone says does everything he can, everything possible, to be good, still not good?

I get it, he's had bad teammates and bad coaches and everything like that, but other guys in bad situations show us more. Justin Herbert's OL in his rookie year was horrific too, he still won games for his team and gave us much more consistent highs. Joe Burrow pre-injury in his rookie year, without Chase, showed us more. And both of those guys had way fewer lows than Jones had his rookie year when his highs were on tape. When people talk about Jones' great stuff, it's almost always just him lobbing the ball deep and his receiver coming down with it. It isn't him creating space to pass with his legs, it isn't him throwing a laser through a tight window.

It all comes down to the very simple and kind of cliche answer for me, off of all of his film over the past 4 years: he just doesn't see the game that well. He doesn't have that natural instinct that the great QBs have. He doesn't see the field well, he doesn't process the game well. He's a ""see it, throw it"" guy.

It's like in school when you have the super naturally smart kid who never really has to try that hard but still gets great grades who, if they chose to actually apply themselves, could do amazing things, compared to the kid who has to work super hard, study for hours every day, and go to office hours so he doesn't fail the class.

In the first category, you have guys like Mahomes and Allen and Brady and all the really good QBs in this league. They understand how the game flows, they understand how to see space on the field, throw to open grass, manipulate coverages. They know how to feel pressure and either escape the pocket (which Jones is capable of but very rarely chooses to do) or hit their checkdown/hot reads in record time. They just *get it*.

In the second category, you have guys like Jones. At some point, it doesn't matter how much you study if you just don't quite have that natural acumen. I've seen too many late throws, too many double or triple hitches, too many throws pre-determined at the snap that he doesn't adjust out of once the defense shifts.

Being a good guy and a hard worker can only take you so far if that natural instinct for the sport and for the position isn't there. And I just don't see it with Jones. He doesn't have that adaptability or magic factor that the greats have.",3.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-03T10:51:44Z,nygiants,3.5157897567461154e-05
4786,48813,48813,DoABarrowRoll,"it's hard for me to say because as much as I do really like this coaching staff and I'm very excited for them, the roster does have very clear holes and a lot of big question marks.

Coaching staff helps raise the floor for this team a lot I think, as just an improved scheme should bring us from ""incapable of scoring points"" to ""can score at a respectable enough level"". Like a 20th best scoring offense? Something like that? And just from that you go from that 4-13 team to the 7-10 team level of a team like Denver or something. 

And then the difference between being Denver or Washington and being Miami and Pittsburgh is the defense, which I think is a bit shaky; I think around that like 16-24 range for our defense like where we were last year is a fair baseline to start from; I don't think they'll be the worst, but there's enough question marks for me I'm not ready to say they'll be a GOOD defense.

Ceiling, I agree, Jones is the catalyst. You look at the teams that led the league in scoring, most of them got very good QB play. In the top 20 in scoring you pretty much have like the Patriots, Colts, Eagles, 49ers, and Saints, maybe Browns not having a pretty strong QB. The teams with bad QBs all were down near the bottom. And those teams I listed above were some of the best rushing teams in the league. That's a mark we could reach if everything goes well, but it's hard to expect for me.

I'm just not that big of a fan of Jones, I feel like expecting him to get us there is just wishful thinking. I'm expecting him to settle into that like 20th best QB type range, I expect that he won't be the worst in the league, but he won't make me feel good about his future.

And because that's just the most important position on the field, it kind of acts like a tiebreaker in some of these situations. In a vacuum (cap hit and age and stuff like that notwithstanding in this situation), I'd rather have the guy on the other sideline in a lot of our games. Probably the only ones I guarantee I would rather have Jones are Seattle and Carolina right now? Hurts I think is pretty even honestly, Goff I think is pretty even.

I didn't really talk about Taylor because I don't think it really changes the calculus for me. I don't think Taylor is just as good as Jones is, but I feel like I have to approach this as though Jones is going to play the full year. And I don't think Taylor wins any games Jones wouldn't (or vice versa really). Frankly I'm not really convinced having Taylor instead of Fromm or Glennon makes the Giants any noticeable amount better than they were last year, either.

All of this coming together to say: I'd rather undershoot than overshoot on this team this year. I expect some of those 6 or 7 wins to be strong, I expect Jones will have a couple of games like the end of the New Orleans game or like the first Washington game in 2021. But I don't expect this team to be consistent in any respect. I can't sit here and tell you Jones is going to prove Gettleman right. So I'll take the weaker end of the spectrum, even though I do like the foundation they're starting to build.",2.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-03T10:36:21Z,nygiants,-0.0037699516448974
4787,48814,48814,DoABarrowRoll,"Far from it, really. I mistyped in the chart with Wink (fixed now), he was the Baltimore Ravens DC last year. The only coaches pulled from Buffalo ended up being Daboll, Tierney, and Bobby Johnson. Egorugwu spent a few years in Buffalo before spending 2021 with Vanderbilt. Everyone else has been from other places, and most of them, Daboll has never necessarily worked with before.

I'm pretty sure he's never worked with: Kafka (his OC), Martindale (his DC), TMac (his STC; who is a holdover from the last couple of NYG staffs), DeAndre Smith (RB coach), Mike Groh (WR coach), Andy Bischoff (TE coach), Andre Patterson (DL coach), or Drew Wilkins (OLB coach).

It's really a diverse coaching staff, in my opinion. Obviously a lot offensively will come from Daboll's identity, but he's also blending it with Mike Kafka's experience from Kansas City.

4788,48815,48815,DoABarrowRoll,"Agreed on all counts. I would be stunned if the Giants had a winning record this year, it's impossible for me to expect that. I'm a pretty out and proud Jones detractor, I don't think he is like complete dogwater trash tier, but I don't see a guy who is going to win you games, just a guy who you can win with if everything else goes right.

This year isn't about the record, and I think most Giants fans agree; I do expect them to win more games than in 2021, but mostly because even if the offense goes from bottom 3 to 20th just on scheme alone, we should win more games. But (and this is where the Dave Gettleman regime failed) if we feel like the foundation of future star players is there, with guys like Thomas, Toney, Neal, Thibodeaux, etc, then it's okay to not win that many games while those guys grow into star players and we fix up the rest of the roster.

In my opinion, the team will have a QB they are going to dedicate multiple years to in 2023, whether Jones miraculously pulls it off (which I doubt) or they really go for it in the draft, trading up if they need to. And then in 2024, we should be ready to rock and roll.

4790,48817,48817,DoABarrowRoll,"Agreed 100%. This year is where they're trying to put a floor on it and not be completely embarrassing, and then go into the next year or two with a reloaded roster led by players and people this regime brought in.

Whether we win 5 games or 8 games, it's irrelevant as long as we feel like we're set up for success. And for me, that's also regardless of Jones/Saquon, both of whom personally I'm ready to move on from right now; even if for no other reason than to remove the stink of the Dave Gettleman era.

Like I wrote, even if the offense caps out at 20th or something, if it's because of Jones, I'm okay with that. This regime deserves the privilege of getting their own swing at a QB.

My personal timeline looks like:

2022: learn whatever we can about all the players on the roster. Some things are foregone conclusions in my mind (Jones is going to cap out as a mediocre starter, somewhere in the like 16-24 range of QBs where you should be looking for a replacement; Saquon isn't going to be worth a big extension; etc), but there's a lot of other stuff to learn, between young players recently drafted like Aaron Robinson, Azeez Ojulari, Kadarius Toney, and vets like Kenny Golladay and Adoree' Jackson. Who's going to be here for the long haul?

2023: little bit of a bumpy road as a Tyrod starts until Schoen and Daboll's guy in the draft is ready; I'm fully expecting Jones to be gone next year. They'll try to compete but probably be in the like 6-9 win range depending on how good Taylor will be/how quickly the rookie comes along. I'd like to hit 8 wins, because coaches who lose double digit games both of their first 2 seasons are historically very unsuccessful, but with a QB change in there, it can kind of reset the timeline a bit. We'll also have more picks and more time to develop players to fill in some more of the holes in the roster. They'll need to replace a bunch of WRs, they still need to fill in a couple of longer term gaps on the OL, CBs, which of those young defensive players can step up and be starters.

2024: By this point we should be a good team. Not necessarily a dynasty level team like the Chiefs or something, but a team that should win 10+ games and make the playoffs. By this point, the Giants should have their QB (even if he's not 100% broken out yet; most QBs in today's game show what they are in year 2, the year 3 breakout for QBs is kind of a defunct measuring stick in my opinion), the roster should be retooled and reloaded, the schemes should be fully in place, etc.",8.0,nfl,t3_vqgqez,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-07-03T09:13:15Z,nygiants,0.0247210965719041

* LG

> This one seems pretty set right now, with Shane Lemieux taking the vast majority of the snaps as the starter at LG. I think the Giants are trying to ease Ezeudu into things. He’s also been playing LT with the first team while Andrew Thomas has been rehabbing from offseason ankle surgery. This may be less of a training camp battle and more of a battle to watch as the season goes on. How well does Lemieux play coming off of his knee injury and how much better is he than his rookie year? How quickly can Ezeudu develop?

* EDGE3

> This might be a weird one to highlight but I’m very interested in it. We all know Kayvon Thibodeaux and Azeez Ojulari are going to be the lead dogs off the EDGE for the Giants. But there’s a healthy stable of options behind them as well. Jihad Ward is the vet and apparent leader for the group, but he’s maybe the least talented of the group. Quincy Roche played limited time last year but made some great plays (like his game winning strip sack vs the Raiders). And Elerson Smith was the highest draft pick and probably has the highest upside. I don’t know how they’ll divvy up the playing time among these guys but having a 3rd quality pass rusher would help elevate this defense.

* Defensive Rookies vs Incumbents

> I’m going to lump these all together because they’re basically the same: Cor’Dale Flott vs Darnay Holmes for the Nickel CB job, DJ Davidson vs Justin Ellis for the NT job, Tae Crowder vs Micah McFadden and Darrian Beavers for the LB2 job, Dane Belton vs Julian Love for the safety spot alongside Xavier McKinney
> 
> The Giants added a lot of mid-late round picks on defense, and there’s a lot of pretty weak listed starters. Which rookies are going to press for playing time and which vets will step up to that challenge? I lean to the vets in each of those cases, I don’t think the coaching staff wants to rush any of the young players, but maybe one of them can really impress.

4794,48821,48821,DoABarrowRoll,"# Scheme Description

* **Offensive Scheme**

> Daboll runs a version of the Erhardt-Perkins system that has kind of become synonymous with the Patriots offense in recent years as more west coast, air raid, and spread passing attacks pop up across the league (on top of the prevalence of the sort of offshoot that Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay have helped popularize around the league).
> 
> The key for Daboll this season is going to be creating explosive plays, and that includes both phases.
> 
> In Buffalo, he leaned on zone runs more when the OL wasn’t meshing, shifting more to man/gap runs when the OL really started to figure it out. I don’t actually expect that to continue with the Giants, as I think they’re going to try pretty hard to get Saquon out in space. The additions of Glowinski and Neal will help a lot with that.
> 
> I also expect Daboll’s offense will live a lot on deep crossing routes and RPOs, which were very common in Buffalo. Garrett’s offense was more archaic, more classic Air Coryell, so I expect Daboll to splash in more modern concepts that will help make Jones’ life easier. Jones operated a very shotgun-heavy, RPO-heavy offense that made his decisions quicker and easier at Duke, and if I was Daboll, I would be trying to do the same thing; get the ball out of his hands and reduce the load on his mental processor (one of his biggest weaknesses).

* **Defensive Scheme**

> Wink Martindale is a blitz machine. His teams in Baltimore have been towards the top of the league in blitz rates almost every year he’s been the DC. It’s most common on those “gotta have it” downs, though. When it’s 3rd and 5, 3rd and 7, you better expect Martindale to come with a complex front that makes it hard for the offense to know who’s blitzing and who’s popping out into coverage. Martindale believes he can manufacture pressure and get free rushers, and that will mean a lot when the offense absolutely HAS to get a first down.
> 
> The concern is that by blitzing you often have to play man behind it, otherwise there’s not enough players to cover all that grass. The Giants CB room is a bit of a mess, so playing man behind it might be a bit tough. We really need the big men up front to get home.
> 
> Against the run, Martindale’s defenses have also done really well. Dexter Lawrence said he expects to play a bit more nose tackle this year, which is something I’m excited for.

He had a strong but not crazy rookie year and people thought he was going to be a WR1. Then he had an almost identical 2nd year just with fewer TDs (in an offense that scored way fewer points to begin with!) and people thought he regressed hard when he had basically the same stats otherwise. And then last year he dropped too many balls and people acted like he's a complete bum and calling for John fucking Ross to play over him when Ross' *career* drop rate is HIGHER than Slayton's drop rate in 2021 when everyone shit all over him.

A lot of us just don't know how to accept good solid players at this point. So many players we've had in the last like 5 years has been either terrible or great, and the pretty good ones have been either overhyped for being not terrible (like Slayton was originally) or have been great players who got paid and regressed like Leonard Williams or Jackrabbit or Vernon or whatever.

He dropped 11.1% of his targets in 2020 and had a really mediocre overall 2021 (26 catches for 430 yards and 3 TDs, but with 0 drops). And he got paid a (fairly team friendly in terms of outs and the like) contract.

But we're sitting around here like cutting him to save what would basically be 1.5m (because another player would take his place for \~1m) would be worth it? Not me. Trade him? Fine. Cut him? Absolutely not. He's a good solid depth piece. 

Just treat him like you treated John Ross last year. We had Golladay, Toney, Shep, and Slayton last year, and people liked signing Ross. Now Slayton slides out, Wan'Dale slides in.

4802,48857,48857,DoABarrowRoll,"Not necessarily in order, but things I'd highlight:

The QB: Unless things change very significantly with Jones' play, then you're looking at a guy who is floating around the outskirts of the top 20 QBs in the league, so you're already in the hole.

Poor roster going into the offseason: We all know Gettleman built a shit team. Thinking the team is going to go from 5 straight 10+ loss seasons to a playoff team overnight is probably wishful thinking.

New Regime: Schoen made tough decisions to get under the cap and had to try to get $200 worth of groceries with a budget of $100. So some stuff got lost, and the team got worse in some ways to try to maximize his budget (James Bradberry, for example).

Dane Belton might be a starter at safety as a 4th round pick. We might end up having a rookie start at NT, if this year's version of Danny Shelton doesn't pan out. Aaron Robinson is pretty much being given a starting job at boundary corner. Jon Feliciano hasn't played center in an NFL game as far as I recall and he's the starter at center with basically no competition. We're hoping that Daniel Bellinger, another 4th round pick, is going to be the starter at TE. 

Schoen is (hopefully, and all signs right now are this is true) better than Gettleman, but this roster was Gettleman's roster. Putting your own mark on a roster requires some time and they're being thoughtful and patient with it.

New Systems: I like the coaching staff the Giants have assembled, but it might not be super smooth. Their philosophies are different from the previous coaching staff's. The offensive coaches have a clear emphasis on creating explosive plays, and the defensive coaches have a clear emphasis on being aggressive as opposed to sitting back to try to limit explosive plays.

Breaking old habits and learning to play the new system consistently and effectively might not go great to start. It might take some time for the team to adjust to what the new coaching staff is asking them to do.

I don't know, I mean, I'm not saying that the Giants absolutely won't make the playoffs, but I think seeing is believing in this case. There is so much shit we just don't know about this team right now. Most of the roster, we don't even really know if they're good or not.

Until they show me that they are going to be a good team, I'm just going to assume they're still bad. Not necessarily irredeemable, not necessarily top 5 pick, but not a playoff team. Like I could see us being like 2021 ATL or WFT level, for example. Not a playoff team, but not irredeemably terribly bad.

For 2022 there's 2 main goals for me:

1. Learn things. Learn what players on the roster could be contributors and which are lost causes. Learn what plays work and what plays don't.
2. Be somewhat fun. I don't care if there's inconsistencies, I don't care if they lose games late on big individual mistakes, I don't care if they're bad most of the time. Just give me reasons to watch the team. Give me reasons to be excited to watch. Give me reasons to believe that this team has the right foundation in place and understands what they need to do. Having a bad CB2 is something we can fix. Having to replace the QB is something we can fix (though obviously it's hard). Getting beat because the other team is just better than us is something we can work on. But we need to be fun. There needs to be flashes, there needs to be moments. There needs to be more understanding from the team that playing not to lose sucks. Just make it feel like there's a clear path to success, even if we're not there yet.

If they do those 2 things, then 2022 is more or less a success in my eyes and then 2023 and beyond we can worry more about the actual results. Fix the process first, worry about the results later.",6.0,nygiants,t3_url2s4,False,0.0,None,2022-05-17T09:29:53Z,nygiants,-0.010159014530162

I don't blame people for wanting him to succeed and supporting ""our guy."" We've been conditioned to do it because we had to do it for a decade with Eli.

I think most people at this point are self aware enough to understand what the situation is. I just think a lot of people are hoping it works out so we don't have to do all of this again (especially since we did it for two years last time, looking at QBs in 2018 and 2019).

And the bar has been moved so low because even dating back to Eli, with the offensive line and the offensive system and all that being as bad as they were, and people are already super bad at evaluating QB play in general, we're still kind of learning as a fanbase what good QB play is actually supposed to look like. We've been a horrific offense for so long, you have to go back to 2015 to find the last time we were an actually good offense with good QB play, and even then a lot of the good offense in 2014-2015 was that OBJ guy.

In 2015 we had 7 guys with 10+ catches and 100+ yards; 2 of them were RBs (Vereen and Jennings), 2 of them were TEs (Tye and Donnell), and 2 of them were Rueben Randle (who never played another game in the NFL after that season, who was 2nd in targets, yards, and TDs and 3rd in catches on the team!) and Dwayne Harris. Not exactly worldbeaters!

2014 was a lot of the same with OBJ, Randle, Donnell, and Jennings, but then you add Preston Parker, Victor Cruz (that's the year he got hurt), Andre Williams, and Daniel Fells. Who the fuck are these people?

But in those years, Eli had around 4400 yards, 30+ TDs, 14 INTs. That's the last like truly good QB play we had. It's been 7 years! As a fanbase we just need to raise the bar again. The bar is on the floor right now when we're taking seasons like that as successes that indicate we should keep doing what we're doing.

I'd say all of those guys for the most part off of their current season are probably not considered viable options for a franchise tag contract. QB 2 is probably the closest. We all know very well how QBs 3, 4, 5, and 7's situations have played out. And QBs 1 and 6 are obvious absolutely not positive comparables.

I think the Giants would be stupid in their current situation to settle at the QB spot. We have a new GM, new HC, we're supposed to be embracing change and letting them reshape this organization. Out with the old, in with the new, and all that. Let them take a fucking swing instead of settling.

If we want to actually be different from the Giants of the Dave Gettleman era, then we have to be willing to let his mistakes go. Settling for Jones level QB play is fine when you don't really have a better option and he's inexpensive and you're just starting to build the foundation (ie this year). But man, committing 30m to that QB play? Another year of the careers of the guys around him? In the all-important second year of a new regime's tenure?

I just don't see what you're hoping would happen then. All it does is burn another year. You're certainly not hoping that year 5 will finally be the year that he figures it all out. So what would be the point? It would have to be just to get you through another year.

Now it's ""we need him so we can win as many games in 2022 as possible.""

It's not ""trying to be bad"" at all. It's as simple as we needed cap space to such a hilarious degree because Gettleman sold out 2022 to try to save himself in 2021, so he has to go.

Look at the players that the Giants have brought in, aside from their draft class. Those guys don't cost shit. Glowinski costs 3.3m this year, Feliciano 2.9m, and Tyrod Taylor 2.7m (in cap hits). 3 guys that people actively wanted anyways (or at positions people wanted, a starting guard, a depth OL, and backup QB). Then you have all the VSB guys.

The Giants haven't really spent money this year. They spent the 3rd least money in free agency, and the contracts they gave out this year come out to the lowest AAV of any team's free agency spending this year (per OTC). Releasing Bradberry basically pays for the top 5 free agents we signed, it basically pays for our draft class.

If the Giants were ""trying to be bad by roster design"" they could have made so many more moves. Dump as many players as possible, eat money on it this year if you have to, to accumulate as many picks as possible. But Schoen only cut Ryan (and I guess Rudolph but he doesn't really count), he gave Martinez and Shep paycuts to keep them on the roster instead of cutting them outright so there's 2 bodies that can help you. He refused to sell LW, KG, and Saquon. He has refused to eat any money on a James Bradberry trade.

This is purely a money move, where they're getting rid of a player that's not going to be here in 2023 and (rightly) wouldn't help the team out to stay (the way that Shep/Martinez did; because Bradberry actually has leverage because he's good and healthy).

But he'd take one of them, I don't think Cross would be his style, and he would know he couldn't pass on the OL at that pick.

At 7...It opens up a ton, frankly. He probably wouldn't have taken Thibodeaux, so the board opens up a ton. My money would be on Kyle Hamilton, probably, assuming he still cut Logan Ryan. Great tape, not so great athletic testing, not the highest positional value guy, but still a guy we definitely can use and have a role for.

He's never going to be the guy that you line up 1v1 heads up and tell him to move a guy.

No one is saying Cross couldn't understand what to do, it's that he doesn't have the traits to execute that consistently. The reason he works as a zone run blocker is because a lot of the point in zone is to get to your spot and get the defense moving laterally and create gaps in the defense that way, as opposed to in a more power/gap scheme, you're trying to push the defense out of the way to create gaps.

Think of it like this, and this is a huge exaggeration to make the point. Tell a 3 year old kid to lift 100lb. How hard is it to tell him to do it? Not hard at all.

For Neal specifically, it's almost entirely coaching. He leaves his feet behind in the run game at times, lunges into blocks when he has the space to drive his feet through guys. That's basically every rep of him on the ground I've ever seen.

In pass pro it's similar, punching too early/leaning into it. You don't see him lose his balance from a sturdy base, get bullrushed and put on his ass.

4815,48877,48877,DoABarrowRoll,"No one knows who the Giants will take.

Most of the recent discourse has been people trying to parse out where Neal and Cross are on the Giants' board. But a lot of that also has to do with everyone thinking Ekwonu will be gone before the Giants pick (and with recent reports about the Jets taking Ekwonu if he's there, that makes sense).

If you listen to Raanan, Duggan, Stapleton, and Garafolo, they make it sound like Neal is the Giants' preference. Rosenblatt and the one ""asshat"" (anonymous insiders that have been right too often to ignore entirely) on BBI that has been posting have said Cross (Rosenblatt listed Cross as the #1 most likely player for the Giants to pick, and said asshat suggested today that Cross was the top tackle for the Giants).

So I have no idea who the team will *actually* choose. What I *can* tell you is who I would want them to choose. I'd have them stacked Neal >>> Ekwonu >>>>>>> Cross.

Neal's versatility doesn't just extend to positions; he has the most experience out of anyone in a variety of different techniques, he's used to anything that an offensive system would require of him. He is, for my money, the best pass protector in the class. I know Cross usually gets that label, but I'll focus on Neal for now.

Neal has the most experience playing the game the way that an NFL team is going to ask him to. He's smooth and light on his feet in pass pro; he's a ridiculously freakish athlete, we know this even without him testing. He carries all his weight incredibly well. A lot gets made of Neal's balance issues sometimes, but it's pretty much all in the run game. In the pass game, he plays a lot more balanced, has a strong, heavy punch, great strength, doesn't get bullied backwards.

In the run game, he can get out over his skis too much and have some balance issues, but it's less an issue of balance than an issue of him leaving his feet behind when he doesn't need to. It's easier to see when you compare him to say Ekwonu, who is constantly running his feet. You'll see Neal on kickouts just not take the extra step. It's a bad habit to break and not a fatal flaw.

Ekwonu is a freaky athlete. Not a great pass protector right now, but it's technical stuff, using his hands, being more consistent in his pass sets. He's the guy you bet on the ceiling for because he has the tools and he has that killer mentality. He's a human highlight reel, especially in the run game. Improved dramatically quickly at NC State. He needs some work, but the upside is crazy good and he has the natural physical traits in spades.

Cross is where I diverge from a lot of people; I just don't see him as a great player. He hasn't been tasked with run blocking often so that's something that will need to be developed. He's not a people mover by any means like Neal and Ekwonu are, he's a combo/climb/carry guy or a sealer on his best reps in the run game.

He's not the pass protector everyone makes out to be for me either. The Air Raid scheme protects the tackles so much; the wide splits, the easy to execute footwork, if you're athletic enough you can handle it. It's a lot more similar to what we saw the Giants try to get Nate Solder and Matt Peart to do (not comparing the players, just schematically in pass pro). The Giants would ask those guys to protect their inside shoulder and just be ready to flip their hips and chase rushers around behind the QB. The Mike Leach Air Raid is the same thing.

Cross opens his hips early every rep, giving the rusher an easier lane outside because they know Cross can chase and recover from there because he is a great athlete. But what that also does is it overcommits Cross to the outside move, and a player with some speed to power who decides to challenge him inside can easily challenge him a lot to recover not just laterally but also anchor. Think Nate Solder getting flattened, similar idea.

I also don't think Cross has the power profile; I think he's kind of thin/lean. He's not a good puncher. When he gets bullrushed, he gives up a lot of ground, and even once he can steady the rush, he gives too much opening for rushers to get started. Compare that to guys like Thomas or say a guy like Rashawn Slater who was also on the smaller side, but Slater was super sturdy, he had great contact balance and core strength, he has a super heavy punch that stuns defenders. When they get their hands on guys, the rep is done. Cross, I don't feel like that's true.

I just think he's more of a ""basketball defender"" type blocker. He has great feet and will always be between the defender and the QB, but he's never going to make the first move and is too willing to take the charge, when in football, the charge is totally legal. He's not bad, he's got great feet, he's athletic, he has a ton of upside to be a pass pro specialist. I just think he's more in the Jonah Williams/Jake Matthews type category to me, not guys that you're like ""yeah this guy is a star"" but a guy you're like ""okay I mean I guess that's cool"" where he's not bad enough to need to be replaced, but he's never so good that you wouldn't consider it. I definitely understand why the Andre Dillard stuff comes up, it's not just helmet/scheme.

This team just has so many problems that Julian Love isn't really one of them.

The benefit, though, of drafting a safety like Pitre or something, is not necessarily just pushing Love out of a starting role, but the idea of building the depth top down; we know Love is a capable 3rd safety and can play in 3 safety sets. It would make sense on that front. Plus we know Love's contract is up this year, so adding a guy (possibly later in the draft too) to develop and then take over for him fully next year makes sense.

But I'm not like pounding the table to draft a safety because we need one; this draft just has a bunch of cool safeties I'd be interested in.

You'd think some of the leaks are probably from some of the people who are still there; maybe Pettit or Mara or McDonnell are the ones leaking things like being put off by Thibodeaux's personality or something. Hard to say until we know what they do and have something to base it off of.

Small update re: BBI:

Rico has essentially confirmed that the Toney trade rumours are true. Didn't say that Schoen is SHOPPING him, all he said about it is ""the Toney trade rumours are real.""

He also said that Toney was kind of a panic pick; the Giants took the deal with the Bears because the WRs were all gone and it was too good value not to. But the team didn't plan properly for that scenario. They hoped AVT would fall to them, and we've heard before they talked about Jamin Davis and Zaven Collins. But once those guys were gone, we weren't sure who to take. Gettleman was ""flying by the seat of his pants late in the first round.""

A different guy who is sometimes right sometimes wrong, just says way too much for me to trust him 100% and track what he says, said he heard the same, they didn't have a good plan for 20, all their targets were gone, and Judge was the one who pushed for them to draft Toney. All quite possible; Judge is the one that protected Toney the most and constantly was backing him and all that. Who knows.

At this point, I kind of expect them to trade him, now that the news is out. Feels like a bridge burned a little bit. The whole thing feels a little too OBJ to me, to be honest. Not in terms of Toney specifically but in terms of the org trading the player. We don't necessarily *want* it to be true, but I'm leaning towards it happening. That part is just a gut guess, I don't have sources of my own or anything.

I'm going to try not to lose it over trading him; I wasn't a big fan of his coming out, he had some great moments but I feel like sometimes we talk about him like he had an OBJ rookie year or something. I can understand why the team would want to just cut ties and start fresh. I'd rather get a day 2 pick for him now than have the team be ""proven right"" (since they're considering trading him, something's gotta be up, and it's gotta be more than just not being at voluntary workouts) and it not work out.

I wouldn't. It doesn't make sense for these mid ass or useless guys to be the top values over players who actually did produce, just because they were much later picks, so there were fewer expectations.

4825,48891,48891,DoABarrowRoll,"The conclusion for us is fair, but the methodology has some big holes.

First of all: Using CAREER AV is a huge flaw. This skews the results super heavily towards the *earliest* classes in the study. Career AV is an accumulative stat; the longer you play, naturally, the higher your AV will go. For example, Andy Dalton's career AV is 108, Patrick Mahomes' is 75. And Dalton was a later pick. So for the purposes of this exercise, Dalton is perceived as a way better pick, which we obviously wouldn't agree with.

It also kind of makes this more of a ""who was good in the mid 2010s"" competition. The highest and lowest scores are often at the earlier end of the spectrum; the Seahawks are #1 but only had 2 particularly positive classes; 2012 and 2015. The 4 most polar (most positive or negative) classes from Seattle were the first 4 years of the study. In the last 6 years, they're at -20.4. 

The 29th team, the Tennessee Titans, have almost as negative a total as the Seahawks have a positive score, but their value for the last 6 years is +18.5. That -20.4 in the last 6 years is a really bad number, but they're still the top team because of what they did in 2012, basically.

It probably would have been better to somehow adjust it yearly, but that makes it difficult for the more recent classes as well, since they don't really have enough data to do that.

The other big thing I have an issue with is how it's adjusted; it's way too heavily weighted against high picks and in favor of lower picks to me.

I definitely agree that the best GMs make their marks in the later rounds, but the ""Over Expectation"" adjustment skews it really heavily against top picks and towards ""best value picks"". Hitting on a good player with a high pick is often not valuable compared to getting a meh player with a late pick. First round picks appear as Least CAVOE 48 more times than they do in most CAVOE. That actually works out to be right around twice as often (49 1st rounders in most CAVOE if I counted right).

To cherry-pick a couple of examples: If I asked you for the best pick in the Giants 2014 draft class, you would probably say Odell Beckham. If I asked you for the second best pick, you might pick Weston Richburg. By career AV, those are the two best picks as well, according to PFR. But instead, Devon Kennard is the best ""value"" pick, because he was a solid player picked with a 5th round pick. I can see the argument for Kennard over Richburg, but if your analysis suggests the Giants made a better pick picking Kennard in the 5th than Odell in the 1st, I take issue.

A better example: The 2012 draft class for the Giants was putrid. Full stop. But the fact that Markus Kuhn, who played 39 games, only started 11 games, had a career 1.5 sacks and 48 combined tackles, and a career AV of 6, is considered the top player by CAVOE over (also bad player) Rueben Randle, who had 188 catches for 2644 yards and 20 TDs in 64 games and 33 starts in his Giants career, and a career AV of 22 (!!), is absolutely absurd to me.

There is no world in which the Giants would want Randle as a 2nd rounder (63rd overall), but I'd much rather pick him with the 63rd pick than Markus Kuhn with the 239th pick. One actually did things, and the other basically never existed.

Another one: Bobby fucking Hart is the ""best"" pick in the 2015 class. The dude who somehow keeps getting jobs even though he's never been good. Over the guy who was a legit DPOY candidate in 2016 and set the market for his position (to some degree) in Landon Collins. All because Hart is a late round pick and Collins was the 33rd pick.

Obviously what pick you use on a player should matter, but if the 15th pick should have an AV of 50 and gets a 51, and the 200th pick should have an AV of 1 and gets a 2, those are not equivalent. At all. To treat them as equal is ridiculous.

It doesn't change that the Giants have been bad at drafting, but this methodology is extremely flawed. It overvalues picks at the beginning of the time period compared to the end of the time period and it overvalues small scale hits (ie mid level starters or rotational pieces that hang around) in the late rounds over quality players (decent starters that maybe weren't worth the draft pick in the end) in the earlier rounds, even though you'd much rather spend the higher pick on the better player anyways.",12.0,nygiants,t3_u9fo4e,False,0.0,None,2022-04-22T12:28:06Z,nygiants,0.0072721389180138
4826,48892,48892,DoABarrowRoll,"If Neal and Ekwonu are gone in the top 4, then fine I guess. It's reaching for need but I at least understand what they're doing.

If you're going to take Cross over Neal or Ekwonu, you had damn well better be right. If you pick Sauce at 5 and let Carolina just leave you with Cross, you better be right that they're equivalent players.

It's different when you're drafting a guy that is pretty widely considered a top player. It's different if you pick Neal and he bombs. It's different if the Jags pick Trevor Lawrence and he busts. No one is going to look back and go ""you should have seen that coming"". 

It's more like Gettleman drafting Jones, Baker, and Thomas.

With Jones, the whole thing was ""there's one team that loooooves Jones way more than anybody else, one team has him as QB1."" If you're going to die on the hill for a guy that you're kind of alone on, you better be right.

Same thing with Baker. He was the first corner taken in the 2019 draft, the Giants traded up to get him, called him the best cover corner in the draft. That draft also included some really good players, Byron Murphy went 33, Sean Murphy-Bunting went 39, Trayvon Mullen (my CB1 that year who has been really good for the Raiders) went 40. They knew he had some effort issues, said ""nah this is fine."" And he came in and was falling asleep in meetings, was overall a bad player (the whole ""playing off vs playing press"" thing is moot when you called the guy the best cover corner in the draft), and hasn't made his mark on the Chiefs since landing there after his incident. Not blaming anyone on that one, but if he was so great, he would be playing for the Chiefs.

Thomas is the case where it worked out really well, they actually were right in the end. There was so much hype around Mekhi Becton being a freak, so many people were all aboard the Jedrick Wills train, Tristan Wirfs was the guy the team was connected to the most (and the Giants did love Wirfs). Thomas was a pretty consensus top guy coming into the season, and then from like December to March his stock took a huge hit. He went from being consistently mocked in the top 10 to being mocked outside the top 10, with a number of mocks with him like outside the top 15, before it rebounded a good bit in April.

The Giants draft Thomas, he has a really rough start to his rookie year and people are losing it because the other 3 guys were having decent success. All the ""Gettleman picked the obviously worst one"" stuff. Then he starts to turn it around, has a fantastic 2022 season, and now it's like the last regime's parting gift to us was a star (potentially superstar, pending health/consistency) left tackle. This time, they died on the hill, and they got it right.

And the Bills have had cases like this too. Josh Allen was not well liked in 2018, and the Bills gave up a starting OT (Cordy Glenn) and 2 2nds (like 53 and 56 or something) to get him. Again, it looked rough at first, but they were rewarded in the end.

Point being: if they're going to pick Cross over Neal or Ekwonu, or if they're so confident in Cross being equal to those guys that they let Carolina make the decision for them instead of picking whichever they like slightly more at 5 and getting their other player at 7 knowing Carolina is going to pick an OT, they need to be right about it.",4.0,nygiants,t3_u8luee,False,0.0,None,2022-04-21T07:25:25Z,nygiants,0.0271822061573012

I just don't care what he does. His level of success this year doesn't really have an impact on whether I think the season was successful or not. I don't view him as a long term piece of the team, just like I don't really view Golladay, Shep, or Martinez as long term pieces of the team, just like I didn't really view Ryan or Bradberry as long term pieces of the team before Ryan was cut and Bradberry's trade/release was deemed necessary.

All of DG's mercenaries are just here to plug short term holes, in my mind. Even almost all of Schoen's are here to plug short term holes; I don't really care how good Feliciano or Glowinski are either. And I really don't care about the short term. I don't care about how good this team is until their QB situation is ""fixed"", whether that be Jones magically figuring it out or him being replaced. Until that point, these short term solutions are meaningless to me and them having great years or shitty years doesn't make me feel like the season was that good.

2020 was a perfect example. Second year of Jones' career, we came out of that year with a strong 5-3 finish, everybody loved Joe Judge. But beneath the surface, that team had a putrid offense despite everything and was really carried by a group of veteran free agent players and a very good performance from a DC to win those games. Those 5 wins were against bad teams, bad QBs, and one great win against Seattle. And the 3 other teams we played beat our ass much like how we ended this year. And 2020 turned out to be smoke and mirrors, all those players regressed in 2021 (or in Martinez's case got hurt unfortunately), and the whole thing fell apart, and now we're sitting here lamenting once again how bad DG was and it's all because he built this team on free agents.

Shep and Martinez are different partly because of the injuries but Leonard Williams is just not a hugely impactful player to me. He's a good solid player but not a player that I'm keeping on my roster for a 26m cap hit like he's going to have next year.

The Giants would eat less dead money and save (a lot) more money cutting Williams vs cutting Golladay after this year, for what that's worth.

I don't really buy into the criticism about Saquon that he's too boom or bust because I think that's just how the run game works a lot of the time; guys like Derrick Henry and Zeke Elliott have games under 4ypc plenty too, and it's when they have some bigger chunk plays that they get those numbers up.

Different bands of information kind of. I'm not sure really how to explain it. Like Leonard will get sit-down dinners with Daniel Jones to write a feature on him or the organization will feed him stuff to tell us to try to like hype us up or make us feel less bad about certain things. When he has stuff, he has things that the team *intends* for us to know. As opposed to just having sources that they can ask for whatever they're looking for.

In terms of him being outright *wrong* about things, it's also usually a product of him being one of the few beat reporters that really tries to like get out in front of things and speculate, while the other reporters don't really do a ton of speculation. We'll be in February and he'll be writing things about prospects he's heard the Giants like and stuff like that, when in reality even the team probably doesn't really know.

Hopefully that makes more sense on that front. He gets told things because the team wants us to know them, but when it comes to the serious stuff like predicting draft picks and major decisions, they're not going to tell him, so he gets shit wrong.

> Regarding Patricia Traina, how is she from a purely factual standpoint, though (as in: her claims end up either true, or they don't)?

Good. She has integrity in terms of not reporting things she's not sure are true, she's not going to report we signed a player and then turns out we weren't actually even talking to that player or something like that. We don't really have problems like that with any local reporters, even Vacchiano/Leonard; for the most part the people who are getting things wrong are the people who are trying to predict things like draft interests and stuff like that.

Typically my view of accuracy for us is mostly about: how many of them are saying this? If they're *all* saying it, chances are it's true. There's not a lot that happens in our sphere where one beat reporter is banging the drum on something and no one else is on it and it ends up being this huge scoop. Like us trying to trade one of our picks, *everybody* is saying that's something they're looking to do. If that makes more sense.

Most people who do, like myself, just check once a week or so in periods of the year that we know those guys are active. Starting from like the Senior Bowl or the Combine or something, just kind of checking their profiles every now and again. 

To clarify, the ""Recent Posts"" are posts that the user *commented on* not necessarily that they *wrote*. So usually I'll just open up each one of those that's new since the last time I checked, Ctrl+F for the person's name I'm looking for and just look through.

4836,48945,48945,DoABarrowRoll,">Which Giants reporters, when their name's on a report/tweet, do you trust it to be true?

I don't think anyone on the Giants beat is ever legitimately *inaccurate* in terms of actual moves being made. I do think there are some who are more speculative than others, but the ones I really trust are Dan Duggan, Jordan Raanan, Zack Rosenblatt, Art Stapleton. If those guys are saying something is happening, they *know* it's happening. They don't really throw out a lot of speculation, if they're saying it, they have a source and a corroboration.

>Whose claims (ex: signings, trades, speculation) need to be taken with a grain (or chunk) of salt?

For me, just anyone that is claiming things that no one else also has. Usually with the Giants beat at least, if someone gets a scoop, then they all work their sources to figure out if it's true, and you'll get them kind of confirming with each other on Twitter, ""I also heard this is the case."" But there's also times where they say ""I asked my sources and that's not true.""

For me, the ones I trust the least: Pat Leonard and Ralph Vacchiano. Not that I don't think they've heard what they say they've heard, I just think the team uses them more than they use the other guys I've mentioned. I think they get fed information to leak more systematically, to gauge fan reactions or put specific information out there that the team *wants* you (or other teams) to see.

When Vacchiano is writing about how Gettleman needs to keep his job or that Gettleman needs to go but they need to keep Judge, that indicates to me that that's what the team *wants* him to write, so while it's not *inaccurate*, it's at least tinted. I don't think in terms of speculation we have anyone that's like super inside the building kind of as a reporter, and I think that the Giants have it that way on purpose.

Honorable Mention: Patricia Traina. Not that I don't trust her or that she's not a good journalist or anything like that. No disrespect, her articles are usually quite good, especially with stuff like the CBA/salary cap. Knowledgable. I just find her to fill a specific niche that I don't love when it comes to like uncovering information. She always struck me as one of the most ""homerish"" reporters, trying to justify everything the team did and calm people down and stuff, while guys like Duggan, Raanan, Rosenblatt, and Stapleton (to a lesser degree, Stapleton can be a bit homerish too imo) are much less afraid to just say ""this is dumb why are they doing that?""

>Are there any random fan accounts that somehow seem to have inside information?

The most common one is [Unnamed NFL Source](https://twitter.com/nfl_unnamed). Nailed a lot of the Giants picks the last few years, was very early on Saquon, Daniel Jones, had us down to Wirfs and Thomas about a week before the draft (which was later confirmed to be true, even while Thomas was still floating outside the top 10), had us as super in on DeVonta Smith. Not necessarily a lot of like unknown information, but typically has been close. Had some other more minor stuff like schedule leaks. Not Giants related, but had Mike Tomlin's extension very early; he seems to have a connection of some sort to the Tisch family.

If you are happy to dig through their old timey forum, BigBlueInteractive's forum (BBI) also has some people that have had good information. Rico and Peppers are really the two that I trust and listen to, they've been right a bunch of times before. They were the first people talking about the Giants being super high on Wirfs and DeVonta Smith the past few years.

Rico in particular has been very on top of it in recent years. He was the first person to mention Gettleman exploring trading for Golladay at the 2020 trade deadline (which Raanan later confirmed). For last year's draft he said:

* The Giants are not interested in Parsons or Slater (ended up being true enough; not necessarily they didn't like them but they would rather trade out which I'm perfectly fine with; if Gettleman and Judge loved one they probably would have just picked them. And see the next point:)
* The Giants would have been willing to pick Alijah Vera-Tucker had they not traded back (later confirmed by Raanan and/or Duggan that AVT was a target for them).
* He said ""From what I'm hearing, EDGE is not our focus in round 1"" (that ended up being true).

For what this part is worth, Rico has said for this year ""don't expect us to take Thibodeaux"" and indicates that he agrees with the character concern issues. So we'll maybe find out in a few weeks here on that front.

> Any that repeatedly claim to have sources, but are regularly wrong?

A few BBIers have been wrong a lot of times. GoDeep13 and JonC in particular for me have just been offbase the last couple of years fairly often, JonC just says too much stuff so he's bound to be wrong sometimes. Not that they're *always* wrong and need to be avoided, just grain of salt stuff. 

Also, NFLRums or whatever on Twitter, idk where their shit started, but they're not real, don't pay attention to them.

For the most part, I don't see a ton of ""I have sources in the building"" accounts to begin with though.

> Any national reporters that can (or cannot) be trusted? (ex: Jeremy Fowler, Mike Garafolo, etc)

Garafolo for the Giants I believe 1000000% on the Giants. He was on the Giants beat at one point and has some connections from that. Schultz is the guy right now that we absolutely do *not* trust; had a lot of stuff wrong with us this offseason. Otherwise, I don't think there's a lot of speculation on us from national reporters that isn't on par with how they are for other teams. Like ""I've been told that [insert team] is interested in [insert player]"" or anything like that. Pretty par for the course stuff.",9.0,nygiants,t3_u0miqv,False,0.0,None,2022-04-10T15:03:44Z,nygiants,0.0104008739758463
4837,48946,48946,DoABarrowRoll,"It's certainly not easy to find one of those top elite guys, but I also think that:

1. It's easier today than it's ever been, and teams have taken notice of that and how important it is, so teams are doing things like trading for Watson/Stafford and trading up to take Trey Lance and things like that.
2. It's also significantly easier to find QBs that can play at the level we've seen from Jones than people think as well.

The graph of NFL QBs is a bell curve, kind of. There's very few guys that are on that absolute peak end of the curve, but then as you get to the ""midrange starter"" level, there's a lot more guys that can hit that. The difference between the 5th and 6th best QB is probably comparable to the difference between the 10th and 20th QB or something like that.

Is Jones *that* much worse than Hurts or Goff or Wentz or Mayfield? Probably not. But we can tell how far he is away from the Dak, Kyler, Derek Carr sort of tier of players too. It's not that hard to find a random guy who can get you by. Teams keep giving guys like Fitzpatrick, Trubisky, and Winston contracts, and teams keep giving bridge QBs like Bridgewater and Dalton opportunities. We've had to have conversations about who's better between Jones and guys like Minshew, Heinicke, etc.

There's more than 32 starter caliber QBs in the NFL, but just being ""starter caliber"" isn't what teams and fans are looking for. If all you want is a guy who can throw the ball well and has a good arm and can start for you, then you never need to draft a QB high. You can find those guys that will just get you by. You don't need to cling onto the one you have if that's the bar that you're shooting for.

4838,48947,48947,DoABarrowRoll,"I think at this point, there's very few people who actually actively want to keep Daniel Jones. I think the number of people who really truly believe in him to be a great player this year and moving forward is small. I think there are still people who think he could be good, but most of them use the surroundings as the excuse for his play and thus understand that by the time that would be fixed, he'd be gone anyways. I think people realize that the next time the Giants make the playoffs, the odds of Jones being under center are slim to none.

I think the problem is that people just don't think that the guy you would draft this year is good. Keeping Daniel Jones this year is less about Daniel Jones and a lot more about Malik Willis, Matt Corral, Kenny Pickett, Sam Howell, and Desmond Ridder, and anger about keeping Daniel Jones is simply misplaced to me.

If you're down to take Willis (which I am as well, to be clear, though I am personally partial to Matt Corral), then that's really where the disconnect is, not keeping Jones. I don't want to keep Jones, but I also am willing to accept a reality where the team just decides that this QB class isn't for them, doesn't have the guy they want, and they're willing to punt for now. 

If they just say ""fine, we're stuck with Jones this year, his money is guaranteed, he's cheap, let's stick with the theme we've been using at every other position and just get through this year, clean the books, and get ready for our rebuild to really start"" I'm okay with that.

The Giants are in a position where it's all about 2023 and 2024. If they decide that one of the QBs in this class is a viable option for them for those years, then they should go for it. If you're sold on Willis, then you take him. That's how it always is in this league: If you have the opportunity to make a big upgrade at QB, you take it. Where it gets dicey is when none of your options are good. Like say Washington last year. They weren't in a position to get a rookie QB, they didn't really have a good option in Heinicke, they kind of just hedged their bets with Fitzpatrick, and it bombed. If you think this QB class is shit, which some people do, some people think every single one of these guys sucks, then yeah don't waste the pick.

4840,48951,48951,DoABarrowRoll,"definitely a wild guess on King's part just based on what the Bills did to get Allen. They traded out of the pick that became Pat Mahomes to collect an extra 1st in 2018, they traded Sammy Watkins and got a 2nd rounder from the Rams, and then when 2018 came around they said ""cool bet let's do this shit."" And luckily they were able to do it without using that extra 1st rounder; they were able to use Cordy Glenn to move up NINE spots in the 1st round (from 21 to 12) and then packaged the 2 2nds they had (theirs plus the Watkins pick) to go to 7 and get Allen.

We all know exactly what the team's options are. They can make the picks if they are in the position to do so. They can trade out of the picks and accumulate more capital to use for a QB move. When it comes to ""wanting to trade down"" it's all smoke up my ass until it comes together. 

We did the whole song and dance in 2020 with the AT pick with people being like ""well Gettleman really wants to trade down and a team might want to jump LAC/MIA for a QB and we can still get the OT we want."" We did the whole thing again in 2021 talking about whether we could trade down if a QB falls and then the Cowboys went on the clock at 10 and we were like ""okay well never mind"" and then it actually did happen.

Trade *speculation* can be fun: Which teams might want to make a big move, how does free agency affect these teams, etc. But trade *prediction* could not be more boring to me. Takes two to tango. If they find a trade that they think is worth their while, they'll make it, but until it happens, that information is really all I need. 

The much more interesting stuff is whatever we can intuit about their opinions on specific *prospects.* Would they take Neal or Ekwonu if both were available? Would they take Gardner or Thibodeaux if both were available at 7?

4843,48955,48955,DoABarrowRoll,"You don't. The Giants will have to create more cap space in order to do that, and trading James Bradberry would be a huge chunk of that, if not outright enough it would be close and you might have to do a little more. We know they're not really going to trade Saquon, but trading him and Bradberry would get it done. They also have some options in terms of restructuring players (which Schoen doesn't *want* to do, but might *have* to do) like Golladay or Leonard Williams or Adoree' Jackson.

In terms of the timeline, this is actually the ""fun"" part of the conversation. You don't have to sign the players right when they're drafted; often times players don't sign until almost into training camp, and they'll sign a waiver of some sort that basically says ""if some shit was to go down in these practices before you get your contract, then we'll help take care of you"" or something like that.

So realistically, the Giants don't absolutely need to create that space until sometime over the summer, but at that point, they will have to make some moves in order to sign those guys. That's why Bradberry isn't gone yet; they can kind of bide their time a little bit and try to artificially create a stronger market for him by waiting it out and seeing which teams maybe miss out on a CB in the draft and get desperate or have an injury over the summer and need to fill the hole or something like that.",8.0,nygiants,t3_ttolgx,False,0.0,None,2022-04-01T08:33:40Z,nygiants,0.0199933755397796

4846,48958,48958,DoABarrowRoll,"I just don't think there's a point really, if that makes sense. Okay you are going to trade Toney to get a 1st round pick, but then you're going to turn around and use the 1st round pick on a WR probably, because that's the whole reason you drafted Toney in the first place.

So basically to me the question is: Would you trade Toney for Jahan Dotson/Chris Olave/whatever WR is going to be available in the late 1st that the Chiefs would presumably draft? Or potentially ""Would you trade Toney and the 7th pick for Garrett Wilson or whatever WR you'd take at 7 and whatever other late 1st round player?""

To me, I'd probably just rather keep Toney; we kind of know what his upside is and what he's able to do in the NFL already; what's the upside of trading him if you're just going to be replacing him with a draft pick?

It would be different with an older player who makes a lot of money (cough Kenny Golladay cough), because you're getting younger, you're saving money, you're kind of resetting that window. But with a 2nd year player that you're going to trade just to open a hole you are going to fill with essentially this year's version of that player, I just am not sure what the point is.

4847,48959,48959,DoABarrowRoll,"> Very interested to see the gameplan for the Giants this year and for the future.

I think this year's gameplan is a lot more straightforward than maybe we thought it was going to be; stabilize, win 6+ games, lay some sort of foundation with the draft class and some of the young players from the last couple of drafts (AT, McKinney, Toney, Azeez), and then the future is going to be the interesting part. 

How this regime approaches free agency in 2023 when they have a lot more money to spend, how they build out the team when they're focused more on replacing the outgoing vets like Golladay/Jackson/Williams/etc.

> We're kind of going into the season with 0 reliable weapons in an offensive led league with an offensive minded HC. Not necessarily a great look for Jones or if we attempt to go rookie in 2023.

I mean sure, but also what else are you going to do in this situation? Yes, a lot of these guys have missed games or been inconsistent at times, but at the same time, we know what these guys are capable of when healthy and can use a lot of that information to our advantage too.

I guess the point isn't that we need to fix that stuff right now, but I think part of the appeal of having an offensively minded HC is that he'll be able to do a bit more with less than the previous regime did.

I also tend to think that for 2023, it can be pretty comfortably wrapped up; we just have to lay the groundwork for it starting this year. That's why I'm cool with drafting a WR whenever this year if the team decides that's where the value is (especially when Shep and Slayton are pending free agents and Golladay could be cut if he doesn't have a good year this year), I'm invested in landing a TE (gut instinct is one of those 3rd rounders will end up being Greg Dulcich), I'm invested in bringing in at least 1 if not 2 RBs in the draft/UDFA (and trading Saquon personally but less about his reliability and more about his future with the team).

I think the weapons are passable this year, but obviously, injuries will cause problems as they come up; the best teams have figured out how to manage that, and that'll apply to us too. I also think, again, the goal this year is to just be passable/respectable, and then kind of launch into things whenever they have actually figured out who they want under center.

> Also, just to make sure I'm not surrounded by crazy people. Does anyone else realize how risky as hell it is to hope for a rookie QB next year?

Yup, I've been saying it since we were 1-7 after losing to TB on MNF in *2020*. You never know what your team is going to do (we finished 5-3 that year!) or what the QBs are going to do (Rattler and Howell went from top 5 picks to going back to school and transferring and being a borderline 1st rounder).

When to draft a QB is a pretty easy question to answer: When there's a guy you really believe in to be a top QB in the league, you take them. The hard part of the question is figuring out which horses to back. If the Giants think Willis or Corral or whoever will be a great NFL QB, they should draft them, even if consensus isn't so high on them.

I get that that's kind of how we ended with Jones, but I'd also argue I think the Giants felt much more pressed into drafting a QB, rather than truly fully believing in Jones at the time. Even when they took him I said ""I don't agree but if he's their guy I'm glad they went for it.""

So yeah, it's definitely not as easy as saying ""oh just wait and get Young/Stroud"" because you have to be legitimately one of the worst teams in the NFL to get those guys; the teams that would be bad enough to get them next year aren't going to trade out of those picks.

4850,48962,48962,DoABarrowRoll,"I've realized after writing this whole comment it's incredibly confusing so I apologize haha. If there's anything I can do to clarify, let me know.

The tl;dr is: HB and TE are the only positions were you are not gaining value on a rookie contract compared to what the player's performance is worth. But LB, G, C, S, and CB, you don't gain particularly much value (mostly on the order of 1-2.5m AAV). Then OT, WR, EDGE, and DL you gain more value than the other positions, and QB is obviously the most value. 

But for the most part, picks in the top 10 are overvalued in the sense that the cost of a rookie contract is too high. The actual value of the player declines slower than the cost of the contract, meaning the players are more valuable relative to the cost of their rookie contract with picks outside the top 10 than in the top 10 usually.

ie EDGE at pick 1 is worth 15m, actually costs 10m, profit 5m, but EDGE at pick 40 is worth 10m, actually costs 2m, profit 8m. 8m > 5m, so you gain more value relative to spending outside the top 10.

\-- end tl;dr --

it's not that a rookie contract C is more expensive than he's worth especially at the top of the draft, it's more that the value you get in excess of the rookie contract value is small. And really this evaluation is primarily for the absolute top end of the draft.

You'll notice that the orange curve is identical for every position; that's because the orange curve is the rookie contract value, which doesn't care about the position. Whether you draft a RB or a QB, the cost of their rookie contract would be the same.

The blue curve shows you basically ""how much value does the player drafted at this draft pick provide""? So your shallower curves are showing you positions where the players that get drafted in the 33-40 range are close in value to those that are drafted ahead of that. TE and HB for example.

The green curve basically is showing you how much value you ""profit"", or the ""excess value"" of the player. The value you get minus the cost of the contract. So QB for example, guys in the top 10 are worth 20+m but only cost you 5-10m, meaning you are getting effectively 15+m in value. That player should be costing you more, but you have them for less.

So almost all positions provide you surplus value across the board, with the exception of it looks like TE and HB, where the surplus value at players drafted with the highest picks is almost or entirely nonexistent.

Then the players at CB, S, LB, G, and C generally don't give you much surplus value, but they give you some with those top picks.

And then EDGE, WR, T, and DL all give you a pretty significant surplus at the top of the draft. And QB obviously even more.

Then we can look at which positions kind of trail off in surplus value. QBs surplus value declines significantly the further in the draft you get; if you're going to pick a QB, you should probably do it earlier. Similar for DL (which is interesting to me considering usually the contention is that DL aren't that important, but I supposed DL early in the draft are assumed to be high upside pass rushers), where it kind of peaks and trails off. OT is similar as well.

Other positions you actually more value as the picks go on. HB, IOL, TE, LB, S are definitely like that (and anecdotal evidence kind of backs that up).

The EDGE/WR/CB charts are interesting because they still provide you some solid surplus at varying times, but the surplus value also still mostly increases over time. What that indicates to me is that this analysis really just thinks high picks are generally overvalued. 

It's not that players at those positions aren't worth it (they are important positions and do provide surplus value), but it's more that the cost is so high early in the draft that the reduced cost as the draft goes on (DeVonta Smith makes 5m AAV, but Elijah Moore makes approx 2.25m AAV) gives you a lot more surplus because the costs drops faster than the actual value of the player.

For comparison, look at the QB chart; The blue line drops much faster than the orange line drops, which tells you that the performance value (what the player is worth) and the rookie cost (what the player is paid) get closer over time. But for WR or EDGE for example, it looks like they fall at much more similar rates. And since the rookie cost (orange) drops off much faster at the earlier picks, that's why the surplus really increases, not because the players aren't worth the contract.

So basically, for a lot of positions, the contention is that having a top 10 pick doesn't actually feel super good because the cost is too high at those picks compared to later picks. The ""bang for your buck (dollar spent)"" factor is actually worse at higher picks than later picks for almost every position. But there still are positions (namely, QB, EDGE, WR, OT, DL) where you still get bang for your buck in the top 10, but you are more likely to get more bang for your buck if you move down.",4.0,nygiants,t3_tqgchi,False,0.0,None,2022-03-28T14:29:20Z,nygiants,0.0072786509036647

He has to show me consistent reasons to believe he is and can be better than the Jimmy G/Goff/Cousins tier of QBs. If he does that, the stats and wins will follow. ""Hold onto the ball and have average numbers"" just doesn't do it for me, not for a team that is on all other fronts rebuilding.

65% completion percentage was 19th in the league this year. 3500 yards would be 19th this year. 25 TDs would have been a solid T-11th this year. But that's pretty much what Jones was on pace for this year! Aside from the touchdowns which are, we can all admit, highly volatile year to year.

Hill wins kind of by default but Robinson hopefully will usurp that (and that's realistic imo). Thought about Darian Thompson because he's been sticking around with Dallas for a while.

I think Cam Brown is an easy choice over Corey Ballentine, one is still here (though only as a ST guy) while the other was really bad on defense and didn't hang on special teams. All of the options are really bad though.

4856,48969,48969,DoABarrowRoll,"I don't think in the vet market, not with Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll running things.

Joe Schoen has been pretty clear about building through the draft, draft develop and retain, etc etc. I think that that much is going to continue, and continue at the QB position as well. I think he realizes that there's a lot of work to do not just with resetting this roster, but with also keeping up with the attrition that naturally happens; Logan Ryan is already gone, we're losing Bradberry this year, Martinez and Shep are on the way out, who knows how long we're really holding onto Kenny Golladay, Leonard Williams, Adoree' Jackson. We'll see about that moving forward.

I think he has a clear vision of building this team from the ground up, but just doesn't have the need that I do to blow the roster up first. So I think that process is the emphasis.

Not that I don't think Ryan or Wilson would be upgrades, at least in the short term, but I don't think that's what the vision is moving forward. And maybe I'm wrong and just hoping that Schoen's philosophy and vision is more like my own. But I think he's got a clear long term vision for how this team is going to be built up. 

I think he wants to win soon, like anyone else, but I think he knows that where this team is in 4 or 5 years is a lot more important than where this team is in 1 year. And I think that would take you out of a lot of the trade market; either giving up too much for a guy you're not prepared to support, or just not being worth it as a long term solution.

It seems like Schoen gets it and generally is aligned with most of us: Jones probably isn't the long term solution, but whether it's worth it to move on now is certainly up for discussion. When you then have to also think about Matt Ryan's age or Wentz's inconsistency or Russ's cost or Watson's legal/moral/ethical dilemmas, then it makes that decision a bit easier to say ""nah it's cool we'll make the team better and find the QB later.""

4859,48972,48972,DoABarrowRoll,"Daboll's offense in Buffalo was super super multiple in the run game. Early in 2021, they were a much heavier zone team, and then as the team kind of hit its groove and they found their best 5 man unit on the OL, they transitioned to a more gap/power oriented system.

Based on adding Glowinski, and to a lesser degree Feliciano and Gono (who to me are depth/stopgap options and not really guys you're building your scheme around), and the assumption that Saquon isn't going anywhere, I'm going to *guess* the goal is to play some more wide zone type run schemes, so we're trying to get Saquon out in space and have him press holes and get him one on one matchups with DBs.

I don't know, however, whether that's really their goal or if it's kind of their ""transition period"" idea while they really set up what they want to do.

To that end as far as draft prospects go, there's really just a few guys that for me would be out and out bad in a wide zone scheme: Trevor Penning (and for OTs it's less of a worry for me, and with Penning in particular it's just a waste of his natural power talents imo), Kenyon Green, Lecitus Smith, Darian Kinnard, Chasen Hines, Tyler Smith, Justin Shaffer. I like almost all of these players (Tyler Smith I'm lower on than the consensus but he's not awful) but they're just not the kind of athlete that you look for for that scheme. And athleticism will be one of the biggest limiting factors.

Guys that could really excel in those systems are guys like: Ekwonu, Linderbaum, Cole Strange (one of my biggest draft crushes this year), Dohnovan West, maybe Dylan Parham, Max Mitchell, Nicholas Petit-Frere.

And we're going to backload the contracts to do it because we need to win games NOW."" They put us in this position to try to prove themselves right and save their jobs.

The problem obviously was they spent it on players that weren't that good and gave them to coaches (especially on offense) that weren't that good.

The perception changes a lot if everything went the way they wanted it to; Jones develops to being a top 10 QB, the OL meshes with Gates being healthy, Thomas taking a leap, Peart becoming a playable RT, Lemieux developing and being healthy. Golladay gives Jones the WR1 he needs while Slayton, Toney, and Engram give you explosive playmaking threats, Shep and Rudolph are safety blankets, KG and Rudolph elevate your red zone game. Saquon gets back to being Saquon. And then on defense you have a great CB1/2 combo with Bradberry and Jackson, you have a strong front with Dex, Leo, AJ, Azeez, and Carter who finally takes his step. Martinez is healthy and coordinating while Ryan and McKinney hold it down over the top. Team shows the fight it did in 2020, wins 11+ games, makes a playoff appearance, maybe even wins a game.

They're only really sleepers if we're talking to people who don't pay attention to anything outside the top picks to begin with.

Just picking the players in the OP so I'm not digging through the comments:

On TheDraftNetwork (not a great source but easiest to access) those are EDGE players 9, 11, 12, and 15. Sounds sleeperish until I contextualize by saying that Ebiketie (EDGE15) is the 83rd (!!!!!!) ranked player on their board (yes, roughly 1 in 6 of their top 100 is an EDGE).

You have LBs 3, 4, 11, and 12, with Andersen and Chenal being 11 and 12 at spots 95 and 96 on their board (so roughly 1/8 of their top 100).

You have TEs 2, 3, 5, 9, and 14 with Woods and Turner being the only players listed outside the top 100 (165 and 221 respectively).

Again, it's not a shot; to normal people who don't watch as much and study as much as I do, those guys might be sleepers they've never heard about. But to me it's 10+ top 100 players that the draft community kind of already knows about.

Take mine, the only player I listed that's in their top 100 is Pitre, and that was purely because I have to mention him and how much I like him. Strange is the only other guy that I think really should be.

The upside of the incentives method is twofold: First, you don't have to replace him.

Second: while you would eat a dead money hit for him next year, you could (hypothetically) be carrying over more cap space into next year vs cutting him, which would help pay for the dead money hit next year. Like if your cap ceiling this year is 208.2m, cutting Shep means you save 4.5m this year. Let's assume the cap next year will be 210m (it will be higher but the number doesn't matter, I just picked a round number to show the math). If you don't spend that 4.5m, then you roll over 4.5m and your cap ceiling is 214.5m in 2023.

Say you slash his base salary this year to 1m; now his cap hit is 5m this year. You save 7.5m this year. Roll that over, now your cap ceiling is 217.5m in 2023. Take out the 4m in dead money that Shep leaves and you're at 213.5m in 2023. Then you'd have to be taking out whatever he makes back in incentives, but that would be assuming he's healthy all year, basically. Incentives would include things like playing time and production, the Bills used per game roster bonuses a lot. So all told, the difference is basically in terms of what his salary + incentives would be earned in 2022.

So in terms of how tough a decision it is, it doesn't really hurt you in any significant way to put it off, unless you're using all of the savings it provides you. It's obviously a bit more complicated because there's other moves that play into it and all that but as long as you are still committed to leaving that cap space open instead of reallocating it, it doesn't hurt you.

If you do reallocate it and use that money and go right up against the cap like the Giants did last year, then you have a Nate Solder situation; you'd go into this year with your 210m cap ceiling, then just lose the 4+m from Shep (and whatever incentives he earned), go down to 206m vs being free and clear and at 210m next year if you cut him and spend the 4.5m savings.

tl;dr: as long as you don't spend to the cap, the rollover takes care of it. A cut would only really help you in any significant way compared to the proposed salary reduction/incentives if either a) you spend all the savings in 2022 and/or b) Shep actually meets the incentives, which you'd probably say is unlikely.",1.0,nygiants,t3_t5s4s9,False,0.0,None,2022-03-03T09:47:09Z,nygiants,0.0336620960569691

Slash his base salary to vet min (a hair over 1m), void the 2023 year, and give him like 4m in incentives for 2022 based on stuff like playing time and production. Could end up with a larger dead money hit in 2023 as a result, but whatever cap space you roll over to next year as a result of making this move would pretty much pay for it in all likelihood.",31.0,nygiants,t3_t5s4s9,False,0.0,None,2022-03-03T08:20:22Z,nygiants,0.1736444444444444

Yeah, sure, you could potentially get a better deal if you're willing to wait on the compensation for another year and you're willing to gamble that he'll be fully healthy for the start of the season, not get hurt during the start of the season, and that you'll be able to have him be productive in a way that makes teams think he'll be a big add for them as a one year rental.

Me personally, I wouldn't take the risk. It certainly could go either way; if he ends up with a team that can block it up for him well and he goes off, you might look silly. If you hold him and he gets hurt or the big play ability is hampered by the past injuries, then you might look silly there too.

Sure, you can say that players have been hit by other player's helmets previously, but that is not a fair comparison as they were being worn to protect both players on the field during normal NFL interactions, not being used by one NFL player to assault another by the use of their helmet, which also opened them up to major injuries as they were now defenseless, unlike the players in your example that did not sustain major injuries while being hit with a helmet.

He is also top 3 in rushing yards and top 70 in terms of games played, including K, P, and QB. For a RB, that's insane. 

I don't want it to seem like I am saying longevity equals a HOF bid, since that isn't what I am saying. What I am saying, is that he mixed longevity with great play. Only four RBs rushed for at least 5,000 yards in their 30s: Payton, Smith, John Riggins and Frank Gore. In fact, he is the only RB to have at least 6,000 yards after turning 30. Add that to the fact that only 6 other RBs (all HoFs) have even played after turning 35, his longevity is something not seen in the NFL before.

19429,170986,170986,Tomtom6789,"In 2019, the Giant's had a hard decision to make. Try to take one last shot for a title with Eli Manning or cut the Giant's legend to stop postponing the rebuild and limit the consistent mediocrity they showed on the field. Well, of course, the Giant's decide to roll with Eli and decided to make multiple signings of aging players such as Antoine Bethea and, Golden Tate, and Nate Solder (who both Solder and Tate still have a $4M a piece dead cap charge in 2022). 

This did not work out how they hoped. The Giant's went 4-12, and instead of starting the rebuild, the Giant's decided to hold off and try loading up yet again with expensive, older players. The 2020 NY Giant's, a team with a QB on a rookie contract and a team that previously went 4-12, starts the season with less than $5M in cap space. We made good decisions during the draft, which are paying dividens now, but other than that, there wasn't much to enjoy about this time.

All the spending they did in previous years and reaching for a QB in a bad QB draft ended up increasing the Giant's win total by 50% over the previous year. The Giant's almost made the playoffs at an intimidating 6-10. 

Now, one would think, after multiple years under a .500 record, it would finally be time to start the rebuild instead of spending multiple millions of dollars on aging veterans that will only prolong the inevitable instead of building a firm foundation for the years ahead. I'll let you guess which one they ended up doing. 

$72M for an oft injured Kenny Golladay, and others leave the Giant's with just under $3M in a make or break year for the franchise. They, again, made great moves in the first and second round of the draft, selecting players in areas of need but seemed to forget everything they knew about drafting and did not draft players in areas of need but spent picks on players like a 4th string RB instead of taking a shot on a developmental players at more pressing needs like OL, Edge, and LB. 

Well, third times a charm, right? The Giant's finished 4-13 this past year, causing Mara to finally clean house and look beyond his best friends to hire someone to lead the Giant's. Even with a competent staff making cuts where allowed and trying to trade off players for further draft capitol or extra cap space, the Giant's sit at just over $1M in cap space with a roster that includes a QB on a rookie deal and a lot of overpaid veterans on deals that have been reconstructed too many times, eliminating any wiggle room there may have been.

The Giant's could have started back in 2019, but instead, we are here in 2022 with no cap space, no franchise QB, a dilapidated OL, often injured, aging WRs, pedestrian TEs, multiple highly paid run-stuffing DTs, one promising edge player, a 1980's style LB core, and an actually promising secondary, but a secondary that will most likely be gutted to create space to improve all the other positional groups.

Guards seem to be easier to find, with an average of 13 starters being found in rounds 1 through 4 each and then 13 starters found in rounds 5 through 7 and UDFAs. The center position seemed to be the easiest to find later with a pretty even spread from rounds 1 through 6. This isn't to say that all of these players that are starters are actually *good* starters, as we have 5 players out there that we call starters, but it shows that if the Giant's are serious about drafting a better O-Line, they will need to invest not only *more* picks into the position, but also *earlier* picks if they want a starting caliber OT to play alongside Thomas. 

On top of this, they need some stability in terms of coaching. You can't expect to have so many shuffles at the coaching position and then expect players to be well developed. This is the first year I trust the Giant's to keep the necessary pieces in place to allow for development and hopefully move forward without needing to use an unnecessary amount of draft capitol to do so.",7.0,nygiants,t3_tk5vn0,False,0.0,:Saquadsflair:,2022-03-22T15:51:49Z,nygiants,0.0909573863593466

19435,170993,170993,Tomtom6789,"Well, first off, Chark and JuJu are not the same players as Cooper is. You said it yourself that Baker needs to prove himself and if I am the Browns Organization, I don't want to surround him with middle of the pack recievers that will probably cost $13M to $15M to bring in from free-agency when I can use a 5th to bring in a WR who has a history of playing like a WR1 that I can pay $20M for and move on from next season without any cap commitment if he turns out to not be worth it. 

The idea that you can bring in anyone that will play like Cooper for closer to $8M - $10M is just wishful thinking since guys like Golladay are getting $18M a year, Robby Anderson is getting $15M, and even Robert Woods will be making $18M - $20M in a year or two. Also, just to rub salt in the wound, those contracts will cost teams at minimum $5M and, at a maximum, over $20M in dead cap, which means they are locked into that contract without having to spend more than Cooper's current contract. Players' value will always be less than what they are paid on the free-agent market. 

I would take the player with a proven history and an easy to maneuver contract than pray a cheaper player on a deal with little wiggle room has a career year any day. With the second option, you have too many instances of ending up with a Kenny Golladay situation. Having to pay near the same amount to put up 500 yards and 0 TDs and the inability to cut him unless you want to free up $0 in cap space and have $26M in dead cap.",9.0,nfl,t3_tcpi23,False,0.0,:Giants: Giants,2022-03-12T18:51:35Z,nygiants,-0.0873899821519851

TT had a hamstring injury. He went on IR in week 3 and came back in week 11 rushing for 2 tds in that game. He was benched 2 weeks later. The article simply mentions the injury in the context of the season. It wasn’t used as an excuse for his benching. That’s a conclusion you tried to draw on your own.

You can’t just throw out MT’s rookie season. That’s not how it works. That’s called moving the goal posts. He had 1 good year then regressed each year after. I’m not making this up. The numbers are the numbers.

The entire extremist attitude taken towards DJ on this sub is what gets wearing. It’s absolutely from both sides. The sad part is the “DJ realists”  are typically the ones who lack the self awareness to realize how ridiculous their takes are. 

The fanboys know their nuts. You saw that fan fiction post with the made up quotes. Their unbridled love for DJ is annoying and creepy, but it’s no less annoying and creepy than the unbridled hate for DJ either. 

That fan fiction post is the equivalent of the fan fiction posts that were written when TT was signed and people were saying he’s going to be the starter. People were actually saying the Giants were probably actively shopping DJ. That’s nuts. 

There is a middle ground. There is an objective evaluation that can be made. While the endless excuse making is ridiculous so are things like “he’s a slow processor”, “he can’t read through his progressions”, all parroted comments by people who probably never studied game film in their lives. While there’s film that shows that, there’s also film that disputes that. I didn’t study any film. I’m not a coach or a scout obviously. I just read alot and listen to alot of podcasts of people who do. It’s a pretty split opinion on DJ as whole.

I have 2 specific reasons I don’t think DJ is the guy. Ball security and availability. It doesn’t matter how much talent you have, if you turn the ball over and miss games, you’re not the guy. However, I also understand that he’s been in one of the worse situations since he’s come into the league. Roster wise and coaching wise. It doesn’t excuse his mistakes, but it absolutely needs to be considered.

With that being said, and with all the circumstances surrounding the team, I’d rather give DJ his 4th year, like MT got, to either play himself into a franchise tag or play himself off the team. It makes for a much more interesting year than watching journeyman backup Tyrod Taylor play.

TT was benched. 

https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32837466/houston-texans-turn-tyrod-taylor-davis-mills-quarterback?platform=amp

MT wasn’t 25-13, the Chicago Bears were. MT was carried to the playoffs by the #1 ranked defense and 11th ranked rushing attack in 2018 and in 2020 they squeaked in at 8-8 with the 22nd ranked offense. After his decent sophomore season, MT regressed each season after that. Stats don’t lie so here’s some for you. DJ, on a per game basis, averages more touchdowns and more yards than MT. DJ also averages more turnovers, my biggest problem with him, but MT is no slouch himself in the turnover department.

While I agree there’s no reason to believe DJ will be more successful than TT or MT have been, I’d rather see him get the opportunity to do it this year than watch either of those 2 play. 

If the QB class was significantly better this year I’d have been on board with doing whatever was necessary with those 2 top 10 picks to secure a QB. If the cap situation wasn’t a complete disaster I would have been on board with pursuing a vet like Russell Wilson. However, I’m not on board with making change just for the sake of change.

“Those personnel deficiencies showed up all over the field. Jones finished last in the league in targets thrown to open receivers, which is hardly surprising if you’ve watched film of the 2021 Giants offense. The offensive line wasn’t good enough to hold up in protection on long-developing pass plays—New York had the highest rate of blown blocks on five- and seven-step dropbacks, per Sports Info Solutions—so opposing secondaries didn’t have to worry about the deeper areas of the field. Offensive coordinator Jason Garrett was unable to coach around those limitations, so he just called a bunch of hitches and out-breaking routes instead. Those are risky throws, and they’re even harder to make when the defenses can sit on them without having to worry about throws over the top. As the season wore on, defenses squeezed the Giants passing game more and more, forcing Jones to grow more and more conservative.”

Congratulations on going back to the post where I had to explain what a bidding war was to you. You just obliterated your own argument. There was no incremental raise from the Browns. They came in with an offer significantly higher than any other team was willing to pay. Not a bidding war.

Fact: Deshaun Watson is going to pay, whether through settlements or rulings in the civil suits.

Fact: Cleveland is well aware of Deshaun’s legal issues as they “thoroughly” investigated them.

Fact: Cleveland way overpaid for a QB who isn’t even the best in his division.

Fact: That money will be used to pay some or all of the 22 plaintiffs.

I shouldn’t even have to touch on the success of Allen and Hopkins before Herbert and Murray.

Even if you just focus on the 1s, Herbert walked into a situation with Keenan Allen, Murray had Fitz in year 1 and was gifted Hopkins in year 2, and Burrow had multiple 1000 yard receiver Tyler Boyd.

What I said was his better ball security did not lead to better production. It didn’t. DJ has a higher td per game average. None of this is disputable. The numbers are what they are.

If you count total tds, DJ has 50 in 38 games for an average of 1.31 per game. Trubisky has 73 in 57 games for an average of 1.28 per game. Turnovers- DJ has 67 for an average of 1.76 per game. Trubisky has   65 for an average of 1.14 per game. So although Trubisky was much better with ball security, it didn’t translate to better production.

The other issue is that you’re lumping me in with the DJ fanboys simply because I’m pointing out that Trubisky isn’t some massive upgrade over DJ. They’re basically the same. The point of giving DJ another year is because Trubisky is not going to come in on some cheap 1 year prove it deal and the Giants are trying to fix their terrible cap situation.

And in regards to your first point, I've seen WAY more people here overhype his first 4 games than people shitting on it. If anything he played worst than what people here think. He was better than 2020, but thats not saying much, he had an awful 2020 season. I talked about this yesterday, im gonna paste my comment here:

Improvement from his second year isn't saying much. His second year was abysmal. His improvement is not as big as you say, and while i think he is better than darnold, they're not far off from each other. The biggest difference is that the jets actually moved on, even if they had as many, or more reasons to assume they actually screwed him over.

That ranking of him as a top 5 QB is ridiculous. He was 7 in yards, he was like 15th in completion percentage (and i took out the saints quarterbacks because i dont know who was starting), he only had 6 TD (including rushing). those are not great numbers, i don't get this narrative that he was killing it. He didn't even scrore a TD against the falcons, who had a horrible defense. In those 4 games, and correct me if im wrong, he had most of his weapons available. In those games (and the rest of the games he played), he had a pocket time of 2.5 seconds, which ranked 6th most during those 4 games and 8th most during all the games he played.

He hasn't been consistent, he hasn't shown that. Almost every QB shows flashes. And even if you ignore all the negatives, he still can't stay healthy and that is the most important thing",3.0,nygiants,t3_tyfjot,False,0.0,:Giants-Logo-Oldschool:,2022-04-07T13:00:57Z,nygiants,-0.0179521923431753

It takes away all the risks of giving him the 5th and you're tagging him knowing he improved.

Willis has an elite arm, he can make throws very few people can. Yes it's very risky to draft him but the tools are there. It's also good to note that many reports say that at the senior bowl he was extremely coachable and learned things quickly. He is nothing like jordan love as a prospect. Trey lance got drafted at 3 purely for his upside, which imo (and it's ok if you disagree) is not as high as willis.

On regards to your post about allen and mahomes. Mahomes draft class was looked as a weak class, the only guy that had a  high grade was trubisky. If it was a strong class then you would've seen more than 1 guy going top 5 and definitely you wouldn't have seen the always QB needy Cleveland browns trade away their pick to houston, or the bills (who needed a qb) trading their pick to KC. Mahomes was looked as a reach.

With josh allen, all you have to do is go to the thread in /nfl where they drafted him and see for yourself. Outside from the reddit world, it was also considered a reach and people said they got ""the wrong josh"" in the draft.

Here is what i see with willis, and its ok if you disagree. I see elite tools, his skillset reminds me of a smaller josh allen. His accuracy problems come from his footwork, when he is set right he can put the ball anywhere. He also needs to get better at reading defenses.

Lars posts a lot of content to the sub - some relevant and some not so relevant, and we're actively moderating the not-so-relevant posts as needed (like a Penik tweet yesterday that offered little to no value or discussion opportunity). These posts keep the feed fresh, up to date, and generate discussion. 

We have been working with Lars over the past several months to clean up his formatting of posts and type of content that gets posted and he has been nothing but compliant with the subreddit rules since then (thank you). 

Some of y'all were complaining a year ago when /u/zimmie41 was posting articles often, and now some of y'all are complaining that Lars is posting content too often. **There's actual news and updates to post right now! Football is here and that's exciting!** 

If you don't want to see Lars' username pop up in the sub so much, then feel free to pitch in and post relevant content to the subreddit feed too. If you feel his post breaks a subreddit rule then report it and we will assess from there. To those of you who are just reporting every single Lars post because Lars posted it and you have something against him, you're wasting your time and our time so please stop. 

Lastly, we're doing more moderating of hateful comments directed towards Lars than moderating Lars' content and comments. **The name-calling and threatening comments towards him (or anyone else) are uncalled for and not welcome here.** He may have some wild takes (sorry dude, Slayton has no trade value...) but that doesn't open the door to attack the guy.",1.0,nygiants,t3_wkv629,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-08-10T06:58:05Z,nygiants,-0.0679058017382683

2022 Hot Takes - NFC
NFC East

New York Giants

- Daniel Jones will finish the season as QB10-12. 4200 pass yards, 450 rush yards, 34 TDs on 8 INTs
- Saquon Barkley will finish as RB2 on the season. 1900 total yards, 17TDs
- Wan’Dale Robinson more will be fantasy-irrelevant. Under 400 total yards on the season
- Kadarius Toney will finish as WR8 on the season
- the Giants top 4 playmakers will collectively outscore the Bills top 4 playmakers this season in fantasy points

Washington Commanders

- Carson Wentz will not be the starting quarterback of the Commanders by week 9
- Brian Robinson will lead the Commanders in rushing yards
- Terry McLaurin will end the season as WR35, scores less than 200 fantasy points 
- Jahan Dotson finished the season with 800 yards, 4 TDs, leads the Commanders in receptions

Philadelphia Eagles

- Jalen Hurts finishes the season with 3 or less games of 25+ fantasy points 
- AJB finishes the season with less than 750 receiving yards and less than 4 TDs
- Miles Sanders will finish with the 3rd most rushing yards on the team
- Devonta Smith puts up 1100 yards on the season 

Dallas Cowboys

- Dak Prescott throws for under 4,000 yards and throws more INTs than any of his prior seasons
- Zeke finishes the season as RB15-17, rushes for under 900 yards for the first time in his career

28659,240619,240619,jshanley16,"Dude you’re on quite the rampage in here. Let’s take a step back, alright?

In regards to Alex Wilson… no, there wasn’t a vote. There won’t be and doesn’t need to be. The dude doesn’t have media credentials so he’s no different than you and me, just happens to have more twitter followers. 

We have rule #5 of the sub: “**Personal Blogs/Websites/YouTube Pages, etc. ** you can be a redditor with a website, but not a website with a reddit account. We reserve the right to remove any blog posts, twitter chains, podcasts, etc that do not contribute to the subreddit.”

Alex Wilson’s tweets, or my tweets, or your tweets don’t belong here, that’s what the daily discussion thread is for. 

Now as it pertains to Pat Leonard, the topic comes up when his articles and tweets aren’t accredited. For example, his latest article really only references to a Colin Cowherd hot take as his source of information he’s basing his article off of. 

In another example, his infamous “Toney is on the trade block” story, he lacked credible sources other than some sources that suggested Toney *may* be on the trade block, and those sources were unsubstantiated as confirmed by Schoen himself. 

So now we have a guy like Alex Wilson who doesn’t have media credentials and posts opinions on twitter and a personal blog site who’s not allowed to be posted unless it’s unique, statistical content worth sharing. And then we have Pat Leonard who has media credentials who’s work is either A) opinions, click baits or stories with sources who lack credibility and B) content that duggan, art, raanan, rock are all reporting about that is actually news, like roster updates. 

The difference? Pat has media credentials and someone pays him (which, there’s plenty of fan-based sites that pay their writers, albeit hardly anything for their work). 

So, your friendly mod team asked the sub their opinion as the content falls within a grey area being discussed by the mod team. 

This is not a “we are banning this content” or “this is our subreddit, we don’t care what you think”. This is us asking for input on what people want to see as it’s our responsibility to *moderate* the content that is on the sub, and we are well aware there is a grey area in that duty.",5.0,nygiants,t3_w8ktcx,False,0.0,:Dimes: Danny Dimes :Dimes:,2022-07-26T11:19:16Z,nygiants,0.0228248302574871

First, wanting a player with upside isn’t just about winning games in the short term. I feel like this is such an obvious concept that it shouldn’t need to be explained but I’ve felt that about pretty much every aspect of this conversation. In fact, it’s pretty much baked into the concepts of “ceiling” and “floor” that you want to chase ceiling when you’re further away from contention and settle for floor when you’re a few pieces away. An old backup QB with a solid floor is not very useful for a team with a bad roster. On the contrary, a QB with upside could return value in a trade or for the team that signs him. In other words, if Mariota plays well, he could draw interest in a trade to a QB needy team or even serve as a starter in the future for the Giants. He was a highly coveted prospect that never lived up to the hype but his natural talent still carries weight in the NFL. This is an incredibly basic concept and it’s why former high end draft picks like Sam Bradford or Sam Darnold still fetch high picks in trades despite being garbage NFL players. By contrast, if Tyrod plays well, no one will give a shit because everyone knows exactly who Tyrod is at this point. 

Your second point is so ridiculous it’s difficult to unpack. For one thing, I brought up those two players as a form of juxtaposition to show that two quality young starters at a position that the Giants need went for roughly the same price it was initially reported that Tyrod went for. If you tried critically thinking for 2 seconds you would realize that this wasn’t a suggestion that the Giants should have ACTUALLY signed either one of them. More importantly, NOWHERE did I indicate that the Giants should have signed both of them, which wouldn’t have been possible anyways. 

Next, the implication that bc the Giants already signed 2 (ftr they have actually signed 3) OL that means they cannot sign 2more is completely asinine. They are most likely GOING to acquire even more than 2 more OL this offseason, so what you said is nonsense on the most basic level. But even if the Giants didn’t purely need more OL for depth purposes, it’s insane to act like bc the Giants have signed 2 OL (only one of which is guaranteed to start) they can’t, won’t, or shouldn’t go out and sign 2 more younger, better OL. That is just a completely silly argument that makes no sense. You’re telling me if 2 good young players were available for an affordable price and would be better than your current options, but you just signed 2 worse players for not very much money, you’d say “nah let me pass on the chance to upgrade my team both now and in the future”?

These people sit down and watch every single snap of every single game. There isn’t a goddamn person here that can say they’ve done that. They themselves admit their grading system is not perfect, but to dismiss their player grades entirely is borderline indefinite. It’s almost unarguable that the grades mean more than any raw box score number, since they are context sensitive and more attributable to the player’s real contributions rather than merely what goes on around them that indirectly boosts their stats. I’ve yet to hear a cogent argument against PFF grades that PFF hasn’t conceded. You can try if you’d like.

As far as positional value on defense goes, I wouldn’t necessarily dispute what you said. I’d put a versatile safety above 3 tech, but there are certainly 3 techniques who are more valuable than any safety. But this is getting off the point.

If you wait, you risk the possibility of a fundamentally team-crippling extension, which (unless well below $10 mill AAV) would be a regime-destroying move. If your plan is to wait to see if his production improves in order to trade him, you risk three main things:

1) Injury, which as we know has become a recurring theme with Barkley.

2) That he might still be bad, which would have a similar effect to #1.

Tyrod looked good, and it's a weird feeling knowing that if Danny gets injured, it's not a guaranteed clown show.... Basically I think we have a good chance of not having a negative yardage game this year. 

Defense had some good plays, and granted it's preseason,but it's a hell of a lot more fun watching and hoping we make a play, rather than just trying to limit their yardage in coverage, and I loved Graham. 

Although it's preseason, I realllly did not like that terrible effort by Golladay on that one red zone route, or even the go route a couple plays before. I get he doesn't get separation, but being able to see that lazy a route is embarrassing, borderline +1 on the clown show rating. That being said, I hope that changes from him, and he's given some  slack that it's the first preseason game.

33955,298770,298770,sybrandy,"This is such a wild draft when you look at where everyone ended up. In order I expected them to be drafted:

* Mayfield was, at the time, my #1 QB as he looked to be the most pro-ready and, keep in mind I don't follow other teams much, he helped the Browns become respectable. I don't think he's the best QB from that class as of right now, but it sounds like he may be in a good position to have a good year.
* Darnold was my #2 QB as I thought he had more potential than Rosen. I know a ton of people who were begging for the Giants to pick him and now seeing that he's now a backup QB kind-of makes drafting Saquon look better. (Not saying he was the best choice there. Just comparing him to Darnold.)
* Rosen being cut again is just amazing. Every report made it sound like he may be the best pure passer that year. The only reason I had him this low was because he had injury issues. I honestly thought he would have done better, so it's just so wild that he's been cut so many times. At worst one could have expected him to be a backup somewhere.
* Allen was a boom or bust case. Everything I read made it look like he was never going to be the star he is now. The biggest issue was accuracy: most QBs don't become more accurate when they move up to the NFL. He became significantly more accurate. I think he lucked into a good situation that allowed him to developed and now he's the clear #1 QB out of this draft.
* Jackson is another one who ended up in a good situation where he could develop into a good QB. His draft profile made him look like a boom/bust prospect. I don't follow the Ravens so I don't know how good he really is, but he's been very effective. I don't yet if he's better than Mayfield, but it's definitely something that can be argued.

Second, regarding the first round picks, I think if I had to rank how likely each one would be resigned:

1. Thomas
2. Sexy Dexy - I think this comes down to money more than anything else. No injury history and has been performing. No, he's no Donald/Watt, but he is good.
3. Jones - This is very dependent on how he does, but QB is the most important position and if he shows enough, I think he gets the second contract regardless of his injury history.
4. Barkley - Again, depends on performance, but also health and money. We all know what he's capable of when healthy. If he can stay healthy and we get him on a pretty friendly deal, I think we keep him, but I find that scenario a bit unlikely.
5. Toney - Way too soon to really know, but it's the same scenario as Barkley except he's already been injured a lot in his first year. Yes, receivers are more valuable than RBs, but he needs to do more to prove he's worth a second contract.

Bradberry is a really good CB but his talent is being wasted on a bad team.  Inversely, this bad team is limiting it's potential for getting better because of cap restrictions and the percentage of that cap used on Bradberry. 

That being said, I think that the old adage ""defense wins championships"" only applies if your offense is already running on all cylinders.  

I wish I could find the clip of Bill Walsh where he stated that the only time to make a huge splash in free agency is when your team is already really good.  Adding that to add a big free agent to your team doesn't do anything for the team. What we did with Bradberry is the latter.  


I wish we would take that approach.  Focus on building an offense that can either compete against TODAY's players and systems or build a system that no one can figure out with players that can thrive within it (yes, ala Patriots... lol).
