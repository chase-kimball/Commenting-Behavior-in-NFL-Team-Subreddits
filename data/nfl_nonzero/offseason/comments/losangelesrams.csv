1. It's VERY conducive to ending in a tie and we fucking hate ties can't have them in the playoffs. And then what do you do after they tie again? Kicker shootout? Full on sudden death? Same rules as now? Another goddamn full 10 minute period?? It's the worst at resolving ties. This isn't basketball, scoring would be at more of a premium and teams would mostly be trying to steal clock from the other team than trying to score as much as possible.

2. You still run into the problem of the team winning the toss getting a huge advantage. The team with ball first can run out most of the clock and leave the other team with less time to work with, if any at all. They get a huge time of possession advantage, which wouldn't matter as much in the current format (at least for playoffs).

the extension AD signed in 2018 was for 6 years. he just finished 3 out of 6 years of that extension. in terms of total cash he already received per that extension, it is:


40 mil signing bonus

9.108 mil 2019 salary

17 mil 2020 salary

19.892 mil 2021 salary


that is a total of 86 mil he already got paid in 3 years, for a ""real"" AAV of ~29 mil/year. it's not like we've been underpaying him. that really is qb-money territory.


the remainder of the contract is salary and roster bonus (amounts combined below).


14.25 mil in 2022

19 mil in 2023

21.75 mil in 2024


which leaves 55 mil remaining for the next 3 years. they're not guaranteed, but he *will* get that money paid *if* he plays. it's not like we can hold his paycheck just because the money is not guaranteed. also, the dead money by cutting him for 2022 is like 18 mil which means his 2022 money is essentially guaranteed.


so, I still don't understand this ""no guaranteed money"" sentiment. we paid him fair and square for the last 3 years, and he basically has 2022 guaranteed as well. if it *really* is about guaranteed money and not the amount of money, we can restructure him and just pay him his salary right now. the same 14.25/19/21.75 amounts. but by all accounts that's not what this is about. he wants a new contract with *more* money. which is fine too but the justification made by a lot of fans just doesn't make sense.",5.0,losangelesrams,t3_v2k8ck,False,0.0,None,2022-06-01T15:18:51Z,losangelesrams,0.0060411258847769

Outside of Von, and as much as I loved Von he did not add stats to the team. He brought leadership, yes but his play was the same we were getting from that position before he came to us. So for the leadership lost we gained it back with Wagner, except instead of having two leaders on the D-line we now have a leader at Middle Linebacker which was an area of weakness last year. We lost a decent CB in Williams but gain one right back in Hill. We kinda lost OBJ during a year when WR was a weakness as well.

But in that same light for every great defense, there is a hole on every play; without knowing Ram's offense and just some basics of the more successful WR from prior like Peyton had in Ind with Wayne and Harrison, Kupp runs a lot of options plays meaning he doesn't really have an actual route. Based on the McVay Offense and how he tries to make each play look the same I am sure the first few yards will look the same thing before Kupp goes to his ""made-up route."" Not to say he is running all over the place but this is where his QB mind comes into play. Kupp is also a target himself and can put pressure on the defense and creates an opening for his team first. But will take the early yardage if the opposing team gives it to him. This is what I think truly separates Kupp from other WR with his unselfish play. 

This is a big reason he can ""disappear"" in games at points like the Super Bowl, but it is because he is also helping create these openings for his team with either run blocking or route running to let another Wr get open like OBJ was. Then later in the game, it begins to make the defense 2nd guess who to go after Kupp or the other guy. And then you Kupp go off for an MVP performance and clutch series.

Also, love how people tried very hard AD this AD that he was the only one with helmets. Yet now it's finally being brought to light that what some actually heard from the beginning is true that Bengals players started the fights. Started taking off helmets and throwing helmets.

If Donald started this it would be a different story and we would not have this conversation. The fact is he did not. It would even be a different story if he swung the helmet at someone without a helmet or even if the individual he hit if their job were not being hit in the head by another helmet with 10 x the force then it would be a different story. But I am not going to get emotional like some when all of those things are actually happening. Donald did not start the fight, he swung the helmet at someone else wearing a helmet, and that person gets hit in the head for a living by helmet-to-helmet contact. 

 A person swinging a helmet allows the helmet to bounce off not to mention the person being hit is not moving forward at a speed. The helmet being swung is also not in front of a 200+ pound player. Energy can not be created nor destroyed. Meaning the situation that allows energy to be transferred in the opposite direction will create less than damage than a situation where all the energy stays in one place like what happens in a tackle.

Zero proof of that. What we do know is the Rams always spent to cap and regularly made huge splashes in free agency in St. Louis after Kroenke took over. In 2012 the Rams spent $98 million on the opening day of FA. In 2013 they signed $86 million over the first 6 days. It's not like the Rams magically started sucking when Kroenke took over. They sucked all though the mid and later single digit 2000s before he took over too. 

As for the rest, everything about what St. Louis did up to the Rams leaving was bullshit, and anyone who was in Kroenke's position would have bounced too. STL promised they would always maintain the EJD to be one of the top 8 stadiums in the league, not once did they honor that obligation. When Kroenke sued the city for it, an independent arbitrator sided with Kroenke and awarded the Rams $750 million. St. Louis just said ""fuck you we're not paying."" So he announced he was moving and STL puts a last minute proposal together that was complete balls. The stadium still wouldn't have been one of the top stadiums in the league as they were contractually obligated to provide. The governor was getting sued by state officials because the way they pushed the funding through was allegedly illegal, so the money officials were saying they were going to put up may not have even really been available. It called for the NFL to pay $100 million more than they agreed to, and it demanded that Kroenke shell out a quarter billion of his own money for a stadium he wouldn't own, and he'd have to share it with a soccer team.

I'm not white knighting Kroenke, but there are no angels in hell. Had STL just honored their contract, they would still have a team today.",7.0,nfl,t3_tn7gbj,False,0.0,:Rams: Rams :Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T20:10:39Z,losangelesrams,0.031473907100486

The dude is an absolute stud and is a huge impact player. Is he worth Top 10 money? no, the dude is past 30 and is coming off his 2nd torn ACL. 

Should we pay  him, yes. Because if you can recall  in the playoffs (where it matters), the dude was clutch. And you saw the impact he had on the Rams in the SB when he went down. Had he not gone down, he was probably going to be the MVP and the game wouldn't have been close. Also remind you, we were razor thin in the SB at WR (woods, obj, higbee, tutu) were all out..

17602,159439,159439,WilliamBillPatterson,"It’s the offseason, and as we await a DONALD decision (retirement/extension), deal with the loss of Woody, and wait to see if Bobby Wagner is coming to town; I decided to make a mock draft because 1. I’m bored at work & 2. I haven’t seen any mocks yet. So, this is my best shot at a mock draft W/O trades, keep in mind I drafted these players based on a couple different websites stating where these players were pegged to get picked up.   
  
**3.104- Luke Fortner C/G, Kentucky**  
Fortner is a multi-year starter with some of the most extensive experience at all three interior positions you'll see in the draft class, although last year he played strictly center. He's played at least 600 snaps at each of left guard, center and right guard. In those 3 years as a starter, Luke only allowed 5 sacks. The Rams have a hole at RG with Corbett leaving, and although I doubt Fortner starts at that position, he can provide versatility on the line if an injury hits.   
  
**4.142- Cordale Flott CB, LSU**  
Who the hell is playing across from Ramsey? Deayon, Long, and Rochell are who we have after Ramsey. I think Rochell wins the starting job with Long in the nickel but the Rams need more depth. Cordale Flott is a versatile athlete with the ability to play as a nickel defender or as an outside cornerback. He has excellent height and length that serves well in both positions. Flott started at nickel for the LSU defense, where he was able to show off his fluid athleticism and quick feet. His issue is he is very undersized at 160 and will be a priority to get that weight up in the NFL.   
  
**5.175- Pierre Strong Jr. RB, South Dakota State University**   
I know we have a 3 headed monster with Akers, Henderson, & Michel with Funk at #4. But Henderson is going to be a FA in 2023 and we don’t know if the Rams will bring Sony back. Pierre Strong Jr. exploded onto the scene last year with SDSU rushing for 1,673 yards and 18 touchdowns. During his 4 years at SDSU Pierre averaged over 7 yards per carry and can work his way as a backup to Akers.   
  
**6.211- Logan Bruss T, Wisconsin**  
  
Surprised that this guy has a 6th/7th  round grade. Logan Bruss is another guy that can come in and be a depth piece. With losing Whitworth and Havenstein getting older we need a guy that we can step in be a start if needed. Alaric Jackson has shown promise, but it would be nice to have options. In 29 games at Wisconsin, Bruss only allowed 1 sack which is damn good for the Big Ten  
  
**6.212- Matt Araiza P, San Diego State**  
The best punter in the draft, I have a hard time gauging where a punter would go so I had the Rams getting him in the 6th. We get the best punter in college to replace Hekker. Simple as that.   
  
**6.218- Carson Wells EDGE, Colorado**  
Rams lost Okoronkwo and Miller & Terrell Lewis can’t stay healthy so Rams need to add some much need depth. Carson Wells doesn’t pop off the charts with this stats, but some his strengths include  
•	Has shown outstanding versatility, flashing in coverage, run defense, and pass rushing.  
•	Plenty of experience: he started 34 games during his time at CU.  
•	Stepped up as a team leader and centerpiece of the defense when Nate Landman went down with injury.  
  
**7.238 Kendrick Duncan S, Louisville**   
Kendrick is a lengthy safety at 6’3 that can come in on 3rd  and long or prevent packages but would mostly be a special teams contributer. One of the key areas of this is Duncan’s versatility in the secondary. During his career for Georgia Southern and Louisville, he has occupied several alignments. In addition to playing as a free safety and in the box, Duncan has also seen snaps as a slot and outside cornerback.  
  
**7.253 Cameron Latu TE, Alabama**  
Cameron Latu was a touchdown machine in the redzone for Alabama accounting for 8 TDs last year. The Rams are thin at TE however I think they will be fine rolling out with Higbee, Hopkins, and Blanton and whatever the hell Jacob Harris is going to be. Cameron Latu will mostly  likely be promoted to practice squad but would nice to have a developmental TE in house.

Having the Bills as the opener will set the tone and gives us and idea how the Rams will stack up against the AFC early on.  


i like having the Niners early since we are presumably going to play against Trey Lance, I'd rather play a new QB early in the season rather than later.  Good chance to stack up W's in division.  Plus I believe we'll have an answer to containing Deebo after an offseason of watching film.  


Bye is a touch early but what can you do.   


Post Bye Week until Week 18 is going to be gauntlet.  Out of the 10 opponents, 8 are playoff caliber, 1 being borderline (Saints) and the Seahawks being the only opponent not playoff Caliber.  


Having Green Bay in December is a bad break but maybe weather won't be as bad then.

You keep saying this as some sort of gotcha when my whole argument is that Aiyuk has a much higher ceiling than Van because of his situation and also has better hands. 

Aiyuk had a less than 10% target share in the first 7 weeks. From week 8 on it jumped to 24%. When you look at the season stats alone you miss the story of player development.

Like in my mind, the process was that the scouts do the scouting, and relay info to the playcaller. From there, playcaller narrows down his playbook for the game, maps out the opening script as well as the likely adjustments/responses to adjustments, analyzes how well it's working in-game, and then calls the actual plays. But that definitely doesn't all need to be one guy.
