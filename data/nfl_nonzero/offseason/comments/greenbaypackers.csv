* Two teams who have established their QBs for the foreseeable future, but can't play either of them this game
* Way too early in the season to know or learn much of anything about either team
* Without starting QBs, a lack of superstar names at skill positions (except for Chubb)

Every player wants a ring, but waiting to be sure that the team you're going to is going to be a SB contender defeats the ethos of lifting your team to that level. It is an extremely self-centered move.

Not because he's not skilled, but because of his selfish and immature behavior.

>so why not try and go to a place that can contend for a sb. Hes a wr so thats also a place that has a legit QB.

We know who the legit QBs are in the league, and we know which teams are early favorites to go deep in the playoffs. Yet again, waiting until week 4 is him selfishly hedging his bet rather than doing the hard work of elevating his team. 

>Ppl call it ring chasing but its also players just trying to go to a franchise thats know wtf they're doing instead of wasting time on a mediocre team that gets a new coach every 2 seasons, obj did plenty of that already

6356,32048,32048,CaptainCorpse666,"""It could be argued that Mike McCarthy will enter the 2022-23 NFL season sitting on one of the hottest seats of any head coach in the league. Since (and even before) the Cowboys first-round playoff exit last season, the pressure has been building for McCarthy. It dialed up even more with offseason rumors swirling around former Saints head coach Sean>Payton, who’s now on the market .But it’s still a little surprising to see McCarthy, one of only eight active NFL head coaches to have won a Super Bowl, rank so low among his peers. CBS Sports recently released their rankings of NFL head coaches leading into the 2022 season, and McCarthy comes in at No. 18 on the list as he begins his third year as the Cowboys’ head coach. He’s seven spots below the next guy with a Super Bowl ring, that >being the Jaguars’ Doug Pederson at No. 11.“The pendulum has probably swung a little >too far in terms of criticizing McCarthy, even if he did have Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay,” >CBS Sports’ Cody Benjamin writes. “He’s now compiled nine different double-digit-win >seasons, including 2021 with Dallas. He’s also wisely given plenty of control to play-caller >Kellen Moore. And yet, with so much talent at his disposal, ill-timed, old-school decisions >have too often doomed him. Maybe that’s why team owner Jerry Jones publicly ponders >about canning him for his own defensive coordinator. ”McCarthy is lumped in with fellow >old-schooler Ron Rivera at No. 19 and the two look like outliers in that area of the rankings, flanked on both sides by rookie coaches and one-year guys like Brandon Staley (San Diego) and Nick Sirianni (Philadelphia).Andy Reid tops the list with 2022 Super Bowl champion Sean McVay trailing behind at No. 2 and the immortal Bill Belicheck at No. 3.It’s no coincidence that those top coaches were the coaches on three of the last four most recent Super Bowl teams. Perhaps McCarthy can join the top echelon of the ranks by adding another ring to his resume with the Cowboys.""",2.0,greenbaypackers,t3_vzwcua,False,0.0,:69:,2022-07-15T14:27:58Z,greenbaypackers,0.0310273962291505

He told me, ‘I want to be Clemson Sammy Watkins.’ And I was like, ‘OK, let’s do it.’ He’s just up there squatting 405 for eight right now like it’s nothing. He started around 218, and he’s at 225 right now, too. He’s going to go be a No. 1 in Green Bay.
 
>Sammy’s going to kill it. I have no doubt. He hasn’t trained like this since college. He’ll say that. ‘I haven’t worked like this since college.’ We’re spending two-and-a-half, three hours on the field in this heat every day. And that sounds crazy, but that’s what your body has to go through so when you get to camp, it’s easy. And that’s been the knock on him. He gets hurt.

You have to pay Dunne money to get to McGinn's stuff, so sadly I've given up on following him. 

Outside of McGinn, Tom Silverstein is probably the best beat writer currently writing about GB. He actually writes about the games, instead of about the personalities or the drama, and he does a lot of work to show different aspects of the Packers' offensive and defensive schemes, or to break down why a particular play succeeded or failed.

* (Jones rolls across the goal line)
* (pause)
* ""Taking it!""

And then he's saved by the color guy. 

Dude is so scared to make the wrong call that he's looking at nothing but the official, and when the official doesn't immediately make a call, he's left with nothing to say. He's so concerned with being loud and excited-sounding when he makes the ""Touchdown!"" call that he forgets to describe the play after ""Jones has got an angle"".

I get not wanting to call it early, but you can say what it *looks* like. I'd rather an announcer say ""Touchdown"" and be wrong then wait 10 seconds going ""Aaaand... it is... a.... score!"" This isn't just a Buck problem, but because he's the guy Fox assigns to its biggest games, it's more visible with him. 

Additionally, you've put your finger on another part of the problem. Summerall could afford to be laconic because John Madden was so voluble, affable, and had such a knack for analysis. When he summed up a play in a couple of short phrases, he knew Madden would be able to fill in behind him with something interesting and insightful. But when Buck holds back and waits for his color commentator to fill space, he gets all the stammering incoherence that is Aikman's trademark. Aikman isn't half as articulate as Madden was, at least in his younger days, and that's saying something.

16189,102593,102593,Journeyman12,"But there is evidence. Or at least there was at the time of the alleged event. Did you read the [Tacoma News-Tribune's summary](https://www.thenewstribune.com/sports/nfl/seattle-seahawks/article233018892.html) of the police report? According to it, 

* the alleged incident took place at a party, where there were witnesses to the argument between the woman and a stripper hired at the party
* the woman called her mother after the first alleged assault; her mother may not be able to testify on her behalf because she's family, but the call log would at least corroborate that part of her story
* Police officers took photographs of the marks on the woman's body
* The woman saw her primary care physician in Atlanta within a couple of days of the alleged incident, so that record could provide corroboration as well
* Police officers took photographs of the damage that Reed inflicted on the door where she was allegedly hiding; the door was split open and the doorframe completely broken off the wall
* While Reed was breaking down the door, one of his teammates allegedly held him back, so there would have been a witness right there to the event

So I totally disagree with the statement ""We have no idea whether the allegations are true or not. There's no independent corroboration"". We can't be definitively sure. But we also have a lot of circumstantial evidence. This isn't just a he-said, she-said situation where nothing can be proven. There was at least one witness, there were contemporaneous photographs, and there was other corroborating evidence.

Now, whether that would have been enough evidence to convict Reed in a court of law is impossible to say. I'm just reading a summary of a police report that was itself redacted, and I have no idea what kind of argument Reed would have made in court (or how he explained the alleged incident at all - we don't know).

I'm sure a lot of fans, including people in this thread, will be happy to take Reed's non-conviction as permission to approve of the signing or to remain neutral. However, for me, I think my team can and should do better than ""Well, he wasn't convicted"" when it comes to deciding which players to sign. It's more than okay to raise the standard to ""No one has credibly accused this person of domestic violence"".

Z literally played 1 game last year and had some toxic stuff going on off the field, it was pretty obvious he was going to be let go so paying him was never a concern.  

Preston had a great year with a very incentive heavy contract, and deserves getting paid more, which he did but it's still pretty tame. 

The big one I don't see you guys talking about is Aaron's contract, which would have hurt a lot if we weren't able to bring him back, potentially season ending.  But not only were we able to bring him back, we extended him which created more cap for this year.  Everybody sees the giant numbers and say he's being greedy but it helps us win now.

His option bonuses are essentially new signing bonuses, so when they get paid each year, those figures get prorated across the remaining years. The option bonuses are $40.8M ('22), $58.3M ('23), and $47M ('24), and those get spread across the remainder of the deal, through 2026.

43876,309928,309928,nootfloosh,"An OT with 34"" arms (which is the bench mark) has an easier time getting their hands into Hutchinson's numbers first after the snap. He is going to need to out-technique and out-hustle every OL he faces on a snap by snap basis. He can improve his form and knowledge all he wants, but he can't grow longer arms.

That isn't saying Hutchinson can't do those things and become great, but 32"" arms is a big deal around the league. Especially for Trent Baalke:

>BAALKE: I like long arms. Last year’s draft should tell you that. I think length is important. It’s important in every sport. Aldon Smith – great leverage player because you can’t get to him. He has a 36-inch arm length. All of the guys last year on the D-line were 34 or more. I think it’s an important trait. It’s a trait that’s hard to find. If you look at this year’s measurements, you’re not going to find many players in this year’s draft that have 34-plus arm length regardless of position – O-line, D-line, linebacker. So it is a trait that we certainly look at.

Watson - really intrigued by him and I wouldn’t be against using some draft capital to move up in the 2nd for him but there are too many question marks with him for me to be confident with him being our big splash.

It’s a 2 year commitment, but if you cancel right after the season you pay less (theres still a big fine but less than the 2 full years). I think the total is around $860.

Then you have to make sure you have Amazon for the one game, the peacock game will be on NBC and the ESPN games will be on there obviously. You might need Paramount+ for a week too, not sure. 

Not living in the Green Bay area is tough honestly if you don’t pirate (which i don’t). It costs me a lot of money. It’s also frustrating when half the Packers games arnt on NFL Sunday Ticket and available local, cuz that’s a week of games you pay for wasted.

He was fucking unbelievable in college.  As a hs prospect at LB.  He was something special.  And then this mystique with how he’s losing his grandmother and then a person who he thought was his gf/love of his life during the most impactful year of his career and during the championship game…that’s not just gonna bounce off someone.  it fueled him to play out of his mind that season.  But, It also fueled him falsely during the first part of his career, not just his senior year when he was affected by the loss of his grandma and his fake gf.  That event fueled his story and image, but his gf fueled his focus and drive almost all of his collegiate career.  (Watch the doc) He didn’t ask for the public to react any sort of way.  He just handled it the only way he knew how.  On the field.  Once he was aware that it was a hoax, he didn’t know how to handle it.  it affected manti’s mental health.  Lost his focus. And then unfortunately had injuries derail him.  

Leading up to the draft…he was speculated to be between 15-32 in the first round I wanna say.  And then the story comes out and he drops out of the first round.  You could argue he was hyped by the story the media presented and that also helped elevated his focus to dedicate himself to his craft.  That became his Achilles heel when his driving catalyst (Lennay) was discovered to be a fraud.  You’re rock and staunch supporter is a facade and a lie.  Now go out there and play with the same ferocity? Nah, that completely stripped him of his confidence and while it was a combination of injury and this scandal blowing up, Manti didn’t live up to his pedigree.  It’s unfortunate but, it’s the truth.

If he’s as advertised, I’m imagining Watkins and Cobb are out in a year or 2.  I don’t see Cobb playing out his contract and based on Devin Funchess and his steep decline when they should have been an impact signing, Watkins with his injury history might not be a fixture for more than half the season.  It’s not guaranteed he makes the week 1 roster either.  In which case, we’re probably still eyeing a trade or dip back into the free agency pool.

The other dude's point was that the Packers' Superbowl run had us being the last seed in order to say that the 7th seed has the potential to be exciting. My point was that the Packer's were much, MUCH better than their record stated, and that if Rodgers were healthy that season we probably would have locked a higher seed (I can specifically remember Matt Flynn folding on the last drive against the Patriots that year). 

Even with the Rodger's injury, the Packers as a unit were strong enough to never be down more than 7 at any point in the season, so it is disingenuous to use the Packers' superbowl run as an example as to why the 7th seed has the potential to make deep playoff runs.

Adams has had a couple AP seasons and actually is neck-and-neck with Evans in TDs, but his yardage numbers are lower especially earlier on. He started out his career as a 3rd option and was affected by injury/drops his second season. He broke out in 2016 but production dipped a bit (along with the rest of our offense) in 2017 with Brett Hundley as our QB for half the season. If not for that and just missing out by 3 yards in 2016 *and* 2019 he would have 6 straight seasons of 1000 yards rather than just 3 *total*.

49782,364011,364011,xylltch,"That 2011 loss was so frustrating. Copying this from a comment of mine elsewhere:

I just re-watched the Packers loss to the Giants in the playoffs that year and holy crap it was way worse than I remembered. Rodgers actually looked good in that game; he only had a few bad throws (which were really just barely off, the receivers still got hands on them) on 45 attempts.

He was also the Packers leading rusher (66 yards) and had 6 first downs on the ground (our other RBs combined for 81 yards, 3 first downs and 2 fumbles).

What really struck me on re-watching the game was just how bad the Packers receivers were at getting open; the majority of the time Rodgers was throwing to guys with defenders right on top of them, and the guys that did get open dropped it half the time. Before the game was out of reach the Packers had 8 drops by 7 players.

Here were the Packers drives:

Result|Notes
-|-
FG | Dropped pass by Finley and then incomplete to Jennings (if he turned the other way he would have had a TD, but this was just bad luck or miscommunication rather than a drop) killed the drive.
TD |
Punt | Drop by Starks followed by a Crabtree drop that killed the drive.
Fumble | Fumble by Kuhn at the Packers 40.
Punt | Good defense by Giants, no one gets open on Packers before pressure forces throwaways or results in a sack.
Fumble | Rodgers fumbled, but it was mainly a [great play by Umenyiora](https://youtu.be/Qylia58YCQs?t=234); he was through the line, into Rodgers and stripped the ball as Rodgers was about to throw (to a wide-open Jennings) in less than 2 seconds.
FG | Drop by Jennings in the end zone on 3rd and 5.
Downs | Drop by wide-open Finley on 3rd and 5, sack by Giants on 4th and 5.
Fumble | Fumble by Ryan Grant at the Packers 45, returned to the Packers 4 (Rodgers made the tackle to prevent the TD, but the Giants offense scored on their first play)
TD | 
INT | Garbage time at this point, down 17 with 1:56 left to play & no timeouts.

After Adams was drafted in 2014 we didn't hit as well on any receivers in the draft, with MVS in 2018 being probably the best, and that's sorta when our unbroken line of great receivers came to a halt.
