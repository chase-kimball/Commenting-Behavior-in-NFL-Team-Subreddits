But bottom line that game was trash and we all know it WAS NOT KYLER that caused it even though this whole situation has turned against him. 

  He is the best thing that has come out of the draft for this team in a long time. If he goes somewhere else with a decent line, recievers, and coach he will ball out. PAY THE LITTLE GUY.

I'm dense??? You're making your own fan theories that just make no sense lmfao. Why would he delete everything to make a point to the organization then immediately back track? Your logic is terrible. Doesn't create leverage or anything

>He wants a massive contract before his rookie deal is up, and he wants it despite having zero playoff wins with a team that has been well built. Look how well signing first round QBs to early, massive deals worked out for the Cowboys, Eagles and Rams with Prescott, Wentz, and Goff, only one is on their original team still and he's constantly coming up short in the playoffs. Kyler hasn't earned a massive deal yet, that's everyone's issue.

>yeah because him being immature through social media and demanding an early payout despite having nothing to truly back it up, paired with his on field and locker room lack of leadership really screams a mature leader to me. If you notice you're in the vast majority of how Kyler is perceived, maybe you should put down your bias and look around instead of trying to confirm everything you believe with one-sided information.

Everybody who has spoken about kyler says he's an amazing leader and probably the hardest worker on the team. You arent in the huddle, the sidelines, or anything. Once again, you are listening to the  media and not the people literally the closest to him, because it fits your narrative better.

>The Cardinals have really no reason to trade him yet unless a big offer comes in and they don't believe he's a franchise starter, but you're talking about a franchise that took back to back first round QBs, dropping the first one after a single season.

Kellen Moore, entirely unproven, not a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù by any means. Supposed offensive mastermind that has continuously disappointed in Dallas.

No it doesn't, that is your subjective opinion. It just references ""reports""; likely just the Mortinson tweet, which the Cardinals have denied.

He went out of his way to reply to a couple of randos on twitter that were discussing these types of issues related to Murray. Very telling.

Even the article you posted has a public statement from the Cardinals that they want to move forward with Kyler as the QB.

18931,162845,162845,buddaaaa,"In my opinion, the run with Bruce Arians early in Keim‚Äôs tenure rivals that of the Warner years. He only had one losing season in Arizona (when Palmer tore his ACL, iirc) out of 5 years, and went 10-6, 11-5, and 13-3 in his first 3 years. Cardinals were one of the only teams ever to miss the playoffs at 10-6 in 2013. They didn‚Äôt make the Super Bowl because of the Carolina collapse, but I think those teams were just objectively better than the ones during Warner‚Äôs years in Arizona.

Now, there‚Äôs a whole different discussion about Keim‚Äôs influence on those teams. He became GM the same year Arians started and the only impactful draft pick he made for those teams was Tyrann Mathieu (which I‚Äôd argue is a special/lucky case). He did trade for Palmer which is a crazy steal looking back, but yeah, the main core of those teams (Patrick Peterson, Calais Campbell, Larry Fitzgerald) were all Rod Graves players, not Keim.

Once the juice of those guys ran out is when you had Arians leave and the Wilks era was ushered in and the Cardinals completely shat the bed. I think Kyler and Kliff‚Äôs scheme have helped keep the Cardinals‚Äô head above water, but if you take a look at the roster it‚Äôs just a bunch of ‚Äúwho?‚Äù

The chart was posted in response to a tweet about the Jags spending the most guaranteed money ever in FA this year, snarkily implying that them being big spenders doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre going to get better, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a premise I disagree with.

What I don‚Äôt like, however, is that the vagueness of the chart is going to lead people to infer that spending lots of money is bad or the contrapositive that it‚Äôs good to spend little money in FA. (Just look at the other comments in this thread, or reason why it was posted here to see what I mean)

For example, if a team were to have a couple of amazing drafts in a row, like the Seahawks of the early ‚Äò10s, I think there‚Äôs a very good argument for that team to be big spenders in free agency. It‚Äôs a great way to maximize team-friendly deals. Additionally, most FA contracts nowadays contain language that allows teams to void multiple years near the end of a contract with dead cap hits that are much smaller than the APY.

I guess my point is that trying to make an example of the Jags as ‚Äúspending big in free agency is bad‚Äù is, at the very least, an argument that lacks any nuance.

Lowest price on SeatGeek is $338 for that section and also near 50 yard line. 

Face value is antiquated for football tickets. It doesn‚Äôt count pre-season because they go way under face value and practically free.  It obviously doesn‚Äôt account for supply and demand which depends on the popular teams and even playoff implications‚Ä¶or popular storylines like Brady‚Äôs possible last visit to the stadium. 

So yeah you could wait till before the game to see if there are any cheap tickets left if you want the cheapest deal. 

Also as I‚Äôve always complained before Cardinals fans are always looking for the best price whereas diehard fans (typically opponents) pay for whatever they can. Tickets were going for as low as $70 in that section (I think third row) and I couldn‚Äôt even convince Cardinals fans to go when it was against the Texans during a great season.  So unfortunately the stadium really does rely on opponents to fill to the stadium and that‚Äôs not right. 

So many comments like ‚Äúit‚Äôs too expensive‚Äù or ‚ÄúI rather watch it on TV‚Äù but no one understands this is the NFL and we‚Äôre spoiled to have a great stadium and and up and up team.

Go be a fan of baseball or NHL if you want face value.

Most views are great EXCEPT for end zone. Even a slight angle at end zone is good. End zone stinks because the angle is weird and when they pass the 30 yard line you‚Äôre stuck watching the Jumbotron.  There‚Äôs just wayyyy too many blind spots in the end zone. Unless you like watching field goals‚Ä¶lol. Even standing in the end zone in the standing areas‚Ä¶you‚Äôll easily see why end zone stinks. 

Upper level is still great if you‚Äôre at the first 7 rows or so. Upper level get pretty high up and those do suck (plus it takes forever to get there and you‚Äôre out of breath).  In upper you couple get a lot of opposing fans though no matter if you‚Äôre on the home or visiting side.
