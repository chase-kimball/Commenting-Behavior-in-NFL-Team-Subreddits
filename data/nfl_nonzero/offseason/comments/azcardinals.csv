The entire team around him crumbled apart. It had been happening for 3 or 4 games prior to that game. But it really imploded in that game. He had about 0.3 seconds before he was sacked every play and had to find one of our completely covered recievers in that time. There was ZERO Kyler could have done to fix it. The only thing he could have done that he didn't do was save face by being a cheerleader on the sidelines I guess. But bottom line that game was trash and we all know it WAS NOT KYLER that caused it even though this whole situation has turned against him. 

  He is the best thing that has come out of the draft for this team in a long time. If he goes somewhere else with a decent line, recievers, and coach he will ball out. PAY THE LITTLE GUY.

I'm dense??? You're making your own fan theories that just make no sense lmfao. Why would he delete everything to make a point to the organization then immediately back track? Your logic is terrible. Doesn't create leverage or anything

>He wants a massive contract before his rookie deal is up, and he wants it despite having zero playoff wins with a team that has been well built. Look how well signing first round QBs to early, massive deals worked out for the Cowboys, Eagles and Rams with Prescott, Wentz, and Goff, only one is on their original team still and he's constantly coming up short in the playoffs. Kyler hasn't earned a massive deal yet, that's everyone's issue.

dude, he's played 3 seasons lmao. He's shown enough to the point where he's worth whatever he wants, because did you see our team before he showed up? Dude is genuinely a star. You're looking at this from the side of the cardinals and not the actual player himself and thats just silly. Get a steve keim jersey.

&#x200B;

>yeah because him being immature through social media and demanding an early payout despite having nothing to truly back it up, paired with his on field and locker room lack of leadership really screams a mature leader to me. If you notice you're in the vast majority of how Kyler is perceived, maybe you should put down your bias and look around instead of trying to confirm everything you believe with one-sided information.

Everybody who has spoken about kyler says he's an amazing leader and probably the hardest worker on the team. You arent in the huddle, the sidelines, or anything. Once again, you are listening to the  media and not the people literally the closest to him, because it fits your narrative better.

>The Cardinals have really no reason to trade him yet unless a big offer comes in and they don't believe he's a franchise starter, but you're talking about a franchise that took back to back first round QBs, dropping the first one after a single season. They seem to be pretty emotionless with their decisions, there's absolutely a chance that Kyler gets traded, especially if he refuses to play the rest of the season without a contract.

Either he doesn’t want to leave KC, or he’s extremely unqualified/poor interviewer. Most likely scenario is he is the successor to Reid when he retires. 

I’ll even list others. 

Zimmer, a defensive minded head coach who was fired for years of mediocrity and stubbornness. Not a winner. 

Jim Harbaugh, a “winner”, who benefited from an entirely new scheme taking NFL defenses by surprise. Teams finally adjusted and surprise, his teams were terrible and he couldn’t adjust. 

Leftwich, unproven and has rode of the coat tails of Bruce Arians his entire coaching career, and his one season without him posted the 4 worst offensive DVOA of all time after McCoy was fired. 

Kellen Moore, entirely unproven, not a “winner” by any means. Supposed offensive mastermind that has continuously disappointed in Dallas. 

Replacing a coach isn’t just willy nilly and suddenly you’re a super bowl guarantee.

Green was pissed because the Cardinals showed they weren't the juggernaut that the media was building them up to be, but because of a few bad plays by the Cardinals and a few good plays by the Bears, everyone was going to ignore that.

My point being that hitting or missing on just 1 pick (and a QB pick, which amplifies the value) is the difference between the top of the league and the bottom of the league. There isn't really that much separation between any of the GMs, and everyone is doing close to the same job.

18931,162845,162845,buddaaaa,"In my opinion, the run with Bruce Arians early in Keim’s tenure rivals that of the Warner years. He only had one losing season in Arizona (when Palmer tore his ACL, iirc) out of 5 years, and went 10-6, 11-5, and 13-3 in his first 3 years. Cardinals were one of the only teams ever to miss the playoffs at 10-6 in 2013. They didn’t make the Super Bowl because of the Carolina collapse, but I think those teams were just objectively better than the ones during Warner’s years in Arizona.

Now, there’s a whole different discussion about Keim’s influence on those teams. He became GM the same year Arians started and the only impactful draft pick he made for those teams was Tyrann Mathieu (which I’d argue is a special/lucky case). He did trade for Palmer which is a crazy steal looking back, but yeah, the main core of those teams (Patrick Peterson, Calais Campbell, Larry Fitzgerald) were all Rod Graves players, not Keim.

Once the juice of those guys ran out is when you had Arians leave and the Wilks era was ushered in and the Cardinals completely shat the bed. I think Kyler and Kliff’s scheme have helped keep the Cardinals’ head above water, but if you take a look at the roster it’s just a bunch of “who?”

The chart was posted in response to a tweet about the Jags spending the most guaranteed money ever in FA this year, snarkily implying that them being big spenders doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to get better, which isn’t necessarily a premise I disagree with.

What I don’t like, however, is that the vagueness of the chart is going to lead people to infer that spending lots of money is bad or the contrapositive that it’s good to spend little money in FA. (Just look at the other comments in this thread, or reason why it was posted here to see what I mean)

For example, if a team were to have a couple of amazing drafts in a row, like the Seahawks of the early ‘10s, I think there’s a very good argument for that team to be big spenders in free agency. It’s a great way to maximize team-friendly deals. Additionally, most FA contracts nowadays contain language that allows teams to void multiple years near the end of a contract with dead cap hits that are much smaller than the APY.

I guess my point is that trying to make an example of the Jags as “spending big in free agency is bad” is, at the very least, an argument that lacks any nuance. While it is possible that spending big in free agency is “not good,” it takes a lot more to show that than a single chart comparing free agency spending against team wins.",1.0,azcardinals,t3_tprxoc,False,0.0,:OROY: Kyler OROY,2022-03-27T19:01:36Z,azcardinals,0.1114821197092533

Lowest price on SeatGeek is $338 for that section and also near 50 yard line. 

Face value is antiquated for football tickets. It doesn’t count pre-season because they go way under face value and practically free.  It obviously doesn’t account for supply and demand which depends on the popular teams and even playoff implications…or popular storylines like Brady’s possible last visit to the stadium. 

So yeah you could wait till before the game to see if there are any cheap tickets left if you want the cheapest deal. 

Also as I’ve always complained before Cardinals fans are always looking for the best price whereas diehard fans (typically opponents) pay for whatever they can. Tickets were going for as low as $70 in that section (I think third row) and I couldn’t even convince Cardinals fans to go when it was against the Texans during a great season.  So unfortunately the stadium really does rely on opponents to fill to the stadium and that’s not right. 

So many comments like “it’s too expensive” or “I rather watch it on TV” but no one understands this is the NFL and we’re spoiled to have a great stadium and and up and up team.

Go be a fan of baseball or NHL if you want face value.

Edit:
Also someone called me out last season or two season ago when I posted about cheap tickets and someone said “If it’s so cheap then why don’t you buy me a ticket.”  So I bought two redditors tickets for a Reddit thank you post or picture (and to put money where my mouth is).
