- 1st team oline looked much better this week, they weren’t bad last week but there were a couple things that they needed to clean up and it looks like they did that 
- Fortson is a RZ animal, he’s so big and he’s really worked on his hands and foot work to really become a formidable target 
- Justin Watson is making the 53, and I really hope these pre season reps translate to reg season reps he looks like a guy who could raise some eyebrows 
- Mahomes looks sharp and in control, doesn’t look like he’s struggling with distributing the ball around in the slightest which anyone with a brain figured but still it’s a pro
- 1st team defense with another scoreless run 
- Willie Gay and Nick Bolton could very well end the season as the best 1/2 LB punch in the game, Willie flys around the field and really has developed a nose for the football playing smart and composed and Boltons pass defense continues to develop
- Karlaftis looks the part, his bull rush is seriously elite and his ability to marry that with some of his lesser developed moves makes him a force. That sack was so impressive, absolutely ate the TE block alive, moved into a double, was held and still made his was back to the QB, he just doesn’t stop
- No huge miscues by the secondary, this Washington pass scheme isn’t exactly elite but still always good to see 
- Saunders when healthy can make an impact he’s a big athletic body and I hope he can keep healthy this season 
- Chenal looks good in the areas we thought he would i.e. run stuffing and blitzing and he’s another high motor guy, time will tell if he can develop has a pass defender but we had those same concerns about Bolton and that’s obviously improved 

Cons 
- Our depth talent is lacking in multiple areas, mostly the secondary, oline & DT, obviously there are exceptions, Josh Williams and Allegretti are obviously good depth just wish we had a little more there. And for the DT’s I just wish we had difference maker, I love Wharton/Saunders/Nnadi and their potential on a down to down basis but I’d argue none of them are NFL-wide every down guys 
- Bit of an odd game for Skyy, Mahomes wasn’t really looking his way too often, and on the pass attempts to him they seemed a little out of sync, and just like that his day was over so not really ton to work off anyway but would’ve liked to see some completed reps to him.

In r/nfl you have the uninformed making knee jerk opinions one way or the other based on a single tweet and here-in our own sub you have people mad at a guy for wanting to be paid what he sees his value is. The only reasonable takes I’ve seen are in this sub as well but they are in a 1:3 ratio between ‘Brown can go fuck himself’.  

It’s a perfectly fine opinion to say that Brown isn’t worth *the* top LT money, I don’t think he is either. I believe we all saw with our own eyes that there were some extreme growing pains in our system for him when it came to jumping from the polar opposite system in Baltimore - and as the season progressed he did improve. Once again I don’t think he improved enough for me to believe he deserves to be the highest paid LT but enough to where I do think he deserve top 5 LT money which is what was offered. I’d still rank him rn somewhere in the 9-13 range of actually best LT’s but that’s just the way contracts work you over pay just a little bit to maintain talent, now don’t jump down my throat about that, I know you can’t do that with everyone but the name of the game is to mitigate how many times you do it and most importantly make sure the guy you’re doing it for is actually worth the risk your taking on. And on that note he’s also only **26** coming off his 2nd full year playing LT at the professional level (1st in a pass heavy scheme), I don’t think it takes a woefully optimistic person to say they think he’ll most likely improve

But, I also understand why OBJ didn’t want that contract as it would’ve locked him in for 4-5 years at that price which by the end of the contract would’ve probably had him as the 10-13th in LT dollars which makes a shit ton of sense for us but as I said earlier if he improves to any sort of degree would have him underpaid, and it doesn’t make a guy selfish to say so when his professional careers’ shelf life is 10-15 years of making money 

In my opinion the smart play by him and his agent would’ve been a middle ground where he accepts a shorter 2-3 yr contract for still that top 5 LT money. You’ll be top 5 highest paid and by the end of it you’ll still be under 30 and if everything went how OBJ believes it will - then he will be well in line to completely reset the market and by that point the Chiefs could definitely be willing to pay it.

976,2726,2726,AU_wde_2,"**My completely professional no way I could possibly be wrong evaluation of our unit:**

OLine: A-: As far as interior goes we probably have the best in the league with Creed, Smith and Thuney. For tackles I like OBJ I think he does certain things exceedingly well but did struggle to contain speed guys when Mahomes wanted to run his deep drop backs - I like the competition of Kinnard and Niang at RT, they both certainly have enough talent, it just needs to click but having them both available as swing tackles is a big plus

RB: B- : I still like what Clyde brings to the table and I think if he can act as our primary pass catching back and in doing so could have an excellent year. Rojo has the between the tackle talent as well as some general high athleticism and  speed; then I like what Pacheco brings to the table with his speed and pass protection. If we could wrap those guys up into one player we’d have a dominator but unfortunately with modern political views on designer babies that’s gonna be tough to pull off 

WR: A- : there’s certainly *a lot* of question marks surrounding this group but there is talent spread fairly evenly across the board. We don’t have the single game breaker like we did with Hill but I believe we can reinvent Hill through the aggregate of Juju/Skyy’s excellent slot play, MVS/Hardmans downfield/backfield speed and if the wildcards like Ross can hit then we’d be at an A+ but only time will tell if they can settle in and mesh with Mahomes. Regardless I think that exact point will be valuable for Mahomes moving forward and being able to more quickly mesh with a new group of receivers as he’s going to have to do multiple times throughout his career

TE A+ : Kelce is enough to make this an A+ but with Fortson coming back and the (hopeful) second year TE jump of Grey we could be looking at an absolutely stacked TE room

DT: B+ : Jones is enough to drag this position to a reasonable spot, I love Nnadi and is a phenomenal run stuffer but that doesn’t move the needle a bunch, then we’ve got 2 hopefuls who’ve shown flashes one time or another in Saunders and Wharton but not much after them 

DE: C+ : I **really** hope I’m eating crow midway through the season and Clark on a pseudo contract year comes out and plays consistently/Karlaftis ends up being an absolute animal/Malik Herring molds into the guy he could’ve been coming out of college pre-injury/Danna takes a reasonable step forward/maybe we see something from the Kaindoh project, but that is a lot of what-ifs and dreams. The upside is there through Herring and Karlaftis to really bring this edge rush together but it’s going to be a challenge 

LB: A+ : Gay is a blitzing cover backer who has the speed and athleticism to cover RB’s and TE’s, Bolton is an elite run stuffer who’s only knock coming out of college was his coverage ability - he showed in his rookie season reasonably higher ability there than I would’ve given him credit out of college, now he’s got a year under his belt and with that will come greater play recognition as the brain behind our secondary. Chenal is the perfect linebacker to round out our unit, he’s a mean mf who hits hard, is too big for RB’s and too fast for Guards, his coverage skills are questionable but that isn’t necessarily because he can’t do it, he just was never asked to do it at Wisco, if that develops then we’re looking at - if not the best -, a top 3 LB group (which is a far cry from where we were just 3 years ago)

CB: A- : lots of moving pieces here, but I just have a huge belief in what we did this off-season. Sneed/McDuffie/Fenton is a solid top 3, there is some overlap there with slot vs outside play but I think McD and Sneed should be able to step into their role of perimeter covers. Then after that we have more depth there than we’ve had in years past with the veteran Lonnie Johnson *(who underperformed but it was with the Texans)*, Josh Williams who is one of the guys im probably too excited for but his athleticism is monstrous and I love getting guys who absolutely destroyed on the defensive side of the ball in D2. We also have Baker coming back who at the very least will add some decent depth and maybe with a year of having the playbook can turn into a solid rotational guy 

S: B+ : it’s clear we are going for a different philosophy, Reid and Cook hit and they hit hard, they are sure handed tacklers that have average to (at times) great field vision but the athleticism to make up any lost ground. Couple them with Thornhill and you’ve got a very solid nickel package with athletes who can cover all corners of the field",15.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_uyvplq,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2022-05-27T07:38:19Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0204076251481418

980,2731,2731,AU_wde_2,"- W1 Cards - Unfortunately the cards play their best football to start the season so that’s less than ideal. That being said they will be without DHop/Kirk, meaning their top guys will be Hollywood, Rondale Moore and Isabella which even with a newly meshing secondary shouldn’t be *too* horrible W31-24

- W2 LAC - Really could go anywhere with this game, it’s early in the season we both have newly reformed defenses. *But* we have a newly reformed receiving core which could help us by catching teams off guard with a new more diverse play calling system…or…it could just not work, Juju doesn’t return to form, Skyy takes a bit longer to learn the playbook, Mecole doesn’t take a step up on his contract year, and MVS doesn’t embrace his role. I certainly like the prior option but the latter is in the cards. In the end I just have a better feeling about this one early in the season but we’ll split with them this year W34-31 

- W3 Colts - They have both a solid defense and offense, with Matt Ryan taking charge which can keep the game close and maybe the ball bounces their way and we end up losing this one but on paper I like our chances W24-17

- W4 Bucs - Brady coming back, I think Gronk re-signs after OTA’s, they managed to hang onto Godwin and Evans, Fournette is now the featured back there and their defense will be healthy to start the year. They have not re-signed Suh yet and I haven’t kept up with the situation but given his age wouldn’t be surprised by a similar move to Gronk. We should be carrying a decent amount of emotion into this game, wouldn’t be surprised if we lose this one but I’m a homer so 42-35

- W5 Raiders - A common theme with me is I think the Raiders and Broncos are getting a bit overrated but sticking with the Raiders: they added Davante which is big for them, their offensive weapons are going to be a challenge but in the end they didnt do nearly enough to fix their defense - adding Chandler Jones is great and they are going to have a pretty nasty exterior pass rush but their interior isn’t very strong, and their secondary is still extremely week. They also are still working with Carr who is right around the 12th best QB in the league but he does very little to instill fear in me. So outside of their weapons I just don’t buy into the hype W30-15

- W6 Bills - they’re an extremely strong team, just like last year and unless we broke their spirit this is going to be a tough regular season revenge game to get past, by this point our defense should be fairly well gelled. We still can win this game but it’s going to be a huge challenge L34-24

By this point in the season I’d be satisfied with 4-2 with one win against the Chargers/Bucs/Bills. I hope for 2 wins against them but they are all going to be tough 

- W7 San Fran - I see them with all of these expectations but with the unknown of Lance (and in some reporting, negativity surrounding him) I can’t bring myself to think they’ll win this game. But this is another solid team similar to the Colts who definitely could beat us if things start going their way W21-14

- W9 Titans - I said the same thing it at the start of last year and we ended up getting blown out in the regular season by them but I feel as though they have been slowly deteriorating after the AFCCG loss a few years back. Still will be a solid team but they’re taking a sizable gamble on Burks working out/the health of Woods/the health of Henry will be an interesting team to watch. W27-21

- W10 Jags - they’re not their yet, they spent a lot of money but I didn’t love the value they spent it on, Walker and Allen will be a problem for opposing olines but I like our Oline a good deal W34-7

- W11 Chargers - as I said earlier I think we split so we either lose the first one or this one L31-24

- W12 Rams - Should be a shootout of a game W7-3

- W13 Bengals - If we lose in a similar fashion to the 2 last year my spirit will leave my body. They made some moves around their oline, by this point they should have gelled, they had our number but in the end they were a 10 win regular season team last year, I think we get the best of them this time W24-17

- W14 Broncos - I’m not buying into the hype of their team, Russ is a huge improvement on Lock/Bridgewater even if he isn’t as sharp/mobile as he was a couple years ago. Their oline is serviceable but not world beaters. Their WR is overrated, I think their guys’ peak is WR2 with most of them falling into a WR3 category. Their running game is solid though but I see us making a big improvement on our run defense this year, and last year it wasn’t all that bad. Then the defense that always managed to stifle our offense EO’s without it’s designer because they inexplicably fired their defensive minded coach for offensive downfalls. And their pass rush took a hit as well, they’ll be a fine team and they’ll win games differently than they have the last few years. But they’re record won’t improve *too* much maybe an 8 win team. W29-23

- W15 Houston - I like a lot of the moves they made, Davis Mills is serviceable but he’s not the answer W27-9

- W16 Seattle - they are in a rebuild with Lock at the helm, even if the browns make a move and Baker ends up on their roster I don’t see them being much of a player this year, let alone this late in the season W36-6

- W17 Broncos - W24-17

- W18 Raiders - I wouldn’t be utterly shocked if we lose either this one or the prior to the Raiders, I don’t buy into the deep playoff team hype but they’ll still be solid W23-18

This is an extremely hopeful outcome finishing 15-2 is going to be really difficult. I think the realistic expectation is more so 13-4 with losses to the Chargers/Bills/Bucs/(one of Rams/Bengals) if we lose all 5 of those then something didn’t work as well as we had hoped whether it be oline injuries, WR meshing, rookie development, secondary gelling etc",6.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_uop4tg,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2022-05-13T08:21:25Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0117103917785984

George Karlaftis: Only 5 years of football experience, does not have the bend that you see from some of those thinner OLB’s but the dudes big and powerful. Seems to me he’s intelligent and can have an impact his rookie season and given some time can in my hopeful opinion develop into a top tier edge 

Skyy Moore: An all around receiver, can play x, y & z with good to incredible success. Incredibly sure handed, not the biggest but with MVS, and Juju I’m not too worried about that. His route running is well polished and given our system can have some great success

Bryan Cook: Thumper safety who can play in the box and dish out punishment. He’s got speed, power and a decent eye for the football. Reid, Thornhill and Cook are going to make one hell of a tandem. Lots of depth with some vets too which gives us some time to ease him in but I love the drive for sure tacklers and heavy hitters

Leo Chenal: A pure downhill MLB, shoots the gaps better than any LB in the draft, meets RB’s in the backfield before they’ve had a chance to breathe and hits like a fucking truck. No proof that he can be a viable pass coverage player, in fact to the contrary he has been a liability in that position. Maybeeee he could develop into competent but he’s an elite run stuffer and blitzer. He opens up a world of opportunities for the Dline, because if you send him screaming up the middle and the other team expects to stop him with a 210lb RB their QB is in for a rude awakening - gonna force the oline to shift around and give us some good one on ones 

Josh Williams: big athletic prototypical CB. This is the kinda prospect that fits our typical mold. Big upside similar to sneed. Only time will tell if he can develop into a solid rotational piece 

Darian Kinnard: Monstrous OLineman, could slide in as a depth guard or could compete for RT. Lots of upside with him but he does have some downsides but I trust our oline coaches to smooth him out

Jaylen Watson: another pure athletic corner, loto

Isaih Pacheco: Speed back, he’s got his work cut out for him having to beat out Gore for an active roster spot but his speed certainly separates himself from the other 3 so maybe a decent shot for a 7th rounder to make it

1011,2773,2773,AU_wde_2,"I personally think the Raiders and Broncos are a little bit overblown

For the Raiders, they’re defense is still not that great even with Chandler Jones - they’ll have a good pass rush from the edge but they’re secondary is still a mess. So unless they can fix their secondary in the draft (a draft in which they’re first pick is 86 then followed by 126) I think they’ll have an offense who can move the ball and they’ll win some games here and there and may even beat us one of the games but I see them as an absolute peak of divisional round and out

The Broncos - I would be much more scared of them *if* they had kept Fangio. I thought it was a stupid fire then and still do now. Dudes a defensive minded coach and put together top 10 defensive units every year, but because they drafted shit QB’s they couldn’t ever get over the hump. Now they’ve got a good QB (who still has *some* doubters due to last years performance) but they got rid of the guy responsible for making that defense elite. So I think they’re defense will take a hit and in the end it’s going to take some time for that offense to gel together - absolute peak for them is wildcard and out

As for you guys you’ve just gotta get out of your own way. The talent there is phenomenal and now is the time to take advantage of it. Staying healthy and competent coaching are the only two obvious roadblocks. Well that and us😉

Regarding Hill, it’s a huge loss and no Mecole isn’t going to be able to fill in for him in that regard. But the guys we’ve picked up signal an identity shift away from small/speed and into big/possession with guys like Mecole sprinkled in as gadget players. We more or less showed last year that 2 main options in the passing game isn’t enough so we’re going to hopefully be able to spread the ball around to the new guys. With that said, Reid is going to have to replace Hill in the aggregate because there is no single player who can just step in and be Tyreek Hill. That’s why there’s quite a bit of anxiety and excitement about the draft from our fans. Because not to be overly dramatic but Veach has set this draft up to be a sink or swim draft. We have obvious holes and there was free agent talent available to fill those holes but instead chose to not re-structure Mahomes, get Orlando Brown extended early which would’ve opened up loads of cap space in the short term and chose to go build through the draft. If we bust out of this draft it will be a set back, maybe bias here but I think with Reid, Mahomes and Kelce + our new and greatly improved oline we’ll still be a highly competitive team we just won’t be SB contenders. On the flip side if we nail this draft, we are set up for the next 4 years of elite core play while small pieces move around throughout the off-seasons

But his first season was murky at best, seemed like he got in the doghouse early with the coaching staff and wasn’t given the opportunity to get out of it all season

But regardless he is extremely talented still with pretty huge upside and given a redraft even with everything we know now, I think plenty would be willing to give up 103 or 121 for him.

So coming out and saying that you want to be used as a WR only is great and all but again you had one great season and you’re asking other teams to take away a sizable chunk of what made that season special. Which is why I’m not too keen on the Chiefs taking him if he’s really serious about that assertion - you’re asking a team to spend +23M a year on you to play to the level that you just haven’t at the singular position.

Also I think some are not seeing the former writing on the wall because it is awkward and a little painful - but Tyreek just didn’t want to be here anymore. Not to slam him or be a pessimist but from a majority of reports coming out we made him a very similar offer to what the dolphins did and he didn’t want it and preferred to move closer to his house in Miami. (Also no income taxes which is nice for him) 

We as the fans took that move and ran with it wanting them to greatly invest in the draft. Meanwhile our FO was, just 5 minutes ago, willing to and - had a plan to - build the roster with a big WR contract on the books. This report just seems that Veach is attempting to gage the potential of salvaging that plan with a younger option. I won’t go out and say that they’re cheaper because that’s a “for now” statement. I’m skeptical of the plan but if we lose a bunch of the draft capitol we’ve accumulated and it’s not an ace in the hole I will be less skeptical and more whelmed. But to openly say it’s a bad plan is a little disingenuous, say we get a guy like Deebo or AJ Brown and they do agree to a $25M/yr contract; I’d still be a *little* skeptical but I’d see the point. 

The only move that I would be over the moon about and would cost us, most likely, *more* draft capitol than we even gave up for Tyreek is getting Justin Jefferson but to squash that hope at all, he isn’t on the market, he is still under his rookie contract and the Vikings have made it abundantly clear their plan is to “run it back” with their squad even though they’ve been “running back” the same 6-10 win team for 5 years now",3.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_tqzjf4,False,0.0,Patrick Mahomes II #15,2022-03-29T09:39:06Z,kansascitychiefs,0.0993725988784759

This didn’t happen over night or handled lightly, from all segments of information we offered Hill a lucrative contract that would’ve made him *one of* the highest paid at the position, but he and his agent put their foot in the ground and said he wanted to be the highest paid
- Opinion: who are we to tell him when enough is enough? Do I think there is inherent value in having an all time QB and play designer as your cohorts? Most definitely and I think he could have added to his legacy more here in KC but from what we’re hearing he valued the money and the city of Miami more than those things and it sucks but that’s his prerogative

There aren’t very many non-QB players worth 30M a year, you can definitely argue that Hill is one of them given his super human characteristics, there are guys that can imitate what a guy like Adam’s does, no one can do what Tyreek does. That being said putting that much cash into a guy known for his agility is a pretty sizable risk

Tyreek is a one of a kind talent that *cannot* be replaced by a single player, and to try and attempt to do so would only lead to more Mecole Hardmans, i.e. players with intangibles that you hope can develop into that playmaker

We showed at times this year that 2 guys who can make a lot of plays isn’t enough if your 3rd/4th guy cant get open consistently. So with that said we are going to need to reinvent the offense with a plethora of lesser talent who can stretch the defense in a number of different ways. This trade puts us in a position to begin that endeavor 

We capitalized on Tyreeks trade value given his age and reliance on athleticism to carry his game. In doing so (and not trying to be dramatic) have made this draft into arguably one of the most important and pivotal drafts in chiefs history. The players from this draft could either propel us into a new more diversified Chiefs roster or Veach and co. could miss on the picks in which case it will take a few years to try and recoup our luster - in that scenario would we still be good? Yeah of course - we have Mahomes and Reid but the margin for error would be much much smaller 

There must be some guys that Veach absolutely loves because the cajones to bet on you and your scouting staff to make this kind of move is pretty remarkable

Regarding the trade value I would’ve liked to have gotten a first in the upper half (and preferably from an NFC partner) but it doesn’t appear that sort of trade partner existed. I do think we got good value it’s just a matter now of turning that value into something tangible

1045,2814,2814,AU_wde_2,"The gambles the Chiefs are taking (imo):

- Trust in Niangs health: given the level of play *just in division* at the DE position we need to have our tackles sorted out, I do believe Niang can be the RT we want him to be but we need a full season out of him 
- Trust in day 2 or 3 WR talent for the future: With the acquisition of Juju I find it hard to believe we go early early on WR. I’d be surprised at anything before that 2nd 3rd round pick. I’m not the biggest fan of that tactic as we will be in the same position next year as we were in this year prior to the Juju signing (assuming things go as planned with Juju and he plays his way out of KC, which would be a good thing) - and I like a good number of the rookie WR’s this year
- Belief we can solve the pass rush issue through rookies: There is still time and I do believe we will most likely get Ingram back for next year - that being said that’s the exact same line as last years playoff team that couldn’t generate much pressure against one of the worst Olines in the league. So we will be looking early in the draft to solve that. There are a number of interesting prospects that I would be excited to get but I’m just not a huge believer in relying on late first round rookies to solve a major point of concern for your team
- Re-establishing the secondary through more inexpensive means: we are once again punting CB either to the draft or post-draft inexpensive signings (probably a little of both). I don’t have much of a problem with that we have shown the ability to spot talent late and put together a serviceable secondary unit. That being said without Mathieu back there, we could see quite a bit of growing pains 
- That the young guys can assert themselves as the leaders of the defense: Bolton, Gay, Thornhill & Sneed are all going to be thrust into leadership roles in some capacity now that Mathieu’s intellect safety net isn’t underneath them - will be a sink or swim situation for each of them 

In the end I think I would’ve prioritized a little differently - most notably signing 2 vet DE’s then answering WR in the draft but I trust in the actual professionals to build the roster.

Given the amount of DE movement I think our competition for him has decreased significantly.

Both him and Landry are gambles in a way. They’ve both been trending in generally the wrong direction and we as fans hope that a change in scenery will be the magic fix

Juju is only 26 but has failed to come even close to that 2018 peak he had while playing second fiddle to AB. Maybe being able to play 3rd in line to Kelce and Hill will take enough pressure off of him in the secondary to get that resurgence. Or he really was a one hit wonder and will offer next to nothing in terms of valuable production or worse yet that injury he had for a majority of last season really will hamper him moving forward. Only fair to question how much the corpse of Big Ben played a part in the drop in production 

Then for Landry he’s going to be 30 by the end of next season. His QB’s have been Miami Ryan Tannehill (with Gase), Jay Cutler and Baker Mayfield (with a litany of bad coaching) for a combined 3 winning seasons in an 8 year career. Despite all of that he has 3 1000+ yard seasons and is 50 yards total over two seasons of making that 5 1000+ yard seasons. That being said these last two seasons have been less desirable with a reasonable 840 yards on 3TD season in 2020 and this year with 570 yards on 2 TD’s.

He’s like I’ll take care of you after dinner. He walks outside and pays me $5 for the cost of the parking and leaves. It’s was cool though a bunch of other chiefs players gave me $20-50 dollar tips but the way Derek Johnson went through all this extra interaction and effort to make sure I parked his car up front and how he’d take good care of me was surprising.

Reid was a great signing since it replaced a huge departure for cheaper and made us younger.

TLDR: It was found back in 2020 that Ross was born with Klippel-Feil syndrome, a bone disorder where two seperate bones in the spine/neck region are fused together. He had the disorder his entire life, but he never had it checked out until his injury. After a while, he agreed to a discectomy (removal of abnormal disc material) in June of 2020. Its a common procedure, but not for Ross's current situation. Other surgeries would have completley knocked football out of the question, but this was the only surgery that left football still on the table. He returned 2021, and through the season, doctors picked up a stress fracture in his left foot. He played through it, because he wanted to ""make a point"" that he could still play. After the season he went on to have foot surgery then started prepping for the draft.

20696,145124,145124,MedianMahomesValue,"My proposed rule changes:

## **1. Defensive Penalty: Automatic 1st downs OR penalty yardage**

I vote that the offense gets to choose one or the other, and that you only get the 1st down option if you started the down within 10 yards of the 1st down marker (or the goal line). If the penalty yardage grants a first down, then so be it.

## **2. Offensive Penalty: Penalty yardage OR loss of down.**

Too often when I'm watching the Chiefs do I see an offensive penalty get called on 2nd down after a 5 yard completion. The defense accepts, and the Chiefs get 2nd and 15 or 20, either of which is a good bit better than 3rd and 10. The defense should be able to choose a loss of down.

## **3. Defensive PI is limited to a 15 yard penalty unless review shows it was ""egregious""**

In hockey, if a penalty is committed on a player who otherwise would have been one on one with the goalie, a penalty shot is granted. In all other situations, the same penalty is a standard 2 minute minor. In basketball, a foul is reviewed before being declared ""flagrant"". I want the same thing in the NFL; you can call PI, but spot fouls beyond 15 yards only happen if a review shows that the PI was intentional, and that without PI the receiver would have clearly caught the ball and had an open path to a TD.

## **4. Extra point becomes extra points**

For example, despite Mecole Hardman not being who we thought he’d be, has been 3rd in total receiving yards (behind hill and Kelce) for consecutive years now.  Reid finds a way to put the ball in his hands bc we all know he’s great at YAC.

2) Ticketed for driving a ""defective vehicle"". 

3) Ticketed for speeding.  

4) License suspended for ""illegal left turn.""  

5) Speeding.  

^These are all in college in the late 1980s. 

6) ""interfering with a firefighter."" Bienemy said the firefighter misread a situation and thought it was an electrical fire and attempted to bust a hole in the wall. He argued against it. Ordered community service.  

7) ""On September 27, 1993, Bieniemy was arrested in Boulder, Colorado, for allegedly harassing a female parking attendant."" Inexcusable.

52909,367456,367456,samtalkssports,"To me bend = ability to 'bend' the angle around the edge once outside containment/leverage is established on a play. So its not just 'does he have an outside speed pass rush move' but does he leverage edge containment to make plays in the backfield.

I think what you mean by bend is can a pass rusher use pure speed to get around the edge of the tackle (or use a head-dip like the video you posted). And you're right that Karloftis definitely does not do that. He's more of a bullrush and push/pull technique guy when rushing the passer.

But he can turn his hips and shoulders fluidly enough and with good balance to be disruptive in the backfield when he gets leverage on his first step or over-powers his man. Calling it ""turning"" really doesn't do justice to how hard it is to fend off a chip block and make a play on the opposite side of the backfield.

This scouting report sums up some of what I was saying too.

* 1995, #1 seed in the playoffs, lost our first game 10-7 to the Colts on three missed field goals.  Almost 30 years later and people still say the name Lin Elliot with anger in their voice.

* 1997, #1 seed in the playoffs, lost 14-10 to the Broncos when we started Elvis Grbac for his first game in months after Rich Gannon had played all season, including a win against the Broncos that November.  Tony Gonzalez was a rookie and dropped a key pass late in the game, too.

* 2003, the no punt game.  #2 seed in the playoffs, lost by 7 to Peyton Manning.  Neither team punted the entire game.

* 2013, led the Colts 38-10 on the road.  Lost 45-44.  

* 2016, lost to the Steelers 18-16 in a game where we scored 2 touchdowns and they scored zero.  Boswell set a record with 6 made FGs in a playoff game.  We actually tied the game late on a 2pt conversion, but it was called back for a penalty and we couldn't convert the second time.

Hill fucked up in college.  He took responsibility and plead guilty.  He got kicked out of school, lost his track and football scholarships, went to counseling.  He convinced a different school to take a chance on him because he was working on himself and getting better.  All of this happened prior to his involvement with the NFL, with no guarantee he'd have the chance to get drafted, but Andy Reid likes second chance guys, so he did.  He repaired the relationship with his GF, to the point that they were living together and had another kid.

[This](https://arrowheadaddict.com/2020/04/29/lessons-learned-media-coverage-tyreek-hill/) is a good article discussing the second incident with his kid's broken arm, and how dirty the DA and press did him.  TL;DR, the GF admitted to abuse, did not cooperate with the NFL investigation, and the local news station edited an 11 minute recording down to 2 minutes to make Hill look guilty.  

Deshaun Watson is accused of sexually assaulting ~20 women, planning the assaults ahead of time, selecting victims to fit his preferred profile.  If true, this wasn't a one-off bad decision in the heat of the moment, he is a predator in every sense of the word.  

Lastly, a Christian is not supposed to be judging anyone, as only God has the ability to judge the heart of a man.  A Christian should not be condemning anyone for their actions, given that all sin is equal in the eyes of God and every person is a sinner.  A Christian should be happy to see someone that had repented from past actions and moved on in a better direction for their lives.

55296,389735,389735,thelovebat,"From my initial impressions, here's what I thought of the game and how our players looked.

* The offense will be great again this year even without Tyreek Hill.

* Age hasn't caught up to Kelce, looks like he's still going to be a stud this year.  Yeah he's lost a step or so compared to his younger seasons here but he's definitely still elite.

* Being 3 deep at RB with Edwards-Helaire, McKinnon, and Pacheko will be great to have.

* Skyy Moore should be higher on the depth chart.  His hands are great, route running is nice for a rookie.  l
Let Mahomes get him the ball with those 1 on 1 matchups in preseason so he can show what he can do.

* We have good depth at wide receiver and cornerback.

* Allegretti is still good, our depth on the o-line is pretty bad outside of him.

* If we suffer injuries at offensive tackle, we could be in trouble.  We'd probably move Thuney to left or right tackle if that happened, but with how strong our interior 3 are looking on the o-line I bet they wouldn't be thrilled about that.

* Our young secondary players were playing hard and not making it easy on the Bears 1st and 2nd string players to move the ball.

* Our linebackers are flowing to the ball so bloody fast with this squad.  Hopefully Leo Chenal comes along nicely as he has all the athletic ability in the world to run down ball carriers and blitz through o-lineman.

* Our d-line has some good competition going, hopefully it leads to an excellent rotation of healthy pass rushers this year.

* Our 1st round picks look as good as advertised.  Karlaftis got some pressures and the sack, McDuffie was locking things down and nothing really came his way.

* Darian Kinnard doesn't look like he's coming along well, and he is not a great athlete either compared to most o-lineman.  Being 3rd string on the o-line and not putting on a good performance against 3rd string defensive lineman is a bad sign for someone that was supposed to be ready out of the gate with their physicality and skillset.

* Didn't notice Bryan Cook making any plays, but it's hard to see what safeties are doing from the broadcast view.

* Corey Coleman has some wheels to him as a return man, sadly I don't think there's any room on our roster to be making the team as solely a return man.

* I love that Josh Gordon has worked hard to get back into football and compete while cleaning up his life off the field.  But he's not going to make this team with the concentration drops and just not doing as well as the other fringe guys like Justin Watson and Daurice Fountain

* I'll be curious to see if Jody Fortson sees any preseason action and if he's able to make the roster this year as a big body receiver.

* Our 3rd string players looked bad with a couple of them being mediocre or to be determined.  Dustin Crum's o-line was content to let him get knocked around all game.

* Ronald Jones was thoroughly outplayed by our top 3 RBs.  Whiffed on a block, stuffed in the holes, did not impact the passing game at all.  I'm betting we cut him.

* Speaking of RBs, Derrick Gore's stock definitely went down.  Even not including his fumble, he was having a bad game and dropped multiple passes.  He could still redeem himself, but his chances don't look so good now.  A shame, he showed he could be a decent depth RB last year but with Pacheko on the team Gore isn't getting a roster spot IMO.",16.0,kansascitychiefs,t3_wnnf0x,False,0.0,"Pat ""Kermit"" Mahomes",2022-08-13T19:04:19Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0072030966460437

Also with the Bengals they have to play a first place schedule now. On their schedule is their divisional opponents, KC, TEN, BUF, NE, MIA, TB, NO, and DAL. There’s a lot of games in there that they could end up losing.

In this take, I’m assuming that we draft a guy in the first 2 rounds that can be a day 1 starter.

If we try to run the same offense we have been the last few years and try to plug MVS or a rookie in the Tyreek role, it will fail. But luckily, Andy Reid is no dummy and will have a pretty new offensive game plan. The rest of the AFC has been bulking up to stop the offense that we’ve seen for the last 4 years. And over the years we’ve seen the better teams start to catch up to what we tried doing on offense. Without Tyreek, it’s going to force us to be a different offense. Which is a different offense for opposing teams to prepare for. I think that plays in our favor.

Teams will be less protective of the deep ball shots as they won’t respect MVS the same way as a Tyreek deep shot. The primary defensive focus will be on Kelce, which could open us up for more deep plays than we’ve seen the last 2 years. You have to be aware of the deep ball if you’re playing against Pat, but without Tyreek teams may be less focused on eliminating that portion of our game and instead focus on taking Kelce out of games.

And also, let’s say we take Christian Watson just for the sake of argument. Is a Juju, MVS, Hardman, and Watson WR room better or worse than Tyreek, Mecole, DRob, Pringle WR room?

Will it be better, worse, or the same? Who knows. It’s gonna be different though.

It’s also setting us up to have another wide open window in the AFC in a couple years.

I hate losing Tyreek, replacing him will be a huge challenge for the front office and coaching staff. But we still have Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid, Travis Kelce, and a great offensive line. I have faith that the offense shouldn’t drop too far in quality.

But it’s also difficult for a WR to make 30m a year and still produce at a level that justifies the salary. I’m sure if anyone can, Tyreek would be that guy. But when you already have a QB making elite QB money it’s kinda tough to also have a WR making elite QB money. Especially when I believe in Pat’s ability to succeed with any competent WR group. The draft produces great young WRs every year. Let’s pick one up and let’s roll.

I also think this might be a trend we see often in the next few years. Talented teams like us or the Packers who have undeniably great WRs will have to make that decision on if that WR is worth the amount of money he’s due. I’ll bet a lot of teams opt to do what both us and the Packers did. It’ll be very interesting to see what teams like Cincy and Minnesota do when it comes time to pay Chase and Jefferson. Cincy especially since they’ll be in a very similar situation as us with having to pay a great young QB and try to keep an elite WR.

I guess if I had one complaint I’d say that I wish we would’ve played out this season for one last run with Ty, then tag and trade him like GB did. But even then who knows how much lower the trade value of Tyreek falls after another year of wear and tear passes by.

Sacks allowed are just about as much of a QB stat as they are an OL stat. 

The Bengals had a great run last year. But now they have to play a division championship schedule. Their own division won’t be a cakewalk either. Ravens shouldn’t be as injured, Browns will be better if they play Watson, and Trubisky is a pretty significant upgrade over the corpse of Big Ben.

The Bengals are a team that screams out regression to me and I don’t see anyone else saying this. Coming off a loss in the Super Bowl is always a sign that regression may follow with SB Hangovers. Especially for a team that came out of nowhere and had a lot of things break their way to get them in the Super Bowl.

Now they won’t be a team without any expectations, instead be seen as one of the favorites that get the best shot their opponents can throw at them.

Probably not entirely accurate, just my loose understanding of how the cap can be manipulated with these contract extensions.",1.0,nfl,t3_tdjqzb,False,0.0,:Chiefs: Chiefs,2022-03-13T18:58:25Z,kansascitychiefs,-0.0994596900720164

To improve a RB room you should always look towards the draft or bargain bin veteran free agents. The position is too injury prone and too easily replaceable to invest that kind of draft capital in.

The gap in talent between above average RBs and a lot of the elite guys just isn’t large enough to pay a running back or give up a day 1 or day 2 pick for a CMC.

If we want to raise the talent level of our RB room the best place to look is the middle rounds of the draft.
