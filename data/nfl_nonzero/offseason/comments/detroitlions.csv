In many cases, 4 to 6 weeks of physical therapy will resolve any pain   
and allow an athlete to return to sports. If, however, the pain comes   
back when you resume sports activities, you may need to consider surgery  
 to repair the torn tissues.

&#x200B;

Surgical Treatment

Surgical rehabilitation. Your doctor will develop a   
rehabilitation plan to help you regain strength and endurance. Most   
athletes are able to return to sports 6 to 12 weeks after surgery.

Surgical outcomes. More than 90% of patients who go   
through nonsurgical treatment and then surgery are able to return to   
sports activity. In some patients, the tissues will tear again during   
sports, and the surgical repair will need to be repeated.

Additional surgery. In some cases of sports hernia,   
pain in the inner thigh continues after surgery. Your surgeon may   
recommend an additional surgery, called adductor tenotomy, to address   
this pain. In this procedure, the surgeon cuts the tendon that attaches   
the inner thigh muscles to the pubis. The tendon will heal at a greater   
length, releasing tension and giving the patient a greater range of   
motion.",1.0,detroitlions,t3_w9d7n5,False,0.0,None,2022-07-27T10:56:53Z,detroitlions,0.0461475753701278

If someone gets drafted at 23-24, they should be more polished and ready to contribute (i.e. Kenny Golladay). I also didn’t love what I saw from Levi on tape in college either; his horrendous play in his rookie year didn’t help things. All of this, of course, is exacerbated by his documented pre-draft injury concerns which have, obviously, bled through into his pro career.

Do I hope he turns it around and becomes a healthy and useful player for us? Sure. Seems like a cool kid, too.

Regardless, he profiles much closer to Alvin Kamara who also isn’t a prolific interior runner and does all of his damage in space.

People forget that Swift and Hockenson were our entire offense pre St Brown emergence and pre Goff’s ability to throw a ball 5 yards. Once Hock got banged up and was double/tripled on every play, Swift was asked to carry the entire offensive load himself. It’s tough to catch 7-8 passes per game, run outside 10 or so times, then bang between the tackles another 10-15 times - *especially* when you’re the only offensive threat on the team and every defense knows it.

another one is “he was in matt patricia’s scheme so it’s basically a meaningless year”, totally ignoring that oruwariye flourished regardless because he’s an actual good player 

look - i hope okudah ends up being good, that’d be great for all of us. seems like a good kid, too. that being said, he looks like one of the biggest busts in our franchise’s history and an absolutely cataclysmic use of a prime draft pick. you have the highest drafted CB ever playing horribly his rookie year and then getting hurt early in his sophomore year - what is the fan base supposed to expect or think?",20.0,detroitlions,t3_uhlezh,False,0.0,Spiciest Memelord,2022-05-03T13:05:13Z,detroitlions,-0.0815617798353909
6664,38530,38530,ChefCurrySauce,"Definitely want to start by commending you, Adham. Woodward sports was a great idea and i’ve noticed a continual increase in your guys’ foothold in the Detroit sports talk market. You and the rest of the entire team are doing a fantastic job blending having nuanced takes from being actual dedicated fans with the professionalism and polish of a big network. Have a lot of respect for you guys - keep it up.

As it pertains to the Lions offense in particular, i think that it boils down to Goff’s performance a lot more than anyone wants to admit. Whereas he was sort of hung out to dry last year, he’s in a *fantastic* position this season with:

- a bonafide top 5 OL

- two playmakers at RB with one of whom, Swift, being a legitimate game changer 

- a top 10 TE

- a legitimately good WR room featuring one of the biggest game breakers in football with Jamo (I feel comfortable saying this given that, imo, he’s better than Waddle was coming out and Waddle was awesome with a worse QB), an emerging star and reliable safety valve in St. Brown, and another big bodied deep threat in Chark

- an aggressive coach (Campbell) paired with an innovative play caller (Ben Johnson)

- 0 competition behind him

- a front office who loves him more than his own mother probably does

Don’t forget that our defense will likely be improved as well - they may give the offense more possessions to work with (and better field position) than last year. The sky is truly the limit for this offense and I see NO reason, aside from poor play from Goff, that we cannot win games off the back of this unit alone. Goff will need to stay in rhythm, push the ball down field, have better pocket awareness, and keep himself from getting too rattled … if he does all of that, we’re in business.",43.0,detroitlions,t3_uh254s,False,0.0,Spiciest Memelord,2022-05-02T18:13:42Z,detroitlions,0.0445716598272323

2) the 4.4 estimates are definitely not “too high” - have you watched his tape? the dude is lightning. he has legitimate breakaway speed reminiscent of lamar jackson

10830,62969,62969,DetroitLionsPodcast,"Heya - neither the subreddit or the podcast is affiliated with the Detroit Lions organization. 

**A Little History**

The subreddit was started some 36 million years ago by /u/Hyperbad and grew to about 7,000 - 8,000 users. I (Chris) was an active part of the subreddit, under a different account name, when I approached the moderators about doing a podcast for the subreddit.

There were a number of conversations with the mods and I started the podcast officially on Jun 21, 2015. Since then both the subreddit and the podcast have grown a great deal.

The podcast will often do AMA's with players or notable figures (Jerry Jacobs was one of the most recent, we did one with Den Blandino back after he stepped down as head of officiating for the NFL, and more) and often elaborates on content posted in the subreddit and calls out various users for their submissions (in a good way!). We also go to Senior Bowl every year to report on the players there, Jeff Risdon goes to the Combine additionally to cover what's going on there. We have a yearly listener appreciation party during training camp in the Detroit area, and also so a 24-hour fund raiser show every year to raise money for St. Jude (will reach over $100K total raised this year).  We also cover the first two days of the NFL draft live as well. There's probably more, but its not top of mind right now.

The goal is and always has been to be additive to the community, to help it grow (its+113,000 since we started!) and provide something that didn't exist prior (we're the longest running Lions-centric podcast), and different than what everyone else provides today. Its been a good/symbiotic relationship and one that remains quite strong.",3.0,detroitlions,t3_usrpvy,False,0.0,None,2022-05-19T20:14:12Z,detroitlions,0.0429935623935008

10836,62975,62975,DetroitLionsPodcast,"So, I'll comment on myself here (i.e, I'm Chris) - I am not a purveyor of clickbait or sensationalism. I believe that ones reputation is more important over time than clicks ""right now"". We started this podcast 7 years ago partially in reaction to the stupidity that existed with people begging for clicks to feed their corporate-owned ""we don't pay our staff"" blogs.

As an example, I had the Coach DeLeone departure news almost 5 days before it broke, but the reasoning for his departure made me not report the news because there was no way I was going to put something like that out there. In retrospect, the reason for his ""departure"" was as my source told me originally, but I'm not going to be the one to report it because its just better to be over. Plus, I don't have that kind of lawyer $$ nor do I want to burn sources. There are a number of people who can confirm I had the info before anyone saw it in the media, the rest you have to take my word on it, unfortunately. Our Slack chat gets the inside scoop, they will confirm I was there first, but even they don't know the ""why"".

I knew Ben Johnson was taking the role of OC well before it was reported. I knew he was ""interviewing"" for the job well before that. Those who listen to the podcast know because I said as much.  I also knew that Anthony Lynn was done a week before the first inkling of it broke (Chris Burke reporting via Twitter that Dan Campbell was checking headsets pregame in Pittsburgh). I did not sensationalize any of this, because that's not who we are nor what we strive to be. We started the show as a response to that kind of crap, we aren't it.

There are plenty of other things that I haven't reported. I'm not in the business of ruining people or their lives. Humans are weak, we're built that way, no need to screw them over for a short term selfish gain.

So to the Dorsey thing. I wouldn't have reported it, but a couple things hit me in the moment prior to the start of the show and I put it out there. I also caveated the report that I haven't corroborated it with another source yet, but the source I have is *really* good. I provided reasons why the report didn't make sense as well. I wanted to be balanced in the information I provided, not the kind of thing you see everywhere else. There's more to come here, and the information is pretty specific. We'll see how it plays out. In the end, I'll know a lot more about the quality of my source, and I will fully own if I was incorrect and reported too early.

We'll see how this plays out and people can judge my sources based upon not just what, but how I reported things. As of the moment I post this, I stand behind everything we've reported so far.

17878,98690,98690,I_Am_Not_That_Man,"Moved to Detroit 7 years ago. On 3 different occasions, (2 at Hopcat, and 1 at Sweetwater Tavern) I ordered a Dr. Pepper. And me ordering dr. Pepper was preceded by me first asking “Hey y’all got Dr Pepper?” and the response was a “Yes” each time.

Well golly bum, wouldn’t you know they came and served my ass some root beer. Fuggin ROOT BEER in place of Dr. Pepper. Now I do like me some root beer, I’m a Barq’s man myself, but that shit ain’t even close to Dr Pepper. It’s shocking taking a sip of what you think is gonna be one thing, like a refreshing soda that has its doctorate degree, and it be something completely different.

Each time I was like “Hey, yeah hi, umm… not a big deal or anything, but yeah this is root beer, not Dr. P.” And they deadass say with the conviction of Christ on the cross as the veil was torn and the temple quaked “Oh we were out of Dr Pepper.”

….

… that’s it! No “hey the Dr. is out of the office right now, can I get you something else to drink?”. No “hey we took a wild guess and brought you a root beer cause we’re out of what Pibb Xtra wishes it could be.” No “Here are you’re drinks, oh, and btw sir, that’s rootbeer.” No sir! They leave little ol’ me a-flabbergasted with a “oh we were out so, bend over and look up and stop your whining ya little bitch.” 

It is, APPARENTLY, assumed and accepted up in the north Midwest to substitute muh fuggin Mug Rootbeer in place of the glorious 23 flavors of Dr. Pepper if the latter should so be out.

Goff being the real deal.   
Sheila being a better leader than previous ‘owners’.

One key point I’d like to emphasize that may get a little lost in the acute analysis of the team is how important Sheila and her handling of the organization is.  Sheila’s actions and those of her executive team (Wood, Spielman, etc) influence the long term success or at least reputation of the team (at least getting them out of the NFL basement) in ways coaching and player personnel management can’t - facility improvements, resources available for players their families etc, policies and practices that are set up to protect the players, their health and their interest - these are some examples of high level business decisions that put the rubber to the road in terms of culture change - hard wired or tangible things that can show an obvious standard of quality and care.    

Obviously I know coaching will win the games and Shiela isn’t calling plays or running practice but look at the successful teams in the league and look at their owner relationship.

I believe this is what Deuce was seeing on the TD run. If he stays on the inside hip of the right guard he has that inside lane with a cutback.   
Pretty sure the earlier play was very similar if not the same.

So I'm ok with bombing for a bit to be able to finish strong and still have the 2nd pick. We had a 2nd string center (or was he 3rd). Add that to the additions this year, much more focus on improving the defense. A top wide receiver once healthy. Before the draft I was iffy on Chark. He definitely is a prove it deal. I think he will. But he's been 50/50 so I'm not holding my breath there. But their draft pick at 12 Is something to be excited with.

So far all our signings have seemed realistic. Idk cap and salary so maybe I'm not seeing all the details but I've definitely been satisfied. Not sure what else they might do in free agency and draft but I'm definitely feeling we are on track. Even last year we Easily could have had 2 more wins which is 5 and 10 I believe.

26658,151865,151865,ParticularCanary3130,"Idk about super bowl and winning, but I definitely could see a shot at winning the division and sneaking into the playoffs.  I personally think around 500 is how we will finish. I don't see bears doing that. Vikings could, they had even more games that could easily gone the other way than we did but both have new coaches. If Rodgers stays I feel we are in the hunt for number 2 in the division. If he leaves I say we are in the battle for number one. We have I think 8 games against teams with new head coaches so in theory, weaker teams. So my goal, and depending on how free agency and draft go, is for them to be an 8 win team this year. That to me would be an acceptable step forward and achievable. If they do better Sweet. If less, not so great but not completely the end of the world. Only 8 teams in the NFC were above 500. So that would put us in the upper half of the NFC. Vikings were 8 and 9 so Just under. Nfc north was the only one with 3 teams below 500. (Not including afc since that doesn't affect the playoff chances for us). Saints were the one team above 500 that didn't make the playoffs fyi. Not sure all this compares to past years but at least for the first year of 17 regular season games its an interesting data point to look at. Only 6 of our games next year are against teams that made the playoffs this past year. (Green Bay 2x, Dallas, Philly, Buffalo, and New England)

26660,151867,151867,ParticularCanary3130,I agree. I think he's similar to a Kirk Cousins. He might not be the reason you win but Probably won't be the reason you lose. I'm sure there are things that prove that he's worse or that analog doesn't work. But at least to me he's a mid level qb. And yeah. He's the bridge. Hence why I'd love to get Willis and have him be an understudy for a year or two. But edge rush is a bigger need I feel so next year is better to look for our next qb since it will be a miracle if he's available at 32. If they take him at 2 I'll understand but I do think it's the wrong step. Raise up the talent at all the other spots to above average first and then bring in a talented qb. Just look at the Jags. Terrible year for their rookie. Not how it Should be done if you can help it.

The Detroit Lions announced today that they have signed unrestricted free agent CB Mike Hughes. Contract terms were not disclosed.

Hughes appeared in 17 games (five starts) for the Kansas City Chiefs in 2021, totaling 45 tackles (38 solo), one interception, six pass defenses, four forced fumbles and one fumble returned for a touchdown.

He joined the Chiefs in the 2021 offseason via trade with the Minnesota Vikings. Hughes spent three seasons (2018-20) with the Vikings after the team drafted him in the first round (30th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft out of UCF.

In 41 career games played (12 starts), Hughes has accumulated 122 tackles (102 solo), three interceptions, 19 pass defenses, seven forced fumbles, four fumble recoveries and two defensive touchdowns. He has also returned 21 punts for 185 yards (8.8 avg.) and five kickoffs for 132 yards (26.4 avg.) throughout his career.",54.0,detroitlions,t3_tlfju8,False,0.0,None,2022-03-23T16:25:37Z,detroitlions,7.7994450107671e-06

If the nfl had this policy it would be all on the Browns. If a player is in trouble criminally the justice system will handle it. It's even worse imo if it's civil. The nfl shouldn't care if a player is in civil court. Not even a little.  Two grand juries couldn't even gather enough evidence to bring misdemeanor charges against Watson.  

A good example is Mike Vick. He literally went to prison yet was still suspended for 2 years.  He committed a crime and served his time. No need for a suspension. What he did was Terrible but it had nothing to do with football. 

None of these things has harmed the nfl financially. They've grown monetarily every year.

Regardless here is a comment I made elsewhere. This is simply to point out my personal experience with false criminal accusations. To be clear I've never been accused by anyone of sexual assault. 

A long time ago I was working 2 jobs. One of my jobs was in a warehouse working 10 hours shifts where there are cameras everywhere. Cameras showing me coming into the building, working and eating lunch. Cameras documenting my entire 10 hour shift that I was clearly in the building working. One day after my shift I came home to be arrested and charged with 7 felonies that I couldn't possibly have committed because they occurred while I was at work In this warehouse. The reason I was arrested is because a dirty cop planted evidence. Now just to be clear I had never met this cop. I never had any run ins with him and I was never pulled over by him. I had no knowledge of this man at all. Yet he decided for reasons I still don't know to plant evidence against me, lie in his reports and arrest me. It took several months to clear it up. I had to bond out after 41 days in jail on $250,000 bond. The end result was that my case was dismissed about 6 months after I was arrested. In part because the cop was caught on video lying and planting evidence in my case and in several others. He was arrested and lost his job. He purjured himself in court and got caught planting drugs in several cases on video during traffic stops. 

The bottom line is that people lie for all kinds of crazy reasons. Don't believe everything you hear or read. Just Because someone said something happened doesn't mean it actually did. I was lucky there was video evidence that I couldn't have committed these crimes. I was unlucky that a dirty cop singled me out for no reason. If he hadn't gotten caught I don't know what would've happened. I do know he had zero reason to do it yet he still did.

Also just fyi people who know my name can still look up news articles on my arrest. You can still go to the local jail website and see my mugshot and the details of the alleged crimes I never committed. And ofcourse no news articles were ever printed that my case was dismissed or my mugshot removed. Even the news articles detailing the cops arrest never mentioned me or that I was falsely arrested. 

Separately 

 I think you're underestimating the prevalence of false rape accusations. Studies have been done showing between 6% and 10% of rape accusations are false. 10% is 1 in 10 or 100,000 of every 1,000,000. 

Here is a study from 2001

https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/false-rape-allegations

41% were officially declared false


This tripartite model resulted from the complainants’ own words during recantation and does not constitute conjecture

From Wikipedia 

In a 2010 study of 136 reports of sexual assault investigated by a university police department, 8 (5.9%) were coded as false reports, 61 (44.9%) did not proceed to any prosecution or disciplinary action, 48 (35.3%) were referred for prosecution or disciplinary action, and 19 (13.9%) contained insufficient information to be coded.[1] According to a 2013 book on forensic victimology, the true percentage remains unknown due to the varying definitions of a ""false accusation"".[2]n

DiCanio (1993) states that while researchers and prosecutors do not agree on the exact percentage of cases in which there was sufficient evidence to conclude that allegations were false, they generally agree on a range of 2% to 10%.

According to 4 studies In this article about half of rape allegations are false

https://www.mediaradar.org/research_on_false_rape_allegations.php

Also 

According to the FBI, about 95,000 forcible rapes were reported in 2004. Based on the statements and studies cited above, some 47,000 American men are falsely accused of rape each year. These men are disproportionately African-American.

This last part is just my opinion but I'd certainly argue that among rich famous men that whatever the actual % is among the general public it is certainly higher for rich men because the accuser stands to gain substantial money.",1.0,nfl,t3_umt79h,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2022-05-13T15:38:23Z,detroitlions,0.023573672505792
35085,208755,208755,Therooferking,"[I'll start with this.  #1 I simply poured through 100s articles and copied and pasted what was written. I didn't purposely leave anything out and I didn't add anything. There are 10s of thousands of articles about this.]


I specifically asked you about the second case, so I'll focus on that.

"" We, based on the evidence here, don't have enough evidence to prosecute.""

""We didn’t have a case. And we knew it pretty much from the beginning.”

Yeah, it's incredibly common for there not to be enough evidence to prosecute sexual assault cases, because it's usually just one person's word against another's. 

[This is an important distinction that you're pointing out to me but disregarding for your own opinion. You're taking her for her word but disregarding his. I'm not solely taking him for his word. I'm basing my opinion on his word, her words and 54 other people's including a district attorney and a handful of police officers.]

Two officers were present on scene, but not in an official capacity. They did not witness any criminal activity or inappropriate behavior. 

They weren't in the bathroom with him, which is where the alleged assault happened. Of course they didn't witness it. 

[That is correct they weren't in the bathroom. Based on her statements tho I'd say there is an obvious possibility that neither was Ben roethlisberger. Based on her statements and many others she was clearly very drunk. So drunk that not only did she not know if she had sex she didn't know if she was raped even tho the 1st time she was asked if she was raped she gave a 1 word answer of ""no"" then was asked a 2nd question. I think it's safe to say that even if she did get raped there's a very real possibility it wasn't roethlisberger. We don't know and in her condition she doesn't either. ]

Did he rape you?', and the victim stated 'no.' 

[In the article I copied this from this was the only thing mentioned. Yes I seen other articles with the part you copied aswell.   I also seen other articles that had even more than what you copied.  The full statement is more than what you copied aswell. ]

Yeah, because she was drunk as hell and didn't know what was going on. The full conversation was:

""The police officer asked 'Did he rape you?' And her response was 'No.' Then he asked, 'Did you have sex?' And she said, 'Well, I'm not sure.' ""

And later she did say that they had sex. 

[Also later in a person to person interview with DA Fred Bright, the accuser and her lawyer Mr bright was quoted as saying this ""The alleged victim, made multiple contradictory statements regarding the alleged assault. Including that he did not rape her. "" This meeting was supposedly weeks later and she was obviously not drunk at that time. Out of the 100s of articles I read through  I only found mention of this meeting 2 or 3 times but apparently it did happen.]

It indicted in the report the victim was not being 'straight up' with them.

[This was a separate line from the hospital report. This was a statement from one of the police reports.]

Wrong, Wrong, Wrong. [Lack of DNA in no way means that an assault did not occur. ](https://archive.triblive.com/news/police-roethlisbergers-dna-not-needed-no-evidence-to-compare/)

""Roethlisberger told the officers that he remembered her and he had told her that she was too drunk to be back there,"" the summary said.

""Roethlisberger did not allege any sexual intercourse with the female. Roethlisberger remembered her falling and hitting her head.""

Haha wait, now one of the reasons you think the woman's story is not credible is because Ben said he didn't do it? Yeah, okay. 

[Is his statement any less credible than hers? I'd argue his is more credible because she doesn't really know what actually happened by her own admission.  His statement never changed.]

One officer said the accuser had already changed her story several times.

Because she was drunk. The key detail of the assault taking place never changed. 

[Again her statements and story did change multiple times. His never did. ]

54 people were interviewed during the investigation. Zero of them made statements that they witnessed any sexual assault.

Because. It. Happened. In. The. Bathroom. 

[And again. We don't actually know that it happened or not. You're basing your opinion on very conflicting statements by her, a person who was so intoxicated she doesn't know what actually happened.] 

One interviewee, told police that the accuser repeatedly tried to get the quarterback's attention at a bar earlier in the evening, pinched Mr. Roethlisberger and, along with others in her party, wore a sexually suggestive nametag.

He said the woman asked him if he knew what her ""DTF"" nametag meant. She said it was a crude acronym for wanting to have sex.

[This isn't a what's she wearing statement saying she was asking for it. It's simply a copy and pasted qoute from a police report that the accuser spoke these words. She asked this man if he knew what DTF meant and then told him what it meant. It means Down to fuck. Regardless of whatever did or didn't happen it clearly suggests her state of mind. I mean would you tell a woman you were down to fuck if you didn't actually want to fuck. 

The world seems to have this opinion that only men want to have sex. The reality is simply that women also want to have sex and they sometimes go above and beyond to get it.  Neither of us know this particular woman or her intentions. For all we know she seaked out a famous person with the intent to have sex with him no matter what. ]

Wow, I never thought I'd actually encounter a ""but what was she wearing"" argument in real life, but here we are I guess.

""The alleged victim, made multiple contradictory statements regarding the alleged assault. Including that he did not rape her. ""

54 people plus Roethlisberger made statements and none of them witnessed or stated a sexual assault occurred.  

The 3 people who made statements for her also didn't witness any sexual assault. 

You're basing your opinion on 1 statement versus 55 others. 

In the Nevada case I never said a settlement was or was not reached but I don't see how that's relevant in determining if a rape occurred or not. There plenty of statements from 9 people saying it didn't happen. 

Either way in both incidents the accusers made statements contradictory to any criminal activity happening. Both women made statements at one point or another that it didn't happen. McNulty saying she hoped to get pregnant by Roethlisberger and bragging about having sex with him consensually.  The Georgia college student stated she was not raped in a police interview and again in a meeting with the district attorney.

I've made this argument before but here goes again. 

The path that Stafford is on in 3 years would put him at 5th on the all time passing  list. If he plays 5 more seasons he should easily pass Favre and P Manning to become 3rd on the list. Now in my honest opinion if Stafford retired today I think he'd eventually get in the Hof. However, if he plays 3 more seasons I think he's an absolute lock and maybe even 1st ballot now that he has a ring. Pretty much everyone in the all time passing list that is in the top 14 is either in the hof or will definitely be in the hof with 2 notable exceptions being Matt Ryan and Phil rivers. Every other person in the top 14 are in or locks and I think Matt Ryan will almost certainly get in aswell leaving only Rivers whom I think actually has a chance to get in.

35180,209007,209007,Therooferking,"According to Wikipedia 

In a 2010 study of 136 reports of sexual assault investigated by a university police department, 8 (5.9%) were coded as false reports

False accusations of rape are notably used by women in positions of power or privilege against men who are underprivileged, such as White women against African American men in the United States.

Causes

Lies

An accuser may have several motivations to falsely claim they have been raped. There is disagreement on how many different categories these may be put into. Kanin (1994) put them in three: revenge, producing an alibi or to get sympathy/attention.[[9]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#cite_note-Zutter2017-9) Author [Sandra Newman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Newman) listed four categories in 2017.[[10]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#cite_note-Newman-10) According to De Zutter et al. (2017), Kanin's division is inadequate and one should recognise eight distinct categories in total:[[9]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#cite_note-Zutter2017-9)

Material gain: to receive [money](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money), [professional promotion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(rank\)) or other material benefits.

Producing an [alibi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibi): a false allegation is used to cover up other behaviour, such as being late to or absent from an appointment.

[Revenge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge): to retaliate against a disliked person by damaging the reputation, freedom or finances.

[Attention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention): an attempt to receive any kind of attention, positive or negative, by anyone.

[Sympathy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy): a special kind of attention-seeking whereby the complainant tries to improve a personal relationship with a specific individual.

'A disturbed mental state'; this may include false memories (""sexual hallucinations"") or pathologic lying.

Relabeling: consensual sex is relabeled 'rape' to the police, because of its 'disappointing or shameful character'. De Zutter et al. argue that a distinction should be made between some acts during a consensual sexual encounter that a participant did not want or had no desire to engage in but nonetheless gave consent to (e.g., to please their partner) on the one hand, and rape (nonconsensual sex) on the other, but that many lay people and even some scholars do not make this distinction and confuse the two. It is often when accounts of such 'unwanted consensual sex' are told to friends and family that the latter interpret it as rape, and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation.

[Regret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret): after having had consensual sex, a complainant experiences negative feelings such as disgust, shame, and sorrow; when others notice this and ask about the source of these negative feelings, they are prone to view the encounter as rape and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation.  

Estimates of prevelance 

It is extremely difficult to assess the prevalence of false accusations.

DiCanio (1993) states that while researchers and prosecutors do not agree on the exact percentage of cases in which there was sufficient evidence to conclude that allegations were false, they generally agree on a range of 2% to 10%.

From what I can tell 6% is about the rate which it's determined to be false accusations. You realize 6% of a million is 60,000.  Seems a lot more common than you think.",1.0,nfl,t3_tiq5xn,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions,2022-03-20T15:14:08Z,detroitlions,2.720697682800242e-06

It was clear that it was time after the, ""I think I got probably one of the biggest plays in the fourth quarter in the history of the NFL where I think I did a pretty good job,"" everyone who thought Patricia was worth a damn - including me - was absolutely wrong, and it was time to fire his ass. 

All that aside, Matt Patricia *was* fired ¾ of the way through his third season with the Lions. I rank him as #3 or #4 on the list of all-time bad Lions head coaches, but the gap between him and the stuff found in the Millen era is as wide as the solar system, and the Millen era lasted seven years. 

Let me repeat that: **seven years**.  

Every single Lions fan could've broken a mirror in 2001 and it could not have been worse. We were *all* ready to move on from Millen in 2004. By 2005 when he was extended, I can't remember a single Lions fan - even the casuals - who wasn't pissed off. You just cannot compare this era to any other in the history of *professional sports*, let alone with the Lions themselves, in terms of how bad things were or how low morale was. The Lions had yet to be a national punchline prior to this era. Millen solidified them as such to the point where the jokes are still being made this day, and the only thing the average football fan can cite when it comes to our team is, ""oh, didn't they go 0-16 a few years ago?"" 

I think that the majority of people in this sub accept a lack of success as a way of life. Those you see making overly positive takes and posts are trying their best to speak things into existence. At the end of the day, does it really matter? It's not like any of it is going to have an impact on where the team goes. What I will say is this: the difference between what Sheila and even Martha have done thus far is clear when compared to what William Clay Ford would've done. Mayhew would've been there for at least another 2 years. A guy like Patricia would still probably be with the team. Hell, a guy like *Hue Jackson* probably would've been with the team somewhere during that time. I happen to be more positive lately ONLY because I became that way after 2014 and that man kicked the bucket. 

Regardless, this team is still recovering from the stench of the Millen era, and that is not something that can be washed off easily. Many fans are simply noseblind at this point out of necessity. Smelling nothing but shit for decades will do that.",1.0,detroitlions,t3_wvgn0j,False,0.0,90s logo,2022-08-24T09:21:21Z,detroitlions,0.0205949929265515

Hunt didn't have as many yards because Chubb is so productive; this is less of a complimentary thing and more of a Chubb-is-freaking-incredible thing.

36880,218703,218703,Wiggymaster,"Any given Sunday.

The Packers have the best roster in the North on paper. What they don't have are wide receivers that are going to impress too many teams. That isn't to say that they won't burn our secondary, considering, but they're going to be razor thin at wideout considering that the only sure-handed guys on the squad are Lazard and Cobb. 

Cobb is almost certainly going to get hurt at some time this year considering his age. If Lazard can stay healthy he'll be their #1, but it's doubtful he's going to match Adams' production considering he's part of the reason teams weren't blanketing Adams with double/triple coverage in the first place. Those corners will now be on Lazard, and there'll be more of them, especially if Cobb isn't on the field. Watson could perhaps take some of the pressure off as a rookie, but they could have a real problem against teams with good coverage who can stop the run.

Now, how do the Lions measure up? Our D-line is at best unproven. We did a terrible job of stopping the run last year, and our lack of a pass rush put extra pressure on our corners. I think we'll do a better job of both with McNeil in year two and Hutchinson on the team, but there are going to be growing pains. Our secondary is what it is; I think our starting guys are going to be much improved over what we saw last year, all things considered, and on paper they *should* be enough to hinder the Packers' wideouts, but Rodgers is a patient passer and very cerebral when it comes to hitting the guy running the best route, and accurate enough to hit him in stride. It's going to take near perfect play by our CBs to keep the Packers from scoring over 30 on us in Detroit this year, short of Hutchinson & Harris getting 2-3 sacks a piece. 

Defensively, the Packers are going to be tough. They're very solid against the run. Where I think we could see hope is in our receiving corps vs. their corners. We have speed in our wide receiver room that we haven't had in a long time, and it's ahead of what their secondary is going to be practicing against by an order of magnitude. If the O-line can keep Goff in a clean pocket, he should be able to deliver the ball to these guys in chunks, and if one or two of them can get loose they *will* burn the Packers secondary. The key is going to be keeping Goff in a clean pocket, which could be tough against the GB linebacking corps, especially if we can't keep the running game a valid option. It's going to be interesting to see how our starting O-line looks against that Packers D-line in both run-blocking and pass pro. I feel like if we can get things going and keep things going we could score 25-30 points in the first game.

I feel like it'll be a close one against the Packers this year in Detroit, provided our starters start and our guys can play four quarters of football. I'm going to wait until we see more of what this team looks like before I suggest that they could even sniff a victory in Lambeau.",1.0,detroitlions,t3_wvoqxv,False,0.0,90s logo,2022-08-23T11:12:24Z,detroitlions,0.0161180025468578

38915,235116,235116,blue_shadow_,"So, the team has been working from the trenches outward. Luckily on offense, the line just needed to get healthy - which it has. From there, adding on Chark and Williams launches the potential of the offense into orbit. Last season, St. Brown shouldn't have gotten anywhere *near* the receptions he got...but for a while he was the WR1, and it was a pretty steep dropoff to WR2.  Admittedly, Josh Reynolds came in and played well, but Goff's other outlets, the TEs, *also* caught the injury bug for much of the season. 

*If* a majority of the holdovers from last year and the newcomers this years get and stay healthy? Now Goff has the line to protect him, a running game that does its job well enough to not be ignored, and enough weapons outside to have good options - it's a perfect scenario for him to do well with, *and* he has the confidence boost in not having to worry about his job this year. Confidence was what hurt him in LA - once you start to lose your mojo, it's a loooong way back. To his credit, he did very well in the last few games of last season, so it'll be interesting to see how that progresses into this season.

Defensively, the main area the team got better was the line. Where on offense that was largely able to be ignored this offseason in favor of other areas, DE was a position of absolute need - and the Lions picked up both a day one starter and a solid rotational piece who may just push for the opposite starting job this year.

With that, if you give the opposing quarterback all day to throw (and the Lions did), your secondary's going to get torched. The hope is now that that *won't* happen, and that the CBs and Safeties are good enough to get the job done while asking just a bit less of them.

LBs...*this* is the weak spot right now, but from everything I'm reading, it looks like the team is trying to work around them through various scheme alternatives and picking the right player for the right situation.

**Final Notes**

* Why am I this optimistic about the season overall? Great coaching, influx of new, raw talent, and a *very* favorable schedule, by comparison. The talent is there to hit a winning season, I think, and beat the rebuild timeline by a year. Everything would have to go *just* right, however. Cue Chris Berman's line: ""That's why they play the game!""

* Notably, I'm a fan of coaches that show they like to make the hard decisions and trust the team - screw playing not to lose, *play to win*! Gregg Easterbrook, former writer of Tuesday Morning Quarterback for ESPN, had one particular take that I agree with - essentially paraphrased as ""get your ass out there and go for it on 4th down!"" I stated above that the Lions have had several fun games against the Pack at season's end - well, several of those games, where absolutely nothing meant anything, became chances to showcase gadget plays that **never** saw the light of day in mid- or even late-season otherwise. Fans of the Lions last year, however, saw game after game where MCDC went for the 4th down, the fake punt, the surprise onside kick, the flea-flicker...you name it, they tried it throughout the season. In other words, yeah there were trick plays and gambles, but these seem to be simply a regular part of his repertoire, instead of a moldy bag of ""ok, fine...*maybe* we'll take a smidgen of a chance"". The players and the fans both responded well to this, and he actually had a decent success rate. If nothing else, it forces the opposition to plan against them, which means reduced time to plan for everything else.

* Can the wheels fall off again? A 3- or 4-win season is also possible, though I would say unlikely. The Lions, in their first season after a complete overhaul of the coaching staff and suiting up players who would never get a *sniff* of playing time anywhere else, remained competitive in the vast majority of their games. They showed a *ton* of heart throughout, and played well above their ultimate 3-13-1 record. That said, this is still a raw team, and the secondary in particular has the most question marks. I'd put the season floor at 5 wins, and the ceiling at 10 if the team stays absolutely, disgustingly healthy throughout the season. I personally set the O/U at 7.5 wins for the season.

* Wild card (no, not the postseason): Credit to Chris from the Podcast for bringing this up in a couple of recent episodes, but it's the sheer amount of meaningful play the team's rookies had last year. With all the injuries and the lack of clear-cut ""next guys up"", the rookies played an awful lot of ball, much more so than they might otherwise have had. Now they carry that experience into a new season where, instead of having the sophomore year jitters after maybe only playing a handful of snaps, you have mini-veterans who've *been* there before, and can help guide and mold *this* year's newbies. Ultimately, it's more experience and therefore more leadership in the locker room - one can only think that this will be a positive for the team as a whole.

Unless disaster strikes, Detroit should carry some great momentum into the 2023 offseason, where they will face the following questions:

* Did Goff do enough to keep his job? My guess: likely so, but Holmes could always engineer one more great trade to move up from about 16th into the top three or four spots in the 2023 draft.
* What needs replacing on the defense? While the line is likely in a decent spot, there's still likely to be questions in the secondary. This might be the year to make one or two good signings for marquee talent.
* Who had the better season, Hutchinson or Williams? Two highly-touted rookies will be looking to become household names this year, and with Williams being brought on slowly, he may not be able to shine as much as his fellow first-rounder - at first. By season's end though? Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see how these two, and the team as a whole, perform. Go Lions!

**Acknowledgements**

Firstly, thanks for the nfl32 team for the opportunity to write this year. While I was intending to start research early for next year's edition, the schedule opened up enough for me to push for this year's as well. I've been a fan of the game and the team for decades, as mentioned above. However, I never played football myself, even in high school, and I lack enough key knowledge to speak with certainty for specific areas - mostly to do with schemes and various specialties within positions (X-, Y-, Z- receiver, WILL vs MIKE, etc.) My intention is to shore up my level of knowledge for that this coming season and early offseason, so that next year's post can be more fleshed out.

For this year's starters/ position group discussion, I received assists from the following users, among others, in determining starters and schemes. For what I got right in that section, thank them. For anything I got wrong, I take full responsibility. In no particular order:

38927,235132,235132,blue_shadow_,"**Week 11: DET at NYG**

Thibodeaux will have his chance to prove to the Lions that they should have taken him instead of Hutchinson at #2 overall. The problem? Thibs plays for the Giants, and while they had a solid draft, there's still question marks *all* over the place. The team is in transition after dumping their GM, HC, and OC last year, and while they seemed to make solid hiring choices in all of those spots this offseason, well...we saw how well a similar situation ended for the Lions last year.

**The Pick:** Lions, 33-13. Touted as the statement game of the season, this win brings Detroit back to .500 at 5-5 and back into playoff contention. Also, Detroit proves that they did not [choose poorly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubw5N8iVDHI).

**Week 12: BUF at DET (Thanksgiving)**

The Bills won the AFC East last year, and were a [miracle comeback and a coin flip away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1dp2ZKi0cc) from heading to the AFC title game. They figure to maintain ascendancy against their rivals, and this should be a good tool-up for Buffalo as they push into the final third of the season. Following the theme of laying goose eggs in recent seasons in nationally-televised games, the Lions have not played particularly well in the holiday match of late. 

**The Pick:** Bills, 29-17. This year is no different, and the squad is too new to compete with a favorite to make a deep run in the playoffs this year.

**Week 13: JAX at DET**

I don't think Hutchinson will carry the same chip on his shoulder about not being picked at #1 than Thibodeaux will over his snubbing. By all accounts, he was pleased to be selected by the Lions and to work with the coaches here. In addition, Jacksonville is just an absolute mess right now and going nowhere fast.

**The Pick:** Lions, 19-7. A rare dominant defensive performance after their second-longest rest of the season brings Detroit back to even once more...

**Week 14: MIN at DET**

...only to be immediately followed by a tough game against the Vikings. The NFC North second half begins now, and by this point injuries will be the knife's edge on which seasons balance. Detroit has actually done well to beef up their depth overall. This is an eminently winnable game, and should be a close one.

**The Pick:** Vikings, 23-20. History repeats itself, and the Lions lose to yet another walk-off FG.
 
**Week 15: DET at NYJ**

Detroit's home-away-from-home this season will be the Meadowlands, with two trips there to play against both NY teams. The Jets' head coach, Robert Saleh, was actually one of the favorites to take over the Detroit job in the 2021 offseason. Still, the Jets, like the Lions, seem to be in perpetual rebuilding mode, and it's not clear that they've made as much progress this offseason as Detroit has.

**The Pick:** Lions, 19-14. Despite trailing late, the defense claims a much-needed turnover in enemy territory. The offense grabs their first TD of the day, but leave enough time on the clock for the Jets to get one last chance. Luckily, NY can't get the job done and Detroit owns the Meadowlands in 2022. 7-7...can a winning season actually be in reach?

**Week 16: DET at CAR (Saturday)**

The Panthers' 2021 campaign started off very promisingly, then fell off a cliff. The team stood at 5-5 before they took seven straight Ls to finish the season. Carolina recently traded for Baker Mayfield, but Sam Darnold carries over from last season, and they also drafted Matt Corral. Note on Sam Darnold - his first ever pass in his first ever NFL game was against the Lions, and it [went for a pick-six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqqqo2HhREQ). That was the last moment of true hope for the Lions in the Quinntricia era, as the Jets promptly stormed back to demolish Detroit in Patricia's HC debut.

**The Pick:** Panthers, 22-17. The Lions get caught looking ahead to the Bears, and subsequently stumble against Carolina in a tough-to-stomach loss.

**Week 17: CHI at DET**

Games this late in the season are tests of depth vs depth, and the Bears have none right now. In addition, the Lions get an extra day of rest.

**The Pick:** Lions, 26-23. Facing a ten point deficit at the half, Goff finds a new gear and engineers four scoring drives, including the game-winning field goal late in the 4th.

**Week 18: DET at GB**

The Lions have had great, fun games against the Packers in the final week of the season in recent years, but before that there were some absolutely *horrible* games. Much of how this game will play out depends on where the Pack sits in the playoff hunt. With only the #1 seed picking up a first-round bye now, instead of #1 and #2, there's every possibility a good-but-not-great Green Bay decides to rest its starters. Again. 

**The Pick:** Packers, 31-23. Yeah, that doesn't happen. Instead, the Packers and the Buccaneers are neck-and-neck for the top seed, and Green Bay comes out swinging. One can only hope for further addendums to [this](https://www.thedrawplay.com/comic/a-decade-of-packers-playoff-pain-addendum/) in the playoffs.

___

**Season End:** The Lions finish out at 8-9, missing out on the post-season but finishing out slightly above where most pundits place them. In the process (by the score predictions here), they end up with the following season stats, compared to last year:

|SEASON|W|L|T||DIV W|DIV L|DIV T||PF|PA||PPG F|PPG A|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|2022|8|9|0||2|4|0||382|377||22.47|22.18|
|2021|3|13|1||2|4|0||325|467||19.12|27.47|

The point totals here seem about right for this team; nothing that will be league leading, but absolutely better than last year. The key will be the division games. The Lions *need* to figure out how to get past Minnesota, and they *need* to figure out how to beat Green Bay, particularly in midseason. If they can do that? Hell, sky's the limit.",8.0,nfl,t3_wd7ofo,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions :Lions: Lions,2022-07-31T23:03:02Z,detroitlions,-0.0123781805370707
38928,235133,235133,blue_shadow_,"###Schedule Predictions

Before getting into the game-by-game predictions, let's first talk about the overall schedule. The Lions finished 4th last year. Therefore, in addition to the division's rotational opponents against the entire AFC East and NFC East, Detroit will also face JAX, CAR, and SEA. Overall, the team plays the pre-season 5th-easiest schedule, [according to Pride of Detroit](https://www.prideofdetroit.com/2022/5/16/23074677/2022-nfl-strength-of-schedule-detroit-lions-easiest-several-metrics-vegas-win-total). They also have the second fewest travel miles, and the only exceptions to the Sunday 1pm EST start times are Weeks 12 (Thanksgiving) and 16 (Saturday @ 1pm).

This schedule, while it appears to be a slap in the face to the team due to lack of primetime games, has honestly come as a bit of relief for some fans. Detroit has typically not enjoyed its MNF outings, to say the least, and Sunday night games have also proved troublesome. MCDC has also showed support for the schedule, as it allows the team and the staff to have a steady routine throughout the year.

The bye comes too early in the season for many fans; at Week 6, it's the earliest a bye could be scheduled, and it's not the first time the Lions have dealt with an early bye in recent years. Finally, due to Arizona's 2nd place divisional finish last year, this will be that rare season that the Lions do *not* play the Cardinals in the regular season.

**Week 1: PHI at DET**

The Eagles are always a weird opponent for the Lions (see: Snow Game from a few years back). They [absolutely dominated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXl_zjfamQA) last year in Philly, and their win kickstarted a second half of the season that saw them go from 2-5 to 9-8 and a postseason berth. They only had five picks in this year's draft, shoring up DT and C first before pulling in Nakobe Dean, who many had thought would end up being a Lions late-1st or early 2nd round pick. 

**The Pick:** Eagles, 26-17. It's going to take a few games for the raw talent the Lions have acquired to come together. However, they make a much better game of it this year than last.

**Week 2: WSH at DET**

Detroit knocks its hosting duties for the NFC East out in the first two weeks of the season. The Commanders (really, Washington? That's the best y'all could come up with? Even just keeping ""Washington Football Team"" would have been better...) stumbled to a 7-10 finish in 2021. They reached for Dotson at WR in the draft, then picked up Howell at QB in the 3rd round. 

**The Pick:** Lions, 27-16. Washington just didn't have a great offense last season, and it doesn't appear to have improved during the offseason much, if at all.

**Week 3: DET at MIN**

The Battle for King in the North begins with a road trip to the always-problematic Vikings. *Both* of the Minnesota games last season were memorable, albeit for vastly different reasons. First, the Vikes [ruined the Lions' chances at winning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnlYhdVceBA) with a FG in the closing seconds of Week 5. In revenge, the game-winning dart from Goff to St. Brown as time expired in Week 13 provided the Lions with their [first win of the season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INmy6xX6Qkc), and Goff's immediate run to, and celebration with, MCDC was an instant classic scene. 

**The Pick:** Vikings, 31-24. While the Vikings may have stumbled somewhat by making not one, but *two* draft trades with division rivals, they're still playing at home and still hold at least the #2 spot in the division unless and until the Lions prove otherwise. 

**Week 4: SEA at DET**

The Seahawks finished out at 7-10 last year. Sparty fans may not enjoy seeing last year's hero against the Wolverines, RB Kenneth Walker III, line up on the opposite side, and Seattle also added Charles Cross to their offensive line. However, the departure of Russell Wilson brings significant question to their ability to run a top-shelf offense.

**The Pick:** Lions, 20-16. Seattle will settle for field goals, but a late Goff to Chark strike will give the W to Detroit. 

**Week 5: DET at NE**

At least the Lions don't have to play Tom Brady. The intrigue here will be off the charts. Both Quinn and Patricia originally came to Detroit from New England, then promptly started importing Bellechick's castoffs to try and convert the Lions into the Patriots of the Midwest. Spoiler alert: It didn't work. Now Quinn is in Cleveland (a team that, by the way, shelled out *what* for Deshaun Watson this offseason? Oof.) and certified ""defensive genius"" Patricia is back in NE trying to run their... offense? This will be an emotional game for those who were with the team through the Quinntricia era - in particular, Jarrad Davis should be out for blood.

**The Pick:** Lions, 31-20. If someone were to replace NE with any other equivalently-talented and -coached team in this spot, I'd say the Lions were likely to lose. As it is though, I think they ride the revenge train, and head into the bye at 3-2.

**Week 6: BYE WEEK**

**Week 7: DET at DAL**

The Cowboys had two strong sets of games last season, starting 6-1 and finishing at 12-5 before being bounced by the 49ers from the playoffs. They picked up nine players in the draft, including four in the 5th round, a good spot to pull depth from. In addition, they'll be playing at home, where they're much more used to the weird ways the sunlight hits at that field. 

**The Pick:** Cowboys, 33-24. The Lions, while rested, have their return spoiled by a dominant Dallas squad that has zero desire to let another NFC East team (probably Philly, for what it's worth) take their crown. 

**Week 8: MIA at DET**

The Dolphins are, frankly, a mess. Tua Tagovailoa just hasn't been that effective overall, and with Teddy Bridgewater also on the team, it's anyone's guess as to who will be lining up behind center for the Fins. To be fair, Miami *did* come back from a 1-7 start to finish at 9-8 and just miss the playoffs.

**The Pick:** Dolphins 26, Lions 13. Every season, there's always at *least* one game that *feels* like the Lions should do well in, then fall completely flat. This is that game for Detroit, and the game that will drive out the last bit of ""are the Lions actually a postseason contender?"" talk after their 3-2 start.

**Week 9: GB at DET**

Aaron. Bloody. Rodgers. Just go ahead and *retire* already, will you? As long as this man is helming the Packers, this will always be a tough game for the Lions. In particular, mid-season DET vs GB games usually seem to come down to egregiously horrible calls by the refs (examples: [phantom facemask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob579O8yQHM) leading to Hail Mary and [multiple incorrect ""hands to the face"" calls on Trey Flowers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J8jHKco9h8), who, up to that point had *never* been flagged for that).

**The Pick:** Packers 34, Lions 28. The Lions can, and has, beat the Pack at season end, but not mid-season. It's just not in the script (and there's more than a few Lions fans that mean that literally) that gets written for what *may* (hopefully) be Rodgers' last season.

**Week 10: DET at CHI**

Da' Bears. It'll take ten weeks for the Lions to finally face all three of their division rivals. Chicago has been quickly turning into a dumpster fire of a team (interestingly here, go see how many *other* Offseason Review writers said the exact same thing about the Bears. Vastly amusing.) Justin Fields could become a great QB, but needs much more support to turn that corner. It'll be interesting to see where he goes at the end of his rookie contract. In the meantime, oddly enough the *Bears* of all three teams in the NFC North have had the most success in the last few years against the Lions.

**The Pick:** Lions, 24-13. As much as the Bears have had the Lions' number, Detroit will be hungry for their first win after the bye, and why not load their plate up with Bear meat?",9.0,nfl,t3_wd7ofo,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions :Lions: Lions,2022-07-31T23:02:41Z,detroitlions,0.0083317454099076

**Note**: [Projected PUP List](https://lionswire.usatoday.com/2022/06/21/nfl-pup-list-change-2022-detroit-lions-jameson-williams-romeo-okwara/) from late June:

* TE Derrick Deese Jr. (UDFA rookie)
* S DeShon Elliott
* CB Jerry Jacobs
* TE James Mitchell (fifth-round rookie)
* CB Jeff Okudah
* DE Romeo Okwara
* WR Jameson Williams (first-round rookie)

Of course, any of these may end up cleared to play at the start of the season, but just keep it in mind when reading below. Also, the minimum numbers of games for players to be off-roster while in PUP status is now 4 games, not 6 as of this season. In any case, as long as players come off the PUP (Physically Unable to Play) or NFI (Non-Football Injury) prior to the end of the preseason, they'll be able to play in Game 1. If they go beyond that? Wait four games, do not pass Go.

Finally, if there are a few players who end up on the PUP list, that does mean that a number of other players who might not be able to get onto the season-start roster will have a chance to get meaningful playing time as opposed to heading straight for the waiver wire/ practice squad.

|Position|Player|
|:--:|--|
|QB|Jared Goff|
* No surprise here. Goff has been confirmed and reconfirmed the starter, and he's going to have every opportunity to work on regaining confidence and showcasing his ability. This is the season for Goff, even if the Lions don't do well overall, to prove what he has.

* What happens if Goff goes down? Throw in Blough or Boyle, doesn't matter really which, and prepare for a high pick in the 2023 draft, plain and simple. The QB talent for next year's cellar-dwellers appears to be a decent crop, and much better than this year's options. I suspect that the coaching staff would still try to be competitive and give players meaningful reps, but the chances of either of the backups being truly productive on the field is minimal, at best.

|||
|--|--|
|RB|D'Andre Swift|
||Jamaal Williams|
|FB|Jason Cabinda|

* Detroit has a RB-by-Committee philosophy, which worked well last year, especially given the high number of injuries the position has historically ended up with on the team. No reason for it to change this season; the run game just needs to be good enough, not great, to keep defenses honest and open up the passing game.

* Cabinda has referred to himself as a ""[Swiss Army Knife](https://lionswire.usatoday.com/2022/03/29/jason-cabinda-detroit-lions-position-explanation-superback-fullback-interview/)"" coming out of the backfield, and signed an extension through 2023.

|||
|--|--|
|TE|TJ Hockenson|
||Garrett Griffin|

* Hockenson is a bruising mauler of a tight end who loves to get physical with the defense. His absence was felt last year after injury sidelined him for the season, and it's a safe bet that he's eager to get back out there and punish the opposition. In particular, this is the season for him to prove that picking him in the first round was the right call.
* Griffin is primarily a blocking TE, and has experience with MCDC from the Saints.
* The depth behind these two is still being worked out in training camp.

|||
|--|--|
|WR|DJ Chark|
||Josh Reynolds|
||Amon-Ra St. Brown|
||Jameson Williams|

* This is a room that has been transformed inside of a year. As soon as Williams returns from injury, he's going to be thrown right in the mix. Opposing defenses should worry if the WR corps stays healthy into Week 7, as trying to lock down this set of receivers is going to seem like playing whack-a-mole.
* Quintez Cephus is not listed as a likely starter, but he'll battle with Reynolds for the spot. Expect to see him on the field frequently, regardless of true ""starter"" status.

|||
|--|--|
|LT|Taylor Decker|
|LG|Jonah Jackson|
|C|Frank Ragnow|
|RG|Halapoulivaati Vaitai|
|RT|Penei Sewell|

* Everyone on this line returns from last year, though a couple dealt with injuries (yeah, it was a bad year for those). The team has spent multiple high draft picks over several years building this line, in part because previous iterations were leaky as sieves, leading to quite a few unnecessary injuries for Stafford. Now the Lions get a chance to reap the rewards of that investment, and the OL stands to give Goff as much protection as he needs. *If* (because that word needs to be said, here) the line can stay reasonably healthy, the talent is there to make things happen, both in pass protection and the running game.

|||
|--|--|
|DE|Aidan Hutchinson|
||Romeo Okwara|
||Charles Harris|
|DT|Michael Brockers|
||Alim McNeill|
|LB|Alex Anzalone|
||Julian Okwara|
||Derrick Barnes|
||James Houston|

* R. Okwara's position is not guaranteed, here. it's entirely possible that Paschal shows well in training camp, enough to earn the starting nod. Otherwise, the addition of Hutchinson and Paschal, even if just in relief, raises the potential for this DL immensely from last year's plodding beast. 
* Linebackers are a fluid bunch, right now. The entire position group, both OLB and ILB, was considered mildly suspect after last year. They did bring back Davis and draft two other project LBs, to be fair. However, as mentioned before, the league seems to be devaluing the position as a whole, so it makes sense for the team to cheap out on talent here and conserve funds for other positions of need. None of the four listed here should be considered firm; any of the offseason addons could impress enough to make the starting squad. (Training camp update: There *still* doesn't seem to be a great shakeout yet as to who's going where.)

|||
|--|--|
|CB|Amani Oruwariye|
||Mike Hughes|
||AJ Parker|
||Will Harris|
||Jeff Okudah|
|S|Tracy Walker III|
||Deshon Elliot|
||Ifeatu Melifonwu|

* As mentioned above, the defense should start from a base 4-3 setup. However, on passing downs, expect the team to switch out to 4-1-6 or 4-2-5 as needed.  Accordingly, this backfield will be in serious flux. The top talent here is more firm than at LB (Oruwariye, Walker, Elliot post-PUP), but the rest is made up of more flexible players who can sub in and out as needed for whatever the situation calls for. There are also a couple of players who, while not great at any one position, have experience playing multiple different roles. This could potentially allow the Lions to disguise their scheme more than they might otherwise.

|||
|--|--|
|K|Riley Patterson|
|P|Jack Fox|

* The battle for Kicker is absolutely up in the air during training camp. **Riley Patterson** did well after playing the final seven games of 2021, going 13/14 in FGs (missing his only 50+yd attempt) and 16/16 in PATs. **Austin Seibert** also played in six games, going 10/12 and 5/5, respectively, so there's a chance he could win the job. There's also every possibility the team brings on competition, as well. Just throw a big giant question mark in this spot - you pays your money, you takes your chance.

* Punter, however, is locked down by **Jack Fox**. Overall, and for whatever reason, the Lions have suffered in season after season but almost always have some pretty good kicking legs, and Fox is no exception.

|KR|Godwin Igwebuike|
|PR|Kalif Raymond|

* This is also a position group that's actively being battled in training camp; neither of these spots are at *all* assured. Expect to see some churn here during preseason games.",6.0,nfl,t3_wd7ofo,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions :Lions: Lions,2022-07-31T23:02:22Z,detroitlions,0.0001350155436904
38930,235135,235135,blue_shadow_,"###Other Offseason News

**1)** This off-season was a clinic in messaging and leadership from the Lions' front office. Ever since the end of last season, the Lions as an organization, as well as Holmes and MCDC individually, stated their trust in Jared Goff to be the team's QB over this upcoming season.

Of course, we've all seen statements like that quickly get undermined by the addition of a free agent QB or a high draft pick; the latter with some vague statement about ""learning from a mentor"" that quickly becomes a starting role by Week 2 or 3. 

Not the case here. It could be argued that the backup QBs are actually more in need of replacing and upgrading. No one would have batted an eye if, say, Corral or Howell had been picked up and publicly stated to be a replacement for either **David Blough** or **Tim Boyle**, neither of whom have proved even remotely as effective as Goff in relief. Admittedly, it would have sparked more controversy over Goff's future with the team, specifically in the short term.

Instead, the Lions showed solid follow-through on their words by their actions. They did *not* draft or sign even a replacement *backup* QB, let alone a potential starter. Quite the opposite, in fact. The team orchestrated a major trade to move up 20 spots and snag an instant playmaker, and signed another veteran WR to provide additional weapons to the offense. The OL was already in a good place, after years of adding upgrades via draft, and the RB room was already (finally) where it needed to be as well. 

In other words, the team is showing its support for Goff both directly and indirectly. Contrast the Lions' action with those of the Packers, for instance, who famously drafted Jordan Love a few years ago with their #1 pick and let Davante Adams, their WR1 last year, walk without having a plan to replace him this offseason. To put it mildly, Aaron Rodgers did not approve of either move. ^I ^weep ^for ^him.

Goff has no excuses, now. He either performs at or above the level he played during the last few games of last season, or he's going to end up gone.

**2)** The Lions have been a perennial contender for HBO's *Hard Knocks* series, which follows one team through the trials and tribulations of a full NFL season. While other teams have had their turns in the limelight, the Lions have done better defending against being on HBO than it has opponents on the field for years.

However, the clock ran out on their ability to avoid it (in fact, the Lions *volunteered* for it this year), and this year HBO's cameras will be everywhere. The team does have the final say on what information is released, thankfully, and fans of the team will get a much more in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at what goes into making a team function. MCDC figures to be a gold mine of quotable quotes, and with the identity of the team rapidly returning to its Black-and Blue roots, this should be an extremely entertaining show to watch this year.

Also, the same day the Hard Knocks announcement was held? The NFL  *also* announced that Detroit would host the 2024 NFL Draft. Hmm.

**3)** A moment of silence for William White, DB for the Lions in the late 80s/ early 90s, who [passed away from ALS](https://lionswire.usatoday.com/2022/07/29/former-lions-db-william-white-has-passed-away-from-als/) in late July at the age of 56. 

**4)** Overall, the rest of the offseason was relatively quiet. Few personnel moves, few coaching moves, and no major team drama. Even the years-old cold war between the team and Calvin Johnson appears to be thawing, at least somewhat. Simply put, the team focused all of its energy into building off the success it found at the end of last season, and making significant strides forward this year.",13.0,nfl,t3_wd7ofo,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions :Lions: Lions,2022-07-31T23:02:00Z,detroitlions,0.0267244033431903
38931,235136,235136,blue_shadow_,"**GRADES**

Info for this section is primarily sourced from [captainbluelionslinks](http://captainbluelionslinks.blogspot.com/?m=1), a bare bones aggregator of a *ton* of team news that doesn't get anywhere near the credit or attention it deserves. The grades listed here are summaries from the various reports pulled by the blog from across the media universe. Also, the number of outlets reporting grades dropped considerably as the draft proceeded. Note: These grades are *not* mine - I don't think my opinion of players who I've never seen play a single down of college ball is worth asking.

**Aidan Hutchinson** - DE

* Grades: 8 As, 4 Bs, 1 C
* Pick Notes: Hutchinson is a lock to make the team and start from day one. As stated above, the defense needed a *serious* overhaul, and this selection was a major step forward for the process. He instantly provides a threat to the opposing quarterback, coming off of a season where he set Michigan's single-season sack record with 14. The Lions are [anticipated to base their defense in 4-3](https://www.detroitlions.com/news/o-hara-lions-linebackers-a-fan-of-updated-defensive-scheme), in part due to the presence of Hutchinson to allow more of an attacking scheme, so he'll be expected to establish his presence early and often. 

**Jameson Williams** - WR

* Grades: 6 As, 6 Bs, 1 C
* Pick Notes: Williams is, admittedly, a bit of a risk after an ACL injury against Georgia. However, as [Jeff Risdon](https://lionswire.usatoday.com/author/jeffr1sdon/), writer for *LionsWire* at USAToday, has stated on several broadcasts with Chris (/u/detroitlionspodcast - unsolicited plug: go watch/ listen to the show!), ACL injuries are no longer the death knells for careers that they were even a decade ago. Sports medicine has advanced enough that Williams is expected to make a full recovery. This is absolutely great news for the Lions. He may be delayed in getting onto the field, especially if he starts the season on the PUP list, but at worst he should be on the field after the team's Week 6 bye. Like DE, WR was a bit of a train wreck most of the season. While **Amon-Ra St. Brown** lit up the field as the season progressed, injuries to other expected starters pushed relative unknowns into play, contributing to the overall lack of offensive production during most of the season. The addition of Williams, along with Chark, instantly improves the WR room by orders of magnitude overall. As it happens, for the Lions, the injury to Williams' ACL and his subsequent drop to #12 means that, quite possibly, the team *somehow* managed to pick up both the best offensive *and* the best defensive player in the draft - and most importantly, *didn't* mortgage their future to do so.

^^As ^^a ^^long-time ^^fan ^^of ^^the ^^team, ^^that ^^last ^^sentence ^^was ^^completely ^^bizarre ^^to ^^write...

**Josh Paschal** - DE

* Grades: 7 Bs, 2 Cs, 1 D
* Pick Notes: For fans who were clamoring for an upgraded defensive line, they got all they asked for and more when Holmes and MCDC double-dipped on DE by picking up Paschal. He is absolutely a fighter, both on the field and off, and was a natural leader at Kentucky. The defensive line now has no excuses to not be able to get to the QB. Over and over again, both Holmes and MCDC have pushed the idea that they want players who are tough, gritty, determined, and focused - kneecap-biters, to use MCDC's parlance - and Paschal fits that mold to a T. Some analysts did consider him to be a 3rd round pick, hence the poor grades, but given the relative and quickly increasing value of DEs overall and the run on second-tier talent above his selection, it's no surprise that the Lions didn't waste the chance to snag him. He may not be a day one starter, but he'll feature in heavy rotation.

**Kerby Joseph** - S

* Grades: 1 A, 5 Bs, 3 Cs
* Pick Notes: It's not stretching a point to say that there were few, if any, bright spots for the Lions' defense last year, so here's an additional pick to shore up the secondary and add depth. Joseph made significant on-field strides over his final collegiate season, improving his allowed QB passer rating from a previous best of 103.5 to 66.4 and picking up five INTs. Most likely not an immediate starter, but figures to be on the field a fair bit while he learns his craft.

**James Mitchell** - TE

* Grades: 1 A, 2 Bs, 1 C
* Pick Notes: Mitchell provides another potential addition to the passing game and another target for Goff. This was a depth pick, and he'll work behind the Lions' #1 pick from two years ago, TJ Hockenson. Mitchell, like Hockenson, suffered from injury in 2021, so he will need to push to come up to speed this year to learn his role in the NFL. He's also not adverse to blocking, unlike some other tight ends *cough*Ebron*cough*.

**Malcolm Rodriguez** - LB

* Grades: 3 As, 1 B
* Pick Notes: Coming from the Big 12, decidedly *not* a league known for defense, Rodriguez had an extremely high number of tackles not just for OK St or the Big 12, but FBS as a whole over his college career. He figures to be a natural for special teams and to see decent playing time on defense as off-ball LB. He also has experience as Safety, and therefore provides flexibility in the case of injury or play-specific schemes.

**James Houston** - LB

* Grades: 2 As, 2 Cs
* Pick Notes: Though Jeff Risdon posited a couple of times that the Lions were set with LB prior to the draft (from a team perspective, not the fan perspective), here the Lions snagged their second in as many picks, albeit towards the end of day three. Houston is considered to be an on-ball LB, but comes from a 3-4 background, not really a great fit for the changes the Lions are making. It remains to be seen if he can transition in scheme while simultaneously making the jump to NFL speeds.

**Chase Lucas** - CB

* Grades: 2 As, 2 Bs
* Pick Notes: Cornerback was yet another position that was a patchwork last season. It's somewhat surprising that the position wasn't addressed earlier, but the Lions have picked up a potential rotational slot corner with their final pick of the draft. He's likely to have a slightly more limited career, though, as he's already past his 25th birthday.

**Aidan Hutchinson** and eventual #5 pick **Kayvon Thibodeaux** were neck-and-neck favorites on /r/detroitlions for months before the draft. Both play DE at high levels, an absolute need for the Lions and their defensive ranking of 31st according to [PFF](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/2021.htm). The team combined for 30 sacks, good enough for 30th in the league and just over half of the Steelers' league-best total of 55 sacks for the season.

Shortly before the draft, Trayvon Walker-DE (eventual #1 pick), Kyle Hamilton-S (#14), and Malik Willis-QB (#86) were also tied to the Lions as possible first round pickups. While debate raged for weeks over who the Lions should pick and were picking (two completely different discussions), most understood that the choice would largely depend on who the Jags selected at #1. There was also fan support for a trade down, but the relatively poor quality of this year's QB class meant that there was only an outside chance, at best, of getting enough bang for the buck to pass up on a generational talent at a dire need.

As it turned out, Walker would go on to be selected by the Jaguars at #1, and the Lions [pissed off the league](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2022-nfl-draft-the-nfl-apparently-got-mad-at-the-lions-during-the-first-round-and-it-was-for-this-reason/#:~:text=According%20to%20Peter%20King%20of,a%20Lions%20official%20told%20King.) ([again](https://www.prideofdetroit.com/2022/5/3/23055632/detroit-lions-angered-nfl-again-nfl-draft-picks-too-quickly-aidan-hutchinson)) by taking less than a minute to turn in their selection at #2 for Hutchinson.

The Lions weren't done yet on day 1, however. Originally, the Lions owned picks #32 (via the Rams in the Stafford trade), #34, and #66. Holmes had been working behind the scenes leading up to the draft to move up, and as the selections entered the teens, he made a final phone call with the Vikings to confirm a trade. Those picks were packaged up and sent off to Minnesota in exchange for their #12 and #46 - essentially paying an early second rounder to move up 20 spots *twice*, including once within the first round.

With that complete, and especially as the run on wide receivers had begun, Holmes conducted a quick phone call with Jameson Williams to let him know he'd be coming to Detroit. The trade was widely regarded as an absolute fleecing of the Vikings by the Lions, and thus a new spark of hope was kindled for long-suffering Detroit fans.",45.0,nfl,t3_wd7ofo,False,0.0,:Lions: Lions :Lions: Lions,2022-07-31T23:01:09Z,detroitlions,0.039059999770128

38990,237377,237377,bmgiannotti,">Lastly, I want to reiterate that it’s not prudent to analyze decisions based solely on outcomes.

This seems to be where you're getting most hung up. That isn't what I'm doing. We did not get close to the value that we gave away with this contract. This was not due to some freak injury, he did not perform to the standards for which he was being paid. In retrospect, this was also bad contract. This is not something that I consider to be a controversial statement. Are the variables something Quinn could have accounted for? Let's take a look. 


1. It's no secret that Detroit is not a free agent destination. I think it's fair to say that he did not take any sort of discount, I imagine we were his best offer by a significant enough amount. So right off the bat we have a bit of an uphill climb. 

2. Bob Quinn must have known that Coleman was going to be brought in and asked to play differently than when he was being evaluated. If a guy can play, sometimes that translates. But when you reset the market for someone, that's probably something you should consider.

There's much that can't be accounted for, but I think there was enough there to be concerned from the jump. He was being paid as they player that he had not yet become (the number one slot corner in the NFL) and being asked to play differently than he had before.

Sometimes weird things happen. Things just don't work out. You have a perennial all-pro that you pay big bucks for and they just don't perform. That's not what happened in this case. We reset the market out of desperation or because we're Detroit or whatever and we didn't truly know whether or not his skills would translate to our scheme. It's a bad contract that was justifiable at the time. But it was a bad contract.",0.0,detroitlions,t3_x0d6np,False,0.0,MC⚡DC,2022-08-29T18:02:34Z,detroitlions,-0.0275936477172591
38991,237378,237378,bmgiannotti,">This very clearly implies that I don’t think he should’ve been offered a market value contract

Actually no it does not. Because there's more than one reason to let someone walk. One of those being that we actually could not afford to keep him with the cap constraints we had. 

But I'm guessing that you're smart enough to realize that. And yet you still chose not to answer it directly. If I had to guess it's probably because it creates a bit of a hole in your reasoning. However given your reply here (even though you still chose not to say it explicitly for some reason) I think it's safe to say that you would consider Golladay's current contract bad. 

It's alright, you don't have to play along. I will lay it all out for you anyway so you won't make this mistake moving forward (hopefully). 


Coleman in 2018 was the 10th ranked slot corner(out of 21 qualifying specialists with at least 400 slot snaps) with a grade of 69 per PFF making him in the top 47th percentile at his position. You believe his contract was not bad because of the context that he had performed as a good slot corner at the time. Fine. 

Golladay had great performances in games he played his contract year. Problem is he missed many games due to ""injury"" so it's really not fair to you to use it even though his grade compares closely to the likes of Tyreek Hill and Michael Thomas that year. For that reason I will use the prior year and we can ding him for the ""injury"". He graded slightly higher his contract year. 

Golladay in 2019 was the 18th ranked WR (out of 48 qualifying WRs with at least 90 targets) with a grade of 79.3 per PFF making him in the top 37th percentile at his position.

Not only was Coleman not ""the best"" slot corner in the league, but he was not even as good at his job as Golladay was. 

Now to the contracts:

If signed this year (3 years later) Coleman's contract would put him in the top 3 at his position and frankly in the #1 spot for the specialist that he was/is in per year earnings.

If signed this year (1 year later) Golladay's contract would put him tied for 17th at his position.

I'm failing to see how Coleman's was ""not bad"" and Golladay's is in light of this information.

Maybe you'll say ""it's because Golladay was only good because he had a quarterback that could take advantage of his skills"". That would be a fair point situation does matter after all. Ultimately it would be misguided.

Because the GM brought Golladay into a situation where he wasn't sure he could succeed, that's exactly what Bob Quinn did when he brought in Coleman who went from a zone heavy scheme in Seattle to a man heavy scheme in Detroit.

And finally here is this. You do not judge contracts only on or even predominantly on how they appeared at the time. Not the royal you, I mean you personally. I don't buy it for a second. If Golladay instead of laying an egg had an All-Pro season you would not be insisting it was a bad contract unless you are the most stubborn person on earth. That variance between results is the difference between a bad contract and a great contract and I don't know why you would waste any time at all trying to convince anyone otherwise. 

Unless you have anything substantive to say, I'm happy leaving it at this.

Furthermore seeing how almost none of this reply responds to anything that I actually said I can't believe I wasted any time on you after your initial reply.

That's alright, I'll be a jerk here to make up for it. If you can't follow a basic syllogism then I suggest you enroll in a intro to logic course at your local CC. I'll make it plain for you again and see if you can follow this time. 

You said the Lions having a top ten offense was on the same level. 
1. Lions Superbowl odds are +10000
1. There are no betting odds for who will be a top ten offense. 
2. There are betting odds for who will win 10+ games.
3. 8/10 teams with a top ten offense won 10+ games
4. If the Lions were to win 10+ games it would likely be due to their offense predominantly given that the offense has less of a way to go than their defense does. 

Given all this I think it is reasonable to suggest that the Lions winning 10+ games is in the the same ballpark odds wise as the Lions as the Lions winning ten games. Which of these premises do you disagree with? 

>This is, again, a hypothetical that's not worth entertaining. The Lions aren't going to win 10 games.
 
Imagine missing the point so badly and still being this smug. 

>You're crazy. Jared Goff is not going to play at a top-10 QB level, and the top-10 offensive production numbers for SF and NE were heavily reliant on their top-tier run games, which the Lions are not going to turn in.

Again, imagine missing the point so badly and still being this smug. This is the only other thing I'll reply to here. I simply cannot spend the time under every single bullet point explaining how you missed the mark.  

Jared Goff is not going to play at a top-10 I think is a good prediction. Can he perform in the same ballpark as Mac Jones, Jimmy G and 80% of Russell Wilson? I think that's a fair expectation. To be clear, this is the claim to which you responded and called me crazy. 

All three had pretty good to great run games, yes. All three also had top ten passing games. And if you truly understand DVOA you'll understand that the passing game has a much greater impact than the run game. But play action you'll say. Rushing success does not correlate to play action success.

""but that's ridiculous. The Patriots had studs like Nelson Agholor and Kendrick Bourne."" 

I'm really failing to see how you've convinced yourself of whatever it is your position is at this point in the thread.

Now we're cooking. This is nearly what I've been saying this entire time. As I said previously I do not think it's likely. However... 

>no injuries

Nope not no injuries, just that this core group is much healthier than they were last year. Hockenson missed 5 games, Swift 4 (and was hampered for more, only officially starting 4 games), Goff 3, Decker 8, Ragnow 13, Cephus 12, Chark 13. It is not unreasonable to expect this group to be significantly healthier than it was last year. If they are not then there is almost no chance of a top ten finish. However, if you scroll up you'll notice the original comment to which you replied had the caveat of ""if healthy"". This suggests that either you didn't read it all the way through or you are saying there's no chance of a top ten finish regardless of health. You're welcome to change your position if you'd like, but you should at least admit it. 

>that Ben Johnson will be better this year than he was last year

Ben Johnson who definitely was not OC last year and didn't start getting involved as much in the offense until Campbell took over play calling duties? AKA the same time our offense improved. Let's chalk this one up to a whoopsie on your part. 

>Goff playing at the level he did last year

Not sure if there's supposed to be a ""better"" in there, but I think there's a chance that Goff can perform to the level of some of these other guys at the helm of top 10 offenses like Mac Jones, Jimmy G, and a combination of Geno Smith/post injury Russell Wilson (who save for two games was pretty mediocre. Call me crazy. 

>It is roughly in line with the idea that the Lions ""could"" win the Super Bowl, or that I ""could"" be elected President in 2024. Each of them is sufficiently unlikely that making arguments in support of them is living in a fantasy land.

Actually no. Teams going from bottom ten offenses to top ten offenses happen more often than either of those examples. A lot more. If say the Lions were to win ten games (not a prediction) it would be more probable that were due to the offense than the defense given that all of those top ten offenses had 10+ wins and the state of our defense. We can therefore use wins as an imperfect proxy for the offensive improvement. Well when you look at the odds Lions to win 10+ games is +420 while winning the Super Bowl is +10000. Making the offensive improvement to top ten over 20x more likely than the Superbowl, probably much more so given that our offense has fewer holes than our defense. So no, not in line actually far from it. It's still unlikely, but +420 odds do happen all the time. So fantasy land? That simply doesn't match reality unfortunately. Anyone who has expectations of being a top ten offense has unrealistic optimism. But it's just not crazy to suggest that if a couple things bounce our way that it could happen. 


>The Lions offense will be better. Literally nobody is debating that.

Yup that's not what I'm suggesting here. Simply that you've been saying it can't happen as a statement of fact. Scroll up. That's what you said. Nobody would object if you'd said you find it highly unlikely. Hell, if you'd said it couldn't happen last year you'd have much more sympathy, while still not technically being semantically correct. Last year the offense was in such a poor position that any suggestion of being top ten was such a remote proposition even before the injuries. 

But the offense is in a significantly better position this year and it's reasonable to expect a healthier offense given how many injuries we had and for how long. 


>We will be better. We will not be a top ten offensive team. Those are two different things, and you're conflating arguing for one with arguing for the other and being insulting about it to boot.

No where did this happen. I have been extremely clear and you are unwilling or unable to engage with what I'm actually saying. You find it insulting that I'm questioning your reading comprehension, I find it irritating that I keep having to repeat myself.

So I will make this simple as well. The Lions are likely to improve on offense. They are not likely to be a top ten offense (and zero people in this chain said they were). We agree there.

39030,237483,237483,bmgiannotti,">Neither of those are top ten finishes.

... Do you believe that the Lions cannot be the 10th best offense, but can be the 11th or 12th? 

>It's...not difficult to measure DVOA. It's literally a percentage number. That's part of the reason it's useful.

You're being obtuse either purposefully or due to lack of social skills. Being a percentage is not what makes it useful. DVOA is useful because it combines many different inputs into one overall digestible number and is a designed to be compared to NFL average. However since it's based on several different variables that makes it a little difficult to interpret what it means and measure truly how difficult or easy of a fix there is. 

>The Lions rushed for 400 more yards in 2021 than 2020 and their DVOA went down because the quality of rushing defense that they faced went down. 

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt one more time here and assume you're not intentionally being dishonest and that you really don't know any better. The Lions also rushed the ball 17% more than they did the prior year, this is partly due to there being an entire extra game, partly due to there being an improved run game and partly due to the Lions rushing 3 more times per game. The rushing attempts are relevant because DVOA is measured per play. So if you equal out the rushing attempts and the Lion's total rushing yards improved total by 65 yards for the entire season or 4 yards per game. When the difference between the main variables is that small other less influential variables can have an outsized effect. That is what is happening here. 

>The person I responded to literally said that if D'Andre Swift (and nobody else) stays healthy, the Lions can be a top 10 offense. That seems like they're saying that the Lions are likely to be a top-10 offense next year

This misunderstanding is entirely your fault. Anyone that understands the definition of can/could should not be making this mistake. Can/could statements are only referring to what's possible. I honestly can't believe that you even typed this part out because of your next point. 

>They're wrong. To be a top ten offense, the Lions would need to beat one of the following offenses:

Okay so just immediately going from ""this person is saying it's likely and I disagree"" to ""also people who say it is possible are also wrong"". It's also weird because the evidence you're doesn't support the idea that there's no chance, it supports the idea that it's unlikely. Which it is, and is also not in dispute. 

Check this out. Almost every year, one team in the bottom ten hop into the top ten (last year it was two). I am not going to put money on the Lions being a top ten offense. But you are simply wrong on the fact that it's not in the realm of possibility. The Eagles were a Josh Allen thumb injury away from doing it this past year. 

>I'm disagreeing that it's as simple as increasing total yards by 800 yards as a pre-requisite to become a top-10 offense.

It pretty much is that simple unfortunately only explanation for your confusion is not understanding the methodology behind DVOA. The vast majority of the metric comes from yards. It is yards gained vs the average team in a similar situation. There are some yards that count for more than others, but that is why 

1. You see total yards so highly correlated with DVOA (remember 8/10 teams were in both top tens)
2. You see very small delta (1-2 pts) between unadjusted VOA and total DVOA.

Furthermore, teams who gain more yards typically score more and are more efficient. So you might think that 50yds/gm isn't enough to make up the difference between a bottom 5 and a top 10 offense, you would be wrong almost every single time.

As a matter of fact I will make a bet with you right now. If the Lions gain 50 more yards per game this season and are not a top ten I'll give you $100, and if they do and are you can vemo me $100.  The odds aren't in your favor, but if you're dumb enough to take the bet I'll gladly shake hands on it.",4.0,detroitlions,t3_v8k7el,False,0.0,MC⚡DC,2022-06-09T17:31:34Z,detroitlions,-0.0144290617605104
39031,237484,237484,bmgiannotti,"Two things. 

1. There are two teams that finished 11th and 12th in DVOA this past year that finished 28th and 30th respectively the year prior. So there's certainly precedent and the Eagles were expected to be much worse last year than we are this year. 

2. DVOA is a better barometer, but difficult to measure since so much more than yards goes into it. Lucky for us there's a high degree of correlation between total yards and DVOA. In fact, 8/10 teams are top ten in both.

So if the Lions gain 800 more yards next year (everything else being equal), it's more probable than not that they will be a top ten offense, whether you measure by total yards or DVOA.

Fans often set unrealistic expectations in their heads failing to account for injuries and player regression. Again I have to remind you that this is not what's happening here. Nobody is saying that they will be or are even likely to be top ten. Some believe that the ceiling for this offense is top ten, including the person to whom you replied. 

If you're disagreeing with that than you're asserting that this team with a healthy Goff, Hock, Swift, Chark, Jamo, ARSB, and OLine, with better play calling from the start and more scheme familiarity CANNOT increase their total yards by 800-1000.

>Exaggerated sense of self-importance (calls himself a business mogul, acts with air of superiority)

You'll notice that only one of these is an actual example while the other is a vague generalization. But let's address these individually. 

1. Business Mogul. This probably just due to that comprehension issue I touched on earlier or maybe just poor social skills on your part. There is zero chance that Thibs is confusing himself for an actual mogul in the technical sense. What is far far more likely is that he is using business mogul as a euphemism for entrepreneur, for the simple reason that he's young and it sounds cooler. 

2. Acts with air of superiority. Like I said this isn't an example, but a vague generalization. He is certainly confident, and maybe a little cocky as many athletes are. But you're stating your framing as a matter of fact when it's really just an opinion. 

>Grandiose sense of self is easily threatened (“""there's nothing (a coach) can tell me that I don't already know, and that's because I'm honest with myself and I watch the tape."")

This is the opposite of what what you're saying it is tbh. Which probably means that you're not super well educated about this topic or just the overall comprehension issue (or both). Thibs is saying here that he believes he self scouts so well that a coach will not tell him tell him a flaw that he does not already know about. This is apparent if you watch the full clip. He's probably wrong about that if I'm being honest, but being the type of person who is actively looking for flaws in one's self is not indicative of a self that is easily threatened. It is indicative of the opposite. 



>Relationships only exist to shore up positive self-image (speaks for itself. His interviews recently have been entirely with the intention of image-shaping)

First of all starting with ""speaks for itself"" is hilarious, because it's by far the most ridiculous. But interviews do not equal traditional relationships which you may not be aware of. But in the pre draft process interviews DO serve the purpose of image shaping. Every single prospect is doing this including Aidan Hutchinson. The image that they're trying to shape is that they are someone worth drafting. Really surprised you even listed it.

He is at least an average starter with upside and was better than Goff last year (granted with better weapons, but a far worse OLine).

Jalen Hurts was objectively a solid starter last year. I have concerns about him long-term, but they have nothing to do with his height and everything to do with his arm talent and reads.

This is true. As are all successful quarterbacks. If you're going by the numbers, any QB you draft at any pick you should expect not to be a starter. Unfortunately you can't operate a team that way and you have to take a chance on a guy eventually and hope he can be that guy for you. 

>Comping prospects to Hall of Fame level players is kinda lazy and unnecessary--even if it's a stylistic comp.

I don't think that's a fair characterization of what I'm doing and I really tried to be as clear as possible from the start. 

Malik Willis has all the tools to potentially be Josh Allen in waiting. He could also be Tim Boyle. It's incumbent upon the Lions to make that determination of where on that spectrum we will eventually land. Nobody here I think is confused on his floor or his ceiling. 

If it were up to me, I would not draft Willis at #2. Brad Holmes and John Dorsey however know way more about evaluating prospects than I do.

> While every draft pick is a gamble, they need to try and get a player that can be penciled in as a starter on Day 1 with the #2 pick.

I guess I don't see how this is actually true. The best time to take on high upside developmental prospects is when the team is bad, not when they're good. The most important question the Lions should be asking themselves should be ""Who will be the most impactful player when we're ready to compete.""

>It's easy to discuss the Chiefs taking Mahomes at #10 in the 2017 Draft, but you leave out Trubisky at #2?????

I think it depends on how you viewed Trubisky coming out. I think a fair summary would be Mahomes had a higher ceiling and was a project, but Trubisky was more pro ready and had better college tape.

Let's assume for the sake of argument that they were roughly the same sort of prospect and one of them hit and the other missed. 

I don't find that compelling. There are no sure things, especially not in this draft. Even in that same draft Solomon Thomas was considered widely to be the second best and safest edge prospect and was drafted by a great organization. How did that turn out?

Players don't work out sometimes, but that fact shouldn't stop you from taking a guy that you think you can get the most out of. We will need a QB eventually. Maybe we will get lucky and the draft next year will be even more loaded than it looks right now. But if you think you have your guy right now.

Favorite pick: Jameson Williams, WR, Alabama

Aidan Hutchinson, my No. 1 player in the draft, was a no-brainer pick and gives Detroit a pass rusher with double-digit sack potential. But my favorite pick is Williams, who has truly special speed and gives Detroit the big-play threat it has been missing since Calvin Johnson (with all due respect to Kenny Golladay, Marvin Jones and others).

Originally slotted to pick at No. 32, the Lions jumped up 20 spots to No. 12 to nab Williams, who was the fourth receiver drafted in a five-pick stretch. Coming off the ACL injury, he likely won’t be ready until mid-season, but the Lions aren’t in a position where they need to rush him back. I love the potential impact from Williams.

Day 3 pick who could surprise: Malcolm Rodriguez, LB, Oklahoma State

A four-year starter at Oklahoma State, Rodriguez was a high school quarterback who made the transition to safety and then linebacker in Stillwater. Though he doesn’t have ideal size by NFL standards, his key-and-diagnose skills are outstanding with the instincts to put himself in position to make plays. With the Lions’ linebacker situation, Rodriguez will be a tough player to keep off the field as a rookie.",40.0,detroitlions,t3_ugu7q4,False,0.0,Peni Swell,2022-05-02T12:00:11Z,detroitlions,-0.0040725164199192

*A three-year starter at Kentucky, Paschal played defensive end in defensive coordinator Brad White’s hybrid front, also seeing snaps as a linebacker and 
inside as a three-technique. After a 2018 cancer diagnosis, he overcame several operations and returned to the Wildcats a year later, finishing his career No. 3 in 
school history with 37.0 tackles for loss (tied with Bud Dupree). Paschal is a smart, technically sound defender with the body type and balanced athleticism to shut 
down the run. He has the physical hands and quickness to defeat blockers as a pass rusher, but he struggles to bend the corner or win at the top of his rush. Overall, 
Paschal isn’t a dynamic or sophisticated pass rusher, but he is polished vs. the run with the point-of-attack instincts and football character that will be welcomed 
in an NFL building. He is a scheme-diverse end who can be part of an NFL rotation.*",1.0,detroitlions,t3_ueyj4c,False,0.0,Peni Swell,2022-04-29T19:19:11Z,detroitlions,0.0015672901272773

Suh's contact had been so fucked from restructuring that using the franchise tag would have cost the Lions $22 million, making him the highest paid defensive lineman of all time. On top of that, due to all the ridiculous dead money from the decade of train wreck top 10 draft picks (in the pre rookie wage scale era), we probably weren't going to be able to afford to keep Fairley either. There was literally no game plan for what to do with DT after the 2014 season. 

And then the best prospect since Suh falls right in our laps. 

The stars of BPA and need finally fucking align for the first time in the recorded history of the Lions. Nobody thought it was possible that Donald would fall to 7. 

And Mayhew drafts Eric fucking Ebron. Too fat and slow to be a true WR, and too small and weak to be a true TE. The dude was a tweener that put up big numbers in a weak ACC, and Mayhew makes him the highest drafted TE of all time.

I'm of the opinion that Goff is most certainly the best option for this upcoming season, it's just disingenuous to suggest that's he's not an expensive quarterback.

Trevor Lawrence - $9.2 mil, Joe Burrow - $9 mil, Kyler Murray - $8.9 mil, Zack Wilson $8.8 mil, Trey Lance - $8.5 mil, Tua - $7.6 mil, Sam Darnold - $7.5 mil, etc, etc. There are currently only 13 QB's that make more than $15 mil per year and I'd say that only 7 of those are actually worth the money. 

Here's the presupase of my entire argument - is Patrick Mahomes worth $20 million more than Jimmy G, yeah I think we all agree to that. Is Jared Goff worth $20 million more than Jameis Winston, I definitely think we'd all agree no on that one.

 A. Lynn was fired before we got a win and MCDC started calling plays with our TE coach (now OC), and it was night and day difference.

Read comments, watch the game again and look at the missed throws.

You bring up defense... so how many holes need to be filled? That's a totally different conversation that talks about several position groups, and their performance wasn't that bad with things that can be cleaned up. This is the first year seeing what this particular defense has to offer, mainly the backups, and one game against a very decent backup Rookie QB in Ridder. This is not the first time we've seen Blough outperform Boyle as a backup.

This post is about the backup QB situation. If you want to discuss the defense performance, which isn't nearly as bad as you're saying (with the exception of a few run plays due to missed tackles and backups allowing chunk plays), it's totally fine to make a thread about how you observed that to be lackluster.

48306,301863,301863,qoqmarley,"Great write up. I love Goff. He got chewed up and spit out. As a symbol of our city he is the perfect QB for us. He is Detroit as fuck. Plus, he screams Alex Smith to me. There is a reason that both players were selected first overall. The talent is there. It's just pretty damn hard to be successful in this league when your own coach throws you under the bus. In my opinion this happened to both players. Goff just needs a coaching staff to believe in him. Having a strong run game with a dominant offensive line will certainly go a long ways in helping him too.

 [Watch this short video on Alex](https://vimeo.com/44971571). It shows how he was hated in SF and how it all turned around once a new coach arrived. I think for the QB position it is way more mental than it is physical. That's where MCDC excels as a coach. Once he took over play calling, Goff's passer rating was very good and on par with his rating from his Super Bowl run (when everyone loved him):

>With Campbell calling plays for Jared Goff’s last six starts of the season, the quarterback completed 68 percent of his passes for 1,250 yards with 11 touchdowns and two interceptions — good for a 101.8 passer rating. Goff’s career-high in passer rating is 101.1, which he recorded in 2018 when helping lead the Rams to Super Bowl LIII.

Also I was watching [highlights of the Sun God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjIWJTC4d_4) the other day. I was actually shocked how many times Goff made a great play to get him the ball. I am really excited to see him play QB with a better receiving corps this year. Also, this year's draft tells me Holmes has a lot of faith in him too.

On a side note, I cannot remember a time when three of our four professional teams had such talent in the GM position. Holmes, Weaver, and Yzerman have a chance to be truly special.

- Boyle over Blough (or one of the both making the team)
- Not knowing who Demetrius Taylor aka ""sawed off"" is


The good:

- OL Sans Stenberg who picked it up after that prediction

Even though we mostly sucked on offense, i rest easy knowing that almost all of the blame fell on QB play

Blough is Qb2, Boyle will get cut

Reynolds is Rb3, Jackson Rb4 Both Igwebuke and Jefferson will get cut / go to the PS

i still dont know who we'll keep between Kraemer and Stenberg, both where good. Kraemer might edge in because he can play C as well (guys on the roster will be the starting 5 + Nelson, Kraemer and Brown)

Defense looked good out there, they could only move the ball when the 2s started playing while they had trubisky still in

Austin Bryant is a lock to the roster and will be playing a good ammount of snaps 

Okudah was solid out there

Chase Lucas might make it in the 53 after all

The Eagles might have the most loaded roster in the NFL. Their biggest weakness is at the QB position, and even then, they've got a guy who can make plays with his legs and break the game open. 

Looking at rosters, I can't think of a single position group where we are clearly better. 

QB: DET if Goff's the Goff from late last year, Hurts if not

RB: DET. Give me Swift and Williams over Sanders and Gainwell. It's close though. 

WR/TE: PHI. AJB and Smith could be one of the best WR duos in the league this year, and I think as of now Goedert and Hockenson are a wash.

OL: PHI. This might be a bit controversial here, seeing as many of us think we could have the best OL this year. And we very well could. But our starting 5 has still yet to take a regular season snap together. Philly's OL has been a strength and one of the best in the league for years. Gotta go PHI for now.

DL: PHI. Another spot where we very well could be better, but that's based on a lot of potential and projections. Philly's DL isn't some dominant group, but we have too many unknowns for me to put us here.

LB: Wash. We both have terrible LB groups.

DB: PHI. Philly might have the best secondary in the NFL. Slay, Bradberry, and CJG is a NASTY CB group. Philly could have 2 Will Harris's at S and still have a better secondary than us. They may we'll have 3 CB1s. 

ST: DET. Solely based off ST DVOA from last year, we were 10th with +1.3%, PHI was 15th with +.3%

A) Aaron Rodgers once proudly claimed that he purposefully prefers his balls (hehe) to be higher than the legal limit, whereas Brady got scrutinized and suspended for being below the legal limit (both are blatantly against the standard rules, yet only Brady got the scrutiny, and the worse thing that happens to Rogers is the refs have to deflate them on the spot to get them under the limit if he ever gets caught during a game)  


B) The form of ""spying"" that the Pats got scrutinized for was something that was done by most NFL teams at that time; keep in mind that Goodell used to work for the New York Jets and already had a hard on toward New England

BREAKDOWN
TuAnon is right about one thing: We’re all wrong about Tua’s deep ball. He is actually pretty good when he’s able to lead his receiver into open space downfield, and he is particularly accurate when throwing to receivers with defenders in a trailing position. But contrary to popular belief, those aren’t throws that require a surplus of arm strength. Timing and touch? Sure—but not pure arm strength. And the throws that do require that power are the ones that give Tua the most issues. His limitations pop up when he’s forced to throw with bodies around him, and if there isn’t room to step into those throws. 

There just isn’t an obvious blue chip strength in Tua’s skill set. He clearly understands how to attack a coverage, but that’s a skill any high-level backup possesses. He can get rid of the ball if his pre-snap read is correct, but if the picture changes on him, he panics. He navigates the pocket well but freezes if things close in on him. His accuracy is limited to touch throws and quick passes. And for a quarterback who’s billed as a smart processor, he sure does make a lot of mental errors. Tua is just good enough to operate in a talent-heavy offense, but don’t expect much more than that.

BIGGEST STRENGTH: ACCURACY
Tua’s arm talent may be limiting, but the throws he’s good at … he’s really good at. We already covered the deep vertical routes into space that he makes with regularity, but his best throw might be the deep crosser, which will endear him to new teammate Tyreek Hill, the NFL’s toughest cover on those routes. Tua’s precision can be found on quick-hitting RPOs, which served as the foundation for the Dolphins offense in 2021.

BIGGEST WEAKNESS: PRE-SNAP
Tua needs to be a bit more skeptical. NFL defenses lie—the good ones, at least. Just because they’re lined up a certain way before the ball is snapped doesn’t mean they’re going to remain that way after. Tua still struggles to pick up on the defensive tells that would improve his in-play decision-making.",20.0,miamidolphins,t3_x79z3c,False,0.0,.,2022-09-06T08:01:28Z,detroitlions,0.005142432201836

That's just the point. Hutch, Thibs and Walker are the safe picks. This draft does not have a talent that jumps at you that's a must have like Chase Young or Andrew Luck, all it has at the top are safe picks. 


Drafting Malik Willis is a gamble, but if developed right, his ceiling is much higher than the above mentioned names. If drafted, he is immediately the 2nd best running QB in the league only behind Lamar Jackson. He also has a cannon of an arm so there is plenty of big play potential. If we can teach him how to read NFL defenses, he could be dangerous, and we have time to do that because it's pretty clear that Goff is the starter this year.
