We have depth in the pass rush, losing Landry is better than losing Cunningham/Long Jr imo with how shallow our depth at ILB is until Rice is back. Same with safety, it’s bleak if we took a hit there.

The CBs may be green, but if they play up to potential, that could be more than enough to make up for the dampened pass rush. The potential is there for a top tier CB room and with how connected pass rush is to secondary play, it might just be exactly the cure for missing Landry.

How I view things, week 1-5 are a trial run for the pass rush. If Weaver/Ola are competent enough to replace Landry, we’ll know by the bye week. If it’s clear they are not, we can still find a pass rusher in free agency or by trade in October with the money freed up by Henry’s re-worked deal.

2219,18935,18935,Bieber_hole_69,"PFF has never graded Landry all that well. They’ve had him as an average to slightly above average EDGE basically his whole career. They had him at basically the same as far as grading last year IIRC, just basically accounting the major uptick in sacks to higher conversion of pressures to sacks, likely credited to a much upgraded pass rush the Titans had in 2021 with Autry and Simmons playing very well and a good defensive scheme with Bowen calling plays. He did have plenty of clean-up sacks last year, his athleticism is his best skill and that shows when he can catch up to a QB breaking the pocket when someone else was already in their face and couldn’t finish.

He doesn’t get a ton of pressure, so he is a guy that can have high variance in sack season-to-season depending on how much he can get home. When the pass rush around him was awful like in 2020, he had 5.5 sacks. When the pass rush around him was great like in 2021, he had 12 sacks. He depends on guys around him to give him the kind of looks where he can be on an island with the tackle/TE on the outside and beat him around the edge with speed and bend, he can be neutralized pretty easily if you can dedicate extra blockers to him as his rush move set is pretty one-trick pony. He also doesn’t rush and drops into coverage way more than most EDGE guys, and PFF values success in pass rush more than being a competent coverage guy.

Landry’s most valuable asset to the Titans was that he played basically every snap. He never came off the field and was a good run defender, so the Titans could rotate guys in the interior more often and give someone like Autry advantageous situations since they never had to spell Landry on the outside. You could put Landry in and not have to worry too much about that side of the defense, and a lot of the exotic looks the Titans like to do up front and in the secondary are possible because they have two guys like Landry and Dupree on the edges that play basically every snap and never have to come out for situational snaps.

I tend to agree with PFF more, even if I do think Landry is a better player than they give him credit for. In the Titans scheme and with what they like to do, he’s a pretty foundational piece. I think he was bound to have a regression season for sacks, just because he’s always going to be a high-variance sack guy, so I think really the Titans only need to replace 8 or so sacks now that he’s gone. That’s totally do-able with the depth they have and the other pieces in the front 7. The real lost opportunity with Landry gone is just that they have to shake up everything they want to do on defense at a base level. There isn’t anybody that can do what Landry does available, nobody can replace just the all-around quality he has and his ability to play 90% of the snaps every game. They have to rotate more and some of their situational packages have to be changed up, and the defense will be worse for it. 

It’s certainly not a death-knell like it would seem to lose a 12 sack pass rusher though. He’s not TJ Watt, they can get his pass rush production from guys already on the roster and with some extra scheming. He’s a complimentary pass rusher, and that can be worked around.",18.0,nfl,t3_x4b94n,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-09-02T15:37:54Z,tennesseetitans,0.019984536199364

Anyone who actually follows the Titans would know that isn’t close to being the case though. Vrabel could go 0-17 this year and still have a job in 2023. He’s about the most entrenched coach in the NFL at this point. Ownership loves and trusts him and the fans love him too. It would take multiple (3+) years of top 5 draft pick seasons to get Vrabel fired at this point.

He also didn’t move up at all between the first depth chart of camp and the [final depth chart](https://twitter.com/jwyattsports/status/1166072508786925569?s=20&t=aiJkpxduHWVKCYFXFQ0kGw) before the 4th preseason game. AJ then went on to play 42% of the offensive snaps a week later agains the Browns in week 1, so it’s clear his actual rotation spot wasn’t reflected properly in the final depth chart. Taylor was also obviously traded before Week 1 as well, so that should be accounted for, but even then AJ played more snaps than Hollister (who didn’t get any offensive snaps, only ST,) and 4 less offensive snaps than Sharpe.

I think that can underline what everyone else is saying about Vrabel’s tendency to keep vets over rookies on the pre-season depth charts.

2240,18964,18964,Bieber_hole_69,"Then you aren’t reading much media, the Colts are and have been the darlings of media since Ballard was hired.

You would think the Colts are perpetual Super Bowl contenders since 2017 the way Ballard is ranked as a top 10 GM in every single GM ranking I have seen. They build the same way most of the “smart” media members think they would build a team if they were a real GM, so they get heaps of praise regardless of actual results.

They’re like the Danny Ainge Celtics of 2014-2017. They’ve taken a bad roster down to the studs and rebuilt it the “right” way, not spending much in free agency, trading down instead of up, acquiring as much capital as possible and not using it on anything other than building the roster with home-grown talent and patience above all. They don’t take short-cuts, in a way they’re the anti-Rams.

Whether that works or not…who knows? It’s been five seasons of mixed results with one playoff win and no division titles, but if you looked at media coverage you would assume it’s been at least two division titles and one deep playoff run, which is something another team in the division has done in that same time period and receives much less media fanfare for actually having done. And that’s why Titans fans get a bit frustrated whenever the Colts are brought up as division favorites every season and Ballard is ranked as a better GM than Robinson every year. 

It’s now year four since Luck retired and they still don’t have a long-term solution at QB, so it looks like retread after retread still as they can’t get the most important position in the game right no matter how many spins of the wheel they take. When they finally did pony up some actual draft capital for a QB…it was a disaster. They would have been better off to have just went all-in on finding a QB and sending a few more picks for Stafford, Herbert, Tua, Fields, McCorkle…hell they could have signed just signed Brady rather than Rivers.

That's 11 months of recovery, and pretty typical for returning from an ACL tear. Maybe he needed longer personally to recover, and it's up to him to be the one to decide that since it's his body. The team gave him a pretty standard window to return and were slow with him during camp and pre-season.

Robert Woods tore his ACL November 13th, 2021 and seems to be on track for a standard ACL recovery timeline, which would be ready for Week 1, it not 100% yet.

2264,18995,18995,Bieber_hole_69,"Why would the Browns take Tannehill when they have Watson? They would be spending like $100 million against the cap with both those guys on the team. The Browns aren't giving up anything to get rid of Baker, they'll just cut him at that point. The only possibility of this trade would probably end up with the Titans being the team giving something up in return because Baker's deal is up this year, but Tannehill has more money left for 2023.

Without even checking the math, I don't think the Titans could take on any of Baker's money while paying against the cap what they would have to for Tannehill to trade him this year.

This is one of the very few lose-lose scenarios I could ever think of lol. The Titans would be trading a very expensive QB for a very expensive QB nobody wants at his price tag. And the Browns would be trading a very expensive backup QB they can't give away for a more expensive backup QB because Tannehill isn't as good as Watson.

Both guys are towards the ends of their contracts but have so much in guarantees for the upcoming season that trading or cutting them saves almost no money compared to the dead cap it would cause. Anything on the field notwithstanding, I just simply don't think the money would work for either team.

On the field though, this would be a disaster for the Titans. I don't think the Titans are a playoff team with Baker at QB, but they are with Tannehill at QB. They'd be getting worse at QB for no reason in 2022. And on the off-chance Baker stuns us all and is better than Tannehill could be, what are you going to do with him in 2023? His contract is up after this year, are you paying the big bucks to extend him if he's good? Letting him walk for a comp pick? If he was good in 2022 and you let him walk and he's still good in 2023 it's a disaster for the team, they let a good QB walk. More likely though, if Baker was good in 2022 the team would be forced into extending him and would give him big money only for the real Baker to come back in 2023 and bring the franchise down with him.

And on the Willis front, any thought of starting him this year or even letting him compete for the job is insane. He should and needs to be on the sideline in a headset on game days this season as a healthy scratch. The dude is not ready and won't be for a while. Willis starting for the Titans is a guaranteed 4 win season and probably ruins Willis as a player in the process. If Willis started this year, we'd be picking a different QB in the top 5 next year anyway.

This trade as a premise wouldn't even work in Madden, and I can't imagine anything other than you forgot the Browns signed Watson. The money doesn't work for either team. It makes the Titans worse.

2287,19023,19023,Bieber_hole_69,"We all get blown away, rightfully so, by the games that AJ can just take over and win by himself. The 2nd Indy game last year, the 49ers game, and the Bengals playoff game (even if we didn't win it,) are as good of performances as you can get out of any WR. I was at two of those games, and I've never seen anything like it. I would have given AJ $30M per year on the spot after leaving Nissan Stadium those nights.

But then what nobody really factors in are the, including weeks he was out with injury, 12 games AJ had last year with less than 50 receiving yards. He disappeared more last year than he really showed up. The best of the best at WR dominate the majority of games.

For comparison, last year Davante Adams had 3 weeks the *entire season* with less than 50 yards. Does anybody, even the biggest AJ stans out there, think he will ever be that kind of player? For the Titans as a whole under Vrabel with our current offensive philosophy, will any receiver ever produce like that? If both those answers are no, then why would we ever pay any WR over 10% of the salary cap? And why would it be AJ of all receivers?

Losing that top level really hurts, and we don't win those four games that he had over 90 yards in without him, but maybe we win those 3 games we lost when he was injured instead if we get better health at WR?

His top 4 performances last year totaled 524 yards of his 869 for the entire season. 60% of his yards for the entire 17 game season came in 4 games.

Maybe it's better team building and long-term strategy to try spreading those 524 yards out into 65 yards/game over 8 games instead.

To replace AJ's entire season yardage over a 17 game season it's just a hair over 50 yards per game. I don't think it's unreasonable to think Woods/Burks/Hooper can be worth that much. Maybe we don't win the couple games a year we wouldn't have won without having AJ there to just take over the game and will us to victory. But maybe we also win some of the games he wouldn't have played due to injury or had to leave early with injury? All 5 of our losses last year came in games that AJ had under 50 yards. How many would be wins if we could have more consistency in the passing game?

It's not all that farfetched to say you can make up AJ Brown's production in the aggregate across the season with what we have on the team now.

Edit: I've also been going back through those 4 games last year that AJ missed due to injury. On the surface, that 1-3 record looks like a bright red warning sign about how this team will be without him. I've written here in the past about how I though AJ was the most important player on our team and that 1-3 record was a big story of my thinking then. 

Looking at those games though, one loss was to the Jets without Julio and AJ. We should have won that game regardless, and were in a position to win it if Firkser doesn't have pads of butter for hands.

And the other two, at New England and Pittsburgh were on the road against playoff teams. We should have won both of those games as well and the big story of why we lost was turnovers, turnovers, turnovers. In those games, the Titans fumbled a combined **10** goddamn times and lost 6 of them. 10 fucking fumbles is why we lost those games, not the fact that AJ wasn't on the field. We aren't winning any games where we average 5 fumbles if Randy Moss and Calvin Johnson are both lining up on the outside lol.",45.0,tennesseetitans,t3_uiw2r9,False,0.0,11,2022-05-05T09:04:38Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0001222151035638

I mean literally, Julio had the hammy problem since camp. Finally it seemed fine and he was practicing again and the first full practice he has it gets pulled again, I've never seen anything like that. The IR stint just felt like the Titans had finally had enough and just wanted to get at least a playoff game out of him. They had been trying a week-to-week approach and then just basically told him to take a month off in November-December.

Julio will never play more than 10 games in a season again, and it would be a miracle if he could even play over 50% of the snaps in those games.

When a team like the Titans that is already thin at WR decides a roster spot and $9M in cap room is worth more than Julio to the team, it's clear what stage of his career he is in.

The worst part is that when he's on the field it's clear he can still play, so any team that signs him is going to get screwed by thinking they can actually depend on the potential since he's still pretty much the same player if you give him 5 weeks off at a time.

The core of the team down the stretch was the defense and that’s still together, a potential top 5 unit that’s only gotten better if Farley can play like his potential.

We could have been the Packers in the same spot with a WR1 that refuses to sign the deal we give him and stuck with picks that couldn’t get a top tier WR tonight anyway.

2356,19104,19104,Bieber_hole_69,"He had the same OC in 2016 and 2017, albeit a terrible OC. He's OC in 2015 was also his QB coach in 2016, even though he wasn't calling plays in 2015. 2018 and 2019 were also different OCs, but the same system both years, the LaFleur offense and the Smith offense were both cut from the same cloth. He had continuity, it's not like he was getting thrown to the wolves in a dumpster fire franchise (although that may have been the case in 2015, the Titans were a disaster at that time, but have since been as consistent and steady a franchise as you can get outside of the top tier in the league.

The offense in 2016-17 was also catered specifically to not getting him hurt, and he still ended up getting hurt both of those seasons. If he can start all 17 games for the Falcons this year it's a miracle, and I say that as someone who desperately wanted Mariota to be what we all thought he could be. His stretch towards the end of 2016 was genuinely great, but at this point was clearly the peak for him. He's a back-up QB and played like a back-up/borderline starter for pretty much his entire career outside of a 6 or 7 game stretch in year 2, and when he should have been getting better and was actually getting a well designed offense around him, he only got worse.

I also think the success of his final two OCs in Tennessee, LaFleur and Smith, can also show that the weak point the whole time was actually Mariota. Tannehill coming in and immediately lighting it up to the tune of having among the most efficient 10 game stretches a QB has ever had should have made that clear. A team that made the AFC title game with Tannehill at QB was on pace to score 16.3 points per game (11.6 if you don't count the 43 points in a week 1 outlier game,) and pick in the top 5 of the draft. Tannehill comes in and the team averages 30.4 points per game the rest of the way. For the 2019 season that would be like going from the 32nd scoring offense in the league to the 2nd best. Hard to imagine any other situation in the league changing that drastically if it's a switch from one starting caliber QB to the other, that only happens if it's a back-up going to a starter.

It's hard to look back and remember just how dark it was after week 6 with Mariota in 2019, but the Titans were a team on the brink of starting a full rebuild at the end of the Mariota era and then suddenly are back-to-back division champs and have a .700 winning percentage in the regular season over the next 43 regular season games.

If they think a QB in this class that's going to be available at 26 or within trading range from there can be a capable starter in 2023, I think you really, really have to consider how much better of a position for the re-tooling of this team that will need to come after 2022 if you're not sinking over 15% of the salary cap into a QB that won't be here after 2023 and isn't elite now.",5.0,tennesseetitans,t3_ud8k8h,False,0.0,11,2022-04-27T15:02:00Z,tennesseetitans,0.0839243284225463
2360,19108,19108,Bieber_hole_69,"I mean yeah, those are all issues as well. I'm not a fan of Downing or how he called that playoff game either. But not turning the ball over is easier to address than the playcalling. A QB can avoid turning the ball over with a bad OC, but any OC can't make up for a QB that won't stop throwing INTs.

I just am of the opinion that taking care of the football and minimizing dumb turnovers is the single biggest issue the team has and the point that needs to be fixed more than any other. Having a QB with a 1.29 TD/INT ratio last season and a 1 for his postseason career (0.5 for the last two postseasons) isn't a formula to success and can't be worked around, playcalling isn't as big of an issue to me. Tannehill has not taken care of the ball well in the last 2 one-and-done playoff series, and I'll believe it when I see it that he can be the 2019 playoff Tannehill again. Art Smith didn't get a great playoff game out of him in 2020 either.

In the 6 losses the Titans had last year, they were -16 in turnovers cumulatively. No team, good playcalling or not, can overcome almost 3 turnovers per game, and that's the common factor in all the losses just like it is for most teams when they lose the turnover battle. When the Titans were negative in TOs last year they were 2-6, I'm sure most teams have splits like that but the common theme in almost every loss is that they can't win if they don't take care of the ball. When they won or tied the turnover battle last season they were 10-1. They can win with the playcalling now if they don't give the ball away.

Since Tannehill took over in 2019 the Titans are 27-6 when having a positive turnover differential and 5-11 when negative. The bigger issue is that the percentage of games when they are negative has increased each year since Tannehill took over from: 
2019 - 23% 
2020 -  29%
2021 - 44%

When you get 9 sacks and hold a really great offense to 16 points for 4 quarters, you just need to take care of the ball and you win 99% of the time. The Titans defense is good enough to carry them as long as the QB doesn't fuck it up, and Tannehill has fucked it up when it mattered most the last 2 years.

I would trade that TD pass for not throwing one of the three interceptions 100 times out of 100, they probably win the game that way.

I wouldn't start to get worried until he starts missing days at camp. Until then there isn't a rush to get anything done, missing off-season work isn't setting him or the team back and it's not like he isn't working out still.

It's probably in the interest of both sides to wait on getting this deal done at the last minute before camp. 

For the Titans, the roster is going to look a lot different after the draft and the last wave of free agency in May, the team will probably want to wait until the roster is pretty much finalized for camp when they start working on how they want to structure AJ's deal based on what money they have left and what money they need to operate during the season. They also have the Julio money coming in June that they can plan around now.

For AJ, being the last guy to sign a deal from that class will mean he probably gets the most money. Both he and his agent know this, there's no reason to rush and be the first in that class to sign at $21/AAV when the other 3 can now show that deal to their teams and get 22+/AAV.

Robinson just doesn't have a history of getting deals done before he needs to. They use all the team control they can to work out extensions and have shown they aren't afraid to use the franchise tag if they need to when they think the player is worth the tag number.

And this is just April, Lewan sat out June minicamp in 2018 when he was trying to get a new deal and not play on his 5th year option, exact same scenario as AJ is in now and a deal got done before actual camp started anyway. A vet like Lewan or AJ that's playing with a pretty identical team to last year doesn't really need all that much time in camp/off-season team programs either, if AJ missed even the majority of camp in the fall it's not the end of the world, he's played with Tannehill for 3 years, they don't need to get their reps in like that together anymore. It's just pretty rare to see any star player actually play out the last year of their contract, and this is how a new deal starts getting done.

Just because their is some kind of holdout doesn't mean this is an adversarial situation, this is just how contract negotiations go in the NFL. During Lewan's hold-out he made it clear he wanted to be at practice and this was just part of business that he had to participate in. I'm sure AJ is the same now, he probably wants to be with the team, but when an agent tells you this is how business is done, you do what they tell you, especially during the first contract negotiation of your career.

If every player that held out for a new contract during the last year of their deal didn't get a new deal done with the same team, like 99% of stars in the league wouldn't be playing where they are currently playing. Where there would have been a real issue was if AJ held out before last season and wanted a new deal with 2-years of team control left (4 realistically because he's worth two years of franchise tags,) that is the kind of situation that ends in a trade most of the time.

4643,33128,33128,ColorblindSquid,"While in Nashville you need to experience hot chicken, it's a little played out at this point but still absolutely delicious. Don't go to Hattie B's unless you just like the whole tourist vibe. My choice would be Red's 615 for hot chicken. It's literally a concrete brick shack that you walk up to (no indoor seating) but imo it's the best in town. Try the hot chicken crunch wrap.

 Grab your food there and walk across the street to centennial park to eat. Lots of picnic tables and stuff.

You'll probably see this huge Greek looking building, that's the Parthenon. It's a to scale replica of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. Tickets are cheap to get in and there is a museum underneath all about Tennessee and Nashville Definitely worth the stop.

If you want to do the whole Broadway experience, go after the game and it will be packed so lots of people but good environment. It's not everyone's cup of tea but it's kind of the standard for out of towner's here.

Also if you get a chance go see some live music.(not big artists) Doesn't matter if you don't know the band, doesn't matter if you haven't planned. We have TONS of local venues that have amazing talent playing every single night. Tickets are usually less than $20 for local venues like basement east, marathon music works etc. Support local artists, you'll meet some great people at these shows and who knows you may see the next big thing. If you are into smoky low lit jazz clubs, Rudy's is GREAT. Definitely get tickets in advance seating is limited but the drink menu is phenomenal and they have great Cajun food too.

10287,68111,68111,JGspot,"IANAL, but this guy is: Aron Solomon. He did a Q&A when the Flores suit was first announced and when asked about the Giants situation (which is very similar to ours), he said this:  


""\[The Giants\] will have 100 percent violated both the spirit and the letter of the “Rooney Rule.” But I say this with my legal hat on: so what?  
The Rooney Rule has been a joke since it came into effect in 2003. It has no teeth. This is what I was writing in the piece before this came out with Brian Flores: a court needs to put teeth in the Rooney Rule and say, “Listen, we’re not just telling you anymore that you have to have two black or other visible minority candidates for a head-coaching job. We’re going to hit the franchises and the league where it hurts.”

The only thing the National Football League understands is money. So let’s talk to them about money. That’s what this is going to be all about as well. Given the fact that Flores is never going to work in the NFL again, the amount of damages he and his lawyer are going to claim — put your seat belt on when you see it. This was a guy who was making $3 million a year in his first head coaching job. Had he continued to do well, he’s probably somewhere between $7-10 million a year in expected income. Play that out over a certain number of years, plus punitive damages? He’s not going into this thing asking for $600.""

&#x200B;

The whole Q&A has some good insight, although some of it is outdated like Flores not working again. You can read it here: [https://www.boston.com/sports/analysis/2022/02/02/qa-legal-analyst-aron-solomon-brian-flores-nfl-lawsuit-rooney-rule/](https://www.boston.com/sports/analysis/2022/02/02/qa-legal-analyst-aron-solomon-brian-flores-nfl-lawsuit-rooney-rule/)

&#x200B;

Here's what I will add on: the Titans situation is different because Mularkey was interim HC and we interviewed three coaches of color for the job that year, but it isn't different enough that I believe we escape a finding that we violated the Rooney Rule. Additionally I don't see true change happening until there is some owners of color in the league. I also think that stuff like Josh McCown hurts the league overall, like, in a league where 70% of the players are black a mediocre at best white qb got serious head coaching consideration without having a single second of any coaching experience above the high school level. Meanwhile Eric Bienemy is still an offensive coordinator. That's a systemic problem.

&#x200B;

Overall, the question isn't going to be whether the titans violated the rule or not (they did), The question is going to be whether the court believes that is a Titans issue or an NFL issue or both. Likely outcome would be some money paid by the Titans to Horton and then an overhaul of the Rooney Rule to be more specific on number of coaches of color in the league (like the system Aron suggests).",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_tygpvn,False,0.0,:TRac:,2022-04-07T14:01:28Z,tennesseetitans,0.0211553182789801

I agree those offenses are built up a little better than ours, but you have to remember most of those players are elevated because they had literal HOF caliber QBs playing for them. When their defenses struggled they had a HOF QB to lean on..we do not have that luxury.

Our offense was working very well before the injury curse got to us. We were averaging 28ppg through Week 9 and had just beat like 7 straight teams or something. Our offense doesn’t need some gigantic changes like y’all are crying about. A few good signings will keep us afloat. Do y’all not understand that every great offense has a great QB to go with it? We have an above average QB who disappoints in the playoffs and has for 3 years. It’s a bitter pill to swallow but history typically repeats itself. We’re never going to have a KC or BUF offense until we improve the #1 part of an offense.

All 3 of those seasons ended because Tannehill couldn’t perform in the playoffs, simple as that. 

I just do not believe it matters at all if we build a offense with prime Randy Moss and Megatron. Until Tannehill and Downing prove me wrong, which is entirely possible, I would rather lean on a defense that HAS shown up to multiple playoff games.

Imo JRobs formula has shown it can work. I think the general consensus in this fanbase and organization was that last year was our year.

You're entirely correct though, only defense isn't enough to win, but it makes it a hell of a lot easier. Our offense was pretty good until Henry + Julio + AJ all got hurt and none of them saw the field together till the playoffs. If we don't catch the injury bug again, assuming JRob signs/drafts a few more offensive weapons, which is highly expected, I don't see why we couldn't be back to a top 10 offense with a top 5 defense. I highly highly doubt JRob will just walk into the season with no upgrades to our pass catchers and expect it to work out.

IMO our Super Bowl aspirations lie entirely in the hands of Tannehill & Downing.

I think Tannehill is gone after this year, so you'll have a rookie or second year qb come in with a solid supporting cast around them if you keep AJ and draft another solid WR this year. 

It's been shown the last few seasons that to win the superbowl you need a qb on a rookie contract and a talented roster around them (chiefs), or a highly productive veteran qb that you've mortgaged draft picks to get (rams). 

Barring injury not paying AJ now is a huge mistake that will get Jon Robinson fired. He doesn't hit on enough draft picks to allow the ones he does hit on to walk.

 This forces Cleveland to trade assets away for a team to take his contract, or they have to cut him and take the dead cap hit. Baker gets paid either way as his option is guaranteed money.

Ola Adeniyi got hurt and wasn’t much of a factor from what I saw. Farley looked decent. Looks like he needs the reps to get up to speed. He’s missed basically two years now. NaQuan Jones looked good too.


QB: Malik looks the part of the raw rookie with talent. A couple of great runs, showing elusiveness, but bails from the pocket too early sometimes. Great pass to McMath but it could have been more accurate so the receiver doesn’t go out of bounds there. He also took a sack before the end of the first half when he should have thrown it away. Expected rookie mistake there. Woodside was consistently under pressure and didn’t look good overall considering he’s been our backup for years. 

The rest of the offense: Much more to say about the RB’s than WR’s here. After the early fumble Chestnut looked good, but I don’t see us keeping him. We already have Henry, Hilliard and Haskins, who also looked good.

That’s why you’ve seen people say that Manning was a better QB. This subreddit is mostly made up of younger people, so most of them don’t even remember Manning as an Elite QB, much less comparable to Brady. 


When they both played, it was obvious that Manning had a superior understanding of the game, acting as a coach on the field. He was able to diagnose everything the defense did and adjust to the play that would take advantage of the weakness in the defense. Then he was able to execute the throws with insane efficiency, carrying the offense forward himself. 

There was no other QB in the league that could completely dissect you’re entire defense, recognize it from the line of scrimmage, even with motions and disguises, and audible into a play that took advantage of it.

Brady and Belichick eventually developed a similar understanding between each other due to the number of years they spent as well as Peyton’s example, but they got there too.

13474,88809,88809,Markosaurus,"Playing faster isn’t necessarily a good thing. If we’re talking situational football like the 2 minute drill right before half or the end of the game, yes. However, often times even in those situations you’ll see teams purposefully run more passing plays outside the numbers so that the receivers can get out of bounds to stop the clock or at worst case have an incomplete pass which also stops the clock. Sometimes you’ll see a seam route or something in the middle of the field if the defense gives it to you, but then teams run up and spike the ball. 

Outside of the situational need to play fast, it’s often better to control time of possession and methodically make your way upfield, forcing the opposing defense to play longer while your defense gets to rest. 

I see you have a pats flair so I know you’re probably biased and I’m not here to argue Brady vs manning, I just wanted to make that point.

16177,110569,110569,PitTitan,"So I want to address a couple things here, because to some extent I don't disagree with you. However, there is one major thing I want to be clear on that may not be a very popular opinion but hear me out.


Steve McNair is not an appropriate measuring stick for a modern franchise QB.


I think people tend to underestimate the differences between a passing offense in the early 2000s and a passing offense now. McNairs league MVP campaign only saw him throw for 24 TDs and 7 INTs. Those numbers wouldn't even sniff the pro bowl today. The league was not as pass happy (outside of the notable Manning / Brady exceptions and they were just getting started) and defenses could do a lot more to stop you.


McNair is the franchise GOAT, at least since they got to TN, but his numbers are nowhere close to the standard for a franchise QB in today's NFL.


A QB I do like to look at for perspective would be Joe Flacco. He also predates the current ""modern passing offense"" and is closer to what I believe most people would view as the floor for Tannehill in order for us to be successful. A prototypical game manager. His postseason stats, even when averaging per game, are all better than what Tannehill has accomplished, even with less weaponry, even in a run first offense with a good defense, even in an era before the league got as pass happy as it is now. If that's the floor to get one ring then we're not getting that.


While I agree with everything you're saying about the availability of franchise QBs, the financial situation that precludes us from getting an established guy is the very reason why we can't move forward with Tannehill after this year IMO. He is BY FAR our biggest paycheck. We can move forward with Tannehill or we can move forward with our roster. I do not believe we can do both. It's not just an issue of having Tannehill or not having Tannehill in a vacuum. Who do we lose to keep him beyond this year? Lewan? Byard? Simmons? Henry? How do we bring in new talent? Would we have been able to keep AJ (if you're in the camp that believes it would be worth paying him that much)? How do we get better from here, a team that can't seem to do it with what we have now? 


I get that the grass isn't always greener and we would likely be looking in the draft next year for our guy, but honestly that's how most other current successful teams got their starter. At some point you can't be afraid to cut the chain if the anchor isn't coming up. If we want to hand a good roster to the next guy then we can't afford to pay $46mil a year to get bounced in round one.",5.0,tennesseetitans,t3_vsv1lu,False,0.0,None,2022-07-06T18:39:29Z,tennesseetitans,0.0263157600792857
16178,110570,110570,PitTitan,"This is the problem with the ""is Tannehill good or bad?"" debate. The people who insist he isn't the problem only look at the regular season. The people who insist he is the problem only look at the postseason. The actual issue IMO is that both are correct. 


Tannehill deserves all the credit in the world for dragging our decimated roster to the playoffs last year. He was working with receivers that couldn't get open to save their lives and a lot of his forced passes were trying to create something out of nothing. He resurrected this passing offense when he took over and is a big part of turning the franchise around with Robinson and Vrabel. He is a top 10 QB in the regular season and will get the team to the playoffs with even a modicum of competence around him. 


However... he also deserves a lot of blame for his performance when we got there. He made some truly inexcusable unforced errors, one of which directly cost the game. Was he the ONLY problem? No. Was he a MAJOR problem? Yes. This predates the Bengals game as well. He didn't perform well in the loss to the Ravens, wasn't great against the Chiefs, and almost lost us the Patriots game. When you compare his postseason stats to other QBs his numbers are below quite a few average to below average QBs. He's a different QB in the postseason. That's not an emotional position, it's reinforced by his stats.


I am on record as saying that we should move on from Tannehill. I still believe that. I think our chances of winning a championship coming out of the AFC with a QB who goes from great in the regular season to below average in the post season are low. Not zero, but low. I'm more than happy to be proven wrong but right now I don't see it. It's hard to move on from that guy though and I get that. You don't find QBs that can get you to the playoffs falling from trees. I just think that our roster is to a place now where we can't afford to have a QB that holds us back when it matters most and so far that's been the case and I think it's fair to say that the numbers and results back that up.",3.0,tennesseetitans,t3_vsv1lu,False,1.0,None,2022-07-06T16:44:32Z,tennesseetitans,0.0119431007897905

His 2003 campaign was without a doubt the best single season by a Titan in team history and his consistency should not be understated. There is a lot of recency bias in this discussion. I've seen lots of people talk about Mason as if he was a possession receiver but he didn't become that until much later in his career. He was the most dynamic playmaker on the team in the early 2000s and put up the numbers he did in an era where we never approached the passing volume we put up now. That's not to say that AJ isn't very good and was well on his way to being an all time great but he hadn't done nearly enough to eclipse Mason on the franchise GOAT list.


That has nothing to do with how much we'll miss his impact next season, however. He was a huge part of our offense and our number 1 receiver.

13:48 should be the start of that play. It's not the most fun thing to relive but you'll see Firkser coming across wide open underneath. 


I think the difference between the Seahawks play and this one is that the play they ran on the goalline was a timing play. It was a ""throw it to this spot quickly"" kind of a thing, which is honestly my biggest problem with that call. I don't inherently think passing there was completely unreasonable but I don't like that they called a play that had no second option or even the chance for Wilson to use his legs if needed. But that's another issue. I do think that's different than a situation like this where Tannehil is going through his progressions (or at least should have been) and it would have clearly dictated a different decision than the one he ultimately made.

I definitely think that, in a vacuum, the Ravens INT is less egregious. I still think it's a bad decision but I certainly wasn't giving up on him after that game. Where it becomes more concerning IMO is when it's viewed as part of the larger picture. After the Bengals game, a game which was his worst as a Titan IMO, it is part of a pattern of poor decisions, late in the game in the playoffs.


You raise a fair point about coaching and I do think it's important, especially in regards to scheme consistency from one year to the next. Where I begin to have a problem with that being applied to the Bengals game is that we've seen him perform in this scheme, as flawed as it may be. I defended Tannehill all year for dragging us to the postseason, and I still will. I agree that he does not get enough credit for that. But man it's hard to imagine a better situation than what he got in that Bengals game and he still managed to shit the bed. If we can't turn the best defensive performance we've had in a decade and a serviceable, albeit not spectacular, running game into a win then I'm not sure what we have to do. Rewatching the last INT (as painful as it is) Anthony Firker is WIDE OPEN in the middle of the field at the sticks for a first down. I can't blame the scheme for that one.


And that's ultimately my issue. We've seen him do it, we know he can, but that all seems to go out the window in the postseason and I don't think we can blame it on any other factors. 9 sacks from the defense, 5+YPC from the running game, AJ, Julio, and Henry all healthy for the first time, a wide open guy at the sticks on the most crucial 3rd down of the game, and this is the result. I want to be wrong but after 20+ years of watching football I've seen lots of guys who have ""it"" and lots of guys that don't and it's hard to escape that familiar feeling when I watch Tannehill do what he did against the Bengals.",1.0,tennesseetitans,t3_tw81y2,False,0.0,None,2022-04-04T16:00:59Z,tennesseetitans,0.0196538787312537

My issue with that play is that he never should have thrown that pass to begin with, even if it's AJ running that route (even though I think that would have been marginally better). You throw that route if it's uncovered because it's a safe, easy completion, but in this case it wasn't. You just cannot throw a contested pass in that situation.

Regular season Tannehill and post season Tannehill are two different quarterbacks.


Tannehill deserves an immense amount of credit for his role in dragging this team to the 1 seed in the AFC this season despite a literal revolving door of skill positions around him.

16245,110681,110681,PitTitan,"I think it's pretty fair to say Tannehill does not perform well in the playoffs. It's not about him not having 400yards and 4TDs. He makes bad decisions in key moments. 


Near the end of the Patriots game he threw a pass directly at a defender, it hit him in the hands, and he dropped it. We very possibly lose that game if he catches it, despite how great the defense and Derrick Henry were playing. The Ravens game the next year, end of the game, down by a score, throws an INT right at Marcus Peters. Game over. Bengals game this year, end of the game, 3rd down in a tie game with almost no time left and he throws the ball into triple coverage in the middle of the field, ball intercepted. Game over. And yes, that 3rd pick was 1000% on Tannehill. There is no justification for throwing a pass into coverage on 3rd down with so little time left. A punt virtually guarantees overtime in a game where your defense has been lights out. The literal ONLY unacceptable outcome on that play is a turnover. It was the most basic ""throw it where your guy gets it or no one does"" situations and he threw it at NWI in triple coverage in the middle of the field. A 33 year old QB should not be making those mistakes.


Saying this is just about stat lines is disingenuous to the problem. Tannehill is a very talented QB who makes bad decisions in the biggest moments. We've lost 2 consecutive playoff games in which our defense plays lights out against the league's top offenses because we can't generate a passing offense and he turns the ball over late.

Tannehill is a different QB in the postseason. This predates this year but the Bengals game was certainly no exception. Our opponents, since the KC game (and the first Baltimore game but they didn't do it well) have sold out to shut down our run game. That opens up opportunities in the passing game by design. The QB should be able to take advantage of that. In the playoffs (and I'm talking specifically about the playoffs) Tannehill doesn't seem capable of doing this.

My family and I were watching this game in Portland, TN. I was about 9 at the time. The Titans beat the Jags twice this year and was meeting them for a third time to go to the Super Bowl.

The game was in Jacksonville so of course, they were doing flyovers of the city and showing snapshots of the beach. My mom nudged my Dad and said, “you know, they have an Air Force base down there…you should apply and see what happens”. My dad somewhat shrugged it off. After the game, we were extremely excited and watched the post game interview with Jeff Fisher calling Jacksonville, “our second home.”  

Shortly after my dad applied for a job, he had multiplied interviews and before we knew it, we moved to Jacksonville Beach just months later. 

I’ve now lived here for 22 years, met my wife, have a good core group of friends, and fully involved in the local community. I surprise people all the time when I tell them I’m a Titans fan. 

It’s safe to say, I’m the most Jacksonvillian Titans fan there is. I will do my duty and rep Jacksonville as the Titans second home, as long as I can. With every DUVAL I hear, I yell a TITAN UP to remind them who their daddy is. 

TL;DR: My family and I relocated to Jacksonville after watching this game to represent the Titans in our second home.",10.0,tennesseetitans,t3_x39mv9,False,0.0,Mike Vrabel,2022-09-01T11:06:35Z,tennesseetitans,2.491329350439725e-05

Basically I use the line/polygon lasso to cut out the things I want to recolor (helmet, pants, arm band, shoulder stripes) and copy them to a new layer. I then go to adjustments and select black and white. From the B&W menu I take the color (red in this case) and bring up the white value until it closely matched the natural whites in the picture.



Once it's white I use the wand to select the outside of said layer and right click to select inverse, create a new layer and paint bucket in the color I want to change it to and then change the layer visibility from the layers tab, scrolling down from normal to multiply.



That's pretty much it. It's not perfect but Idk how theses things are supposed to be done, I've just messed with Photoshop long enough to brute force a thing or too.

I used to run counters out of the shotgun in older Maddens, but that has been impossible to do for years cause you get tackled immediately!

The bad is his body. While he will scratch and claw for everything his body can't handle it. The Jags broke his Leg and he lost more than the ability to walk that day. He wasn't the same quarterback at all after that. 

Then he had a nerve injury and he lost alot of his throwing power. He couldn't feel anything in his hand for months, and could barely hold on to the football to throw it on a slant. 

But he isn't a aggressive kinda guy he hesitates to throw the ball into windows, and decides not to make the throw often. He isn't a guy who throws 50/50 balls either.

32163,170675,170675,Wright606,"1. The ""AAS is a great owner and turned the team around"" takes we routinely see going semi-viral are braindead. Owners have ONE job. Supply the billion or more in capital necessary to run an NFL team. In our case, the owner just inherited her money too. AAS delegates everything else to other, qualified pros. ""not interfering"" isn't the same thing as turning the team around. It's the expectation. Having a previous terrible owner who tried to intervene doesn't make her responsible for the team turning around. That credit goes to the coaches, players, and Jon Robinson. And when I reply with these facts on social media, Titans fans act like it's anathema and we must worship the owner for not actively kneecapping the team like Bud Adams frequently did. 

2. Vrabel's demeanor and lack of professionalism in public appearances and media stuff is funny, but it wouldn't fly at all on any team that wasn't winning. Ultimately, winning fixes anything. But his disrespect to basically everyone he interacts with on camera is a bad look for the team. It also fails to utilize media as a way to promote the team's brand - basically it's a missed opportunity. Currently, there's very little if any consequence because the team is winning, so fans don't care. But if Vrabel weren't a spectacular coach with a great front office and great talent, stuff would start to come apart at the seams. And it's basically impossible to keep a team winning forever in the league. When we inevitably regress (and I hope it's more like 10 or 20 years from now) if Vrabel is still HC at that point, he'd have to change his public demeanor. And all of this does Vrabel no favors. When he makes big public mistakes on the field, like his punt against the Ravens in the 2020 WC, the ""winning coach"" aura temporarily fades and it kind of exposes how he cannot handle criticism or interact will with fans/media. 

3. The fan perception of Ryan Tannehill as a bridge QB is actually delusional. And they're really not going to like it when he gets his next contract extension. But I don't really care about how they feel. I know full well that it's coming, and I'm just going to log of Twitter and this sub for a while when it does. Beyond that, I definitely think Tannehill's performance regressed this year, but everyone has identified pretty clear reasons for that - the entire offense getting injured, the offensive coordinator, and the bigger emphasis on the passing offense after Henry went down. 

4. Trading AJ Brown at the 2022 deadline is not a horrible idea. He's going to command like $30M a year. I would much rather franchise tag him in 2023 than pay that, but the tag may skyrocket because of the new WR market, and he might holdout if he were tagged if the tag price is remotely affordable, especially if he has an excellent season in 2022, as we all hope he does. But if he has a top-3, healthy year, I would be OK trading him for like 2 1sts and a replacement level WR on a rookie/cheap deal. It would just be an admission that the WR market is unjustifiable and we made some bad restructure decisions in prior years and couldn't really afford it, and wanted to cash in and rebuild. This deal would make a lot more sense if we have a mediocre record at the deadline, or if Tannehill or Henry were injured. I ultimately hope it doesn't end that way, but given AJ's injuries and lack of elite production so far, I could see it happening and I would be disappointed but not furious. 

5. Derrick Henry is the next Frank Gore. I think this injury was a one-off, and barring a catastrophic injury, I think he's going to be among the greatest running backs to ever play football. I think he'll still be giving us elite production well into his 30s, and possibly still be in the league close to 40. I think he's just a different level of athlete than the entire league, and the typical ideas about RB durability do not apply to him until proven otherwise. Of course, catastrophic injuries and concussions do not take into account his general health and durability. There's no level of conditioning that stopped his broken foot this year. But assuming that is fully healed, I see no reason why he's going to slow down. 

6. Our WR room is fine. In fact, our entire starting lineup at all positions is excellent. The one area where we need a massive talent infusion is OT. I love Taylor Lewan, but it's time to draft a rookie to be our future LT, and maybe Radunz is, and maybe he isn't. It's too soon to tell. But we also need a RT. I totally expect our first three picks will involve two OTs, a WR, and possibly a guard. But given the fantastic quality of the roster, and the depth, I could see us drafting basically any position and just choosing whoever they think has the best pro potential. I'd rank the needs as OTx2, LG, CB, WR, NT and then a steep drop off to all other positions. Given that, don't be surprised if we select some complete shocker positions like EDGE, C, QB, TE etc. It just makes no sense to reach for needs when we might have one or two rookies at best with decent chances for starting reps this year - and possibly none if Radunz, Farley, and NWI continue their upward trends. 

6. Harold Landry is a bit overrated. If you watch closely, a shocking amount of his sacks are blown assignments and completely free runs to the QB, or protection mismatches like TEs and RBs getting assigned to stop him. He has elite EDGE speed, and he's certainly above average at the rest of his game. But I don't think he or Dupree are anywhere near elite at their positions. Simmons and Autry are the generators of the pressure, Landry just capitalized off that and played well otherwise in a contract year.

32170,170691,170691,Wright606,"Mariota never got hurt running. His injuries exclusively came on sacks. So the ""doesn't protect himself"" narrative is irrelevant. 

Also it's highly misleading to say he never played a 16 game season. He played 17 games in 2017 (missed one regular season game, played 2 playoff games). He also didn't get hurt in 2019 at all, or 2020 - granted he was on the bench, but he was playing in gimmick packages for TEN and LV, plus one nearly full game in LV. This matters because he's been almost totally injury free for 3 years now, and hasn't been getting hit. He took several big hits in his one Vegas game and popped back up each time. 

Overall the most honest way to show how hurt he's been is to look at his pro football reference. His starts by year:
1. 12
2. 15
3. 15 (plus two playoff games) 
4. 14

What went wrong - injuries. It was really just a string of bad injuries, in particular a devastating nerve injury in his throwing arm, all of which stunted his development so he never went from good to great. The even bigger reason we moved on is that Tannehill immediately outclassed Mariota's best season. 

Most people agree that lingering nerve issues and regression related to not developing because of it, led to Mariota's bad stretch to start 2019.

We didnt know how good we had it, and so we underrated him, but AJ knew. And I speculate that he knew it was not a one week benching. He felt like Mariota's time as franchise QB was over, and turnover at QB is almost always bad for the WRs, but it wasn't for Brown in retrospect.

32174,170705,170705,Wright606,"Ban all kicking except punts. Onside kicks replaced by 4th and 15 at your own 10. If your offense turns the ball over on downs inside your opponent's 25 yard line scores you 1 point. It's worth 3 if you do that inside the 10. The goal posts are removed entirely. Each half, the coin toss winner starts the ball at their 30 yard line. 

Also the second playoff tiebreaker (after head to head if applicable) is net points on the season. 

Defensive touchdowns are worth eight instead of six. Punt return touchdowns too. 

If a lateral hits the ground without touching a receiving player first, it cannot be a turnover. If the other side falls on it, it's like downing a punt. This applies to defensive laterals too, so every INT becomes a game of rugby. 

All protections for QBs are removed. Running into the punter is removed, but roughing still exists because they're so vulnerable while midair. Late hits on the sideline are legal as long as they aren't unreasonably late (like by the Gatorade jug) or after the whistle. 

You can no longer delay the game by sitting on ballcarriers for excessive time. This is already technically illegal but I would enforce it. 

The instant a receiver has possession and two feet, they have possession. If they drop it after that, it's a fumble. 

If a fumble goes out of bounds, the last team to touch the ball gets possession. Fumbles out the back (or side) of the end zone are now a 10 yard penalty from the LOS, not a touchback. 

Only 8 out of 32 teams make the playoffs. Playogf byes are outlawed and the extra week generated by this allocates a 2nd bye week to every team. Regualr bye weeks are standardized and rotating so,no one gets week 5 or week 13 or whatever. Primetime games are also standardized so small markets get an equal number. Games are played 7 days a week, with an emphasis on prime time on week days. All conferences and divisions are abolished. You still play your old division rivals twice a season, until 2032.

First off, Nissan stadium is not in great shape. The renovations needed to bring it up to standards would cost marginally less than an entirely new stadium. The Adams family isn’t Jerry Jones, they literally could go broke and still not be able to fund an entirely new stadium. The alternative would be to move the team to a different city, have THEM pay for it, and then we’re shit out of luck, just like Houston when we took the Oilers, the Rams, Oakland etc. 

Second, y’all underestimate how much money Nashville makes off our tourism industry. We don’t just play 8 games of football in the stadium and call it a year, Nissan gets used continuously for concerts, events etc. The plan is to make the new stadium a dome, which would further increase the events we can host year round 5 minutes walking to our tourism hotbed. On top of all the country music and other events we already host, we’ll be able to host Super Bowls, college playoffs, SEC tournaments etc. Each of these events generates millions of dollars of revenue on Broadway. All of that in turn generates millions in tax revenue. 

This isn’t just chucking 500m into some billionaires pockets, there’s a lot more that goes into this. It’s not an unreasonable expectation to have the city pay a portion of a stadium that the city will OWN, and the public will use frequently and generate revenue from.

2021 | Caleb Farley | Christian Darrisaw | too soon to tell, leaning no
2020 | Isaiah Wilson | doesn't matter (Noah Igbinoghene) | yes
2019 | Jeffrey Simmons | Noah Fant | hell no

2013 | Chance Warmack | D.J. Fluker | yes 
2012 | Kendall Wright | Chandler Jones | yes

Jones instead of Kendall Wright is obviously a huge upgrade. Fluker over Warmack is too, though it probably wouldn't move the needle much. 4 years ago you'd probably say yes on Lewan for OBJ, but now it's a no. Mariota didn't work out but rolling with Mettenberger for Fowler wouldn't be any better. Keep Conk over Floyd, pretty easy. Adams over Davis is easy with hindsight too, even with how much of a meme Jamal Adams is now. Jackson for Howard is basically a wash, but Adoree played good for us the first couple years. Wynn is a good but unspectacular upgrade over Evans. Big Jeff and Wilson would be kept and kicked unceremoniously to the curb, respectively, and finally we have last year where Farley barely played and is far too soon to tell. I think the answer is no, since at this point Jones would probably have moved on to other pastures, Adams would have forced his way off the team, and we'd lose Big Jeff on a rookie contract which is crazy good value.",1.0,nfl,t3_ucmgh1,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-04-26T17:52:03Z,tennesseetitans,-0.0290703662999513

He sees Burks, completely unable to get separation, slowed down from his broken wrist and his skipped breakfast of albuterol. He sees Woods running the wrong route, not looking his direction, his ACL has fallen off. Austin Hooper is dead. He looks deep down the field and sees double coverage, but a glimmer of hope. One last spark of hope for humanity. He throws deep. Its going to the back corner, but the coverage is too tight, there is too much traffic, the ball is too high, there is no way he is going to connect, no mere mortal could bring this ball in... Suddenly we see the majestic hands of our lord and savior JOSH GORDON slowly rise up. The light blazing around his body is so bright it causes everyone in the stadium to shield their eyes. He is in the air for what seems like minutes, slowly rising, rising, rising. He makes the perfect one handed catch, He keeps rising. He is 20 feet above the goalposts now. The clouds open up and a single beam of sunlight falls to the field as JOSH GORDON does a forward flip and comes slamming down to the ground in a marvel-like superhero landing. The shock-wave from his landing causes the entire opposing team to fall to the ground with CTE. Miraculously, everyone on the Titans is unharmed, Ryan Tannehill is young again, Burks no longer needs an inhaler, and Hooper is still dead on the field. The crowd goes wild. The Titans win.

So... *yes*? I think his problems are fixable in that they're all things that can be taught and learned, as opposed to if he physically just didn't have the ability. But I think that's also true of the majority of bad QBs in the league.

My real answer is that it's just too early to have any idea. He has real potential, which is what he was drafted for. We've seen enough Woodside to know that Woodside doesn't really have the potential to be a legit starting QB. That doesn't mean that Willis will end up being a better QB than Woodside in the long run. It just means that he can. I think he probably will, but we won't know for a while yet.

> It’s not a good sign to be missing so much time when you’re so young, I know injuries can be freaky but it’s hard for the Titans to pay top 5 money (again, he was reportedly asking for record setting guarantees from the Titans) to a player when he can’t stay healthy for the last 2 seasons when he’s only been there for 3.

The first comma should likely be converted to a semicolon or simply a period. I might consider the word *fluky* instead of *freaky* just given other common definitions. There should be a comma before *but* because there's an independent clause both before and after it. The parenthetical is a full sentence, so you can capitalize it and put a period just before the close parenth if you like. I might consider altering the final phrase to *when he hasn't stayed healthy the last two seasons and has only been there for three*. 

> The 2021 Titans had one of the worst pass blocking offensive line in the league.

*line* should be *lines*.

> Everyone before the season thought that Anthony Firkser could step up and be that guy but he did not step up at all.

It's not a ""rebuild"" draft, but it is imperative to begin replenishing with younger talent in order to continue a competitive product on the field in the near future. 

We have not been hitting on draft picks for a number of years now and the core of the team is now beginning to age. Byard, Lewan, Tannehill, Henry, Ben Jones... These are names I think we all associate with the ""Tennessee Titans"" identity right now. But there is not a solid core of youth coming in behind them. You had a veteran like Rodger Saffold just depart in free agency. You're still looking to fill your starting RT and LG positions (let alone your LT who has maybe 2-3 more years, at most, of peak performance on him). You don't know what you have in Caleb Farley yet. You're relying on Robert Woods (30) to provide production at WR. 

Point is, you don't have guys like Corey Davis, Adore Jackson, Isaiah Wilson, Dane Cruikshank, DeAndre Walker, etc., etc., etc. here on this team to replenish and replace talent that is aging (or, in AJ's case, pricing) itself out. I just don't think you can look past the older players I mentioned above and see who the future of this team is beyond Simmons and *maybe* Hooker? Who are our studs under 25?

AJ Brown is considered one of the top tier wide receivers in the league, with his star on the rise. The truth is he is the first Tennessee draft pick to pan out like this in...

51700,298736,298736,trick96,"#VII. Schedule and Predictions

I really don’t like doing schedule predictions, especially before preseason is over. I will not be doing score predictions. So here goes:

**Week 1 – vs New York Giants:** This is a must win for the Titans if they want to have a good season, but the Giants will likely be much improved from last season and I feel like the Titans will find a way to lose a very weird week 1 game. **L, 0-1**

**Week 2 - @ Buffalo Bills (MNF):** Bills will be looking to stop their 2-loss streak to the Titans, both of which were also on primetime. Bills look scary good. **L, 0-2**

**Week 3 – vs Las Vegas Raiders:** Look it’s the only team that had a worse 2020 first round draft than the Titans. Great team though. **W, 1-2**

**Week 4 - @ Indianapolis Colts:** Colts should be better this season than last season thanks to one simple trick of throwing away Carson Wentz. **L, 1-3**

**Week 5 – Washington Commanders:** This is another one that can be filed under must win to have a good season. Should be a great defensive game. **W, 2-3**

**Week 6 – Bye Week**

**Week 7 – Indianapolis Colts:** Much like last year, the two Titans/Colts games will be over early in the year. If one team can win both these games, it should have a massive effect on the outcome of the season. Luckily for this game, the Titans will be coming off a bye week and will be at home. The Titans under Mike Vrabel are [undefeated in the regular season with extra time to prepare](https://new.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rv2wva/why_is_the_potential_of_having_a_bye_week_so/) with an average score of 29.6 – 10.9. **W, 3-3**

**Week 8 - @ Houston Texans** The Titans will extend their winning streak to 3 with a win here. *W, 4-3**

**Week 9 – @ Kansas City Chiefs (SNF):** The Titans are 2-0 against Patrick Mahomes in the regular season. The Titans will be 5+ point underdogs in this game but manage to win. **W, 5-3**

**Week 10 – vs Denver Broncos:** Russell Wilson is way overrated. **W, 6-3**

**Week 11 - @ Green Bay Packers (TNF):** I have never been more confident in predicting a loss. Titans 5 game winning streak ends. **L, 6-4**

**Week 12 – vs Cincinnati Bengals:** This game is circled on the calendar and Mike Vrabel is undefeated the week after TNF games. **W, 7-4**

**Week 13 - @ Philadelphia Eagles:** If AJ Brown is still healthy, he is going to shit on the Titans. **L, 7-5**

**Week 14 – vs Jacksonville Jaguars:** Very late first game with the Jaguars. I will not predict a loss to the Jaguars until I see Trevor Lawrence be a good QB. **W, 8-5**

**Week 15 - @ Los Angeles Chargers:** Herbie gud. **L, 8-6**

**Week 16 – Houston Texans:** Titans sweep the Texans as revenge for not sweeping them last year. **W, 9-6**

**Week 17 – vs Dallas Cowboys (TNF):** An outdoor night game in December? Yeah, Derrick Henry will be going nuts. **W, 10-6**

**Week 18 - @ Jacksonville Jaguars:** Mike Vrabel is undefeated coming off of TNF + I will not predict a loss to the Jaguars until I see Trevor Lawrence be a good QB. **W, 11-6**

#Overall: 11-6 (5-1 Division), 1st AFC South

The Titans will be AFC South champions for the 3rd year in a row. 1st place because there is not way geriatric ass Matt Ryan is winning 11 games with the Colts, their hype this off-season is insane to me. Also I would like to say it’s bullshit the Titans have to play 2 TNF games.",22.0,nfl,t3_wb2hlf,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-07-29T06:39:39Z,tennesseetitans,0.0013019335213229
51701,298737,298737,trick96,"**DL:** Jeffery Simmons is the best DT in the AFC and Denico Autry just had the best year of his long career. Big Jeff still has room to grow his game, as he still needs to be more consistent game to game. Titans have good nose tackles as well, but depth is a concern for this group. **Elite.**

**OLB:** Bud Dupree had a down year last year, but much like Taylor Lewan, I expect him to be better another year removed from his ACL injury. Harold Landry has a big contract to live up to, but it’s important to note that he does so much more for this team than just rush the passer, so to judge him solely on his pass rushing ability is disingenuous. He is a great, complete edge player who rarely comes off the field. Good depth here with a 2nd year player many are excited about in Rashad Weaver, who flashed in the preseason last year but had his season cut short due to injury.  **Good.**

**ILB:** David Long Jr is borderline elite. You probably don’t know much about him if you’re not a Titans fan, but you should. He is a complete 3-down linebacker, he’s great against the run and the pass. He flies to the football with and makes plays. His breakout season was shortened due to having a hamstring injury in the middle of it, so that didn’t help his name recognition, but regardless I can’t wait to watch him play this year. Meanwhile Zach Cunningham is one of the best run defenders in the league and competent in pass coverage. This duo is very quietly one of the best in the league.   Depth is a major concern for this group, Monty Rice is the primary backup for both of these guys but he started camp on PUP after an Achilles injury last season. I’m not sure there’s another NFL level LB on the roster behind those three players. **Elite.**

**CB:** This is the most interesting group on defense, mostly because it’s the only group with a new starter and that starter happens to be an interesting case. Caleb Farley was viewed as an elite talent coming out, with potential to be a top 10 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. However, he had surgery on an injured back and due to concerns with that he fell all the way to the 20’s where the Titans picked him up. He missed a lot of training camp due to a separate injury then missed the first few games of the season and ended up only playing in 3 games last season due to tearing his ACL. So now the Titans have a lot of their eggs in the basket of a highly talented player that has had a back surgery and an ACL reconstruction in the last 20 months. Farley participated in minicamp and will not begin training camp on PUP so he will be ready to go. Farley is an absolute wildcard for this defense, but good news for Farley is that he has a ton of good players around him to make things easier. Other than Farley, there’s Kristian Fulton who had a breakout season in 2021 and Elijah Molden in the slot who will look to improve upon his good rookie season. Decent depth here with an early 2nd round pick in McCreary, Chris Jackson who played a lot last year, and Greg Mabin who famously played 100% of the snaps against the Chiefs last season in a game where the Titans held Patrick Mahomes to only 3 points, the lowest amount of points he’s ever score in his life.  **Above Average with potential to be good or average/below average.**

**S:** Amani Hooker had a fantastic breakout season last year. He’s only the 2nd best safety on the team but he had one of the best seasons last year of any safety in the league in 2021. Meanwhile Kevin Byard remains absolutely elite in every way. One thing the Titans love about these guys is they are elite run defenders and are a big reason our rush defense was so good last season. Depth is a major concern here as well. This safety duo is absolutely insane.  **Best In The League.**

**Overall Defense:** I truly believe the Titans defense is one of the most slept on things in the entire NFL. They were fantastic last year, and this year the only significant changes are: replacing Jackrabbit Jenkins with Caleb Farley, having Zach Cunningham for the entire season, and hopefully less injuries. I mean the Titans didn’t even lose a defensive coach (that they didn’t fire). Amani Hooker, David Long Jr, and Kristian Fulton are all budding stars that nobody is talking about, they all had breakout seasons last year. This defense could possibly carry this team to the playoffs this season. I can’t believe how young of a defense it is. Denico Autry is the only player over 30, having just turned 32 and coming off the best year of his career. Bud Dupree is 29. Then Kevin Byard at 28. Cunningham at 27. Then every single other player on the starting defense is either on their rookie contract or have yet to play a snap of their 2nd contract (Harold Landry). If you want to know more about the defensive scheme the Titans run, [here is the /u/NoFlagsFilm breakdown on Shane Bowen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F41eoZu-qF8). Overall, here is how I see this defense: It will be one of the best, if not the best rush defense in the league this year without a doubt. It comes down to one player to decide just how good this defense will be in 2022. If Caleb Farley is bad, this defense will still be good. If Caleb Farley is just competent, this defense will be elite. And if Caleb Farley is good, this defense will be damn near the best defense in the league, if not THE best. **Elite with potential to be the best in the league or just good depending almost entirely on one unproven player with ridiculously high potential.**

**Special Teams:** Worth pointing out that K Caleb Shudak got the 2nd most guaranteed money of all the Titans UDFA’s, so the Titans clearly wanted to have a real battle for the kicker spot. However, Shudak was injured in minicamp and will begin camp on PUP, so the competition is likely over before it starts unless Shudak can get healthy soon. Kicker could be an issue for the Titans, but Randy Bulluck was solid for them last season though he has limited range. Punter Brett Kern (who has been with the team since 2009) took a pay cut to remain with the team this offseason, last season was the first season I’ve ever seen where he looked human punting the ball. If the Titans want to be the run first, defensive team they’re designed to be they really want Brett Kern to recapture his former glory. UDFA P Ryan Stonehouse is a dark horse to take Kerns job. **Below Average.**",12.0,nfl,t3_wb2hlf,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-07-29T06:39:18Z,tennesseetitans,4.4926172132660894e-08
51702,298738,298738,trick96,"###VI. Roster Evaluation

**Position groups:**

I will give a brief description of how I see each group as well as give a grade for each group. My grading scale is Bad = bottom 5 in the league, below average = 27-19, average = 18-14 above average = 13-9, good = 8-6, elite = top 5.

**QB:** I addressed Tannehill and Willis already. The other QB, Logan Woodside, has been with the team for years now. The Titans have tried to replace him several times with players like Trevor Siemian, DeShone Kizer, and most recently Matt Barkley but nobody has seemed to be able to take his spot. Most believe he will be the number 2 QB this season. Next season either Willis will be the #2 QB (most likely) or Tannehill will be released and Willis will start. **Average with above average potential**

**Backfield:** Many believe that 2021 was the beginning of the end for Derrick Henry since he had a “major” injury. I want to push back on that. First of all, obviously he played in the playoffs so he’s had an entire offseason to get back to his former self. Second, it really wasn’t a “major” injury, it was really just an injury he couldn’t continue playing on. Any other common injury is much more significant, I would argue even a hamstring injury would have been more concerning for his future. [Here’s a study on NBA players that says the majority of NBA players who have a Jones fracture return to prior level of performance and elite athletes demonstrate no decrease in performance on their return to play](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26627111/). Now if you want to argue that the end is near for King Henry because of his age, then sure I can’t argue that other than by saying Henry is a freak of nature and I hope you’re wrong. I just want to be clear that his 2021 injury will not be the reason his career declines, even if he does have a down year this season. Tory Carter is an awesome fullback to watch, he just abuses people. **King**

**TE:** This TE group, while still not great, is miles better than what it was last season. If the offense as a whole is any better in 2022, I would bet every cent I have it’s mainly because of this group, specifically because of Austin Hooper. We have a competent receiving/blocking TE in Austin Hooper, an okay blocking TE in Geoff Swaim, and pure athletic rookie with Jonnu Smith type potential in Chig Okonkwo.  **Below Average with average potential**

**WR:** This group relies heavily on two types of players you never want to have to rely on: a rookie and a player coming off a torn ACL. The good news is that both players are very talented. There isn’t a lot of depth behind them though, and I would still expect the Titans to add one more piece to this room (my guess would be Will Fuller). I believe Kyle Phillips will play right away in the slot and be solid. **Below Average with potential to be average or bad**

**OL:** Taylor Lewan at LT  had a tough year last year coming off of a torn ACL but he got better as the season went on and most players are better in their 2nd year from a torn ACL than their first. Ben Jones played like a top 10 center last year, so those are the two spots the Titans should feel really good about. Nate Davis at RG took a bit of a step back last season, but he has shown before that he can be a good player and is at least a solid option. RT is likely to be Dillon Radunz, a 2021 2nd round pick who did not play much last season. He did start one game at LT and held up relatively well against Nick Bosa ([/u/NoFlagsFilm Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZuEQBvZI90)), so he certainly has potential. I have no idea who is going to start at LG, but I would very much like the Titans to sign Ereck Flowers and plug him in there. I truly believe that alone would take this line from bad to at least average.  **Bad with below average potential because of LG and RT being total question marks.**

**Overall offense:** Here is the quick argument I can make for this offense: if Robert Woods, Treylon Burks, Austin Hooper, Derrick Henry, and of course Ryan Tannehill can all stay healthy this year then this offense will likely be better in 2022. How is that possible? In 2021 AJ Brown and Julio Jones combined to go 94/1304/6. I don’t think anybody would argue that if Burks and Woods stay healthy, they will out produce that. Not to mention how much of a big deal having a competent TE is.  **Below Average.**",28.0,nfl,t3_wb2hlf,False,0.0,:Titans: Titans,2022-07-29T06:38:54Z,tennesseetitans,5.397584822682713e-06

51722,298758,298758,trick96,"#VII. Schedule and Predictions

I really don’t like doing schedule predictions, especially before preseason is over. I will not be doing score predictions. So here goes:

**Week 1 – vs New York Giants:** This is a must win for the Titans if they want to have a good season, but the Giants will likely be much improved from last season. **W, 1-0**

**Week 2 - @ Buffalo Bills (MNF):** Bills will be looking to stop their 2-loss streak to the Titans, both of which were also on primetime. Bills look scary good. **L, 1-1**

**Week 3 – vs Las Vegas Raiders:** Look it’s the only team that had a worse 2020 first round draft than the Titans. Great team though. **W, 2-1**

**Week 4 - @ Indianapolis Colts:** Colts should be better this season than last season thanks to one simple trick of throwing away Carson Wentz. **L, 2-2**

**Week 5 – Washington Commanders:** This is another one that can be filed under must win to have a good season. Should be a great defensive game. **W, 3-2**

**Week 6 – Bye Week**

**Week 7 – Indianapolis Colts:** Much like last year, the two Titans/Colts games will be over early in the year. If one team can win both these games, it should have a massive effect on the outcome of the season. Luckily for this game, the Titans will be coming off a bye week and will be at home. The Titans under Mike Vrabel are [undefeated in the regular season with extra time to prepare](https://new.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/rv2wva/why_is_the_potential_of_having_a_bye_week_so/) with an average score of 29.6 – 10.9. **W, 4-2**

**Week 8 - @ Houston Texans** The Titans will extend their winning streak to 3 with a win here. **5-2**

**Week 9 – @ Kansas City Chiefs (SNF):** The Titans are 2-0 against Patrick Mahomes in the regular season. The Titans will be 5+ point underdogs in this game but manage to win. **W, 6-2**

**Week 10 – vs Denver Broncos:** The 5 game winning streak ends here when Russell Wilson and the Broncos come to town. **L, 6-3**

**Week 11 - @ Green Bay Packers (TNF):** I have never been more confident in predicting a loss. **L, 6-4**

**Week 12 – vs Cincinnati Bengals:** This game is circled on the calendar and Mike Vrabel is undefeated the week after TNF games. **W, 7-4**

**Week 13 - @ Philadelphia Eagles:** If AJ Brown is still healthy, he is going to shit on the Titans. **L, 7-5**

**Week 14 – vs Jacksonville Jaguars:** Very late first game with the Jaguars. I will not predict a loss to the Jaguars until I see Trevor Lawrence be a good QB. **W, 8-5**

**Week 15 - @ Los Angeles Chargers:** Herbie gud. **L, 8-6**

**Week 16 – Houston Texans:** Titans sweep the Texans as revenge for not sweeping them last year. **W, 9-6**

**Week 17 – vs Dallas Cowboys (TNF):** An outdoor night game in December? Yeah, Derrick Henry will be going nuts. **W, 10-6**

**Week 18 - @ Jacksonville Jaguars:** Mike Vrabel is undefeated coming off of TNF + I will not predict a loss to the Jaguars until I see Trevor Lawrence be a good QB. **W, 11-6**

#Overall: 11-6 (5-1 Division), 1st AFC South

The Titans will be AFC South champions for the 3rd year in a row. Also I would like to say it’s bullshit the Titans have to play 2 TNF games.",13.0,tennesseetitans,t3_w9dbhn,False,0.0,:6::5:,2022-07-27T07:25:07Z,tennesseetitans,0.0014002534350256
51723,298759,298759,trick96,"**DL:** Jeffery Simmons is the best DT in the AFC and Denico Autry just had the best year of his long career. Big Jeff still has room to grow his game, as he still needs to be more consistent game to game. Titans have good nose tackles as well, but depth is a concern for this group. **Elite.**

**OLB:** Bud Dupree had a down year last year, but much like Taylor Lewan, I expect him to be better another year removed from his ACL injury. Harold Landry has a big contract to live up to, but it’s important to note that he does so much more for this team than just rush the passer, so to judge him solely on his pass rushing ability is disingenuous. He is a great, complete edge player who rarely comes off the field. Good depth here with a 2nd year player many are excited about in Rashad Weaver, who flashed in the preseason last year but had his season cut short due to injury.  **Good.**

**ILB:** David Long Jr is borderline elite. You probably don’t know much about him if you’re not a Titans fan, but you should. He is a complete 3-down linebacker, he’s great against the run and the pass. He flies to the football with and makes plays. His breakout season was shortened due to having a hamstring injury in the middle of it, so that didn’t help his name recognition, but regardless I can’t wait to watch him play this year. Meanwhile Zach Cunningham is one of the best run defenders in the league and competent in pass coverage. This duo is very quietly one of the best in the league.  **Elite.**

**CB:** This is the most interesting group on defense, mostly because it’s the only group with a new starter and that starter happens to be an interesting case. Caleb Farley was viewed as an elite talent coming out, with potential to be a top 10 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. However, he had surgery on an injured back and due to concerns with that he fell all the way to the 20’s where the Titans picked him up. He missed a lot of training camp due to a separate injury then missed the first few games of the season and ended up only playing in 3 games last season due to tearing his ACL. So now the Titans have a lot of their eggs in the basket of a highly talented player that has had a back surgery and ACL surgery in the last year and a half. Farley participated in minicamp and will not begin training camp on PUP so he will be ready to go. Farley is an absolute wildcard for this defense, but good news for Farley is that he has a ton of good players around him to make things easier. Other than Farley, there’s Kristian Fulton who had a breakout season in 2021 and Elijah Molden in the slot who will look to improve upon his good rookie season. **Above Average with potential to be good or average/below average.**

**S:** Amani Hooker had a fantastic breakout season last year. He’s only the 2nd best safety on the team but he had one of the best seasons last year of any safety in the league in 2021. Meanwhile Kevin Byard remains absolutely elite in every way. This safety duo is absolutely insane.  **Best In The League.**

**Overall Defense:** I truly believe the Titans defense is one of the most slept on things in the entire NFL. They were fantastic last year, and this year the only significant changes are: replacing Jackrabbit Jenkins with Caleb Farley, having Zach Cunningham for the entire season, and hopefully less injuries. I mean the Titans didn’t even lose a defensive coach (that they didn’t fire). Amani Hooker, David Long Jr, and Kristian Fulton are all budding stars that nobody is talking about, they all had breakout seasons last year. This defense could possibly carry this team to the playoffs this season. I can’t believe how young of a defense it is. Denico Autry is the only player over 30, having just turned 32 and coming off the best year of his career. Bud Dupree is 29. Then Kevin Byard at 28. Cunningham at 27. Then every single other player on the starting defense is either on their rookie contract or have yet to play a snap of their 2nd contract (Harold Landry). If you want to know more about the defensive scheme the Titans run, [here is the /u/NoFlagsFilm breakdown on Shane Bowen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F41eoZu-qF8). Overall, here is how I see this defense: It comes down to one player to decide just how good this defense will be in 2022. If Caleb Farley is bad, this defense will still be good. If Caleb Farley is just competent, this defense will be elite. And if Caleb Farley is good, this defense will be damn near the best defense in the league, if not THE best. **Elite with potential to be the best in the league or just good depending almost entirely on one unproven player with ridiculously high potential.**

**Special Teams:** Worth pointing out that K Caleb Shudak got the 2nd most guaranteed money of all the Titans UDFA’s, so the Titans clearly wanted to have a real battle for the kicker spot. However, Shudak was injured in minicamp and will begin camp on PUP, so the competition is likely over before it starts unless Shudak can get healthy soon. Kicker could be an issue for the Titans, but Randy Bulluck was solid for them last season though he has limited range. Punter Brett Kern (who has been with the team since 2009) took a pay cut to remain with the team this offseason, last season was the first season I’ve ever seen where he looked human punting the ball. If the Titans want to be the run first, defensive team they’re designed to be they really want Brett Kern to recapture his former glory. **Below Average.**",8.0,tennesseetitans,t3_w9dbhn,False,0.0,:6::5:,2022-07-27T07:24:57Z,tennesseetitans,3.985542577392136e-06
51724,298760,298760,trick96,"###VI. Roster Evaluation

**Position groups:**

I will give a brief description of how I see each group as well as give a grade for each group. My grading scale is Bad = bottom 5 in the league, below average = 27-19, average = 18-14 above average = 13-9, good = 8-6, elite = top 5.

**QB:** I addressed Tannehill and Willis already. The other QB, Logan Woodside, has been with the team for years now. The Titans have tried to replace him several times with players like Trevor Siemian, DeShone Kizer, and most recently Matt Barkley but nobody has seemed to be able to take his spot. Most believe he will be the number 2 QB this season. Next season either Willis will be the #2 QB (most likely) or Tannehill will be released and Willis will start. **Average with above average potential**
