I do give the Bears credit for having the Chargers take on the rest of the deal, but a 2nd and 6th pick has to hurt after what was given up.           
        
We were never ranked better than 25th on most metrics when Mack was here because we had holes everywhere. Taking a 17-22 million cap hit the next 5 years would have kept us in the same place. Multiple reports have proven we offered him deal that was very fair and he decided to not only hold out, but didn't even come to any team activities to be with his teammates regardless if would practice or not ( he still had a year left on his deal, we could have played hardball with him). He wanted out 100%, which as much as it hurts to say it was probably smart of him to move on from the dumpster fire we have been.

>The Raiders have opted against tendering fullback Alex Ingold, which means he will become a free agent able to sign with any club when the market opens on March 16.

>In another offseason move ahead of free agency, the Raiders restructured the contracts of left tackle Kolton Miller and running back Kenyan Drake to clear just over $14 million in cap space. The Raiders are now $34 million under the cap.

>Ingold, who scored the first NFL touchdown in Allegiant Stadium history and grew into a fan favorite over his three seasons with the Raiders, had his 2021 season cut short when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in Week 10 against the Kansas City Chiefs.

>“Gut-wrenching and heartbreaking” is how Ingold described his feelings upon being informed of the Raiders’ decision. “It feels like I’m going undrafted all over again.”

>While no doors are being closed for a return, at this point Ingold is expected to hit the open market next week.

>An undrafted free agent out of Wisconsin in 2019, Ingold won a roster spot as a fierce blocker and short-yardage runner who could also catch out of the backfield.

>Over three seasons he caught 28 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown and ran 15 times for 22 yards.

>But it was his role as a blocker and team leader that resonated in the locker room and with fans. At the time of his injury, Ingold was grading out as the second-best pass blocker among NFL fullbacks, according to Pro Football Focus.

>“It’s a tough circumstance that nobody can really control and I get it,” Ingold said. “Just have to lock in on what I can control and be the best Alec Ingold I can be.”

>With his future uncertain, Ingold is hoping for the best for the Raiders.

>“I wish the Raiders the best of luck,” he said. “I know all those guys in that building have a vision of what needs to happen to finish what we started. I’m really excited to see that manifest. My future is all about getting healthy and being a better football player after this ACL than before.”

>Ingold said the road to recovery is going well, and the goal is to be full-go by the time training camp opens.

>“I’m over three months post-operation now and crushing the rehab,” he said. “I’m excited to be fully cleared by training camp wherever that might be and take all of these lessons and hardships and turn it into a heck of a 2022 campaign.”",17.0,raiders,t3_tb8rgy,False,0.0,:24:,2022-03-10T15:05:57Z,raiders,0.0254325899136674

12657,102115,102115,MrAmericanIdiot,"Here’s a list of players I’d start looking into. The stars/above average of the team.  
  
QB: Derek Carr  
RB: Josh Jacobs, Kenyan Drake  
WR: Davante Adams, Hunter Renfrow  
TE: Darren Waller  
LT: Kolton Miller  
RG: Denzelle Good
  
DT: Johnathan Hankins  
DE: Chandler Jones, Maxx Crosby  
LB: Denzel Perryman  
CB: Trayvon Mullen, Rock Ya-Sin, Nate Hobbs  
S: Tre’von Moehrig  
  
K: Daniel Carlson  
P: AJ Cole  
  
Rookies to keep an eye on:  
  
G/C: Dylan Parham (3rd round)  
Per rumors, he will be competing with current center Andre James as the starting center.  
  
RB: Zamir White (4th round)  
He looks like he may be third on the depth chart. Speculation he could be Jacobs replacement next year since the Raiders did not pick up Jacobs’ 5th year option.  
  
Other story lines:  
  
2021 first round pick Alex Leatherwood was drafted to be the starting right tackle. He underwhelmed and got pushed to guard halfway through the season. Currently, the Raiders don’t have a defined right tackle. Leatherwood will be competing for the tackle spot again during camp, but there’s a big question mark at right tackle.  
  
The Raiders have been weak at linebacker for decades. But 2021 third round pick Divine Deablo showed he has great potential his rookie year when he did get on the field. Looking for him to make a jump this upcoming season.  
  
2021 third round pick Malcolm Koonce showed some flashes during last season as an edge rusher. Hoping he turns into a great rotational piece for Maxx and Chandler.",47.0,raiders,t3_uz7szz,False,0.0,:4:,2022-05-27T16:16:57Z,raiders,0.0560586069049505

When he played with the Raiders, he never had a season under 70+ tackles.

He only broke 50 tackles ONCE and that was right at 50 in 2020. 2018 was the only year he had double digit sacks. Plus he’s 31 on a big contract that has a $30 million cap hit for 2022, with a dead cap of $24 million. Maybe he can work out in LA, but the Bears needed that off their books for the lack of production they are getting from him.

Oh and if I hear anyone say “but he was double covered” yeah, so was Aaron Donald and he still got to the QB. And he’s the same age as Mack, but has only $26.7 million to the cap.

His 2016 MVP level season when he was throwing back-shoulder to Michael Crabtree. Crabtree had 1,000 yards and 8 TD's. It is what both DC and DA are best at.

Add Waller and Renfrow to the mix. Last year, teams doubled Waller and bracketed Renfrow. You can't do that shit anymore, and you're not going to be able to stack the box so Josh Jacobs gets to do what he does best, make moves at the second level. JJ doesn't have elite burst or breakaway speed, but he's easily among the top  RB's in the league at making guys miss at the second-level.

Our biggest problem last year was in the redzone obviously. Guess what? Adams is the best redzone receiver in the league. And the kicker? Even though we sucked last year, Renfrow was quietly elite in the redzone. He ranked 5th in redzone receptions and 5th in redzone touchdowns. Guess which team was SEVENTH in redzone TD % last year? The Patriots. With Agholor, Meyers, and Bourne as WR's. 

Last thing that has me hyped is that, although nothing is certain, Davante is the exact prototype WR that ages well. He's never been a speed guy in the league. He dominates with footwork, route-running, and finding holes in the defense. I don't anticipate we'll see a big drop off in his play, and this contract ends right after he turns 34 (late December birthday).",24.0,raiders,t3_th3oq5,False,0.0,None,2022-03-18T10:45:16Z,raiders,0.0035257426695798

Also worth noting Yannick would not have been on this team after next year and we locked up Chandler Jones, a MUCH better player, for three years. Graham wants to be able to stop the run without sending blitzers and that's impossible with Yannick on the field.

On offense, I just don't think McDaniels values high-level wide receivers in the way that we do. He has thrived with stud tight ends and slots, and average outside guys. More importantly, what would people have preferred we do? Overpay Chark? Overpay Kirk? Overpay MVS? No thank you. The only receiver on the market that's worth paying a lot of money to is Allen Robinson and that is still TBD.

I also think Bricillo thinks he can coach up this line. New England has been atop the league in developing lineman.

They will lose a couple of players but ""salary cap hell"" is the most overrated phrase in football. You would have said this same thing about the Saints every year for the last 3 and yet they've been able to retain their talent.

Kicker: Daniel Carlson

Punter: AJ Cole

Long snapper: Trent Sieg

Analysis: There was never any intrigue here as the Raiders didn’t bring in competition at any of the three designated specialist positions. The trio had to get creative to keep themselves from getting bored.

“Trent has been trying to legitimately tape my thumbs together and actually go through with the wrestling thing, which I think it’s kind of dangerous; probably shouldn’t do it during the season, so we’ll save that for the offseason,” Cole said Wednesday when asked about their legendary fight against each other that’s never happened. “We’ve spent so much time together that we’re just coming up with ridiculous hypotheticals all day long.

Cut: Matthias Farley, Qwynnterrio Cole, Isaiah Pola-Mao

Analysis: It will be interesting to see how Graham uses Abram, and how much Harmon plays instead of him on passing downs. Abram has made some plays rushing the quarterback and lowering the boom on ball carriers. He also had to fly to South Florida and play in the third preseason game, while Harmon was one of the two dozen players who got to stay home in Vegas and fall asleep on the couch. Moehrig had a good rookie season and will try and take the next stop and finish more plays and get some turnovers.

Analysis: The cornerback group was short-handed for most of training camp. Mullen practiced for the first time last week after offseason foot surgery while Ya-Sin and Averett also missed chunks of time, respectively, with undisclosed injuries. Everyone’s back now, though, and with Hobbs showing he can be an inside-outside player, the Raiders have four legit starting-caliber outside corners on the roster. Hobbs will still spend most of his time at nickelback while Phillips handles backup duties and works as a return man. Robertson impressed the staff both as an outside corner and nickelback in practices, but it didn’t translate very well to preseason games. Inconsistency has been a consistent theme for Robertson through three seasons with the team. Perhaps the former mid-round pick sticks around on the practice squad.",26.0,raiders,t3_wz3xf5,False,0.0,None,2022-08-27T09:22:55Z,raiders,0.0018359669136887

Backups: Darien Butler, Luke Masterson

Cut: Curtis Bolton

Analysis: The Raiders don’t really need a lot of linebackers in this defense, as they will be in nickel and using extra defensive backs often. Perryman is coming off a Pro Bowl season, while Deablo has the size and speed linebacker coaches dream of. Brown has a reputation as one of the better coverage linebackers in the league and had a pick-six in Tuesday’s joint practice with the Patriots. Butler and Masterson are two undrafted rookies who the staff really likes and can help out on special teams and Masterson picked off Patriots quarterback Mac Jones in Friday’s game. The Raiders could try and get one through waivers and onto the practice squad if they feel they need the roster spot elsewhere right now.",28.0,raiders,t3_wz3xf5,False,0.0,None,2022-08-27T09:22:36Z,raiders,0.036763456

Cut: Tyler Lancaster, Kyle Peko, Zach VanValkenburg, Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa

Analysis: This is a lot of defensive linemen, but the Raiders will need plenty considering defensive coordinator Patrick Graham runs a multiple defense that uses both 3-4 and 4-3 fronts, and one of us couldn’t convince the other to cut Ferrell. Crosby and Jones are as good as advertised, but it’ll be interesting to see whether Koonce, Bower and Ferrell are able to bring something to the table as rotational pass rushers off the edge. Bower had two sacks in Friday’s game and led the team in the preseason with four; Koonce also had a sack Friday and was second on the team in the preseason with two. The other major question is the interior pass rush as Nichols is the only defensive tackle on the roster who’s had much success getting after the quarterback so far in his career. The Raiders want their defensive tackles focused mostly on stopping the run and filling gaps, but it’s always nice to be able to create pressure from the inside.",28.0,raiders,t3_wz3xf5,False,0.0,None,2022-08-27T09:22:06Z,raiders,0.153093504

Backups: Alex Leatherwood, John Simpson, Thayer Munford Jr., Brandon Parker

Cut: Jackson Barton, Hroniss Grasu, Bamidele Olaseni, Jordan Meredith, Alex Bars

Analysis: Simpson started over Parham at left guard in the preseason finale, but we think Parham ultimately gets the job. Parker and Munford can’t go on injured reserve until after the 53-man cuts or else they would be out for the season. Parker will be out longer than Munford, who probably steps back in as the starting right tackle once he’s recovered. Their injuries may buy Leatherwood some time. The right tackle has really struggled this preseason, and the fact that the new staff has tried the other linemen at different spots but Leatherwood hasn’t seen a snap at guard seems damning. The Raiders could trade for or sign better options at both right guard and right tackle once other teams start trimming their rosters. If they don’t make any outside additions, Barton could be a candidate to rejoin the roster if Parker winds up on IR.",16.0,raiders,t3_wz3xf5,False,0.0,None,2022-08-27T09:21:40Z,raiders,0.00721690294253

Starter: Darren Waller

Backups: Foster Moreau, Jesper Horsted, Jacob Hollister

Cut: Nick Bowers, Cole Fotheringham

Analysis: Waller’s hamstring injury made us add another tight end. McDaniels uses 12 personnel (one running back, two tight ends) and 13 personnel pretty often, so it’s good to have depth here anyway. Waller and Moreau have things covered as receiving tight ends while Horsted and Hollister bring more to the table as blockers. Especially with the offensive line looking like it’ll be a liability, the Raiders will likely need to rely on tight ends serving as extra blockers pretty frequently.",19.0,raiders,t3_wz3xf5,False,0.0,None,2022-08-27T09:21:22Z,raiders,0.0498867187499999

Backups: Tyron Johnson, DJ Turner

Cut: Keelan Cole, Isaiah Zuber, Dillon Stoner, Justin Hall

Analysis: We felt pretty good about Cole making the roster, but him playing through the fourth quarter of the final preseason game gave us shades of John Brown from last season. While Turner isn’t the receiver that Cole is, he adds value as a return man on special teams. Turner and Johnson played against the Patriots, too, but they both were sat down before Cole. That’s usually a sign of things to come on cut day. Johnson is still a work in progress, but his speed gives him an element the Raiders don’t have otherwise. Adams and Renfrow are two of the best in the league and big reasons why the Raiders should return to the playoffs. Meanwhile, Hollins came in and locked down the No. 3 job rather quickly; he is a big target who is faster than you think.",43.0,raiders,t3_wz3xf5,False,0.0,None,2022-08-27T09:21:08Z,raiders,0.0012918676316738

Starter: Jakob Johnson

Analysis: Raider Nation wasn’t too pleased when the team let go of fan-favorite Alec Ingold in favor of Johnson this offseason, but you can’t blame the front office for siding with familiarity. Johnson was the starting fullback and a special teams contributor across three seasons with the Patriots and walked in the door with a thorough knowledge of the system. He doesn’t add a dimension to the offense as a receiver like Ingold did, but he’s much bigger at 6-foot-3, 255 pounds and should be more effective as a blocker.

“He’s a grinder, man,” McDaniels said in June. “He’s a self-made football player. He comes to work every day, takes great care of his body. He’s a tough guy. He’s really a tough player, good teammate, unselfish, willing to do anything you ask him to do. … Jakob knows what his role is. He embraces it every day and he’s an unselfish teammate. I just really enjoy being around him.

Starter: Josh Jacobs

Backups: Zamir White, Brandon Bolden, Ameer Abdullah

Cut: Brittain Brown, Austin Walter

Analysis: It was only a month ago when people were freaking out about Jacobs playing a lot in the preseason opener, but he looked good and is certainly motivated in what has become a contract year after the Raiders declined to pick up the 2019 first-round pick’s fifth-year option. This will be a committee approach — with Abdullah and Bolden likely factoring in the most on third downs — and the big question is if the rookie White will overtake Jacobs for the lead role this season or wait until next when Jacobs is likely playing somewhere else. Brown, a seventh-round pick, has made some tough yards when given the chance and would be a nice stash on the practice squad.",21.0,raiders,t3_wz3xf5,False,0.0,None,2022-08-27T09:20:23Z,raiders,0.2249740740740741

Starter: Derek Carr

Backup: Jarrett Stidham

Cut: Chase Garbers

Analysis: Stidham had only attempted 48 regular-season passes across three seasons with the Patriots and didn’t play last season after undergoing offseason back surgery, but Ziegler and McDaniels felt confident enough to trade a 2023 sixth-round pick to New England for him in May. It proved to be the correct decision as Stidham handily won the backup quarterback job over Nick Mullens, who was traded to the Vikings this week for a conditional 2024 seventh-round pick. Stidham looked pretty good — albeit largely against backups — in the preseason despite playing behind a struggling offensive line. The Raiders want this to be the second straight regular season that Stidham doesn’t take a single snap, of course, but he looks like he can be a capable spot starter if something happens to Carr.",39.0,raiders,t3_wz3xf5,False,0.0,None,2022-08-27T09:19:28Z,raiders,0.208009375

If Munford can pick up RT, it would be the best-fit position for him IMO.

I love versatility (esp to deal with injuries), but it will help the development of our young OL if they can settle in to a position as a starter. That's what I'm hoping will happen with Parham.

I am not expecting Munford to start, but he can develop as a backup. Hopefully he can make faster strides than Parker, who still had 4 years and isn't where we were hoping for a 3rd round OT with terrific length.

One thing that impressed me about the Pats coaching is how well OL played under them. Very disciplined, technically solid. Hopefully that happens here.",1.0,raiders,t3_uh89uy,False,0.0,:28:,2022-05-03T21:07:42Z,raiders,0.0325806494354123

Munford supported his team by moving inside from LT to LG but that likely negatively impacted his draft stock. If he had 2 consecutive seasons at LT and performed well, he probably would have been a mid-round pick (3rd to 5th).

I agree on the adjustment to RT. If he had played on the right side of the line, this would be an easier transition. Look at Parker for example, he's always looked better / more comfortable at LT than RT.

I am glad that we drafted Munford and feel like he feel further than his production and size warranted, but even me being optimistic has a hard time imagining that he would beat out Leatherwood or one of the vets (Eluemunor, Good, or Parker) at RT.

One thing to keep in mind is that Munford's performance at his Pro Day was very mediocre. He had around a 7.74 3-cone, which is very average, and his VJ was 22"": https://draftscout.com/dsprofile.php?PlayerId=1023180&DraftYear=2022

Parker wasn't re-signed until 3/21, so the Raiders were willing to risk his getting signed by another team before re-signing him.

I think Good was the most consistent OG we had in 2019 and 2020. Losing him in 2021 in the 1st game sucked.

Eluemunor was a victim of draft standing politics IMO. When he was benched so that Leatherwood could move to RG and Parker could be inserted at RT after 4 games, I thought that was a raw deal because Eluemunor was the best IOL in those first 4 games.

My projection as of now has a few guys moved around from last season:

* LT Miller
* LG Parham
* C James
* RG Simpson
* RT Leatherwood

Here's my rationale:

1. Miller is an obvious lock for the most important position on the OL
2. Word is that Leatherwood training hard at RT
3. Simpson played LG, but that's usually a nimble G because that player pulls a lot in power, gap, and counter plays. I think his more natural fit is RG
4. Who is the most athletic IOL we have on the roster? Say hello to rookie 3rd round pick Parham. Therefore, he makes the most sense to me at LG.

Derek Carr is literally the reason the coaching staff is the way it is. The Davis family holds Carr to a high regard and the deal was for any new head coach coming in  that Carr remains on the team. Carr is very well kept up to date with moves by the coaching staff and the Davis family themselves.

Carr also is not someone that just puts himself out there on social media in any regard unless he knows 100% what he is talking about. Every time he has made a statement on social media it has come Into fruition. I welcome anyone to try to find an instance where this is false. 

Even if just not to spoil his image, Carr would never say something that he didn’t 100% know about for a fact. He doesn’t “run his mouth” and then say “lol jk”. I know you guys don’t know that much about him, but if you did you might understand.

**Las Vegas Raiders**  
**Preseason power ranking: No. 13**

**Injury to watch: Darren Waller, TE**  

Waller missed most of the second half of training camp with what was described as a hamstring issue, even as rumors floated that the 2020 Pro Bowl tight end was ""holding in,"" waiting for a contract extension. Only the 17th-highest-paid tight end in the NFL, Waller is a game-breaker when healthy but missed six games last season because of back and knee issues, and coach Josh McDaniels would not commit to Waller playing in the season opener. -- Paul Gutierrez

**The season will be a success if…**  
the defense can match the expected play of the offense.  

Yeah, you know all about quarterback Derek Carr's many options on offense, starting with new wide receiver Davante Adams, continuing with slot receiver Hunter Renfrow and moving through tight end Waller and running back Josh Jacobs. But the remade defense, under new coordinator Patrick Graham, has to show up and keep games manageable. Edge rushers Maxx Crosby and Chandler Jones will feast so long as the retooled secondary -- with new cornerbacks Rock Ya-Sin and Anthony Averett -- can cover -- Gutierrez

**Impact newcomer: Davante Adams, WR**  
Adams is the best receiver in the NFL, and rejoining his old Fresno State running mate in Carr -- along with a modern playcaller in Josh McDaniels -- is expected to pay off with another playoff appearance. The chemistry with Carr is real, and so is Adams' preternatural ability to get open and come down with the tough catch. The key, then, is a questionable offensive line giving Carr enough time to find Adams downfield. -- Gutierrez

**Fantasy breakout candidate: Derek Carr, QB**
Despite his previous reputation as a checkdown king, Carr recorded 142 deep-ball attempts over the past two seasons. He also managed a top-eight YPA and a top-12 true passer rating in back-to-back seasons. Reuniting with Adams and getting a healthy Darren Waller back figures to improve his efficiency and push his passing touchdown total above 30. -- Liz Loza

**Over or under 8.5 wins? Under**  
There's good reason for all the optimism, but ultimately the offensive line is a giant weakness and the division is too tough. They can improve from last season and still not have as many wins. -- Doug Kezirian

**Bold prediction for 2022:** Carr will throw a career-high 35 touchdown passes in McDaniels' offense.

In McDaniels' schemed pass game, Carr will be set up to attack open coverage voids and cut it loose on deep ball throws. The Raiders have multiple pass catchers who can get open with their route-running traits. -- Bowen",14.0,raiders,t3_x71ap4,False,0.0,:Logo_95-Present:,2022-09-05T23:44:45Z,raiders,-0.000109028434022

34389,244014,244014,grumpysky,"By Vincent Bonsignore Las Vegas Review-Journal
August 27, 2022 - 2:25 pm

One of the biggest issues facing the Raiders during training camp has been an unsettled offensive line.

At right tackle, four players have been competing for the starting job, and both right and left guard have featured various players auditioning for starting roles.

While the Raiders are closer today to finalizing a starting five and the four or five players behind them, to say it is a done deal would be presumptuous.

“There will be no big announcements today on that,” Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said on Saturday, a day after his club wrapped up the preseason and training camp. “There’s a lot to sort through.”

And not a whole lot of time to whittle their way through it.

The Raiders have until 1 p.m. Tuesday to decide on their 53-man roster — they currently have 80 players — and soon after they will have to make decisions on who is starting at what positions ahead of their season opener on Sept. 11 against the Chargers.

At this point, only Kolton Miller at left tackle and Andre James at center are in the starting lineup. Dylan Parham, John Simpson and Lester Cotton are in the running at both guard spots, and Jermaine Eluemunor, Alex Leatherwood, Thayer Munford and Brandon Parker are the contenders at right tackle.

Jackson Barton and whoever doesn’t land the starting right tackle position are candidates to be the swing tackle. “We feel like we do have some quality there,” McDaniels said.

Nevertheless, the offensive line was a mix of good and not-so-good during camp and preseason, and there remains the distinct possibility the Raiders will look outside their building to shore up some spots.

“We have a lot of things to discuss in the next so many days,” McDaniels said.

Leatherwood, the 17th overall pick in last year’s draft, remains an enigma. His inability to state a case for himself leaves him vulnerable. Everything is on the table, including the drastic measure of outright cutting him.

McDaniels said Leatherwood remains in the mix, but also added the Raiders believe they have quality options at his position. That leaves his spot on the roster in doubt.

“Having tough decisions to make because you feel like you’ve got a lot of guys competing for them is a good problem to have,” McDaniels said.

Further complicating the process are injuries to Parker and Munford that limited Parker to just one preseason game and Munford to two.

Parker is a candidate to start the season on the injured reserve list, but the Raiders are holding out hope he can return at some point during the season. To preserve his eligibility, he would have to be part of the 53-man roster by Tuesday’s deadline and then put on retrievable injured reserve soon after.

That means the Raiders would have to put someone on waivers they actually covet and hope they clear the waiver process in order to be re-signed to the roster once Parker is added to I.R.

In other words, preserving Parker’s eligibility could mean losing a player they believe worthy of a roster spot.

The extent of Munford’s injury has not been disclosed, although the hope is he doesn’t need to spend time on the injured list to start the season. When healthy, Munford is firmly in the running for a starting job.

Meanwhile, the Raiders have to sort through the multiple options they have at both guard spots after mixing and matching at those positions throughout camp and the preseason.

At some point, though, they have to make a final call.

“This is the part of the year where some of those decisions are going to have to settle in here,” McDaniels said. “We have a lot of tape to digest.”",25.0,raiders,t3_wzleb0,False,0.0,:Logo_95-Present:,2022-08-27T22:33:27Z,raiders,1.89581394935096e-08

For instance, maybe he’s scouting a corner and he talks to the Ravens and Patriots scouting departments.  They’ll both say something like this corner has trouble flipping his hips in man coverage so we gave him a 5th round grade.  And maybe that fits what Lance sees so that’s the projection he’ll give.  Meanwhile, a team like the Seahawks may look at that corner and say hey, he can play press coverage and play the boundary in a cover 3, that’s worth a 3rd rounder for us.
