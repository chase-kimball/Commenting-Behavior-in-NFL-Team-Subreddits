Specifically, it can be found at footnote 11 on page 12: “After the hearing and after the submission of post-hearing briefs, Mr. Brady’s certified agents offered to provide a spreadsheet that would identify all of the individuals with whom Mr. Brady had exchanged text messages during [the relevant time] period; the agents suggested that the League could contact those individuals and request production of any relevant text messages that they retained. Aside from the fact that, under Article 46, Section 2(f) of the CBA, such information could and should have been provided long before the hearing, the approach suggested in the agents’ letter — which would require tracking down numerous individuals and seeking consent from each to retrieve from their cellphones detailed information about their text message communications during the relevant period — is simply not practical.”

In English, here’s what the footnote means: Although the text messages couldn’t be retrieved directly from Brady’s phone, his agents provided all of the phone numbers with which Brady exchanged text messages. His agents also said that the league could attempt to get the actual text messages from the phones of the people with whom Brady communicated, but the league refused to attempt to try, claiming that it would be too hard to track down the various people and to persuade them to cooperate.",3.0,nfl,t3_wc5jbf,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-07-30T19:57:19Z,patriots,-0.1171281249999999

The only major hope would be with not making that Mohamed Sanu trade, which could give the Pats a chance at someone like Van Jefferson in the second round (who might have been the third guy the Pats wanted in the second in that draft?) but even then, I think Brady just wanted proven quality receivers if that was what drove his decision making.

The thing is, I understood every word you said, I just think you're looking at this whole process completely wrong and overall I completely disagree with you. 


>**But after that...It's a weird dichotomy where they'll miss on the their trop picks...but them find a a guy or 2 in the lower rounds**

Who cares? As far as i am concerned it doesn't matter what round the player is drafted in, whether it is round 1, 7, or an UDFA if the player is good the player is good. If we are missing on first round picks but getting consistent /equivalent production out of 6th rounders. That sounds good to me, the late rounds cost a tenth of the salary. Would it be better if we were hitting on first rounders and the seventh, most definitely. 

The draft is just a giant game of chance. There are 250-260 players in the draft and each team is given ~7 balls to throw onto the wheel. The expected chance a player succeeds is about 40-50% in round one and like 10-15% in round 7. As far as I am concerned, as long as you hit on 3-5 players a draft, you are doing good. And as far as i am aware this is exact philosophy BB goes by. (If you haven't read it, read the book War Room, I think that was the one that goes a little more in depth on this).

 So, sure, you're right we're missing on our easy picks and hitting on the hard ones. The result is the same as long as we're hitting on something. Sure, if we hit more early we would be in a better spot but the fact of the matter is no one is consistently hitting early. Every now and then some team gets hot for a year or two but they all come back to earth pretty quickly.

And on top of that, BB was starting to take shots on more high risk high reward type players nutty in the draft and in free agency as he was trying to squeeze one more run out of Brady for a couple years there. Maybe if he didn't go into it with the mindset that he would only have Brady for a couple years he would have been able to do it differently. Who knows.

The whole point of me going through and showing how many starters/solid role players we got in each draft / UDFA period is just to show that we are getting what we need and last I checked the Patriots are the winningest football team in the past 20+ years, I think it's working.



>First, I said, ""A large part of the first dynasty was built on picks not made by him."" 

I didn't specify one year. But go back and look at those first dynasty guys: (arguably Bledsoe for what he did in the AFCCF) McGinniest, Law, Ted Johnson, Bruschi, Milloy, Tebucky jones, Damien Woddy, Kevin Faulk....Some of the the biggest names in their secondary and and front LB group were all drafted before he was HC. 

The point about dynasty #1 was that, yes there was a 'core' of... you counted 9... players that were brought in before BB. Of which the large majority were gone before Superbowl number 2. How does having 3ish players (that BB still may have even had a hand in drafting then) on a roster of 50+ still being on the team for a couple years give Parcells or Carroll deserve any credit for any of what happened, the dynasty would have still existed if Parcells nor Carroll were in New England, add long as whatever Joe schmoe coach didn't whiff completely on their picks The same results would have happened. The only thing Parcells did for the pats was introducing BB to Kraft.  And of course he throws away a SB when he quit on the team before the game even started.

On a sidenote Parcells is literally the most overrated coach in NFL history, he has never succeeded without BB by his side


>> As for Pioli, sure, I am sure he deserves some credit but at the same time, he literally accomplished nothing after leaving New England. How can you assume that he is responsible for that dynasty?

> He didn't have Tom Brady. That's the answer for lots of coaches, GM, teams, ETC. 


So yes, as long as Pioli has the QB that BB drafted, took a risk on by keeping him in the starting role, and then developed into the GOAT, Pioli could have been great. The fact of the matter is, while Pioli was with BB they did great things together and I am not necessarily trying to write him off, I appreciate what he did while he was here. But outside of New England he did nothing of import and after he left, we still won 3 more Superbowls and went to  2 more after he was gone.",1.0,nfl,t3_uecp69,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-04-29T17:33:31Z,patriots,0.0206957091748497

>>What are you talking about? Both dynasties that BB has built in NE were built primarily through the draft.

>A large part of the first dynasty was built on picks not made by him. Either literally made by carroll or parcels teams or with a lot of help from piloli. 

The thing is, that isn't really how it was. If you go and look at their first Superbowl, only ~6 of the starters, including special teams, were draft picks or brought in by either Parcells or Carroll. And even then, a couple of them were brought in when BB was the assistant head coach of the Pats in 1996 so who even knows if BB didn't have a hand in that. And that's only looking at their first Superbowl, that number drops down to like 3 or 4 players the next year. That first dynasty had nothing to do with Parcells or Carroll.

As for Pioli, sure, I am sure he deserves some credit but at the same time, he literally accomplished nothing after leaving New England. How can you assume that he is responsible for that dynasty?

As for dynasty #2, I understand what you're saying, there were a lot of objectively bad drafts / players picked but on the other hand there were a lot of good/role players that win is those Superbowls.

>But the problem is rounds 2-4. He's been missing TONS of those. And for a team that lets players walk in FA, you can't miss as many as they have.

Looking at the drafts, by year since 2014 and I am going to ignore the players that didn't pan out, just trying to point out starters.


2014


* Probowl (Alternate) QB ( Jimmy Garoppolo)

* One of the best 3rd down backs in the league (James White)

* Solid Journeyman Tackle (Cameron Fleming)

* All Pro / Probowl CB (Malcolm Butler)*


2015


* Solid (maybe not great) Interior Defensive lineman (Malcolm Brown)

* One of the best D-linemen in the league at the time (Trey Flowers)

* One of the best guards in the league (Shaq Mason)

* One of the best centers in the league (David Andrews)*

* Solid Journeyman CB (Justin Coleman)*


2016


* First round pick stolen due to the league not understanding Ideal Gas Law**

* One of the best guards / All Pro (Joe Thuney)

* Journeyman QB (Jacoby Brissett)

* Solid linebacker (Elandon Roberts)

* Solid Guard / Center (Ted Karras)

* Solid cornerback (Jonathan Jones)*


2017


* First and Third round picks were traded for Brandin Cooks (eventually traded for a new first) and a 4th***

* Second Round pick for Kony Ealy***

* 4th rounder traded for Dwayne Allen***

* Solid DE (Deatrich Wise)

* Solid DT (Adam Butler)*


2018


* Great when healthy, but often injured Tackle (Isiah Wynn)

* Injury hampered but solid RB when healthy, no SB LIII without him (Sony Michel)

* Solid linebacker when healthy (Jawhaun Bentley)

* Probowl CB (JC Jackson)*

* And then Keion Croessen and Duke Dawson were both traded away for higher picks than they were originally drafted at


2019
 

* Joejuan Williams has barely played due to the all pro cast of players in front of him. He hasn't been super impressive but we will see this year

* Damien Harris is great

* Jake Bailey is one of the best punters in the league

* PR Gunner Olszewski I mean he was just a special teams guy, but he was good*

* WR Jakobi Meyers has been great*


2020


* Kyle Dugger is going to be a star

* Josh Uche looked great when he was on the field, but that's been the issue

* Anfernee Jennings has been hurt, but I think he can be good, too early to say anything.

* Asiasi and Keene were both injured and both spent a good chunk of their rookie season on ir. Keene missed season 2 and asiasi took the back seat to the free agents we brought in. Still don't really know what either of them look like, not looking good though

* Michael Owenwu has looked great; PFF All Rookie team

* JJ Taylor has been an interesting player, good for an UDFA

2021

* Mac Jones was a borderline ROTY.

* Christian Barmore looks like the real deal

* Rhimondre Stevenson looks amazing

* And a bunch of project players that are too early to say anything on.


So, in a league where the average first round picks bust on a rate of about 50% (closer to 60-70% busting when considering the patriots haven’t picked earlier than the #23 pick). So when the bust rate only gets worse in the later rounds and you see that the Patriots are still getting an average of 3-5 starting caliber players (mostly playing near pro bowl level) in each draft/UDFA period on top of the handful of role players that may not stick around in the league but play their part while they’re here… I mean what do you expect? How many starters per draft do you think we should be getting? 

Sure there were a couple years in there where the drafts were kind of rough, but those years were also the years that we traded the picks for players or it is time for the once a decade stolen draft pick where the league decides to screw the patriots and steal a first round pick. And yes, there have been busts, quite a few of them even, but that is expected. Like I said the average 1st round pick busts at a rate of 50% of the time and it gets way worse really quickly. And no, I am not saying that BB has been the best drafter in the league over this past 6-7 years but I also think that when you look at the whole picture, he hasn’t been nearly as bad as what people like you keep spouting off about. At the absolute worst he has been average, and while I would have loved to have drafted different players in multiple spots I am also sure that other teams would also feel quite the same about grabbing some of our players

>The biggest ""problem"" for belichick is that he always had Brady to cover up these ""meg drafts.""

And you aren't wrong here, having Brady gave us a bit more wiggle room with all of this. It allowed BB to take a higher risk on a player like Easley or Gronk. Knowing that Brady was there to hold it together let BB try to grab players that were high risk or more commonly players that played a hyper specific role. Sure a bunch of them failed, failed spectacularly even, but that is what every team in the league goes through. The draft bust percentage is extremely high.

Still, league average is not remotely out of the realm of possibility. They were a top 5 defense by DVOA last year, they could be a whole lot worse and still be an average defense (not accounting for improvement/impact from Barmore, Uche, Perkins, McGrone, Jennings, Macmillan or Wilson).

> QB’s tend to slowly improve

[PFF](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-investigating-learning-curves-from-college-football-to-the-nfl) and [FBOutsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/extra-points/2012/quarterback-development-patterns) have found that QBs tend to improve by far the most from year 1 to year 2.

> Strange is a rookie

Only needs to play as well as Karras did, which is a borderline starter/highend back up.

> none of the WR’s we brought in are all that much better than the ones we already had

Parker is a lot better than Harry. Both Agholor and Jonnu Smith have played much better in the past, so expecting them to improve is at least reasonable. Bourne could have played more, but kept committing MEs, he should have a better grasp of the playbook this season. Thornton could realistically find a role as a designated deep threat early on (no matter what you think about the pick, his onfield speed matches his 40 time). 

>  but what happens if the best case scenario doesn’t happen?

If the best case scenario happens the Pats are super bowl contenders.

I agree that if the guy is good enough, waiting likely won't hurt you. The issue is being good enough is much easier to say with retrospect.

I say this as someone who believes in Lamar, but also watched Cam Newton play after the wheels fell off. The team has the ability to franchise him twice.

But the point isn't about being criticized, but the type of criticism (them being judged as athletes and as such needing to prove more as quarterbacks vs less athletic pure passer peers). To me I don't see that as an issue because the style of football Lamar and to a lesser extent kyler plays is different from other pure passers and is predicated on their athleticism. As such I think most (not all) of the perception and therefore criticism is warranted.",1.0,nfl,t3_wbbvr5,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-07-29T17:30:31Z,patriots,-0.0517650612950325

I still don't think he has completely vanished from entire games in a row like kyler has. I haven't paid close attention to Herbert so I go off the box scores for him. For kyler he was my fantasy qb and I have a buddy who is a part time cardinals fan so I followed him a bit closer and his end of season was incredibly disappointing. After the bears game half of his games had a sub 80 passer rating including a passer rating of 40 in the playoffs.

And yes, I understand the context of both his injury and missing DHop. Herbert ended the season playing better than Murray, even though they both lost.

12035,113286,113286,MFreak,"I still feel (and I think others do as well) a bit of disingenuousness from what Mahomes is saying. Lamar and Kyler do rely on their athleticism to play, in some cases a bit too much. In the same Josh Allen received the same criticism. The difference is that Allen played better more recently than Jackson or kyler.  It just feels insane that mahomes is saying he has to keep proving he belongs as if it's ever been in question since he has been starting.  And kyler does need to prove himself because outside of half season stretches he hasn't proven himself at all. 

When streetball comes up I think it's fair to point to it as an unsustainable style. Anything the relies on extending plays past the first few reads after the structure of the play breaks down is unsustainable. Some guys make it work better than others. Mahomes, Wilson, Romo, Rodgers and Roethlisberger were/are all guys who were able to play as well or better on off structure plays to an infuriating degree, but not all the time. Mahomes in the super bowl has twice looked like a sub par qb who had that style of ball fail him (if Jimmy G hits a wide open sanders or even if the Kittle catch at the end of the first half counted there's a solid chance the 9ers win). 

Now mahomes wins plenty on structure too, so to say that he only plays streetball is equally stupid. The most infuriating times to play against the chiefs isn't when mahomes is playing full hero ball, but when he's able to hit his first read immediately every play because he always has someone immediately open. I feel like I'm rambling at this point. Basically kyler gets warranted criticism so it's frustrating to hear his name come up as if he's above criticism and mahomes barely gets any criticism at all so it's frustrating to hear him at all show the mindset that he has to prove himself to the media",1.0,nfl,t3_wbbvr5,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-07-29T16:00:36Z,patriots,-0.0601934767412064

Compare this to Kirk Cousins who is constantly questioned when you can tie a lot of his losses to failures on the team around him (awful kicking and defense were responsible for like 3 or 4 wins in games that Kirk put the vikings in a position to win last year, in case any vikings fans want to confirm)",2.0,nfl,t3_wbbvr5,False,0.0,:Patriots: Patriots,2022-07-29T15:38:18Z,patriots,0.095792096
12037,113288,113288,MFreak,"I'm confused. What people in the national media have said at any time in the last 3 years that mahomes isn't a tier 1 qb? I consider myself plugged in to the league and haven't heard it once. Even when mahomes struggled early last year he was considered a top qb and was for some reason still in several MVP articles late in season during his resurgence as if he hadn't struggled the majority of the season.

By all accounts kyler isn't a tier 1 qb either. He's had consistency issues every season, hasn't won a playoff game, and his overall ownership of the offense is a direct reason for that. He is by the athletics definition of the tiers not a tier 1 qb.

And then for Lamar, his MVP season was predicated on an obscenely high TD%. His efficiency as a passer has objectively regressed. I do think that overall narrative on him has swung too far, but it is based in his actual play getting worse despite his surrounding cast supposedly improving.

All of this to say, if he had left out himself and kyler, he would probably had a reasonable point. But the biggest issue most people have here is that he used himself to point to some sort of uphill climb to prove himself that he has in part because he's a black qb (per this quote he does indulge in the race play while understanding is in response to a direct question) when he doesn't actually face this uphill climb. He is as universally revered in the sport as anyone can be so it's disingenuous to use himself as an example of media narrative being unfair.

Russell Wilson: $107 million over 3 years (35.66 average) 

Matt Ryan: $88 million over 3 years (29.33 average)

Jared Goff: $84 million over 3 years (28 average)

Wentz: $77 million over 3 years (25.66 average)

Dak: 2020-22 $126 million over 3 years  (42 average)

1. Nothing crawled up my ass, though I'll admit my response came off brash, because the post came off as if he was trying to just generate some clicks/karma due to point #2:

2. The title is incredibly vague, and he hadn't posted any context into comments about why he's posted this. ""At the San Diego airport"" means *nothing* as a title. And as a subreddit, as news breaks about Patriot related moves, obviously much of that is tracked because they're sighted in certain places. So is the OP insinuating something is going on in San Diego? Who's on the plane? Why is it there?

And so since the whole thread feels like some kind of ""news bait"" I met it with a heavy dose of skepticism because I literally have no idea why OP is posting a picture of the Patriots plane.

If the title of this post was simply, ""Never saw the plane in person before, thought this was cool"" then the 50% of comments in this section wouldn't have been downvoted (mine is not the only one).

27120,273322,273322,lilyswheelys,"That’s honestly debatable just because of how rare it is to actually find those game changing elite ILBs specifically, probably the position with the least amount of elite turnout. Only inside guy that’s truly game changing there is Leonard and maybe just maybe Smith, most teams seem to get by just fine with just decent ILB play but yeah if you can get one of those guys it’s huge, I just don’t think you can argue picking any one of the first round guys this year over a much higher chance at a potentially elite guard. The athleticism in Strange alone along with the fact that he’s even got good technique already gives him extreme upside that isn’t easy to find among most guards. But yeah it’s generally not worth it taking a LB that early but it would have been nice to pick a Leo Chenal in day 2 where those picks can have great value but I don’t blame them for seeing McGrone as a rookie this year and addressing other more glaring needs, McGrone was a good prospect coming out just super young and raw and didn’t get the time to develop in his first year, not a bad thing for him to still be behind a bit when McMillan can still be good. I definitely like taking edge prospects in the first though, but I still don’t see it being the right pick over Strange when we have 3 young guys there that could still turn out to be something especially Perkins who has all the tools physically and athletically to succeed. But sure yeah they traded Mason and I didn’t like the value but I do see the reason they did it, not only did they want to get younger and cheaper but we genuinely had a hole at LG still and Onwenu hadn’t played well there at all (explained by Ted Karras playing over him all year) and as talented as he is they didn’t want to waste that by not playing him or putting him somewhere he doesn’t excel at especially on his cheap rookie deal, so they traded Mason to give us the flexibility to address LG and start another good younger RG.",2.0,patriots,t3_wah7aa,False,0.0,None,2022-07-28T20:10:35Z,patriots,0.1897530949931413

The LB core is unproven but if one or two of those young guys flash a little bit of good play we’re looking a whole lot better there than when we had slow as molasses Hightower and KVN. Then we also have possible breakout candidates in our young edge guys in Uche, Perkins, and Jennings I mean one of them have got to be something, they were all good prospects just have dealt with a lot of combined injuries. I can see some concern in the CB group without JC Jackson in the fold but hey at least our CB depth isn’t atrocious like last year which gave us an insanely hard time last season on multiple occasions. We lost Jonathan Jones for the season and Mills was out a couple games and behind Mills we basically only had Bryant and JoeJuan... we didn’t have Mills for the playoff game and they just targeted them all game it was sad as hell. We used Jonathan Jones more as a perimeter corner last season before he got hurt too which I find quite interesting, and he was pretty good at it along with the fact that he’s in general a very good player. I’d like to think that’s what we do this year, Jon Jones and Mills as our CB1&2 while having Butler/Jack Jones/Mitchell getting snaps here and there at the perimeter as well, while either having Bryant, Wade, or Marcus Jones in the slot, not sure if Bryant and Wade can both make the team together but if Bryant or Wade do start off there I’d like to think Marcus splits some of those snaps with them and eventually takes over the role entirely. Not the most assuring group when looking at your top two guys but it’s not nearly as bad as people think it is and we actually have depth now. And not to mention our safety group is extremely good and really fascinating in terms of how we’re gonna use them. I feel like they all see the field very often maybe even all at the same time more often than not. We got 3 guys in Dugger, Phillips, and Peppers that can play that box safety/LB role and that’s not for nothing. I’d like to think we got Peppers to allow Dugger to play a LB type of role more often without sacrificing good safety play I mean the guy can do it all, and maybe it even allows him to be our full time weapon against Josh Allen as a QB spy. He’s a beast defending the run and can even handle shedding blocks off O-linemen, dude man handled Mechi Becton lol and obviously he can fly around the field in pass coverage as well.

Connections with schools and players on the coaching staff can influence picks sometimes too though we’ve seen it plenty of times. And I just think they had plenty more reason to have him as their guy over Pickens, he can certainly be a legit receiver in this league. The guy is an absolute freak, 6’3” height, 33 1/8” arms, 79 1/8” wingspan, only measurables that are a concern are his hands (7 7/8”) and his weight (like 179lb.) but his catch technique is phenomenal and has never had a bad history of drops with around a 58% catch rate, and Tyreek Hill also has the same hand size if you’re not convinced it won’t be a problem. You can call his size a concern if you’d like but I don’t think it’s a huge deal when the consensus top 2 WR in the draft, Jameson Williams is basically the exact same size. Sure Williams actually produced a lot but Thornton also had shaky QB play for most of his college career, crazy how many missed opportunities by the QBs there are in his tape. Flat out Thornton is a much more complete receiver than the media gives him credit for, watch his tape it’s all there. He’s physical and has the ability to catch contested balls+run block, footwork is surprisingly quick at his height and can not only beat you with speed but with route running as well although he could definitely improve it more for the next level. He’s shown he can beat the press with his insane release, another thing we need to see how it can translate at the next level but the ability is there. I’m sure I could say more but yeah he’s not just your usual combine speedster who gets overdrafted, he’s a legit receiver who was deserving of a 2nd round selection and has crazy upside, tons more positives than his negatives and most of the negatives can be fixed. Sure Pickens is the consensus better pick with what he’s proven and more of a sure thing but I can 100% see any team especially the Steelers wanting to take the upside Thornton has with their success at developing WRs.

Adding Parker gives him the big outside 50/50 threat he couldn’t go to with N’keal. Mac threw more of those 50/50 balls last year than I was ever used to seeing with Brady, and having that type of receiver will help him immensely. He also allows them the flexibility to move Agholor around more, having him in more of a Z role, but his speed could also be really useful in the slot, too. 

On top of that there’s likely to be improvements just due to the chemistry of everyone being in the system a second year, and I expect better years from Bourne, Henry and Meyers bc of this. Not to mention better use of Jonnu could open up more as well 

Aside from this it’s rumored he’s worked on his arm strength this off-season with Tom House, which was the biggest knock on his game. I’m my opinion, if that improves a bit, combined with a better overall receiving group than last year and better chemistry/personnel usage, he is in a really good spot to make the second year leap. 

My biggest worry is the offensive coaching staff and being able to maximize his potential, but if the rumors are true that Bill will be very hands on with Mac and the offense, I trust it.
