The CMC injuries have nothing to do with the franchise’s stability. He’s still young and we’re not talking about torn ligaments or head injuries or something that shortens a career. [They’re all sprains and strains.](https://www.draftsharks.com/fantasy/injury-history/christian-mccaffrey/7750). I was in the small camp that said we should trade him before last season to maximize his value. So I obviously have some concerns about the injuries but he’s not overpaid. He is, however, overworked. I don’t think we’ve *wasted* any seasons with Matt Rhule. They gave him a shot during an obvious roster rebuild. You can’t give him one or two seasons and then cut him loose. Time takes time. Expecting a new coach to come in and microwave success with no quarterback is naive. It’s also a bad look and only makes it harder to attract the next coach when you do go looking. We have loads of cap space. I don’t know what you’re talking about but if you know something I don’t know I’m all ears, honestly. If we are what our record is then were we one the best teams in football through the first four weeks last year? That’s just coachspeak. There are a handful of teams every year that are better than their record or worse than their record. The average game in the NFL is decided by less than a touchdown.

40,506,506,11_25_13_TheEdge,The QB situation is unstable because we have been rotating through clowns. There hasn’t been an opportunity to get “our guy” so to speak so they’ve been reaching and overpaying for guys to bridge the gap and hopefully get lucky with a breakout. The head coaching situation is no different than any other team who is moving on from a long tenured head coach. Rivera spent 9 seasons with Carolina and was preceded by John Fox who also spent 9 seasons in Charlotte. Tepper is polarizing but he’s loaded and he wants to win. He just doesn’t necessarily know how in the current landscape. That’s not unstable. Outside of the QB position and the OL (which will be vastly improved this season) the roster has been capable and stable. The perception that the Panthers organization is a bad one to be a part of is largely a myth perpetuated by the media circus that can’t take its eyes off of the quarterback position.

2760,15593,15593,BelowMikeHawk,"The sky is a brilliant shade of blue in Charlotte, North Carolina. The sun's rays smolder the skin with the coolness of a gentle breeze as your only relief. The smell of slow cooked pork permeates the air with a dominance only matched by fresh cut grass in the spring. All the signs were there. Football had awoken from its hybernative state. It was opening day 2014.

Like a young child filled with eagerness and excitement on the first day of school, the fans filled the stadium. They scattered the corridors buying cold beer and 75% off Steve Smith jerseys, until they heard the staccato notes of snare drums. They then scurried to their seats in anticipation of the player introductions. 

Drummers, flag wavers, and cheer leaders dotted the field. The crowd roared with the intensity of a Boeing 757.

The team, escorted by smoke and fire, ran onto the field. 

""And now, your starters!"", exclaimed the PA announcer. He started with Ryan Khalil, and worked his way down the list to the ninth player, Cam Newton. 

A sense of bewilderment wafted through the air. 

What's going on? Why didn't the star QB come out last? Who was the last two players?

The PA announcer could then be heard breathing heavily over the microphone. 

""This...This can't be right! It must be some kind of mistake!"", he said in a rattled voice.

""King McNuttatron""

The skies turned pitch black. A lightning storm filled the sky with loud strikes of electricity.

Out of the tunnel walked Marvin McNutt and Tavarres King. They had emotionless, almost robotic, faces. They stopped at center field, and stood back to back. 

The PA announcer came back on the microphone. 

""Gettleman told me I'm supposed to say this."", he said in a voice of disbelievement.

                     ""Fire, water, earth, and wind,
                   let the powers from below, ascend.""

At that moment, their eyes started glowing green. Their bodies then began contorting and binding into one. When the spectacle was over, a sight that could be mistaken for the 8th wonder stood. 

A 7'0 350 pound receiver. It was built of solid muscle. It had hands the size of catcher's mitts, and shoulders as wide as the Mississippi. 

Cam Newton bravely walked up to this towering beast. 

""How fast do you run the 40?"", Cam asked.

""3.8 seconds"", it replied. 

""How many bench reps can you do?"", Cam asked.

""All of them."", it replied. 

It was at that moment, that the whole free agency debacle made sense.

While fans cheered for their new player, David Gettleman sat alone in a luxury suite, with a grin stretched across his face. 

""Who's laughing now?"", he whispered

""Who's laughing now?""

Panthers offensively don't have a ton of under the radar guys as most their skill positions are known commodities at this point, but Shi Smith could be a guy who ends up as WR3/4 and likely has low O/U numbers.

DJ Moore. Maybe not so much underrated as much as he's under appreciated outside of this fanbase.

Low hanging fruit but Robbie Anderson is the first one to come to mind. Granted he was great in 2020 so we'll have to see how he performs with Baker.

I'll say CB has the potential to be that if Henderson and Horn take the next step. RB is the obvious answer if CMC stays healthy.

I'd say LB. Outside of Shaq Thompson there are players that are either unproven or new to the team and its yet to be seen how well they'll play in a Phil Snow D.

- my point: “Hubbard is not a good RB2 and we could stand to improve there.”

- what you keep trying to say my point is: “we should go spend major money on a RB2! RB2 is the most important position ever!”

Your “points” are wrong:

1. Pollard: 161 touches in 2021/Elliott: 284 touches in 2021. Elliott was RB1 for the cowboys. Add Cowboys to the list of teams you don’t know shit about.

2. The Cardinals realizing their RB2 was good enough to carry the whole load for their team does not help your point, as that is something I would like for the Panthers to do.

3. AJ Dillon was bad decision to draft in the 2nd round, but he is not an overpay, he’s still on a rookie contract at 4 years/$5million. The Panthers have the most cap space in the league currently and could afford a post-1st-round rookie contract. Aaron Jones (like CMC) was an overpay - not the depth guys lmao.

Meanwhile every single team you listed had a better record than us and routinely had to rely on RB2s throughout the season, as RB1 injuries are very common. Yet, the salary for those guys is extremely low (aside from Connor who is now a RB1 so his salary is good for RB1). You’ll recall that I **never** once implied that we should overpay any RB2. You’re pulling that out your ass because you’ve had to backtrack on every point you’ve attempted to make thus far. In fact, I mentioned cheap FAs and 4th-round picks specifically. 

I won’t even go into how guys like Hunt and Mattison are dirt cheap. The bottom line is Hubbard = ass. RB2 = easy and cheap to upgrade.

It’s not even a “ridiculous” ask either, decent RBs are a dime a dozen and can be picked up in the 4th round or on dirt cheap contracts.

I have a lot of faith in Marshall and although he had a shitty rookie season, he was very impressive in camp and was effectively the number 3 option on an offense with a QB that doesn’t go through his reads… it also didn’t help that he wasn’t 100% last season as he was still dealing with an ankle injury. I will say however, I think that as the season progressed, he got frustrated knowing that he was the 3rd or 4th read that was running clear out routes most of the time and started to get a bit lazy with those routes, which is probably what led to him playing less as the season went on.

> They need a corner to match up with the devastating offenses in their own division. 

This is just nonsensical… we have Donte who while inconsistent has played like a shutdown corner at times, Horn who was a lockdown corner in the 3 games before he got injured, CJ who was the 9th overall pick 2 years ago with loads of star potential and just needs some development and Taylor who has played really well for a 5th round rookie.

I whole heartedly believe if he didn't attempt to play through an injury and just sat the bench while he healed he would still be the qb for the browns. They picked up his 5th year for a reason. 

I made a post here a few months ago that I think he's a great fit and that was when I thought we'd have to give up a 3rd or better for him. A conditional 5th and 5m this year is an absolute steal. 

At this point if you're not excited about this trade and the moves we've made this off-season its hard to believe you're not just a troll.

We also got the receiver he had the most natural connection with in Higgins. I was high on matt corral but I would be very surprised if baker doesn't play his way into a new contract with us.",22.0,panthers,t3_vtspq2,False,0.0,Spider Burns,2022-07-07T16:12:35Z,panthers,0.00988253650965

That just seems like a more likely positive scenario than draft an OL and hope we're some how worse than detroit, Jax, giants, jets, commies, falcons, texans and any surprise terrible team like there usually is. 

In a perfect world we have Ickey, Neal or Cross available and our FO feels good about them. And Darnold or Baker somehow has a career turn around with good weapons and a good line. 

The less perfect scenario is we get one of those guys, we're the worst team in the league and get our qb next year without giving up our future. 

I just don't know how likely either of those scenarios are, we're atleast in the position this year to likely get our choice in guys and if they believe in a guy, I don't know how we don't get him.

I did see that the NFL tried to have Jerrry Richardson change the name and colors:

>There were concerns raised within league circles about the nickname Panthers. A team nicknamed the Panthers and one whose color scheme was predominantly black might have appealed to street gangs and reflected poorly on the NFL. Around the same time, a team with the same nickname, the Florida Panthers, began play in the NHL in 1993. They were owned by Wayne Huizenga, who also was a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins.  
>  
>On July 12, 1993, the NFL sent a letter to the Carolinas’ ownership group suggesting an alternative nickname. The following are excerpts from the letter. …  
>  
>“To offer you some alternatives, enclosed are 13 comps for a potential Carolina Rhinos. If the creature is not native to the Carolinas, then neither is the Lion (or Tiger) to Detroit, the Bear to Chicago, the Ram to Los Angeles, etc. The rhino is a large, powerful creature, fierce when provoked with a skin that is almost a natural version of football pads.“  
>  
>“We never wavered off of the Panthers, even though we had pressure to,” Mark affirmed. “They wanted us to minimize the black and they wanted us to consider a different nickname. At the end we said, ‘We’re paying $140 million, so we ought to be able to name the team what we want it to be and have the colors that we want to have.’ In the end, they agreed.”

If you were like me, you want Steve Smith jerseys, because Agent 89 is on the Mt. Rushmore of Panthers players. But, sadly every year since his retirement, more and more Smitty jerseys are becoming harder to find.

In an effort to replace my Smitty jersey, I saw that the Panthers had a [Mitchell and Ness Smitty jersey here](https://shop.panthers.com/mens-mitchell-and-ness-steve-smith-black-carolina-panthers-2003-legacy-replica-jersey/p-15151167596295+z-9883-2352145890), on the official Panthers website. Sadly, they are limited in sizes.

I spent weeks searching everywhere for these jerseys, even contacting Mitchell and Ness themselves asking when they would make more. They said they weren't going to.

Fortunately, [I found a place in Seattle that had them listed on their website](https://seattleshirt.com/products/nfl-carolina-panthers-steve-smith-sr-2003-legacy-jersey?variant=42785232060674). I emailed asking to see if they legitimately had them in Mediums and Larges (as no other website had those sizes), and they said they did. 

I skeptically placed an order, hoping it wasn't a fake, but in actuality, it's a legit M&N Smitty jersey!

So, if you have the coin to burn and want to grab one of these rarities, the above linked website has them.

Andrews is fine. All pro. All elite. We get it. 

Brown is a deep threat dynamic receiver who is 800-1000 yards of production in the heavy offense. 

You can’t just replace that easily as people are saying with just Bateman. Last year on film I see a small sample size of his yardage and receptions. His touchdown sample size was 1. 

Again, don’t kill me, but I see Bateman as a wr2 and not a 1. The rest of your receivers do not flash me as standouts and that’s okay because you have a top 5 running game. 

Overall I’m still hesitant that Bateman against a cb1 will not do so well.

33173,220104,220104,jakaedahsnakae,"So 1st off, there were no charges brought against him so it is purely speculation what type of charges there might have been unless someone out there knows what the DA was planning. 

2nd the reason no charges were brought was because there was not enough evidence for each case. The reason why that may be the case is because other than physical evidence: video of the assaults, audio recordings, semen. All the evidence they had was circumstantial or hear-say. And from my understanding (im not a lawyer) unless he was convicted in the other cases AND a judge ruled it was okay to use the other cases as corroborating evidence, then it became a he said she said scenario. That's where the court system is limited, whereas we can look at the scenario as he said, she said (x22). The statements of the women all indicate he had a common MO: he would reach out on instagram via DM's, show up to the appointment and expose himself/force them to touch or blow him (or attempt to do those things). Being that these are situations where it's literally 2 people 1 on 1 alone in a room, it becomes really really difficult to prove that he did those things in a court of law (hence why he wasn't charged). BUT when we have 22 professional women say that he did the same or similar things to them, it is safe to conclude that he did do those things. There really isn't a question in my mind.

What makes the criminal thing easy for watson is that in order for there to be charges, they have to prove that he touched them and did what they were saying. And when I say they, I mean each womans account was taken seperately, ergo they couldn't use the other 21 accounts as corroborating evidence. They can only use what each individual woman states happen and unfortunately Instagram dm's aren't enough to prove he did what they said.

They treat free agency as a way to plug holes so they don't have to reach for a player in a position of need in the draft.

These are often viewed as stopgap signings, although some players have recently been re-signed, like Robb(y/ie) Anderson and Frankie Luvu.

Sometimes these are older players who probably don't fit the team's long-term plan, such as at a position where they have young players who aren't quite ready to be a full-time starter, and a veteran is needed to give them time to develop. Matt Ioannidis comes to mind (his deal is a 1-year deal with a bunch of void years) and DaQuan Jones before him. Reddick kind of fits that too with YGM behind him, and other players capable of making an impact in a rotational role like Haynes and Luvu.

In the case of Bozeman, I imagine the Panthers would have preferred to sign him to a 3-year deal like Corbett, but Bozeman probably wanted to sign a 1-year deal and hit the market again before he turns 30. As /u/Hefty-Association-59 pointed out, the market for centers wasn't great. It didn't help Bozeman that J.C.

> Charlotte bankruptcy attorney Andy Houston says a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing often is an attempt to bring order to what can be a chaotic and adversarial process.
> 
> “It’s an effective and efficient way to work through complicated legal matters,” he said. “Filing bankruptcy stops all litigation and channels everything into one forum, the bankruptcy court.”
> 
> The three largest creditors in the GT Real Estate’s bankruptcy filing have combined claims of more than $48 million. All of those claims are listed as “disputed.” That means the creditors will be required to file proof of what they are owed with the court, Houston says.
> 
> Tepper’s company can contest the amounts. Even so, Houston says, bankruptcy court offers a far more streamlined process of administering assets and resolving disputed liabilities than, for example, lawsuits filed in state court.

GT Real Estate Holdings is an LLC (limited liability company). The whole point of setting up an LLC is so you're not personally liable if the company fails. In this case, the city of Rock Hill reneged on their contractually agreed upon financial obligations after construction was well underway. Also a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is different from a Chapter 7 filing, which is used to discharge debt; Chapter 11 is filed to *restructure* debt and pay creditors.

I get that people don't want billionaire owners getting public funding or tax breaks for projects like this. I tend to agree, but I don't live in Charlotte or Rock Hill, so I don't have a dog in this fight. But like it or not, the city of Rock Hill signed a legally binding contract to finance a portion of the project, then was unable to raise the money they committed to spending.

He didn't have enough creativity in his playcalling and it became very stale and predictable. The difference between young hotshot Sean McVay and young hotshot Joe Brady was the former rose up through the NFL ranks while the latter had a cup of coffee with the Saints before returning to the college game.

McAdoo comes from a successful NFL coaching tree and was himself once a young hotshot coordinator candidate. 10 years ago he was a 34 year old tight ends coach for the Packers that the Bucs and Dolphins were interested in hiring as their offensive coordinator, but the Packers blocked them from interviewing him. He got promoted to QB coach for the Packers before getting hired away by the Giants to be their OC.

I initially hated the hire thinking back to McAdoo's disastrous tenure as the Giants' head coach, but I have since done a 180 and now I actually think it's pretty smart. Him being a former head coach is important for Rhule's development. Not to mention he was a pretty good OC when he was with the Giants. He got the best out of Eli Manning and OBJ during his time with them.

Obviously this is a make or break year for Rhule and his entire coaching staff, but there's at least a reason for optimism heading into the 2022 season. We should have a legit power run game for the first time in a long time. The tight ends will no longer be an afterthought in the passing game.

38447,258158,258158,tank4trevor,">Im not sure why anyone would think BC is going to slide right into the LG starting slot.

Rhule has been telegraphing this move since he was drafted, from the ""second round grade as a guard"" tidbit, his well documented desire to have ""length"" at tackle, him being noncommittal every time he was asked if Christensen would play LT, and most importantly his comment that BC would  be a starter ""somewhere"" on the OL. When the Panthers drafted Ekwonu it was a done deal.

>He was bad last year at guard

BC played 84 snaps at guard last year. That's too small of a sample size to definitively say he's bad. He was also taking snaps at 4 different positions in practice. He should get better over time getting consistent reps at LG.

Let me be clear: I'm not saying he's going to be an All Pro, particularly not right out of the gate. But it doesn't make sense to bring in a veteran LG before Christensen has even had a real shot. This was a guy the Panthers traded up for last year after almost taking him in the second round.",1.0,panthers,t3_ugujgr,False,0.0,Tepper,2022-05-02T16:40:24Z,panthers,0.0004252711871899
38448,258159,258159,tank4trevor,"Christensen is going to play LG, hands down. Rhule has already said he would be a starter, and we just drafted Ekwonu to play LT. The other 3 positions are set with Bozeman, Corbett and Moton.

LB is thin but Shaq and Damien Wilson will be the starters, with Littleton being the next man up in the event Wilson is suspended. Brandon Smith could be in the mix but he's pretty raw. The Panthers play a ton of nickel though, so there shouldn't be too many instances of having 3 LBs on the field at once.

Xavier Woods is gonna be a starting safety, like it or not. The Panthers didn't sign him to a 3 year deal to be a backup. Juston Burris is back, plus there are some young guys who are still developing like Kenny Robinson.

TE is the same group as last year, but with an OC that will actually use them more in the passing game. Tremble could be really good. Ian Thomas isn't going to light the world on fire but he's not as bad as people make him out to be. He should see more opportunities this year in 2 TE sets with Tremble.

Terrace Marshall is the biggest question mark IMO. Ideally he takes a step forward and becomes a bigger part of the offense, but that could be just wishful thinking. I'm a little surprised people are completely writing off Robby Anderson though. He's just a year removed from a 1000 yard season. He's been extremely durable, not missing a single game in the last 3 years. I don't think it's a stretch to say that between Anderson and Marshall someone will step up and be a solid WR2.

IMO you're conflating ""holes"" with non pro bowl level players, when in reality a ""hole"" is a below average player that's a liability at a given position. For example, last year we had ""holes"" at LT, LG, and RG on the offensive line. We certainly could have upgraded at center over Paradis, but he wasn't a complete liability. Meanwhile Erving, Elflein and Daley were all below average starters at their respective positions.

This year Bozeman, Corbett and Moton are all proven, solid players. Ekwonu is expected to step in and play at a high level from day 1. Perhaps it's fair to say Christensen is a question mark at LG, but if he doesn't play well there are another half dozen players who can compete for the starting LG spot, including this year and last year's 6th round picks, Brown and Mays.",2.0,panthers,t3_ugujgr,False,0.0,Tepper,2022-05-02T14:45:43Z,panthers,-0.017987377887551

Evaluating and drafting a true franchise QB is hard. That's why the Broncos gave up so much for Wilson, and why the Browns gave up a ton of money AND looked past legal troubles AND gave the highest amount of guaranteed money in NFL history to land Watson.

The Panthers easily could have used the #6 pick on a QB. Instead it cost them a pick at the end of the 4th round and a future 3rd round pick. That's a pittance for a team without a franchise QB.

I don't love trading a future 1st round pick. but Olave was my 1B WR and Penning could wind up being a solid LT for them. If Taylor hits too they will have another really solid draft class. The one problem I have with their draft is they only took 5 players. Considering the Saints' cap issues, they could have used more players on cheap rookie contracts. My grade: B

I think the Falcons, more than any other team perhaps, should have traded down in the first round. They had a ton of holes to fill and a terrible cap situation. I think they could have still gotten their guy in Drake London but added an extra pick or two in the process had they traded back from 8. I'm surprised they didn't address the safety position in a deep draft, but then again they had a ton of holes to fill. I don't mind the Allgeier pick in a vacuum as a depth guy, but the Falcons still have one of the worst RB rotations in the league. My grade: C

It's hard to nitpick the Bucs' draft when they have a fairly talented roster. They filled their two biggest needs with their first two picks, they double dipped at TE, and they added a RB who can potentially replace Gio Bernard. I think taking a punter in the 4th was a bit high, but this is a team with relatively few holes in the roster, so it's more forgivable. My grade: A-

And finally, I think the Panthers killed it. I was pounding the table to trade down, but then again I never thought Ekwonu would be there at 6. Once he was drafted I figured the Panthers would trade back into the 1st or 2nd to get Corral or Howell, so getting Corral at the bottom of the 3rd is nuts. The rest of the picks could be complete busts and this still would be a great draft if Ekwonu and Corral both work out. Corral was my QB1 in this class based off of his potential fit in the Panthers' offense. Smith, Barno and Barnes are nice lotto tickets; if 1/3 pans out that's a great outcome. I like the Cade Mays pick, but that could be from name recognition more than anything else. Philosophically I am all about drafting a ton of offensive linemen because you can never have too many.

If you're a contender like the Packers that's tight against the cap, having an experienced receiver on such a cheap deal is very valuable, especially considering the inflated contracts that receivers have been signing this year. $1.2 million is less than Terrace Marshall's cap hit as a rookie 2nd round pick.

I think the Panthers could get a 2nd round pick in return, particularly if there's a run on receivers at the end of the first round. The Packers and Chiefs both have 2 second round picks and a need at wide receiver. The Patriots have a terrible track record drafting WRs and might be better off trading for a known commodity. I doubt the Lions would give up their 2nd but who knows, considering they've got another pick at the end of the first round.

To everyone saying that wouldn't happen: why would the Panthers take on $19 million in dead money for anything less than a day 2 pick?

38455,258168,258168,tank4trevor,"No offense Kaleb, but you don't seem to be very plugged in to the Panthers beyond looking at Darnold's statline from 2021 and the Panthers' record since Rhule has been hired.

It's true the Panthers have been bad the past 4 years. It's also true that last year Darnold stunk and the offensive line was one of the worst in the league. Matt Rhule didn't come in and immediately turn things around, and by winning percentage the Panthers were technically worse last year due to the 17 game season.

All that said, the roster is miles better than it was since Rhule was hired. The bulk of the effort in overhauling the roster was focused on the defense in years 1 and 2. Derrick Brown, Yetur Gross-Matos, Jeremy Chinn, Jaycee Horn and CJ Henderson were all drafted / traded for, as well as a bunch more guys filling depth roles. Overall the defense has no gaping holes after signing a few veterans in free agency.

On offense there's still work to do, but it's not the dumpster fire everyone is making it out to be. People fail to realize just how much better the offensive line is going to be this year. Bozeman and Corbett are MASSIVE upgrades at their respective positions. Brady Christensen didn't get a ton of playing time last year, but he looked promising in limited snaps. I'm not going to say Deonte Brown will even crack the starting lineup, but he will at least be playing it a scheme that is way more suited to his skillset. The only major question mark is LT, assuming Christensen slots in at LG to start the season.

The elephant in the room is obviously the QB situation. Personally, I don't want to draft a QB at 6, but I don't think it would be a disaster with the right guy. The Panthers could sign Duane Brown as a stopgap at LT, and regardless of whether it's Darnold or a rookie under center they would be in a pretty good situation with a solid offensive line, good receiving corps, and a solid rotation of running backs.

I think it's a bit overstated too how bad the coaching staff is. Although Rhule is still the head coach, McAdoo is arguably an upgrade at OC over Brady, and considering how bad the offensive line has been Campen is most likely an upgrade over Meyer as well. Bringing Wilks back as the secondary coach is an under-the-radar big move to work with some of the ascending young players in the secondary. Special teams should show some improvement as well under Chris Tabor.

On top of everything else, the division got worse. Bruce Arians and Sean Payton retired. Matt Ryan was traded away. The Saints and Falcons both are in salary cap hell. And the NFC as a whole had a mass exodus of talent to the AFC. So while the Panthers may not truly be ""a QB away,"" they very well might be a QB with a pulse away from a winning record and even a possible playoff berth.",1.0,panthers,t3_ucepad,False,0.0,Tepper,2022-04-26T16:49:05Z,panthers,0.0188658225522678

If one of the top EDGE players falls to 6, there could be some interest in trading up. Ditto for Gardner/Stingly or Hamilton, or maybe even WR1. The Eagles, Saints, Packers and Chiefs all need WR help and all have multiple first round picks.

And finally, as much as this sub would hate it, if Neal or Ekwonu falls, the Panthers could almost certainly trade back with one of the many teams needing LT help.

Will Grier was right there, ready to drive that tank. He could have landed us Trevor Lawrence the same way Jimmy Clausen got us Cam. But instead, the team spent a bunch of money in free agency, wiping out any chance at comp picks. McCaffrey signed a huge extension, becoming the highest paid RB in the league.

I'm really torn on this and I think the front office is as well. I'm basing this off of four nuggets from Fitterer's most recent press conference (paraphrasing here):

* The ideal way to build a roster is a QB on a rookie contract
* Fitt wants to get to a point where the roster is a QB away
* They're willing to continue to take swings at QB until they find their guy
* The Panthers want to be aggressive in their pursuit to improve the roster

Those statements are somewhat contradictory. If the Panthers swing and miss at a QB at #6 overall with no more picks in the top 100, they won't be in a good position to pursue a veteran QB in free agency or by trade. If they trade back and try and beef up the roster the could miss out on a potential swing at a franchise QB this year. Both options have merit.

There are a ton of guys on one year deals who are free agents next year: Bozeman, Ioannidis, Littleton, Foreman, Zylstra, Higgins and basically all the depth players at safety to name a few. The Panthers need to draft players to backfill some of those roster spots or they'll be right back where they started filling holes again next offseason.

The top 150ish picks are where the bulk of the starting caliber players are drafted. You can look at last years' draft and draw a line around there between the starters and the backups. Right now the Panthers only have 4 picks in that range, and obviously only one is in the top 100.

Because the Panthers restructured McCaffrey and Robby Anderson's deals, making them unlikely to be traded, the only realistic way to accumulate any 2nd or 3rd round picks is to trade back. This is the bottom line: Fitt has to get the buy-in from Tepper and Rhule to take a calculated risk and trade back in the first, hoping their preferred QB is still there.

I think ultimately that's the route they go. I could easily see the Panthers making moves and getting an additional 4 or more top-150 picks from trading down in the 1st. If they can do that an still get their guy, they look like geniuses. Additionally, if he busts, they won't do as much long term damage if they still manage to draft some impact players from the picks acquired from trading down.

There are multiple reasons why I think a trade down with specifically a team like Baltimore makes sense, but I'll save that for a later day.

Basically every offseason move points to a more run heavy, play-action offense, and Corral fits that like a glove. If McAdoo can scheme up a bunch of RPOs and screens, Corral can step in day 1 and effectively run the offense.

Also based on everything Fitterer has said, drafting a QB is the direction the team is going.
