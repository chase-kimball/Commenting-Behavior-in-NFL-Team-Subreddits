736,5710,5710,A--A-RON,"It was brought up on Saturday that some users may not be a fan of the locking of the sub during games. I wanted to have a civil conversation about this because at the end of the day...

1. This was put in place to help the community stay organized on game days, and prevent trolling. 
2. This sub's moderators have never taken the stance ""It is our way or get lost"". Every decision made is for the community. Therefore if there is a rule or procedure that the community as a whole has a problem with, it should be discussed in a civil manor and is up for negotiation. 

How it Currently is: One hour before games, through one hour after the game, New posts are not allowed on r/buccaneers. Users can freely comment in the game thread. 

My concern as the head automod config mod on r/buccaneers: I am concerned that if we remove this policy, not only will be bombarded with trolls but the quality of posts during games will be poor. 

My proposal: If the community would like this policy removed, my counter proposal is that we only allow posts during games that are tagged [Injury Report] and [Highlights], all other posts will be removed. That means if you try posting ""lol fire Todd Bowles"" it would be removed. If you post ""[Highlight] Mike Evans catches a 89 YARD touchdown over Latimore"" and include a quality video(not a recoding from your tv) it would go through. 

Again, This policy was never made so that the mods can flex any power you may think we are hungry for. I think it is safe to say we have a great community here, and I would hope the majority of the users here realize that us mods are only here for you. We don't get paid, we don't get perks. 

As always, I open the floor for civil and productive conversation.

785,5830,5830,A--A-RON,"I'm looking for a civil discussion. 

I do not understand the hate for possibly taking the best available running back in the draft at 33. 

When Lenny got hurt before, we had Rojo, now we don't. I have not seen enough from Keshawn Vaugn to be confident and if Lenny was out for an extended period of time, I think our offense would be screwed. 

We already missed out on the top EDGE rushing talent, and arguably the best Defensive Back talent... so why not stack the deck and give Brady another weapon out of the backfield?

If we are truly in win now mode, why take a rotational Defensive lineman/EDGE rusher when we can take the best running back in the draft Breece Hall?

1. To remove that burden of having **you** report trolls to us mods.

2. To hide the troll comments all together, so we can talk about the game in peace, win or lose. 

**That being said, starting this season, we will be removing all non-flaired user comments on gamedays. We will be sending out a message reminding you of this if you try to comment without a user flair. We will also be testing the new(ish) crowd control feature which hides comments from users who have negative karma on r/buccaneers, are not subscribed, or brand new accounts who could be trolls trying to evade a ban.**

Well that is one.

As you mention all natural turf grass fields are not alike.   It's really easy to shittily maintain a natural field.   It's easy for a guy to fuck something up too.   It takes a lot of work, knowledge, and in some cases luck for a field to be in good shape every week.  For a properly installed Field Turf field it's pretty much always going to be the same.  Not saying teams shouldn't put in that effort, but some weeks regardless of the intention the field will be in bad shape, and it will contribute to injury.

That said, I think at the NFL level it's the best place for natural grass in most cases.  In a high school or college setting, turf probably prevents more injuries due to those schools not being able to maintain a natural field as well.  There's certainly some areas of the country and some schools who can do it, but my high school field was a death trap.  If they could have afforded it, turf would have been much better (it would have been astro-turf back then)  In the NFL in some places it's just a matter of money, like in Carolina.   But domes are a problem, and north can be a problem, GB does it, but weather still causes issues, as a heated field can only do so much.   

Honestly, I think putting more money into improving artificial turf is actually the answer.

I know everyone thinks of Welker and Edelman as the scrappy 'non-traditional' receivers who have had success with Brady, so why can't Scottie be the next guy?   The answer is he's probably not the caliber of those guys.   And best case, to use another guy Brady has played with who fits the same... um... profile, he's probably closer to Danny Amondala than those two.   

It's OK... if we let Scottie go, he's still got a career out there, but we do have others on the roster who make more sense right now.

He was actually pretty good in KC, relatively, but for someone who had watched him since the 80's it was clear he was not anywhere near the top of his game.  Add to that, that they really made the right decision moving on with just some shitty QB they picked up from a shitty team, I can see the point of view.

We've seen other high-end HOFr's move and in the case of Favre it was a publicity disaster with not great payoff.   Manning was pretty amazing in Denver, but it did feel weird, and that last season, oh man, he was done.  Brady at this point is well beyond what is a reasonable age for a QB to play at a high level.   But he's playing better than anyone.   

I also think he managed the switch better, as he really did adjust his public persona.   Montana seemed like he was on a ride, Manning was a robot that plays football, and Favre, well, he decided to start sending dick pics.   Brady becomes a Buc, but somehow at the same time redefines what that should be.   There are dozens of case studies to be done on his transition here from a leadership and marketing perspective, because it has been insane how successful it has been.  There have been tons of talented and successful people who have failed because they didn't do what he has done as well, outside the NFL.

So while I can understand the perspective, the thing everyone has to do with Brady is realize this guy is an anomaly.  He's ridiculously smart, ridiculously talented, and ridiculously savvy, and finally he's stupid charismatic, sure people hate him, but once he has an opening he can turn that around quick.

But in order to be above average there has to be no more than 14 guys above them.   We know that Brady, Rodgers, Stafford are certainly in the top 10 QB's.   I'd also say Prescott is probably there.   We love to hate guys like Cousins, Murray and Wentz, but while they're not our favorites they're at least statistically, last season, above average.

I'm skeptical, because Robinson has shown he either gives up on routes or is frequently out of sync with his QB.   It's not that he drops a lot of balls, he isn't anywhere near where he probably should be when the ball is thrown.  Put a guy like D.J.

We have a new expansion team with no home city.   It is a true ""America's Team.""   It's location can move each year, with cities putting together packages for the season.   The home cities are set for the upcoming 4 years, and every year a new location is announced between the Superbowl and draft.   A location can only be used every 4 years.    

To balance the conferences, and serve the international goals of the NFL, a ""Not America's Team"" is also added, but its locations are outside of the US.  

Neither of these teams are confined to the NFC or AFC, they swap each season.   They also are placed in a different division within the conference each year.

The team mascots are fixed, But each year, these teams can rebrand their colors, and obviously city/locale name into a new concept.   Provides great sales opportunities.

Now the NFL gets the ability to target and test new locations, along with increasing exposure of the league.   Obviously playing in games overseas or in BFE is a large ask for players, so I propose this: These teams are owned and managed by the NFLPA and players are given shares, based on every year they are on an active roster for more than (x) games.   But a backup tackle gets the same share as a starting QB.

Seriously though, a good QB & receiver combo knows the playbook and the QB is making a decision based on the idea that the receiver should be here, he can get here, and the defenders won't be there (decision making), the receiver is running his route with the intent to be in the right place at the right time (precision).   One way the QB can adjust this, is by changing the arc of the path of the ball.    So what we see as a rainbow is intended to be a perfectly executed pass to the receiver.  

All goes back to Walsh's offenses which were quite explicitly timing based and require the QB and R to be in sync to work properly. Walsh's schemes allowed OK athletes with a lot of practice  to seem great and great athletes to excel, and it's still core to most pro offenses.  The biggest problem is that it takes time to develop that understanding between a QB an receiver,  and if one isn't on the right page yet the other has to be able to compensate.

One things the books did so much better is express the massive amount of time for anything to happen on a solar-system scale.   The TV show wasn't able to do that as well.   You start moving something from the asteroid belt to the earth, well... it takes time and that's non negotiable even with the Epstein drive being a thing.

Jumping forward to the Persepolis Risng story immediately after season six would have been bad, and against the rigor they put into the books to keep them somewhat realistic (minus a super advanced alien race and the deus ex machina of the Epstein drive) The idea that anything on that scale could have happened outside of a human generation is just silly.

I think Moon could have gone ~ 4th round, but in no way was he a clear cut hall of famer.  He might have, or he might have lasted later, he would have been a stretch any earlier.   Objectively looking at the two in 1978 you'd say Williams is a far better bet.   

And Williams was a great QB.   He managed to help elevate a bad TB team to a NFC championship appearance.  He won a superbowl.     Ironically, if you want to look at racism at the QB position, Doug Williams is probably a better example because he was screwed by Culverhouse in contract negotiations, and went to the USFL for 3 years.   If those 3 years were in the NFL, he might be in the HoF today.   Now I'm not going to say that was because he was black, because there were more problems with the Bucs when his career in Tampa came to an end, but if we're just inferring racism, there's a lot of places there it could be inferred. 

Personally, I think both these guys endured things they should not have had to.   But the narrative that Moon wasn't drafted solely because he was black is not accurate.   He wasn't drafted because he was already signed with the CFL, and he didn't have an amazing college career.  Had he thrown for 2500 yards in 1977, no doubt he'd have been a first or second rounder.

Today just about every college game has easily accessible film, stats are updated and easily accessed after a game.  Then, even the top teams had maybe a couple games that got televised.   There was no sports center to show highlights, and most of the time that great performance was only really seen by the fans in the stands.  You couldn't travel as effortlessly across the country as you can today, and teams had real budgets because they weren't the billion dollar organizations they are today.

What happened with Moon was he would have been a later round pick, which wasn't really out of line with what he did in college.  So instead he  decided to sign with Edmonton, before the NFL draft, he was essentially off the table.   When he decided to move to the NFL, there were a lot of teams interested.   

Has there historically been racism in sports?  Yes absolutely.   Has there been some specific racism around the QB position, yes, I think that also is pretty clear.    Was that why Moon went undrafted?  No, it was because he already was signed with a CFL team.  

Why would he go to the CFL though, they make nothing compared to NFL players, right?   They made less back then too, but NFL salaries have ballooned, then, they were much closer than today.   Moon made more than some NFL quarterbacks did when he was in Edmonton.

It aired at 2:30PM, which proved to be an unfortunate time-slot for a show targeted at middle-school age children.  There it was followed by the locally popular ""Gary Springer Show"" which capitalized on emulating the more well known ""Jerry Springer Show"" and leveraged a different vagrant as the host each episode.  Outside the US,  the show was shown in 12 countries, 4 of which no longer exist.

The show ran for 2 seasons, the first having 17 episodes, and the second was abruptly cut short after just 6 episodes.   The final episode was only 14 minutes long, and revealed that the entire series was actually just a fantasy of the main character.",5.0,nfl,t3_tqd9f5,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers,2022-03-29T07:13:26Z,buccaneers,-0.0017302538236201

It's a super young team, and Taylor & Pittman are both going to get better this year, which is a bit scary.   It's going to come down to whether their defense can hold up well, because I think the colts offense will be significantly improved.   Leonard  is amazing, but they do need some of their young players to emerge.  They get to play the Texans and the Jags twice.   Titans do not have that division locked up this year.   Some of it will come down to how good and consistent the AFCW will be, since they're matched up.   

Both those teams should handle the other two in their division, so it should come down to how they play the west, and each  other and then the NFCN matchups favor the colts.

5295,31726,31726,CoopNine,"I think the argument really boils down to who was carrying who.   In reality it was a bit of both.   Belichick and the patriots org did some great things, and so did brady.  Neither results in the number of superbowls without the other.  

Brady winning here pretty much cements him as being the best QB ever, because he proved it wasn't just Bill making things work.  (although it really should have been 28-3) that did that.   Yeah, the Bucs were better than they were the year before agnostic of Brady, but not  too much, the biggest piece was replacing a QB who was a liability with one who is amazing. Gronk was a huge addition, Lenny was a huge addition, even fucking AB was a nice addition.  But Brady was the difference.   Bill also has to overcome his history of being pretty bad elsewhere, while we aren't going to worry about Brady's struggles to be a starter in college.   I think what the Pats did with Mac Jones this year was outstanding as an outsider to that org, but really Belichick has never really been successful yet without Brady, but this isn't necessarily a checkmark against him, their two careers just coincided.   

At the end of the day, Brady is the most successful QB in the history of the NFL and Bill is the most successful coach in the history of the NFL. Thats pretty cool for both of them, but after a couple years of TB12 in tampa I think a lot more people got to appreciate him as a person and a leader, which has been super beneficial to his legacy.  BB needs to come down to Florida and let lose a little.  Shit... Imagine BB coming down to tampa after BA walks into the sunset.  And then taking a 47 year old Brady to another superbowl win.

Lynch in my opinion was more a player who defined his position during his era than Rhonde was.   Both were amazing, both are among the greatest to play at their position, but Lynch was that iconic player at safety.   When I think of a great safety I think of Lynch or Lott.  (Ironically you could also probably make an arguement for Lott at CB, because the man was amazing at both positions) 

At CB I do have a longer list, and while Rhonde sits near the top of mine, it's not as clear cut as I feel Lynch is.  I mean Rhonde was good, but he didn't even have a neat nickname, no neon night trains in sight.

I'd say Lynch is pretty easily arguable at top 5 at his position ever.  Ronde you can argue top 10 or 15 pretty easily, top 5 will be a little rough if you're objective.

5496,32170,32170,Coral_Polyps,"So actually I have some experience with this. About 4 years ago I was working the night shift at a hospital when a family brought their 6 year old son into the emergency room and he was immediately brought to the ICU. The family says that they had a tire swing in their backyard and the rope had snapped, causing him yo flip upside-down and land on his head.

He was in the ICU for 7 or 8 hours I believe, and luckily they were able to stabilize him and his family were then allowed to see him. They eventually moved him up to a private room where the boy and his family could get some privacy while the doctors figured out the best way for him to recover. 

It was probably about 3 days later when the boy finally spoke up and told a nurse that he hadn't been able to sleep that night, or any night since arriving at the hospital. The doctors worried that maybe he had been bleeding internally in his skull, and the pressure of the now-coagulating blood might be the cause of his restlessness. 

They did the whole 9 yards with MRIs/CAT scans but nothing turned up. Other than a small fracture on the underside of his jaw, he looked perfectly normal. 

Worried that the lack of sleep would soon begin to negatively impact the boy's organs and cognitive abilities, they prescribed some pretty heavy doses of sleeping medication, but 24 hours later nothing had changed.

As it turns out, Tom Brady, 7 times superbowl champion quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (At the time Patriots) was visiting the hospital- I believe- for a 'Make a wish event that was happening in another wing of the building.

Well, apparently word made it's way to Tom about the boy's struggle to sleep and he was very adamant about seeing the boy as soon as possible. The boy was ecstatic to meet Tom and told him about how he always played as him in Madden. They chatted for a few minutes and then Tom suggested a treatment for his current condition.

I wasn't in the room at this point, but I was just a few meters away at the nurse's station. Tom suggested to the boy, and his family, that he sing a lullaby to put the child to sleep. It seemed a bit silly, but it was Tom Brady and even though it likely wouldn't work, it would still be enjoyable. So they all agreed and Tom began to sing... _""Lullaby..... and good night...""_

Only 30 seconds later one of the heart rate monitors at my nurse's station began beeping erratically and flashing red, indicating an extremely low heart rate. The boy's heart rate had dropped to 36 bpm. I rushed into the room to see what was happening, and was mortified by what I saw.

The boy, his father, mother, little sister, and 4 of the 5 doctors in the room at the time were all comatose. His song had worked so well they all were sent- not just to sleep- but into a literal coma. The 5th doctor had locked herself in the bathroom and was screaming ""La La La La"" to try and block out Tom Brady's voice. When I entered Tom was fiddling with the door handle to the bathroom, not even trying to open it, but rather just to make it rattle. He was gently saying, ""It's nappy time little one,"" through the door when he turned to me and made eye contact. 

He paused for a brief moment, still maintaining eye contact, and then he gently started again, ""Lullaby..."" and I immediately sprinted out of the room, and explained the situation to security.

When they arrived, Tom was nowhere to be found, nor were there any records indicating that he would have ever been there that day. Make A Wish told us he never participated in an event that month, and the Patriots front office told us he was at practice on the date and time I told them.

More to the point about his voice, him simply singing ""Lullably"" was the most gentle, warm, and calming thing I have ever heard on this planet. Even now, I yawn insistently day in and day out because of it. I believe if I hadn't escaped when I did, I too would have been put into such a deep sleep I wouldn't have woken up.

The boy and his family? They haven't woken up these past 4 years, but every year on the anniversary of the incident, they get anonymous flowers sent to their room with a card that says, ""My name is Tom Brady, 7 time superbowl champion and quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and you can catch me on _The Masked Singer_ weekdays at 8, 7 central only on Fox""",110.0,nfl,t3_wsffcg,False,0.0,:Buccaneers: Buccaneers,2022-08-19T11:27:31Z,buccaneers,0.0226333539514355

Add an elite offensive talent.  Have him for 4-5 years of cheap contract.  Can be an immediate contributor, which is important in all of Tom's remaining years, as they each might be his last.

Our defense was bad last year because of injuries.  I think we were missing 3 members of the secondary on a regular basis.  We shore up the depth chart and add Ryan's replacement.

Phidarian, Phiddy, Mathis is 3 Tech out of Alabama.  While there's still going to be a learning curve in the NFL, he's as pro-ready as they come.  Whether we re-sign Suh or not, Phiddy will add a talented body to a unit that needs one to help it over the course of 20-21 games.

* R4 P133 - IDL - John Ridgeway

Ridgeway offers us the chance to get Vita Vea a backup and be more versatile with our fronts.  Vita plays in ~50-60% of snaps these days, which allows us to rest him for the plays he's needed, but it does leave a sizeable hole in the roster when he rests.

* R7 P248 - RB -Zonovan Knight

There's not a whole lot we can use pick 248 on that's going to be 'sure-fire', but we're thin at RB currently, this guy has excellent return skills, and he's elusive AF.  He has a path to the team through special teams, but a truly dangerous underneath threat is a piece missing from the offense.

When he was playing with the second team in the first half we saw him under throw miller, dink and dunk down the field, and hand off the ball as much as physically possible. 

2.) You’re right preseason games do mean nothing. Last year we all thought Chase was a bust because he couldn’t catch the ball. Defenses in the preseason run basic schemes to not give anything away for the season and offenses run basic schemes as well. So trask beating them even with his 3rd team o line doesn’t get me anywhere close to seeing QB1 because the disparity in scheme and talent from where he’s playing now and in an actual nfl game is so large

3.) I don’t think ronde is stupid and knows nothing about football. I do think he is paid by the team to commentate and wants to hype up fans for players, especially one coming from UF. As well QBs are award winners by nature of the position (see Brady winning sb mvp over James white) and trask played longer than anyone else, giving him the most stats (still only 1 td btw).

19984,128948,128948,TheRencingCoach,">	Did we get stronger at any position groups

Imo - stronger and weaker are simplistic ways of framing this. There are trade offs to how teams and position groups are constructed and we, as fans, should try and think about those!

Let’s take WRs for example:

-	Depth: more proven
-	Investment - Salary hit: much higher, thanks to signing Godwin, Gage, and Julio Jones (last one still feels weird to say). Salary hit here is a multi year impact
-	Investment - draft picks: none (*because* we prioritized proven depth)
-	Scheme fit: Gage and Julio are probably gonna fit in pretty well
-	Injury concerns: many, especially with all of our WRs either being injured (Godwin), injury prone (Evans, Julio, Godwin), and another year older (meaning, chance of injury is higher)

Overall, is this group stronger than last year? Hopefully - at the cost of many salary cap $$ and an older group of players which may get injured more easily.  

Anyway, that being said this is my overly simplified breakdown:

Stronger:
-	WR - hopefully
-	RB - guessing that replacing RoJo with White is an upgrade
-	iDL - assuming that Hicks stays healthy and Hall is worth a second round pick

Same:
-	QB
-	OT
-	EDGE/OLB - JPP was mostly injured so his loss will be felt more in the locker room than on the field. 
-	ILB
-	CB - same guys, we’re just paying Davis waaay more. Let’s see how the depth looks with McCollum. Improvements at S should help mitigate any depth issues here
-	S - loss of Whitehead hurts because he was proven and cheap. We don’t know if Neal will be able to be healthy and provide the same level of play. We don’t know if Logan Ryan has lost a step - hopefully the combination of those two will help our secondary as a whole. This is one more place where we went with proven experience and paid money for it instead of using draft picks. 
-	P - used a draft pick to save some salary cap $$ and hopefully get play that’s just as good. Let’s see
-	K - same guy, just older. 
-	LS - is this still Triner? Assuming it’s the same lol 

Weaker:
-	TE - no Gronk and 2 rookies at a position which is hard to translate to the NFL 
-	iOL - last year we had proven experience, this group *may* be better, but they’re unproven",5.0,buccaneers,t3_x6eg31,False,0.0,:winfieldPeace: Winfield Jr. ✌️,2022-09-05T10:57:12Z,buccaneers,0.001625969133117

And a small nitpick on what you said: I think the roster battle right now is one of ability+contract, not potential…. If they had the spots, they’d keep everyone…. Instead, it could make sense to move on from 400 yards earlier instead of later. 

Like if you’re deciding between Darden and Miller, Miller will be a FA at the end of the season, while Darden will have 2 years left. If you cut Miller today and you can try to replace his 400yards with Darden’s for the next 3 seasons (this plus 2 more). If you cut Darden today, you’d still have to do something about Scotty at the end of the season *and* you don’t have Darden to step up into his place.

That’s why we drafted guys like Godwin, Watson, Miller, Johnson, and Darden…. And that’s why we re-signed Godwin, and let Watson go.

28283,169619,169619,j4ni,"Well, short answer: yes.     

Long‘ish one: while losing weight (or rather bodyfat , since we don’t want to loose muscle) is the result of the simple equation energy input vs. energy used, alcohol a) reduces the amount of fat the body burns as it is dismantled into an acetic acid in the liver the body sees as a poisonous substance and hence tries to get rid of it as fast as possible thus burning it before using fat but more importantly b) consuming alcohol will very likely lead to consuming more calories than planned as you’ve got less control over yourself and will probably get snacky especially in a social setting.

If you know you’re going out and have some drinks, limit yourself to a certain amount of alcoholic beverages, make sure you have some healthy and not too calorie-dense snacks at hand and try to make some room for the extra calories by eating less calories throughout the day. (Which makes it even more important to set yourself a reasonable limit as you might get intoxicated earlier due to lesser food being consumed).

Here are their touch numbers under 27, including playoffs, which my original numbers did not.

Johnson touches (including Playoffs) by age:

* 2015 (24) = 206
* 2016 (25) = 373
* 2017 (26) = 17
* 2018 (27) = 308 **Included this entire season even though he was only 26 for part of it**
*  Total = 904

Fournette touches (including Playoffs) by age:

* 2017 (22) = 304
* 2018 (23) = 155
* 2019 (24) = 418
* 2020 (25) = 215
* 2021 (26) = 271

Total = 1363.

So the touch numbers you had a quite a bit off for one.  Second, Fournette has had at least 1 full season more under 27 than Johnson, so of course it makes sense that Fournette has more touches under 27 than Johnson has.

Evans: 297 Rec, 4722 Yards, and 43 TDs
Adams: 432 Rec, 5310 Yards, and 47 TDs

While this favors Adams, I think it points to what sets Evans apart, which is his longevity and consistency. If you ask Bucs fans, of course we’ll always put Evans top 5 or even top 3 at any given point in time, but that’s just not the case when you ask NFL fans as a whole. However, looking since 2014, top WRs have come and gone, but there’s no way to argue Evans isn’t 3 or 4. It’s Julio, AB, and then Evans or DHop depending whether you prefer 478 yards or 9 touchdowns.

It’s funny listing out the names at any given time too to see how things have changed. In 2016, it was Julio, AB, and OBJ. In 2019, it was Michael Thomas. In 2020, it was Diggs, Adams, and Tyreek.

The issue is twofold- a lot of times I get anxiety thinking about doing the work because it seems daunting, but it always ends up easier then it seems if I just do it one step at a time.

Derrick Ward RB, Eric Wright CB, Chris Baker DT, Robert Ayers DE, Michael Johnson DE, Albert Haynesworth DT, AB WR. Some of the many major FA flops.

Gerald McCoy, too friendly for a DT, and tried way too hard to be the next Sapp for us. I feel like he was too confident for someone with zero playoff appearances. Ecstatic about him at first. 

Josh Freeman, had a clutch ability to win come back games in the 4th. But also had an ability to fumble or throw a costly int.

Michael Clayton, First year was decent, could block but had feet for hands. 

""Jaboo"" Jameis Winston, I was sold on the pick as at the time of the draft I really believed he was the best QB, he was better than Mariota in my eyes, was actually the first jersey I ever purchased (red color rush), felt like he would get out of the turnover issues  but there's just no way to defend 30 for 30. Despite the 5k yards. 

Any kicker post Matt Bryant, however Succop has been the most efficient for us and I do trust him to make most kicks.
