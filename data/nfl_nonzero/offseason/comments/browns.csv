I think Baker can improve for sure. The fact that he started going to a QB coach is a good start. His arm talent is really good, and his accuracy is elite when hes healthy. But his head just wasnt at an NFL level and his mechanics completely broke down. 

In 2020, AVP completely changed his motion and they made the offense extremely easy for him to read. He was successful (to say the least).

In 2019 they gave him the aaron rodgers treatment and let him sling it wherever he felt like going and had the recievers just running trees all game long. (He was not successful).

Baker needs to accept that he HAS to walk before he can run. If he does that and he genuinly works every second at becoming the best and listens to his coaches and QB coaches. He can certainly get there. But it wasnt going to happen in Cleveland in the same way Breese would have never been successful in San Diego.

4447,26906,26906,ClevelandOG,"Im not going to put that play completely on Baker, but that play is a good illustration of why Baker was so frustrating.

The initial read should have been middle field closed, even though it turned out to be bracket coverage. In any case, on his left you had press coverage on an in-route. Which is totally fine, you can throw it there if you want, even though it's a difficult throw, it isnt a bad read.

The problem i have is that to his right, he had a perfect set of routes to beat middle field closed. He had an inside fade (Njoku), an option (Landry) and a quick hitch (Higgins). 

You know the inside fade will beat middle field closed all day or it will at least cause the safety to move over to it. In which case you have an extremely easy completion with Landry on the deep hitch.

If you watch the play, Landry is open by 3 yards and it would have been the easiest first down they had.

Was the decision to look to his left and try to hit DPJ on the in route a bad one? No. It wasnt. It would just have been much much easier if he looked right instead.

*That* was my issue with Baker. He has to make everything harder than it needs to be. He decides where hes going with the ball and he goes there no matter what. Does it look great when he threads a 15 yard rope down the middle between 3 defenders? Of course it does, but it looks equally as bad when the ball gets tipped and picked when he could have just taken a checkdown when the throw wasnt there.

Tl;dr not Baker's fault, but he took the harder correct read and the no-call happened which was unfortunate. But you can never count on refs especially with 30 seconds left in a game, and nobody was close enough to landry on that play to even touch him.

There is a reason he doesnt usually make those throws. It's because as a backup QB hes supposed to be a game manager who just possesses the ball and not lose it at all costs. Throwing long over the middle is risky no matter what... But it seems like the Browns coaching staff wants him to take some risks as hes no longer considered a backup.

Baker was great at throwing those deep intermediate middle routes (he threw them a lot, which is partly why his pick numbers are higher) but couldnt operate against middle field closed to save his life. Thats why every team stacked the box like their life depended on it and left a single high safety... The ravens kept NINE in the box against baker all game... Repeat...

Im a Brissett Bro so take that into consideration when i say this. 

That INT was on Brissett. He had a blitzing linebacker on the right side which means he should have immediately gone hot to his right. Njoku was there wide open in the spot vacated by the blitzing linebacker. He looked left because before the play he diagnosed the cb giving outside leverage and knew schwartz was going on a quick slant.

Schwartz got cut off and fell down, but Brissett was hellbent on going his direction.

This was a case of trying to go with the initial read hell or high water and not reacting to what the defense was giving him. 

I know Brissett knows it was a mistake and i know he immediatly knew where he should have gone with the ball as soon as it happened. He is a really intelligent QB and you could see his frustration with himself as soon as he hit the sideline.

Other than that play Brissett was pretty solid with reads. The game was a case of extremely vanilla playcalling with a lot of high low concepts not much else. Obviously our offense wont be called this way in the regular season (duh). But coach just wanted the players to get their feet wet.

However,

It's pretty clear that the interior defensive line is not a priority for the Browns. And if you follow the advanced metrics there is a good reason. Running the ball just doesnt translate to wins anymore.

According to Jason Lloyd:

> The stats on this are bonkers. Teams that average 8 yards per carry, **8 yards per carry** over the past however many years are like 12 and 12. Like it doesn't guarantee you anything. But if you throw it for like 12 yards per pass [completion] you are like 32 and 1. You HAVE to throw the ball to win in the NFL.

Go to 8:35 for quote.

A part of me still wants to believe that because i love old school trench football, especially in the mud and snow. But the numbers are pretty clear that running just doesnt *really* matter anymore. 

I think the Browns are holding on to the run game because they probably believe the run game will help you keep your leads and take the air out of the ball. Like... Deshaun kills the opponents, D'chunt nails the coffin shut. 

Plus just the threat of a run opens up the field so much when the opposition has to put out an extra linebacker or lineman instead of an extra DB.

To add to this, he does 1 or 2 huge leg crosses, sometime even heel clicks on his way back.

This causes him to be almost always 10 yards off the line of scrimmage on his release.

To add to THAT he throws off his back toe with his heel in the air. Which gives him barely any base to throw from.

Timing routes just cannot work when there are that many moving parts. Sure you can connect on a couple. But there will be no long term consistency whatsoever. And it for sure leads to high pick rates when you are throwing consistently a half second later than you are supposed to.

Hudson did not deserve to be called out after that game by baker in the public media. When you drop back that far it causes watt to almost take a straight line or barely curving line to the QB. Watt is EXTREMELY fast. So i dont care who you have at right tackle, you arent going to stop watt unless you make him bend.

That is an inexcusable comment to make. He both publicly called out Bill Callahan and tried to absolve himself from any blame, when clearly **He** was one of the main people not giving Hudson any help.

And worst of all, this comment is calling out his own offensive lineman in saying that hes essentially incapable of blocking one on one.

That is an extremely childish thing to do. It is frankly disgusting to call out your linemen like that. On the field you can yell at your linemen, you can get in their face about missing protections. But you never EVER call them out in public like that. 

Not even Aaron Rodgers would sink that low. In fact Rodgers buys cars for his linemen...he doesnt throw them underneith.

4661,27156,27156,ClevelandOG,"Oh, i didnt want to seem confrontational. I appeciate the discussion. But i know the frustrations of the linemen with Baker. Between drifting in the pocket, taking way too large of drops, and trying to escape when there is no reason to, they rarely ever know where he's going to be and it's a nightmare to block for someone like that.

I think that sack doesnt happen if he makes Watt run around the edge instead of going in a straight line, as well as if he had time to get 10 yards down the field and take 6 steps, he for sure had enough time to get the ball out if his fundementals were solid. 

But then again, i cant see the routes being run since the camera is zoomed in on Baker...

Even so though, if he sees that nobody is open off the snap, his first instinct should have been to immediately step up and buy time, or step up to eat the sack and not take a 10 yard loss.

If you give TJ Watt a straight line, you are going to have a bad time. I dont care if you have a prime Mike McCormack over there. Watt will get to you. At the very least give your line *something* to work with.

It's like if you're boxing and you keep your hands on your hips. You cant get mad at your gloves for not blocking punches. You have to get behind your gloves...

4662,27157,27157,ClevelandOG,"> This is totally on Hudson https://youtu.be/MCUgH_jsSqo?t=635

Im not so sure... 

Look specifically at his feet. As soon as the ball is snapped, his first step is left foot back (wrong foot). Then he puts right foot back as his next step and it causes him to awkwardly turn on top of already having a false step.

His next step is a shuffle step where i believe his left heel actually crosses his right, at the very least, it's a heel click.

The next step is yet another shuffle step for when he was about to throw.

The play starts on the 42 yard line, but because of the false steps and the large jumping shuffle, he ends up on the 32 1/2. **That is a 6-step drop, 10 yards from LoS.**

This allows Watt to just take a B-line to the QB and since he's much faster than hudson he doesnt even have to make a real move... It's just a speed rush with a quick swim. I dont know if linemen really expect a QB to be 10 yards back on a shotgun timing route. And since their back is to the QB, they can only block to where the QB *should* be, not to where he actually is.

Also, because of all his bad footwork and heel clicking, it causes his timing routes to be off. The first wrong step immediately messes up the timing with recievers and essentially it puts them a half second farther into their routes than it should. It doesnt seem like much, but it's HUGE in an NFL game. It is the difference between open and a pick/sack.

It should be snap, right foot back, left foot back, and boom, ball out as you plant your right foot 3rd step. And if it isnt there, you need to step up so you dont end up so far from the line of scrimmage and leave your linemen out to dry.

I dont know how to do timestamps (thank you for doing it with your videos) but if you watch something like a peyton manning video and look how he handles the shotgun, you will see a gigantic difference in footwork. Baker's fundementals are so so so bad that it's frustrating.

He certainly has the arm talent to be a good QB, but this is year 4 and we are still seeing habits that should have been gone by high school graduation.

He is a lawyer with major political aspirations. He rubs shoulders with prominent conservative politicians, he donates tons of money to campaigns. And he ran multiple times for poltical seats. Once for state house and most recently for mayor of houston in 2018. He will 100% run again for a major political seat when this is over.

After this case, so many more people will know the ""Buzbee"" name. Enough that his next campaign will be a breeze. He has already won regardless of the outcome of the case, and it is in his personal best interest to drag it out as long as he possibly can with the new accuser movie of the week.

More fun facts about buzbee:

He started out as a democrat, but then switched to republican when he realized he didnt get as much support and couldn't win political races in texas as easily wearing blue.

He held fundraisers for trump's campaign, but then backed off Trump when the access hollywood tapes came out and Buzbee publicly ""disavowed"" him. But when he realized trump was winning, he donated 500k to Trump's inauguration committee.

He was arrested for a DUI in 2016 but later that year, the DA mysteriously *personally* dismissed the case. Then Buzbee somehow finished his year long probation in 8 months. It was later revealed he was contributing to the DA's campaign fund.

It is vitally important that we separate the claims from the litigator here. Buzbee is a very easy target to attack because hes a grade A sleeze. But that doesnt make the cases any less valid. It is hard to refuse when you cant find a lawyer to take your case but then a ""hot shot"" billionaire lawyer comes in and promises you the moon.

4687,27195,27195,ClevelandOG,"I get your point here, but lets say the opposite happens and he *does* get injured. Then you for sure get nothing. Nothing in Baker's history says he's a red flag, and he has a really low projected injury risk. Plus, Baker is a really tough person. GMs are aware of everything about him, including that he wont back down from a bit of pain.

As for the projected 17 game season, that is exactly the rub of Mayfield. He can torch teams when the conditions are right and everything is rolling his way. But his inconsistent mechanics cause him to crumble under pressure when your mechanics should be there to save you.

For instance, lets say you play an instrument, and you learn to play a song once and can perform it in front of your best friend without a problem. If you ramp the stress up to 100 and put 20,000 people in a concert hall, it would be difficult to play perfectly. However if you practice the song over and over and over, even if you black out, your muscle memory will take over and you can play the song without even remembering playing it.

Baker is at the point where he can make amazing throws. He has the arm talent to sling it. But when he gets to points where pressure piles up, or hes against really good defenses, his mechanics break down because they are so inconsistent.

There is a reason why Baker ranked 31/32 in the league on 4th quarter QBR. And has been known as someone who cannot close out games. 

Baker could be a GREAT qb if he swallows his pride and works with a QB coach all offseason. And every offseason from now until retirement. You could see how much better he was when AVP changed just his footwork. But then he went right back to his old ways as soon as he hit adversity.

Not to say that they never deviated from that trend, but the players all knew there was at least a bit of bias between the 2.

Now, however, the appeals process is a crap shoot as Goodell has absolute final say regardless of the suspension time (unless it's zero). If the investigator recommends 4 games and you appeal it, Goodell can make it 6 years if he feels like it.

It's a really messed up system that I just 100% do not understand.

But the Browns took Jerome Ford in the draft. Hes a 5th rounder so whatever hes not going to be slotted in as a starter right away. But it means the Browns have 5 capable running backs. Even if Demetric splits time with wide reciever, that is still too many...they have to drop 1.

Which brings me to the tea leaves.

I think the Browns will package Kareem Hunt and Baker to the Lions for a high pick and the lions taking on Baker's salary. I LOVE Kareem and i would hate to see this happen, but it just makes too much sense...

D'Andre Swift was not good last year (he had a lot of all purpose yards before the injury, but he really didnt perform well) and Jamaal Williams wasnt much better. In fact, when they both went down, Craig Reynolds outperformed them both.

The Lions need a legit running back and they didnt take one in the draft (or a QB for that matter). Both are Dorsey players and we all know too well how Dorsey will gut a team to bring in ""his guys"". It is a win/win trade for both sides. Baker has the fire Detroit wants in a QB. He fits Dan Campbell's personality perfectly, and Kareem is a warrior no matter where he is.

But at the same time, it does feel a little slimy and it definitely would be better cheering for a QB who wasn’t a sexual predator. I’m not itching to go out and buy a Watson jersey that’s for sure, which says a lot because when a team acquires an elite QB, who wouldn’t want their jersey normally? 

And it sucks to see so many diehard browns fans quit on the team (and I don’t blame them) because they can’t support a sexual predator. Things feel different. 

I also passionately hate the grandstanders that think supporting the browns/Watson makes you a bad person. I don’t care if this is “whataboutism” - but the NFL is full of shitty people that have done shitty things. And there’s probably a lot more of them that we just don’t know about.

2 Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 7 Age: 23 | Last year's ranking: Honorable mention

""You go into the game with the Colts and say, 'Don't let him kill you. Make the quarterback beat you,'"" an NFC exec said. ""He's No. 1, 2 and 3 on the game plan.""

3 Nick Chubb, Cleveland Browns Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 7 Age: 26 | Last year's ranking: 5

""He was born to run the football,"" an NFC exec said.

4 Dalvin Cook, Minnesota Vikings Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 8 Age: 26 | Last year's ranking: 3

""He needs to stay on the field. The whole team is different when he's in there,"" a veteran NFL offensive coach said. ""He's great and can get even better with discipline as a runner and growing as a third-down receiver. I think he'll show a more all-around game in a new offense.""

5 Alvin Kamara, New Orleans Saints Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: 10 Age: 26 | Last year's ranking: 2

""You can put a really good safety on him, and he'll still come back to the sideline and say, 'Uh, we've got a problem,'"" a veteran AFC coach said.

6 Joe Mixon, Cincinnati Bengals Highest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 25 | Last year's ranking: 9

""He improved a lot as far as pass protection, his detail in his work,"" an AFC coordinator said. ""He's definitely a complete back. He always had the explosive component. The Bengals are better, so he's no longer an underrated player.""

7 Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers Highest ranking: 5 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 26 | Last year's ranking: 5

""Not as dynamic as some others, can't stay healthy,"" said an NFC exec of McCaffrey, who has missed 23 games the past two seasons. ""I'm guessing Carolina will give him less touches in efforts to preserve him.""

8 Najee Harris, Pittsburgh Steelers Highest ranking: 3 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 24 | Last year's ranking: Unranked (rookie)

9 Aaron Jones, Green Bay Packers Highest ranking: 6 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 27 | Last year's ranking: 8

""Versatility -- he does a lot of stuff for [the Packers],"" an NFC exec said. ""The offense is better when he is in there. He really boosts their passing game and is really good getting out on the edge or making something happen with screens.""

10 Javonte Williams, Denver Broncos Highest ranking: 2 | Lowest ranking: Out of top 10 Age: 27 | Last year's ranking: Unranked (rookie)

""You can't get him on the ground, can't tackle him,"" an NFL personnel official said. ""That kid is really good. Depends which offense you're running in that [Ekeler vs. Williams] discussion, and Ekeler is really, really good. But with Williams you just can see defenses feeling like, 'I'm tired of tackling him.' He's not as fast as Taylor but has everything else.""

Honorable mentions

Austin Ekeler, Los Angeles Chargers: Ekeler appeared on several top-10 ballots thanks to a career-high 911 rushing yards to complement his always stout passing-game presence. An AFC coach describes Ekeler as an all-purpose back who has a feel for the passing game. ""Huge asset to Justin Herbert,"" the coach says.

Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas Cowboys: Elliott's fall outside the top 10 is still a bit surprising considering he just produced his third career 1,000-yard, 10-touchdown season. But his rushing yards per game have dipped in each of his six NFL seasons, from 108.7 in 2016 to 58.9 last year. ""He's still a good player, but that burst he once had just doesn't seem to be there,"" an NFC exec said.

Saquon Barkley, New York Giants: Barkley was No. 1 on this list two years ago, but his decline has been precipitous. Injuries have cost him 22 games over four seasons, but that's hardly the only issue with his game. In 2021, he produced just 593 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 162 carries. ""I'm down on him -- he still doesn't know how to play running back enough,"" a veteran NFL offensive coach said. ""He's a bouncer. He wants every run to be a home run. He's going to have to learn that 4-yard runs in this league are good, instead of stopping, cutting it back and losing 2. And he gets his ass kicked in protection.""

If y'all haven't read Dixon's book, ""Day of the Dawg"", it's well worth it. Here's one of my favorite Hanford Dixon stories:

---

>Although I was all of 170 pounds, I looked forward to taking shots at the big boys, like Pete Johnson and later Earl Campbell. By December of my rookie year, the Browns were mired in last place, but I looked forward to taking on Campbell when we went to Houston for a nationally televised Thursday night game on December 3. 

>“Damn. You haven’t seen Earl Campbell,” my teammates told me all week. “Well, Earl Campbell hasn’t seen Hanford Dixon,” I responded with all due cockiness.

>Early in the game, Campbell came around the left side on a sweep. I fixed my eyes on him and charged forward. He looked at me and took aim, and bam! I saw stars. It was just like running into that telephone pole while playing football with my friends back in Theodore. The first thing I thought to myself was, “Oh shit. I’m hurt.” But I wasn’t about to let Campbell, or any of the Oilers for that matter, see me hurt. It’s not just a pride thing. If the opposing coaches upstairs see that you’re hurt, they’ll run a go pattern past your sagging ass on the next play. So I jumped up, maintained my composure as best I could, jogged to the sideline, and sat my ass down. After a second or two, I realized something was wrong. I was sitting on the wrong bench, on the wrong sideline. I jumped up and trotted over to our sideline, much to the amusement of the veterans. We went on to lose that game, 17-13.",9.0,browns,t3_x2hl26,False,0.0,:brownie-elf:,2022-08-31T17:49:30Z,browns,-0.0175929437289784

24092,176693,176693,deviden,"> I honestly believe Baker would still be here if he would've gone to IR after the shoulder tear/break.

I think you're right but for different reasons. 

My feeling, and it is just a feeling I admit, is that some bad shit went down in the locker room over the course of the 2021 season. The seemingly broken relationship between Kev and Baker, the OBJ saga, statements like we just saw from JJ3 implying that a significant faction among the players didnt like working with Baker, the ill advised ""we needed an adult in the room"" comment probably leaked from ownership... 

We'll never know the truth but I think that things started going off the rails when Baker went outside the team to get a 2nd opinion on whether he could play when the team doctors said he needed to sit out... that was the beginning of it. It suggests he was fighting back against the decisions of others in the building, trying to secure his spot.

As Baker's form was affected, his confidence collapsed, he probably turned the bravado up to 11, his footwork went completely to shit (after it was fixed in 2020), he's missing thows, he's not seeing open guys, and meanwhile OBJ (who was universally liked among the players) is already lowkey unhappy to begin the season and goes fucking sabotuer just to get off the team... then you get the comments from Kev & co. along the lines of ""it's Baker's choice to play"" etc... and we're still somehow in the playoff hunt... and eventually it all ends in Green Bay and Pittsburgh with some of the worst imploding QB play you'll ever see.  

Idk man, I just feel like after last season it was over for Baker in Cleveland. If it wasn't Watson it would have been Ryan or Cousins some other QB brought in as the dominos fell. I think people in the building felt that keeping a mid tier QB who's falling out with the head coach and is resented by a large group of players (who they want to keep around) wouldn't be worth the trouble.

25599,186302,186302,gettin,"Quarterback Deshaun Watson was suspended Monday for six games for violating the N.F.L.’s personal conduct policy and was not fined, concluding the league’s 15-month investigation into sexual misconduct claims made against him by more than two dozen women.

It was the first N.F.L. player disciplinary decision to be handled by an arbitration process established in the 2020 collective bargaining agreement, which sought to bolster a system that had been criticized for inconsistencies and potential conflicts of interest.

Since Roger Goodell became N.F.L. commissioner in 2006, he has taken a stricter stance on player punishment than his predecessors, levying some of the lengthiest player suspensions in the league’s history. The personal conduct policy includes provisions for penalizing players even if their transgressions did not result in criminal convictions.

But while Goodell once wielded unilateral power in disciplinary action, revisions to the policy in the last decade have shifted some of the process to third parties. Watson’s penalty was imposed by a retired federal judge who was jointly approved by the league and the players’ union. But Goodell, or someone he appoints, would still have the last word if the league appeals the decision.

Here are some of the most notable suspensions of N.F.L. players during Goodell’s tenure as commissioner:

Suspensions that lasted more than one season

Michael Vick. Vick, a former Atlanta quarterback, was indefinitely suspended in 2007 for his role in a dogfighting scandal. The suspension lasted two seasons; Vick was reinstated before the 2009 season after serving an 18-month prison sentence.

Aldon Smith. Smith, a defensive end who played for San Francisco and Oakland, was suspended in 2015 for a violation of the substance abuse policy (he had been charged with drunken driving). The suspension lasted until Smith was signed by Dallas in 2020 and reinstated.

Dominic Rhodes. Rhodes, a running back who played for several teams, was suspended indefinitely in 2011 after failing a third drug test. He was reinstated in 2014.

Jerrell Freeman. Freeman, a linebacker, was suspended twice for multiple games after positive tests for performance-enhancing drugs while with Chicago in 2016 and 2017. The N.F.L. suspended him for two years for another failed test in 2018, though he announced his retirement days before the suspension.

One season

Adam (Pacman) Jones. Jones, a cornerback then with Tennessee, was suspended for the 2007 season after multiple arrests, including for his role in a fight at a strip club that led to three people being shot.

Calvin Ridley. Ridley, an Atlanta receiver, was suspended for at least a year after he bet on N.F.L. games while away from the team during the 2021 season.

Donte’ Stallworth. After striking and killing a pedestrian in Miami Beach while driving drunk, Stallworth, then a receiver with Cleveland, was suspended for the entire 2009 season. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

Darren Waller. In 2017, Waller, then a Baltimore tight end, was suspended for at least one year for violating the substance abuse policy. He had been suspended for four games in the 2016 season for the same violation. He was reinstated in 2018.

Martavis Bryant. Bryant, a receiver, was suspended for at least one year for violating the league’s substance abuse policy in 2016. After being conditionally reinstated in April 2017, Bryant was suspended indefinitely in 2018 for violating the terms of the reinstatement.

Travis Henry. In 2008, Henry, then a Denver running back, was suspended for at least one year after he tested positive for marijuana for the third time. Before his suspension was complete, Henry was sentenced to three years in prison for financing a drug operation. The N.F.L. reinstated him in 2012.

Josh Gordon. Gordon, a receiver currently with Kansas City, has been suspended six times for violating the league’s substance abuse policy, including a suspension for the entire 2015 season. He was most recently suspended in January 2021 and reinstated in September 2021.


12 games / 12 weeks

Ray Rice. Rice was initially suspended for two games by the N.F.L. after his arrest on domestic violence charges in July 2014. Two months later, after TMZ released a more graphic video of the assault that showed Rice knocking his fiancée unconscious in a hotel elevator, Baltimore released the running back and he was suspended indefinitely by the N.F.L. Rice was reinstated on Nov. 28, after the first 12 weeks of the 2014 season, but he was never signed by a team.

Vontaze Burfict. Burfict, an Oakland linebacker, was suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season after his helmet-to-helmet hit to Indianapolis tight end Jack Doyle in a Week 4 game. Burfict’s penalty, the N.F.L.’s longest suspension ever for on-field actions, took into account his lengthy history of violations of the league’s player safety policies.


10 games

Josh Brent: For his role in the 2013 drunken driving death of a Dallas teammate, Brent, a defensive tackle, was suspended for 10 games of the 2014 season. He was also sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years of probation.

Eight games
Antonio Brown. In 2020, the league suspended Brown, a receiver who was a free agent at the time, for sending threatening texts to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, and for his role in a dispute with a moving company employee. He pleaded no contest to burglary and battery charges and received two years of probation. Brown denied the sexual misconduct claim.

Chris Henry. The league suspended Henry, a Cincinnati receiver, in 2007 after he was arrested four times between December 2005 and June 2006.

Terry (Tank) Johnson. Johnson, a defensive tackle then with Chicago, was suspended in 2007 after the police raided his home and found six unregistered firearms, a violation of his probation on an earlier gun charge.

Mychal Kendricks. Kendricks was suspended after pleading guilty to two insider trading charges in 2018.


Six games

Josh Brown. Brown, a kicker who had been suspended for one game in 2016 after admitting to the Giants that he abused his wife, was suspended for six more games in 2017 after documents released by the Washington State Police revealed he had written extensively about the abuse.

Adrian Peterson. After being indicted on child abuse charges, Peterson, then Minnesota’s star running back, was suspended for the remainder of the 2014 season, which resulted in six missed games.

Myles Garrett. The N.F.L. indefinitely suspended Garrett, a Cleveland defensive end, after he removed the helmet of Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph and hit him with it in 2019. The league reinstated Garrett two days after he met with Goodell and league representatives at the end of the season.

DeAndre Hopkins. Hopkins, an Arizona receiver, was suspended in May after violating the league’s performance-enhancing drug policy.

Ezekiel Elliott. Elliott, a star running back for Dallas, was suspended in 2017 after a league investigation into domestic violence allegations. An ex-girlfriend accused him of assaulting her five times in Columbus, Ohio, where he played at Ohio State. He was never criminally charged.

Five games
Albert Haynesworth. In 2006, Haynesworth, then a Tennessee defensive tackle, was suspended for stomping on the head of an opposing player. Goodell handed down the suspension weeks after he became commissioner.

Terrelle Pryor. Pryor, who had been handed a five-game suspension by the N.C.A.A. for accepting improper benefits while at Ohio State, entered the N.F.L. supplemental draft instead. The N.F.L. mandated that he sit out the first five games of his rookie season.


Four games

Tom Brady. Brady was suspended in 2016 for his involvement in the Deflategate scandal that emerged after Indianapolis accused New England of deflating footballs to give Brady an advantage.

Ben Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger was initially handed a six-game suspension in 2010 after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a Georgia bar. He was not criminally charged and Goodell reduced the suspension to four games after an appeal. The Pittsburgh quarterback was the first player to be suspended under the league’s personal conduct policy without having been charged with a crime.

Greg Hardy. The N.F.L. suspended Hardy, a defensive end, for 10 games in 2015 for his role in a domestic-violence case. An arbitrator reduced the penalty to four games.

Ikemefuna Enemkpali. The league suspended Enemkpali, then a Jets linebacker, for punching his own team’s quarterback Geno Smith during a locker room altercation in 2014.


Three games

Jameis Winston. Winston, a quarterback then with Tampa Bay, was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season. The penalty stemmed from an N.F.L. investigation into a BuzzFeed report that said he made an unwanted sexual advance on an Uber driver in March 2016.",43.0,nfl,t3_wg3ac6,False,0.0,:Browns: Browns :Browns: Browns,2022-08-04T09:59:50Z,browns,-0.0021972644364469

The NFL and the NFLPA agreed to appoint an impartial, independent judge.  Who also happens to be a woman.

The judge used the prior NFL suspensions as a baseline for the six game suspension.

The judge made her findings known to the NFL in June

The NFL, not happy with the ruling, sat on that ruling until this week, and then appealed it.

Watson is guilty.  The judge has shown that.  He is being suspended longer than the judge recommended, again due to prior suspension amounts, because the NFL now wants to set an example.  This is not a just way to go about this process.  It is not Watson's fault that the NFL did not have longer suspensions in the past.  

There is no reason to have an independent judge if everyone (except Watson and his camp) see that he is clearly guilty.  The  NFL could have just suspended him on their own.

Why did the NFL sit on this ruling?

Why are they choosing to make such an example out of Watson?  

Why are they not adhering to the independent judge?

Example:  One person wants to buy a friend's house. They are not using a realtor as there really is no home to search for.  They get an independent agent to do a market analysis to determine fair market value.  The house comes in at $400k where the seller thought the home would come in at $450k... and the seller blows up the deal by insisting that the price be $450k.

for the majority of this you're using hindsight. the 3 QBs you named off had major concerns going into the Draft. Allen was never consistent and was seen as a major project. Mahomes was seen as boom or bust. as for Lamar the majority of teams were wondering if he'd be willing to switch positions. in all 3 cases it took a team that was willing to be patient (allen), change their entire offensive philosophy (jackson) or an offensive genius (mahomes) to be the right spots for those QBs to thrive.

They made the evaluation on Baker and determined he wasnt good enough to win a superbowl with/deserving of a second contract.

They tried to acquire a significant upgrade at the QB position to allow them to compete for a superbowl. They did not secure one.

Even if they have to move on from baker, and we get a downgrade it doesnt matter. 10-7 season and miss the playoffs or 7-10 miss the playoffs is completely irrelevant.

They saw the AFC and said Chiefs, Chargers, Broncos, Titans, Bills, Ravens, Bengals, Raiders, Patriots, Colts, Dolphins. We can beat some of those teams with Baker but not nearly enough or not nearly consistently. 

Yes we have sucked before. Get over it. Don’t condemn yourself to mediocrity because youre afraid of regression.

The front office is doing their job. They had to break the stagnation and seek progress. The best way to do that is upgrade qb. Either you get an immediate upgrade or you invest in finding one later. And if we just ride it out and lose with a Meh Vet that’s exactly what we are doing.

*The NFL is the victim of its own terrible mistakes in previous highlycharged cases. It wound up with a judge who treated the question of Watson’s penalty as she would a case in court and refused to exercise too much latitude. That is to be expected when you hire a retired federal judge. Good judges try not to wilt or bend with popular outrage —that’s not a system, frankly, any of us would want to live in.

Including Hall of Famers like Lawrence Taylor and Jim Brown. All those dudes have female supporters still. 

Deshaun’s suspension is the result of the terrible handling of this previous matters. If they would’ve handled the violent sexual assault cases differently, Deshaun would probably be banned from the league. And that’s 100% NFL’s fault.

Let's go back in time: Is 1964 tainted now that the vast majority of people seemingly unaware of Jim Brown's past (which includes a defenestration, mind you)? How about the Lakers post Shaq, and Kobe's rape accusations? We all like to toss out the ""Local Heroes nab sex offender"" posters and yes, it is good that the lot of fans feel a healthy way about how heinous the accusations are.

But don't fool yourself that people will be discussing the result of this suspension beyond this year.

A good number of the folks here are all in on ""well let's just play some football"" as if these things aren't societal issues that are playing out as we speak.

I've said the below in my personal life several times and there is always some man that jumps up (or sometimes silently says) they have done nothing untoward in regards to women:

Regardless of what you think your actions may have been, there are very few cis, straight American men (or for that matter, men globally) who have not caused a woman to feel potentially at risk in some situation. Full stop. And the vast majority have never even realized it. Never even considered it. Yet, the same individuals feel compelled to vote for select (ALLEGED!) sex offenders, and slander other (alleged) sex offenders. How about they all stay in the bucket until things are fully resolved? How about equitable and consistent outrage *and* personal reflection?

What does that have to do with the matter at hand and am I stating I'm OK with the QB sitch... I'm absolutely not. I'm just done with the selective outrage. You could pick the personal lives of ten people in this conversation and I'll bet you uncover someone a lot more like QB1 than one might care to admit.

If anyone really feels compelled to do something about the marginalization and dehumanization of women, particularly when it comes to institutions that historically are bastions of toxic masculinity, then be that voice and keep that energy consistently and support for all instances... and DEMAND a transparent  conduct policy. You're the consumer; you have that power to make those demands.

Conveniently in this case it would solve a lot of problems for both sides, particularly the NFL armed with a defined, expanded suspension and game/pick/salary forfeiture might you know... be able to actually delve out more equitable discipline.

We're not talking about the locker room or personality; we're talking about his performance. Data and observing his play and what the outcomes per possession are. There's nothing subjective about that.

The Browns lost to the Chargers. He didn't take that game.

I'm going to assume you're referring to the Cinci game in 2020 which was not last season. Having ONE game in two seasons in which you come back and win against the last team in the division is not something you build myths on. That same season he lost to Lamar Jackson disguised as Willis Reed when he couldn't capitalize late. Once again, that was not last season.

This year, in the ONLY game Baker played Cinci the Browns won 41-16. He didn't take that game.

Nick Chubb not only scored the go ahead TD but sealed the game with with a monster run TD. Baker tossed two TD's, one a marvelous throw to DPJ but the game was in hand. One could argue Denzel Ward chipped in the winning score but Cinci tied that game. Chubb sealed it.

As I said, show me ANY game in the past season, ""literally"", ""basically"" or whatever preferred defining adverb you wish to assign that Baker Mayfield went out and took from from an opposing team based on his talent as the spearpoint.

Defining abverbs may sound convincing; as though someone has absolute certainty of facts in particular within the political arena but homie don't play that.

The proof of the pudding is in the tasting.

The closest game from the past season that \*might\* apply is the game against the Texans, as he ran for the trying score in that game and threw a go ahead TD, but Malcolm Smith ended that game in the third quarter with a pick deep in Texans territory that led to the deciding FG. He was not on fire in that game although not bad by any measure and sans the pick, the Browns may well have lost.

That's it, in a 17 game season. It was the game he was hurt in and it was the closest he game to securing a victory by will this past season, and he didn't.

But here you go, the data that matches what I saw from my seat. I actually get the feeling you don't care and would rather stir and insult versus objectively evaluate but hey. Whatever makes you feel better.

When analytical fingers started pointing at Ex QB1 the gloves came off and the ""you must be stupid if"" (I noted there are a fair number of those types of posts in your history FYI) flew.

So do you expect me to believe that even though now we (well, ""you"") have more complete information yet the caping for this guy is still going on, no I don't think those other 52 guys are getting the same kind of support that folks give this cat.

Let me help you:

Baker Mayfield can play the position of football at an NFL level. He has some very desirable traits as a passer. Unfortunately those traits do not include innate feel or fast processing of field movement. Now, it was confirmed that offseason coaching was not part of his regimen, so as hard as he worked to get where he is there was not an apparent  (sufficient) effort to correct his weaknesses until recently. The same stubbornness that fuels him is his most significant weakness. I do not think he has emotionally caught up..yet. He has to fix the on the field first.

He had four ball handlers at OU that are in the league, three of them #1 on their team at their position.

I mean, I'd expect success.

Four years in he has not make a Pro Bowl while both of his college understudies have. He's had his RB1 (which ""you"" the royal you may appreciate, but ""you"" sure as hell don't ride for him like this cat... I wonder why? Hmm..), WR1, and multiple OL make it in spite of front office turmoil, failed coaching, hell, COVID. Dude's a no go.

What was the last comeback win he had? How often do his champions run to that one game against the last team in the division in 2020/21? Give me a big moment that Baker put this team over the top? Baker, not the defense, not Nick Chubb, not Kareem... Baker.

I've SEEN the guy in person from my too hot seats in FES on seven Sundays a year for three years play well (as I said he can play the position), get lucky and outright not see the field on consecutive plays. Hell, sometimes 2/3 on the SAME play. The Browns/Bears are two teams that don't have a litany of great QBs. We won our last championship with a doctor at the controls.

But dude, you got picked #1. you HAVE to be able to a make plays that separate you from the flotsam...

Nick Chubb stirs the offensive drink and drives the bus; nobody's trying to stop Baker Mayfield. Myles Garrett stirs the defense and drives the bus on D.

32276,216691,216691,metagawd,"That's why I was asking. The public nature happened to not just Baker.

Jared Goff dealt with it. Jimmy G., Both Saints QBs, Sam Darnold multiple times, Matt Ryan, Tua T., the list is long and distinguished.

Let revisit this timeline, and to avoid going back to.. I dunno... 2019 I'll truncate to the last season:

-Both Lamar Jackson and Baker are not extended early. Now, we all know the story: No QB drafted #1 has failed to make it to the second contract in X number of years.

-Baker starts 2021 where 2020 ended, in KC, on the losing end of a winnable game. The following week he suffers a torn labrum  but we win three straight against teams that did not make the playoffs/are drafting mighty low. No one at this time was overtly concerned about his injury. About the same time Teddy Bridgewater made a ""business decision"" that he got a bit of gruff about, one that I actually argued here that Baker should have made. Stopping that interception was not going to turn the tide of that game.

-The Chargers/Browns game is the first benchmark game since the season opener to evaluate Baker versus a QB that is regarded as the next big deal. The Browns had a 15 point lead on Justin Herbert late in the 3rd quarter. We know who won that game and how he won it.

-The following week is the Cardinals. We know what happened that week as well (the fracture). Kareem who is the outlet gets hurt. From the now established timeline no fracture was reported, and there was a determination made that he would play through it. The framing for fans was that he was being permitted to play. While yes, that's true he also elected to play and not wholly just for his teammates. Sans knowing if the 5th year option is a reality, dude is actually playing for his next bag.

-The Steelers loss and OBJ wanting out. While I personally haven't been sold on  Baker's leadership or dedication and folks, stop it: He can actually play, he's just not as dedicated and is probably not as well liked as he thinks. Kinda ""Bro-esque"" to me and who *really* likes dudes like that?

OBJ was one of a handful of players to directly meet with Stefanski prior to the hire. I'm 100% convinced the struggles/complaints he had about getting the ball or offensive awareness were discussed.

MKC's comments during her appearance on Cowherd's podcast about not only the locker room but the FO and ownership liking OBJ confirm for me that what I suspected: John Dorsey's willingness to elevate him as a team leader upon arrival when he had not earned it, knowing that he has had a history of conflict and resistance to criticism set the table for today.

OBJ, convenient scapegoat took the hit locally for that. You don't bounce your QB, so it has to be the receiver. At that point, critically as an observer of the team not just a fan (anything I spend a lot of money on, I'm observing lol) it's evident where the significant locker room (and  on field) issue is. 

The teammates themselves pointed by what they said and more importantly, what they did not say and what individuals they did not defend.

-I'm skipping the lack of interview post Lions game. 

-Week 17. Pittsburgh, or as someone here called it, the Ivy League cut game. It really looked like a game in which KS called the plays that he expected his QB to make the best read on, and Baker responded with 16 for 38, 185, 2 TDs and 2 TOs. Now, then.. he proceeded to sit the following week.

-It's also been repetitively reported that his intent to hold out was determined prior to the Browns speaking with his camp at the combine but post exit interviews, which predates the Browns even scheduling the meeting with Mr. Watson. This is most likely just after the 5th year option pickup.

Now, in the Cowherd podcast, a second source states that Andrew Berry (after the owner and probably the coach) was worn out by QB1 prior to the formal end of the season and his interactions with media, leaks and such in attempting to dictate the narrative of his experience.

Now, if you're angling to hold out when you've not exhibited consistent play, you elect not to invest in your craft in the off-season to maximize your talent, have no problem in intervening in a contract dispute with your teammate (the locker room actually let him know this was not appropriate), leak, freely are combative with the media and overtly question the offensive strategy because it doesn't fit the way you think you should play, who really quit on whom, or better yet, didn't really try?",1.0,browns,t3_tkv0d9,False,0.0,:brownie-elf:,2022-03-23T15:34:02Z,browns,0.0007166603953128

 I'm getting the impression that while the locker room was not going to throw him under the bus it's understood that he is not the straw that stirs the drink, save that maybe he didn't realize it until this past season.

When your top level teammates on both sides of the ball, some of whom may or may not have been discussed in regards to this potential trade say nothing positive about you save for parroting the obvious ""very tough, leader, my guy"" bit that's actually saying a LOT.

There was a random tweet I saw from a fan in regards to the All Star Game last month in Cleveland and the Browns players seen around town as the festivities took place, but not Baker.

The narrative that this was a surprise to him cannot be true, as if there's some sort of backstabbing here. I get that there are really significant emotions due to the allegations against the dude they flew to see but someone is going to sign him and be very successful. Why not shoot your shot?

32293,216710,216710,metagawd,"Yep.

I really blew out my posts from here because I find it tough for me to deal with how emotional folks get about this team, but I remember saying that early on Baker was too empowered early on by the org (particularly the GM) and once that happened it would be tough to change not only positional things, but those leadership gaps that don't work in the NFL.

\-The Duke Johnson comments, which it was reported at the time didn't play well in the locker room because you don't mess with another player's money.

\-His response that year to how the team struggled in 2019.

\-The constant battles (rightly or wrongly) with local media in person or on social media.

\-Not putting in the work to mitigate his (perceived or actual) physical limitations.

What's wild is I actually think this guy will put it together at some point in the right circumstance, but it's not going to be in Cleveland. He is tough, stubborn... I recognize a lot of his strengths, and I can see how they also do not serve him.

The rest of the roster doesn't have the time.

Insofar as whom they have targeted with the obvious known one being Watson isn't that hard to figure out, but in my entire fandom the Cleveland Browns have never, EVER been this committed to figuring out the QB position and taking advantage of a window that exists now.

And these are just examples that weren't deleted after the fact when he scrubs his tweets. There is documented proof this guy actively gives false information.  

Either way... CLEARLY I have documented enough here to showcase that your mocking of me calling him a ""verified fraud"" is unjustified.  He is a verified fraud who is a member of the Denver media but absolutely not a reporter affiliated with anything close to a legitimate new outlet... whether that meets YOUR standard for what violates the subs rules or not is another conversation.   

From my perspective its pretty obvious this guys ""reporting"" cant be trusted and should be viewed as a random member of social media.  He's clearly not got verified sources and isn't a member of the Browns org or even geographically close to Cleveland.  If you honestly believe this guys knows ANYTHING real about the Watson situation I got some beautiful lake front property on The Great Salt Lake you might like!

33064,220896,220896,nickpapa88,"I get it — You don’t believe they have legal grounds to sue.  But you’re wrong and the NFLPA believes you’re wrong as well.

‘The argument will be that the punishment of Watson is not proportional to the punishment of those owners, especially in light of this key line from the Personal Conduct Policy: “Ownership and club or league management have traditionally been held to a higher standard and will be subject to more significant discipline when violations of the Personal Conduct Policy occur.”’

“With Commissioner Roger Goodell or his designee no longer presiding over the effort to evaluate the evidence and reach a decision, the Disciplinary Officer ( retired federal judge Sue L. Robinson) could decide to allow the union to fully explore the manner in which the league handled Snyder, Kraft, and Jones.”

“The union, for example, could get access to evidence from Wilkinson’s investigation, the league’s handling of the information, and the key question of what Wilkinson would have recommended, if the league had bothered to ask her for a recommendation. (As previously reported, she would have recommended that Snyder be forced to sell.) The union also could get access to internal communications regarding whether Kraft should be disciplined, and whether Jones and the Cowboys should be investigated.  This approach would be separate from defending Watson against any claim of wrongdoing.”


As I said… this isn’t about defending Watson it’s about the NFLPA going after the league and getting discovery access to a PR shit storm. If the league goes after Watson they will pay a heavy price because the PA will expose their lies and deceit.

“Whether and to what extent this defense will hold any real water — and will gather any real evidence — will depend on Judge Robinson, who was jointly hired by the league and the union. But if the league means what it says when it says that owners are held to a higher standard and will be subject to more significant discipline for violations of the Personal Conduct Policy, the manner in which Snyder, Kraft, and Jones were handled by the league becomes directly relevant to the manner in which Watson is handled, too.”",1.0,browns,t3_vko7d4,False,0.0,None,2022-06-25T18:06:03Z,browns,-0.049364456825359

-Solis said Watson touched her with his penis without consent which if true is in fact abusive sexual assault.  But Watson has denied this making it a he said/she said with zero supporting evidence which means criminally & civilly she won’t sway a jury without more evidence we haven’t seen. 

-Hayes said Watson unveiled his erect penis without consent and requested she massage below his belly button in a V pattern on his upper thighs — this physical contact (massage locations) appear consensual with no forcible contact made by Watson.  Her testimony seems to be clear emotional/sexual abuse but again it’s he said/she said with no supporting evidence and Watson denying her testimony. 

-Tony Buzbee (the plaintiffs attorney) is a scum bag and has taken advantage of Solis & Hayes for his own personal gain.  Those two women are now lessened by Buzbees bogus attempts to pile up countless cases hoping for a settlement pay day. 

-I don’t blame Watson for not settling. He receive a no bill in two supreme courts and will likely avoid liability in all 22 civil cases (based on the facts we
have now). 

-The NFL as was said all along will likely suspend Watson between 6-8 games to start the 2022 season base on Solis & Hayes testimony with little or no discipline for the other cases.  

-IF these cases actually go to trial in 2023 and more damning evidence comes out a second suspension could come but at this point it seems extremely unlikely these cases (at least most of them) make it to court. Buzbee can’t be in 22 places at once and running 22 cases is extremely expensive. 

-The testimony of Solis & Hayes is chilling and should be respected by all Browns fans. The reality is we will never know the truth of exactly what happened but it’s clear to me Watson has a pattern of misunderstanding boundaries and consent.  Even if he is criminally and civilly cleared of all charges I hope he puts in the work to grow and avoid preying on any potential victims in the future.
