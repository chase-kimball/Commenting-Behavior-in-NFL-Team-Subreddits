8236,68533,68533,JaMollyAdams,"This is clearly a meme/joke, but it‚Äôs to point out something I‚Äôve been seeing on this sub a lot recently. The Jets are constantly in the top 5 of available cap space ‚Äì every season. It‚Äôs because we have such little talent on the roster. I‚Äôm tired of hearing that we don‚Äôt need to spend money on a big-time free agent because they‚Äôre ‚Äútoo expensive.‚Äù 

8 of the bottom 10 teams in salary cap space were playoff teams and 8 of the top 10 teams in salary cap space missed the playoffs. The top three spenders in free agency in 2021 increased their win totals by at least 3 wins!

What‚Äôs it going to take for you guys to realize that the salary cap in the NFL is a joke? The saints have been in ‚Äúsalary cap hell‚Äù for a decade and have been a continuous playoff team throughout that time. The Rams are -20 million in cap space and are super bowl champions. Obviously, these teams are much more talented than the Jets, but they have to start somewhere. We can‚Äôt continue to say ‚Äúoh we‚Äôre not a safety away from contention‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not a linebacker away...‚Äù We need to add talent to this team now and being frugal about free agency spending is not going to get us there.

Let‚Äôs go ahead and pay Marcus Williams/Tryann Mathieu 15-16m/year if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to take. Let‚Äôs go get Carlton Davis on a big contract ‚Äì let‚Äôs (slightly) overpay these FAs because we HAVE to. Who cares if he‚Äôs asking for 2-3 million more than they‚Äôre ‚Äúworth?‚Äù We should be rooting for our teams to be as talented as possible.

We need these types of playmakers to join/stay on the Jets, so we increase our win total and increase our team morale and ultimately increase the attractiveness of joining the Jets as a free agent in the future.

Lined up 334 times in the box for Tampa last year, with 265 snaps at free safety, and 191 snaps at slot CB.

13455,96815,96815,MrTruxian,"It really all falls on Zack. If he struggles, all the talent in the world won‚Äôt make this offense productive. Assuming he has a serviceable year, keeping us in close games where we can stick to our run first philosophy, here are my takes.

1) Will Zach Wilson take a step forward? Most likely he will simply because of the greatly improved offensive roster. Does that mean he is performance will improve? I have absolutely no clue, but unless he plays worse than last year, his production should improve simply as a result of who‚Äôs he‚Äôs throwing to. 

2) Rookie RB‚Äôs are always a gamble, CEH was going in the first round his rookie year and that was way overvalued. We do know from our beat writers that the Jets see Hall as the primary bell cow over Carter so that‚Äôs a nod to him. He also fits the mold of previous Rookie RB success in terms of build, combine testing, and a wealth of experience as the primary back in college. That‚Äôs not to say Carter couldn‚Äôt continue to improve and ultimately win over the majority of touches. Shannahan type schemes usually go with the hot hand at RB so this is also subject to change week to week. I‚Äôd say Hall is worth it though.

3) Probably. If this offense works as it should, Michael Carter is at worst Nyheim Hines with huge upside in ppr as a pass catcher. If this offense struggles, and Hall is the clearly better back, then you could see him relegated to RB4 territory.

4) Corey Davis showed flashes of elite play last year but other times completely disappeared. He‚Äôs now competing with Garret Wilson and Elijah Moore for outside reps, and Conklin and Uzomah for redzone targets. Although, his combination of size, speed, and experience as a route runner makes him the primary target on shot plays off playoff action. I could see him taking a leap in year two of the jets system, even in a crowded receiving room. I wouldn‚Äôt draft him higher than you need to.

5) my guess: Elijah Moore, Corey Davis, Garrett Wilson. This will change in years to come with Garrett coming out on top but this system is notoriously difficult for young receivers to pick up. Davis also pretty much always be on the field as an outside guy which is another nod to him. 

6) Maybe. If one of those guys becomes Zack‚Äôs clear number one safety valve, there‚Äôs potential. This offense loves to use its tight ends, and both Conklin and Uzomah are talented pass catchers. If Zack has a great season I could see both these guys being productive.

13462,96824,96824,MrTruxian,"My thoughts on the AFC North Gauntlet:

Ravens: Regardless of the lack of receivers this is one of the most talented rosters in the league at key positions. Lamar is a threat to take over at any time and our young players will be seeing his combination of speed and agility for the first time ever, their incredible run game matches up well with our poor run defense, and Harbaugh is unlikely to come into a week 1 game unprepared. This is likely a loss.

However, their entire running back corp and a large part of their secondary will be shaking off injury rust, while either a rookie center or converted guard will be calling protections. There is a lot of room for poor execution and misfires, the jets rookies will just have to be able to take advantage of that, a tall order for their first game. 

Browns: Deshaun Watson won‚Äôt play but this is not a gimme. Outside of QB this Roster is arguably better than the Ravens, and people forget Brisset won games as the colts starter in a similar situation with a strong offensive line and a deep running back rotation. However I think the disfunction that‚Äôs to come with Watson‚Äôs situation will lead to a severe lack of team chemistry. If the Jets can put up 24+ points without letting the Browns control the clock this is a win. But as we know, the MLF offense can take a few weeks for rookies to get a handle of. 

Steelers: this offense is going to be bad unless KP can magically turn into Burrow and put up probowl number behind a god awful offensive line. I expect some breakout performances from some of our defensive players. With that being said, I legitimately think this defense good give us a shutout. They are deep, experienced, well coached, and have pro bowlers at almost every position and a few game breakers like Watt, Heyward, and Fitzpatrick. This is the type of game where a Coach like Tomlin can really take advantage of our young players. If the offense puts up 20+ points I expect a win, but that‚Äôs not easy.

Bengals: Zac Taylor is a fraud, Joe Burrow is a god. This offense may only be improved from last year, but It‚Äôs entirely on Burrow‚Äôs shoulders. I know we beat them last year, but I think the bengals will not take the jets for granted again. This game will be decided by the jets pass rush, JC, TH, TB will do their thing, we just need to get to Joe before they can make plays. I think having Uzomah may end up being huge for Saleh in getting some insight into the bengals play calling tendencies. I‚Äôm not big on the bengals defense so if the jets can compete in another shootout type game this winnable. 

I would not be surprised going 0-4 to start out. I think if we can beat Cleveland and get some momentum 2-2 or even 3-1 is more likely than 1-3.",10.0,nyjets,t3_vi22pz,False,0.0,:billruckert:,2022-06-22T10:57:37Z,nyjets,-0.0002506373195315

13494,96865,96865,MrTruxian,"My attempt based on what I think are scheme fits and also fit JD and Saleh's draft history of picking athletic versatile players that are well fit for the 49ers style offense and defense. 

  
4. Ikem Ekwonu  
10. Jameson Williams  
35: David Ojabo  
38: Perrion Winfrey  
69. Nik Bonitto  
111. Brandon Smith  
117. Jerome Ford  
146. Smoke Monday  
163. Bo Melton  
  
Ekwonu: KT and Hutch off the board here, I know this is polarizing but I like the pick and think this is what JD will do if the first three picks roll this way.   
  
Williams: I know the injury is a concern but apparently he has been progressing very well and I think a healthy Williams is in a different class than the other guys.   
  
Ojabo: I know it may seem silly to replace our injured weakside edge guy with another injured weakside edge guy but Ojabo being available at 35 is insane value for a would be top 15 pick. Man was productive at Michigan despite only playing football for a few years, and is arguably the most athletic lineman in this class. He just seems like a Saleh type of guy. These types of injuries are far less career defining then they were in years past, and Ojabo has really only scratched the surface. I see him as this year‚Äôs Odafe Oweh.   
  
Winfrey: We are thin at DT, Perrion Winfrey offers positional versatility and pass rush upside, again a very saleh type of guy.  
  
Bonitto: More pass rush???? Yes, this defense runs off its pass rush. Every defensive coordinator will say the defense starts in the trenches but the Saleh scheme legitimately requires more resources into a strong pass rush rotation than most. The 49ers defense has thrived by investing into pass rush year after year while relying on a well coached backfield that are good scheme fits but not necessarily high end talent. Bonitto is a smaller, highly-athletic, well polished pass rusher, who‚Äôs skilled enough to show the ability to overcome occasional strength and power issues in the run game. Also boasted an insane 30% pass rush win rate which is generally considered a good predictor of NFL success. Also offers some coverage ability. What‚Äôs not to like?  
  
Smith: Every year Penn State rolls out some linebacker with insane athletic ability which everyone undervalues for being a ‚Äúraw prospect.‚Äù This year it's Brandon Smith. Again this guy is such a Saleh type of prospect, rangy, athletic, and plays best in space. Outside of Mosley and Williams, our LB core is very shallow. I think Smith can perform the same role being asked of Sherwood and Nasirildeen while being a more natural position fit.   
  
Ford: I love Michael Carter, perhaps more than most, and that's exactly why we need to draft a solid rotational back for him. Regardless of how Wilson progresses, the offense is going to be run first, and Carter is not the type of back you give 20+ carries a game too. Ford offers a great change of pace, he‚Äôs big, powerful, productive in short yardage situations, and is progressing towards being a solid pass blocker. I think he gives you a lot of what Tevin Coleman offers, with better athletic upside. This way, Michael Carter can continue towards being the Alvin Kamara type back we know he can be, without having to bear a bell cow workload on his small frame. I also think Ford could be #1 type of guy if need be, giving us a lot of flexibility at a position that historically is extremely volatile.   
  
Monday: Big versatile athletic safeties. Saleh loves them, and at some point one of these guys is gonna stick. Smoke is a good scheme fit who can work into the defense, contribute to special teams day 1, and I think has potential to be a legitimate starter. Also, best name in the draft.  
  
Melton: Pencil this guy in, he checks every JD box; 9.25 RAS score, local guy, multiyear team captain, played under the jets coaching staff at the senior bowl,  has already visited the jets, was a great returner in college as an all purpose yards king who was productive in gadget plays with great YAC ability. He just seems like everything the jets are looking for in a late round prospect. I think he actually compares very well to Braxton Berrios with a much better athletic upside.   
  
I do not care that I didn't draft size in this WR class. We signed two athletic TE‚Äôs for that as well as Corey Davis. This offense needs receivers who can make plays in space after the catch, and who have the precise route running ability to get in sink with the timing of play action, motions, and screens.   
  
What do you guys think? I feel like I addressed the offense and defense well with the exception of leaving some holes in our defensive backfield, although I think a strong pass rush will greatly reduce the amount of blown plays we saw in coverage last year. I also considered drafting one of the many athletic mid-round guards/centers to replace McGovern but ended up going elsewhere with my picks.",4.0,nyjets,t3_u69hk7,False,0.0,:billruckert:,2022-04-22T17:37:26Z,nyjets,0.0003702405841094

14340,99954,99954,NannigarCire,"I'm surprised Tyreek went for such an *affordable* price. Wide receiver in their prime moving for a first, second and a few day three picks is surprising. Davante Adams is 30 years old, so I understand his price. Tyreek's 28, he still has 2-4 years of high quality play remaining. I'm not upset about the Jets missing out on him, I prefer not having to overlook the things he's done, but undeniably he's a very good player. 

In context of that, not being able to win the Amari Cooper sweepstakes is even more upsetting personally, since that would've only cost a day 3 pick and for a much cheaper high quality receiver, who is still half a year younger than Tyreek Hill and without the baggage. Hill is more schematically valuable and has a far higher ceiling than Cooper, but Cooper still would've had a significant enough impact for this team to be worth the cost.

But I'm trying to understand how once-a-decade these events sort of are. COVID crushed the trend for cap, while the economics outside the NFL has not seen that same crush at all for prices. The cap should've been around 218m for this year if the NFL's normal trend continued, instead it's squeezed down slightly to 208m, after a year where it was further squeezed down to 182m. I sort of wonder if this is part of the reason so many players are being traded.

Anyway, I think at this point the Jets are probably locking into Garrett Wilson if the players they were engaged in talks for (Cooper, Hill) give any indication. I also think it would be a good idea to bring in and sign John Ross while they wait for the draft, since he'll offer another speedster. Especially since his role will make him a wanted commodity for whatever team misses out on a rookie speedster (maybe net a day 3 pick for 2023/2024 if he's pushed out of the top 4 WRs in training camp), and the Jets have more than enough holes in the WR room to fill out.",1.0,nyjets,t3_tkrc1c,False,0.0,:TeamWilson:,2022-03-23T15:37:37Z,nyjets,0.000550477174081

With restructuring, Fant's currently at 9.6. Convert some of it to signing bonus, gauranteed payout into next year, you can probably clear like 4m-5m for this year.

14447,100072,100072,NannigarCire,"there are maybe like 5-8 players at any position in the NFL that are actually genuinely ""good"". As in, they are season to season realiable and high quality. They rarely ever hit market too regardless of their position. You might see 2-4 of these guys in FA aseason, and usually it's because they're just past the age line so no ones sure how much they have left. The point is, if youre trying to figure out which players you should buy on FA based on whether they're ""Good"" or not, you're doing it wrong imo. The only thing you need to figure out is if they schematically or strategically make sense. It doesn't matter if you think Laken Tomlinson is good or not. Tomlinson has experience playing in a similar offensive scheme and has performed decently in it. From there you can imagine what is the cost of a viable starter at that position and if Laken is worth it. You can do this for any player, at any position.

I think if i had to say how many ""Good"" players i see in FA right now, i'd go with about 3, all of which are only on market due to age. Bobby Wagner, Chandler Jones, and Stephon Gilmore.

I'm saying this because i notice a lot of conversation comes around who is ""good"" and who isn't. It doesn't really matter who is good. Teams aren't evaluating players to pick up based on if they're ""good"" or not, because there's very few players where the ""good"" moniker applies. You have to consider what picking up that player does for the position group, for the draft strategy, for the team strategy, for on-field strategy, for everything. That's probably going to be a lot more interesting of a conversation than ""they're are/aren't good"". Any of the aforementioned three players would be awesome pickups, just because on the chance they are still good, they are going to have wide impacts across all of those strategic team-building and on-field elements. 

Just imagine Bobby Wagner is still good and the Jets pick him up. Do you **need** to draft a LB? no. Can you rely less on your safety in the box? yes. can you have wagner man up with some RBs/TEs to provide better coverage? yes. do you need to worry about whether he can make a transition to the NFL and also play at a high quality like you do with a college player? no.

Tangentially but related, I notice people seem to argue on players based on whether they are good or not. But that doesn't really matter, especially since no one really knows who IS and ISNT good exactly. Chark is a deep threat who can play split end and allow Moore and Davis to move around into the slot, without weakening the outside receiver. His schematic role is very valuable and offers versatility to the remaining players on offense. Him and Moore will both push safeties back, offering a bit more room to the underneath passing game and running backs. And as a deep threat he plays well to Zach Wislon's supposed biggest strength.

Watson (tho we may hate him now) was easily a top 5 QB in the league and the Texans still sucked. There are so so so many examples of this in recent memory.

QB is the most important position in football, but the other 21 combined outweigh it pretty heavily.

I‚Äôm staying away from Breece. Many people are projecting this crazy workload on him, but as fans we also know that Carter is also pretty damn good and should still be getting work. This offense likely won‚Äôt be good enough to turn Breece into a top 15 RB if he‚Äôs splitting touches, even if he gets like 60% of the work. I‚Äôm staying away.

My expectations for Moore are lower after the G Wilson pick, but so is everyone else‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt hate him at WR29, and as a homer it‚Äôs a fun pick. However, I‚Äôm much more inclined to take Rashod Bateman in that range or hell even Olave later. Talent + opportunity. He‚Äôs talented, but as much as I love Moore this WR room has lowkey gotten too crowded to make me comfortable in a very high target share for him every game.

At TE I‚Äôd have taken Uzomah or Conklin late if they were here alone, but with both of them here together that‚Äôs a real tough sell. Overall I don‚Äôt like anyone on this team for fantasy this year.

16297,107143,107143,OrangElm,"Lmao I watched every minute of the Jets last season and then went back to watch even more of Wilson constantly. Believe me I know how he looked.

You can check my other comments to see I clearly recognize that Zach was trying to take steps to improve that we‚Äôre not reflected in the stats. But he was never even remotely ‚Äúgood.‚Äù Even in his best games (titans) he was missing EASY throws and taking unnecessary risks. Even when he returned and played ‚Äúbetter‚Äù he turned into a worse version of Mac Jones and essentially only checked down, but STILL was making bad throws on screens and interceptable passes. Compare this to how I felt after darnold‚Äôs rookie year return and it‚Äôs night and day. 

I couldn‚Äôt care less about his stats, but for the large part they accurately reflect how terrible his season was. Bad line and weapons doesn‚Äôt make you forget how to throw a checkdown, or an accurate screen. Let‚Äôs take off the Jets glasses here. The amount of easy throws Zach whiffed on was insane. And compare him to Mike White/Flacco, we see how so many of the sacks were caused by Wilson himself and his happy feet leaving the pocket instead of stepping up. 

Look at Davis Mills last year and what he was able to do with that lineup. And who was Mac Jones throwing to? I‚Äôm sick of the excuses here. I‚Äôm not saying Zach didn‚Äôt need more help last season, but so many of the issues with him were beyond just a poor line and injured WRs. Zach played worse than bad. He was terrible. Literally one of the worst rookie QB seasons. I don‚Äôt understand how he played so poorly after his college performance.

Now none of this is to say I don‚Äôt think he can take a step this year. He can. But he also needs to. I think it is very likely Zach shows progress (it would be hard not to), but if he doesn‚Äôt then his days are numbered.",6.0,nyjets,t3_v1h9xg,False,0.0,:WSB:,2022-05-31T10:14:46Z,nyjets,0.007734831063869

‚ÄúEarlier this week, we reported that Joe Douglas was all in on Deebo Samuel and ready to use the 10th pick of the draft to acquire the talented skill player from San Francisco. A league executive confirmed this to me on Sunday and also said if Douglas could pry DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks with the 10th pick, he would make that move.

On Tuesday evening (April 26), during the PFN Draft Insiders show with PFN Analyst Trey Wingo, I stated that after speaking with a league executive, I was told, ‚ÄúDeebo Samuel will be a Jet, and the tenth pick will belong to the 49ers‚Äù. Whether it actually gets done remains to be seen, but this is a situation worth keeping a very close eye on through the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft.

And now that I‚Äôve got your attention, I suggest all Jets fans sit down as they read the final piece of this story.

I am told Jets owner Woody Johnson will be very involved in this year‚Äôs draft. To what extent will Johnson be involved? I did not get specifics, but is any involvement in the draft from Woody Johnson good involvement?

Now, for those who may want to burn down my home, let me tell you this ‚Äî the source on Johnson‚Äôs involvement in this year‚Äôs draft is the same person who informed me just days before the 2019 NFL Draft that former Jets GM Mike Maccagnan would be fired soon afterward and told me two weeks in advance of last year‚Äôs draft that the 49ers‚Äô pick at the quarterback position would be Trey Lance over Mac Jones.‚Äù",8.0,nyjets,t3_ucri5t,False,0.0,:WSB:,2022-04-26T20:12:36Z,nyjets,-0.0494154283154084

Jaylen Waddle was drafted #6 overall and his contract was a tax free 27M. However, if he was instead drafted one position higher, he would have made Jamarr chase money, which was 30.8M.

Then this also came this strange comment:

Like holy shit he is going to be come a millionaire regardless, and if he is as good as he claims hes going to be, all the endorsements and fat contract down the line is going to eventually wipe out any extra ""tax"" he might have to pay. This is what you are focused on?
