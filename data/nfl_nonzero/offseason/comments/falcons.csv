835,9018,9018,AlconTheFalcon,"First off, I wasn't the person you initially responded to.

Second, I do think we'll be better on defense, and probably run the ball better than we did last year, so I am mentally prepared to win some games and have a decent season and not be in a position to pick in the top couple of picks.

That's why I'm happy we got good value on Ridder and a low pressure situation to let him grow in, we got our stud receiver to go with Pitts, we got potential solutions to the void at EDGE, and we got a replacement for Deion Jones.

If we have an abysmal season and get into the top couple of picks, great, take a quarterback if they wind up looking as good as people think they will, trade down for a king's ransom for someone that loves them, trade Ridder to someone who wants him and go with the rookie, or keep Ridder as competition/backup to the rookie.

We've got a shit ton of cap space in 2023 to secure Lindstrom and Terrell and anyone else who shines this year, we've got money to pay Ridley the $11m left on his contract or we can trade him to someone if his mental well-being doesn't want to be in Atlanta. We can sign a couple of top free agents.

At the same time, this team is most likely not better than last year's team overall, and last year we were on the winning side of the close game coin flips, so we could wind up with a very high pick, which I think would benefit our plans for a quick and efficient rebuild.

You expect to suck for a couple years probably get the first pick in the draft your first year in. 2 to 3 years after drafting and playing around in FA with a huge salary cap available to you ought to make for a good team.

You have to pick up a veteran QB early and stopgap them into your franchise QB. This is where I wanna go draft and get a QB on that rookie contract. Don't want to overpay here just for a big name to come in and eat up your cap space as that is gonna be all this new team would have to influence players to join. 
I don't think your RB is gonna matter they burnout quickly you can easily draft a good one without expending much capital that still has his health. 
WR room you need at least 1 veteran in this group and I'm trying to spend big on at least 1 up and coming receiver coming off their rookie deal in FA. 
I want a veteran TE that I'm spending a bit on it so my QB has a chuck down option in case of emergency.

We just have to sure up our lines on both sides with the freed up cap space. Hell maybe we get lucky and Ridley comes back after this suspension and would have to ride out that last season with us in order to prove he has any value or maybe he gambles on free agency instead of proving after at least 2 years being out of the game he has anything to bring to a team.

We would be out of salary cap hell before rookie contract is up and gives you 2 to 3 years with Willis or another project QB behind Ryan if need be. I'm sure Ryan will be all for passing on the torch and training his replacement as he seems to have a lot of love for the Falcons organization. Saved salary cap can help sure up veteran on edge maybe and draft 2 receivers in the second. Possible the coaches believe keeping our O-line together and syncing another year may be our best bet.

13600,129067,129067,Wayne93,"I myself think Terry is what everyone values DJM to be just never has had a QB. HE has done a great deal with little to no help, we didn't even get to see what Fitzmagic could do (be it good or bad).

Ridley is a shell, as he was never able to be an alpha. He makes business decisions that are bone headed consistently. It is not a slight on his talent but his intelligence overall. He was 20 leaving HS. He will be 28 post suspension. The talent is there, the head is not.

Frankly, Ridley is a headache at this point and last year pre mental Ridley was poor. He had 52 targets 31 Rec for 281 and 2 TDs in 5 games. He had an aDOT of 9.9. Kupp was 8.6, Adams was 9.6, so how was his yards so low? He had a 5.8 drop rate, and 3 drops in 5 games if we put that conservatively over 17 games, he drops it 10 times and is 2nd in the league in drops. He ranked 12th in separation (his doing) and 10th in cushion (given by defender) and still did what? He is more a name from how he played last year when our line was better and playing alongside Julio.

Brandon Marshall being a headache went from DEN to Miami coming off 101-1120-10 missing a game. At age 25 for 2 2nds, Then 2 years later at age 27 (younger than Ridley with capabilities of playing) traded for a 3rd coming off 81-1214-6. Later traded for a 5th at age 30 coming off 61-721-8, or 279-3524-31 in 3 years. He rebounded with the Jets for 109-1502-14.

Ridley moving in general likely would have any trade vetoed before his suspension is done. On his career has only exceeded 1000 yards once. with not even being on pace to do it last year. His career is 248-3342-28 over 4 seasons or 49 games. SOOOOO is Ridley even worth a 3rd even without suspension being a mental health case and regressing without someone capable to take the heat off him? Terry is 222-3090-17 so far on his 3 year career in 44 games, so is he bonafide going to produce? same time he came out old turns 27 during next season. If younger maybe he's worth more than my hypothetical 3rd, that is speculative at best all depends who wants to pay him next year on 20+M, we trade a 3rd, extend we can pay him have a #1 maybe Ridley comes back sane and maybe we have a core after this years draft after trading a 3rd away to with #8 2 2nds in 43 and 58 plus 2 3rds. We can definitely address needs and if trade the 3rd less pressure to take a WR in those first 3 picks which we likely need to do otherwise we may be going into a season with one of the worst WR rooms I think I have ever seen in my almost 20 years of being an NFL fan.

DK is 24 has actually done more. 216-3170-29

Diggs at age 26 was traded for #22 after 365-4623-30  coming off a 63-1130-6 season

Robert woods was just traded for a 6th at age 30. Cooper was traded for a 5th he’s also 27. That’s cap related. WSH has 26M in cap next year before extending. They also traded their 3rd for Wentz. Is this saying to happens? No but it is saying situations change. If someone wants to give a 2nd sure! At the same time McClaurin came in as an older rookie and I doubt someone wants to trade a 1st unless they get desperate for a WR because he’s probably going to get a 20-24M contract based on the current trend.

Watson seriously benefited from horrible defensive play in Houston, which forced the offense to rely on passing to “keep up” with other teams and padded his passing stats (similar to Matt Ryan and Matt stafford’s situation for years). 

Lastly, the Browns offense relies on Chubb and hunt and I don’t expect stefanski to completely ditch his offensive scheme.

Julio did take a parting shot at Matt when traded, however I get the feeling their relationship soured over the years. My thoughts on this is based heavily on Ryan's Pat McAfee interview where he was asked about teaming with Julio again. Ryan was classy, but his facial expressions gave away he did not want that.

He's already getting praise from players on the Colts for both his leadership and his accuracy throwing the football.

I personally feel like part of the reason you didn't really hear much about Ryan is because the national media seems to only really cover the Falcons if they are in a high profile game (NFCCG, Super Bowl) or have done something to embarrass themselves.",8.0,nfl,t3_vooh51,False,0.0,:Falcons: Falcons,2022-07-01T08:31:33Z,falcons,0.0886333573341369

Whenever I point to the Julio Jones trade, I always get the same response: ""He's not even on a team right now."" Rewind the clock 1 year. It's 2 weeks before the 2021 NFL Draft. If I told you that all of the following happened, you'd say the Falcons got robbed.

* Julio Jones traded for a 2nd round pick.
* Matt Ryan traded for a 3rd round pick.
* Drafted a TE at #4 overall with both Justin Fields, Mac Jones, Penei Sewell, & Micah Parsons still on the board.
* Attempted to court a QB with sexual abuse allegations, thus burning the relationship with the current franchise QB, and then failing to close out that trade.
* Saw projected starting LG Josh Andrews go down with an injury, and instead of trying to acquire a vet to fill the hole, was convinced to let 3rd round rookie Jalen Mayfield start in the spot, where he was rated as the worst OG in the NFL.
* After losing starting WR1 to gambling suspension (can't blame him there), he let the next best WR on the team leave in free agency, and instead signed a 29 year old journeyman WR and a WR that looked promising in 2019, but in the last 2 seasons has played 16 games and caught just 17 balls.
* After trading away Matt Ryan, he went out and signed a QB that worked with the current HC for 1 season and was benched that year. Mariota got to watch the team go 7-3 while he rode the pine (they were 2-4 with him).

Right now, I have a very low opinion of Terry Fontenot as a GM.

14532,149092,149092,d1dOnly,"Looking at Corral and the other QBs in this draft, I still hold steady that I would not take any of them prior to the end of the first round.

* Willis - Makes some questionable decisions, has a tendency to miss open receivers, and the competition level frighten me off. Needs to go to team where he can sit and learn for a year or two, otherwise you're just throwing him to the wolves and he'll never progress.
* Pickett - Feels a bit like a 1 year wonder to me. Something about his throwing style just feels off to me. I think he's the most pro ready in this class, but the team that takes him needs to have a good OL already in place or he's going to be hearing footsteps by the end of year 2.
* Ridder - Honestly, my favorite QB in this class. However, that doesn't mean I would take him early on. I feel like the football IQ is there, but that throwing motion is concerning. I feel like there's a chance at the NFL level that DBs could start hawking on him with how long his windup is. Honestly, if I'm drafting Ridder, I'm going to consider sitting him for a year and working with a specialist to see if his throwing motion and time to release can be improved.
* Corral - He looks like a strong breeze would blow him over, and at the NFL level he'll need to show he can take getting hit. Add to that a problem with throwing easy picks and I'm skeptical of his future prospects.
* Howell - This time last season, Howell was viewed as an near lock for first QB off the board, and probably was going to go in the top 3. Now, there's a possibility he's the 5th or 6th QB off the board and most don't see him as more than a long time NFL backup. Short and stocky, a slow release, and a problem with overthrows, Howell will likely take 2 seasons to make it to starter level, unless a team has no other options. I think the 2020 Howell is still in there somewhere, but he'll need a coach that can really help draw it out.

For my team in particular, I want them to go DL-DL-WR with their first 3 picks, and then see what is available.

Players: as far as young talent goes, Anderson is one I'm looking forward to. It'll take time but he's one of the most athletic linebackers ever and given he played QB at college I hope he can be like Kuechly. Ebiketie is expected to be a pro-ready pass rusher. Grant and Hawkins seem to be a nice young safety duo with potential. My personal dark horses are Ogundeji and Alford.

FTS: for the most part it's just petty rivalry, especially since we've both been historically bad.
