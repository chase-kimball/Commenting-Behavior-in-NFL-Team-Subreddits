Also no, there‚Äôs no point in trading him now when you can (A) Have him as your top backup LT for depth when there‚Äôs been countless years of injuries at the OL which is why he played last year in the first place.

1. Riding high on The Dark Knight trilogy while Marvel kickstarts the MCU.

2. Release The Green Lantern in hopes of starting its own universe. Movie flops.

3. Start it over AGAIN, this time with Man of Steel and Zack Snyder running the show.

4. Rush the DCEU to get to Justice League, with some moderate success (mainly Wonder Woman).

5. Justice League doesn't perform well. Somehow, Aquaman does very well and Shazam is moderately successful. 

6. This all puts DC in an odd spot. Its DCEU is doing OK but its biggest tentpole, Justice League, did not. 

7. The recent movies with the non-Batman and Superman characters, get sequels, but who knows who is cast as Batman and Superman at this point.

8. This whole time, we get TWO unrelated Batman continuities in Joker and The Batman, both doing very well. That's not even mentioning the tons of TV shows such as the Arrowverse and Gotham.

9. So, while these outside-the-DCEU projects are made, other ""kinda"" DCEU projects are made with The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker. 

10. Fans petition to get The Justice League: Snyder-cut released which also gets positive attention.

11. Newer films are made such as Flashpoint and Batgirl that ARE in the DCEU, but are trying a multiverse thing with Michael Keaton as Batman. Then, Batgirl gets canned by the WB-Discovery merger. The Flash movie still seems to be on to release despite Ezra Miller's many shenanigans.

12. Now, Ben Affleck is rumored to be in Aquaman 2, even though originally, it was going to be Keaton.

He is not only reverting back to pre-COVID policies, but he's removing THAT as well. People at my wife's office used to telework 3 days a week prior to COVID. Now, state employees can do 1-2 days remote and that has to be approved by a Cabinet member, higher on the food chain than the original head of the individual departments and teams.

My wife was supposed to telework permanently and her team has been amazingly productive with it in place. We live an hour away from the capitol; others on her team do as well. We knew the risk when we moved, and when the administration changed, that something like this could happen.

Few months ago, with this admin, she signed a year-long agreement to telework for a full year so we assumed we had at least that amount of time. This governor is basically ripping that up and reverting old pre-COVID telework policies for state employees to ""get back to work"" (the email is the most condescending bullshit thing I've ever seen). 

Our plan is for her to either find a medical exemption or take maternity leave early and look for a new job in the meantime as when this policy is in place, she'll be 8 months pregnant. We imagine a lot of other state employees will look for jobs elsewhere too.

Government jobs are not the best with pay, but having telework policies was a big advantage over the private sector. This will cause a lot of turnover.

15971,140425,140425,PleasantParfait48,"All this Matt Araiza stuff has me super triggered (TW, mention of SA) because I was raped, by a football player at a frat house my freshman year of college. It happened at Wabash College (if you're from Indiana or nearby you might know that school) in the cold dorm at the Beta Theta Pi house.

The guy who raped me was my ""date"" that evening. We were wasted. I was having a great time with him. I wanted to make out. I got in bed with him so that we could keep kissing. I figured he'd feel me up. He started to undress me and I tried to get out of bed. He pinned me down. I told him ""no"" many times. He kept pushing. Finally, he forced himself inside me and the act lasted about 5 minutes.

That 5 minutes literally scarred me my entire adult life. I've suffered from panic attacks, flashbacks and anxiety. I've worked for the past 15 years to untangle myself from the trauma he inflicted on me.

Ultimately, through therapy, I moved to forgive the person who assaulted me. Not because he deserved it, but because I did.

It takes a lot of cognitive dissonance for me to enjoy football. As much as I love the game, I feel like the prevailing culture is inherently mysogynistic. Which is ironic considering nearly 50% of NFL fans are women. 

I can't explain how hard it is to love this game but then come online (not just reddit but all sports media, twitter, etc) and have a bevvy of people blaming the women who were assaulted and excusing the behavior of the players that committed assault...

We don't have a Bosa or a Watt. 7.5 sacks from Sweat was decent, and I know all the metrics about pressures blah blah, but ultimately you need to hit the QB and get him on the ground to have a defense that can stop NFL offenses.

Sweat is good, but he's like Clyde Simmons good. Without a Reggie White on the other side, he's going to put up mediocre sack numbers.

T.J. Edwards has been disruptive. He nearly had a diving pick on a Hurts near the right sideline.


3) Haason Reddick made his presence felt, reading a toss to Miles Sanders and blowing the play up in the backfield. Fellow linebacker Patrick Johnson ""sacked"" Hurts later in the session.


4) A good day for WR/return hopeful Britain Covey, the 25-year old rookie out of Utah. He made an impressive catch during 1-on-1s, extending his arms to snare a pass with Josiah Scott in coverage. Also scored on a slant during red zone team drills on a pass from Sinnett.


5) Receivers are at a big advantage during 1-on-1 drills. Credit Avonte Maddox for blanketing Quez Watkins all the way down the field before elevating for a near pick.

I've watched all the other shows they've done on each other team and it has been cool getting such an in depth look at teams I don't like the Birds, despite being an NFL fan broadly.

As for their predictions, I love seeing that it isn't JUST homer goggles that have me feeling good about this team. The take on Gannon and the defense was a fair critique and I think that improved as the season went along. The added personnel changes SHOULD help him be more aggressive, but it'll be a definite sign of no go for me if they aren't, even with the coverage/scheme improvements that White, Dean, Bradberry, Reddick, and Davis bring",6.0,eagles,t3_w3yhoq,False,0.0,GO BIRDS,2022-07-21T07:39:59Z,eagles,0.0877158836879191

37192,328024,328024,rsmseries,"tl;dr:  I think Howie‚Äôs problem is scouting/the draft, not the cap.

I have criticisms of Howie but IMO but the cap is one of them. The Wentz contract was only bad because he was god awful, if he was average to above average (like we all projected him to be) it would have been a fine contract. I feel like there‚Äôs a bit of revisionist history with Carson, everyone in the organization/fans knew Carson was the franchise QB, and paying him before Goff and Dak (I wanna say Matt Ryan had a deal coming up) was the best way to get him cheaper.  Howie getting out of that deal and getting a huge return (like getting out of Bradford previously) is the magic here.

As far as other contracts, I can‚Äôt really think of any bad ones other than Alshon‚Äôs last contract with us.  There really wasn‚Äôt a reason for that one other than wanting to keep that 2017 team together, which he admitted was wrong. I‚Äôm sure there have been some other ones you can remind me of (don‚Äôt read that as snarky I genuinely want to know).

I think the thing that has been holding this team back isn‚Äôt the cap/money, it‚Äôs been scouting/the draft. I think that‚Äôs something most Eagles fans can agree on.  They do it when they boo Reagor or JJAW, Marcus Smith etc.  It seems like we haven‚Äôt hit on a lot of our premium picks and that‚Äôs where a lot of the good teams get value.  Luckily Smith is looking great, and Howie does seem to do a good job with some of the later round picks (Mailata, getting value out of Jalen Mills, etc).

https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/md9av6/deshaun_watson_allegations_a_detailed/

The TLDR summary is [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/md9av6/deshaun_watson_allegations_a_detailed/gs811ih/) Anyone saying ""he didn't do anything"" after reading through those, and seeing the clear pattern that emerges of a series of unconnected women all reporting a similar pattern of behavior...well, I doubt there's anything that could convince those folks, really.

I think the issue was that most (all?) of these incidents happened when it was just the woman and Watson alone, without witnesses to corroborate their accounts. Very hard to meet the criminal level of beyond a reasonable doubt with only that evidence to go on, even if there's a lot of such evidence...and yes, I know grand juries' level to pass it on for jury trial is just reasonable likelihood, but having served on one, to be honest that basically translated into whether there was a reasonable chance for the prosecutor to win their case before a jury, or were wasting the trial jury's time by moving it forward. 

Unfortunately, a number of fans with only a passing knowledge of the case will take today's outcome as a declaration of innocence and that there's nothing off about about the guy, when there's anything but. After reading through that thread, I think any team taking this guy on is getting a ticking time bomb where there's an escalating pattern of behavior & its only a matter of time before he does something that is criminally actionable and gets him kicked out of the league.

Bud Carson took Buddy's players and used them in a much more fundamentally sound defensive scheme, which is part of why the '91 defense was one of the best D's of all time.

In my opinion, I can see why some pass catchers may not view the Eagles as a prime spot. I can see why people want to move on from Jalen Hurts. BUT, it is too late for that -- the quarterbacks in the draft are not it, there are no viable free agents worth taking, and our roster is still deplete. Riding out Hurts for another year praying for a miracle to happen on his throwing while simultaneously building up the roster is the best move. Basically -- two outcomes happen at the end of next season. Either Jalen Hurts shows vast improvement and we don't have to worry about the position, or he doesn't and we move on. Regardless, in both scenarios, we end up filling huge holes and implementing key players to make us a 'Win Now' team, which we currently are not.

While I may not call myself a ""Hurts bot"", I am going to root for him this season as we all should.
