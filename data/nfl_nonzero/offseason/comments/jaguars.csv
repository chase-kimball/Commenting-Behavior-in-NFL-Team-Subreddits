If he's smelly due to prolonged poor hygiene (not showering daily or every other day, not washing bed sheets, towels, not brushing teeth), it's harder to fix and you might have to start fresh with new clothes/sheets and throwing away old ones.

I had a roommate who had awful hygiene. You could smell his room even with his door closed. I could smell him in my own closed bedroom when he would pass by in the hallway. Unfortunately, the smell permeated into all his clothes, all his sheets, and his spot on the couch he sat on. His negligence allowed the smell to grow stronger and more powerful that even when he did shower or wash his clothes, it had 0 effect. 

I let him borrow a bath towel for a single use one time. He returned it after giving it a wash and it still smelled. I washed it again, still bad. Washed it one more time out of hope. Nope, still bad, so I threw it away.

I think it's all circumstantial. Everyone on Detroit hated Matt Patricia.

ETN (if healthy/effective) has the skills of Darren Sproles, who was in Philly with Doug. He will have a specialist role, I think, and not carry the brunt of the load in the running game. His injury may require baby steps on the field.

I'm not holding my breath for Robinson this year, but I'm not writing him off totally. Akers came back quick, and while yes he was on the field, he wasn't near the player he was. I expect the same for JRob. Maybe he surprises everyone, but I'd not go forward just assuming he will be good to go. That's not to say both can't fully regain their form, I think they can.

If anyone moves to OG, it's Taylor.

32380,218224,218224,fonebone819,"Hi all - wanted to tell a story and share some pics of my visit to TIAA Bank last month.  First, I am fan since the beginning, living in the Northeast.  It's been a bucket list item to see a game (not yet), and see a concert at Daily's Place (checking this off in May...).  

My girl friend lives just outside of Jax, and is well aware of my obsession with the team.  The first time I visited, she took me over.  Going over the Hart (?) Bridge was cool, as I had seen it online a bunch of times.  We parked, took a few photos with the jaguar, then decided to walk around the stadium.  It was all fenced off of course, but I was just happy to be there.  As we get around the back, the fence opens up, and I see a loading dock overhead door open...  I get closer and can see down the tunnel to the field...  so I look at my gf and say, let's go in.  We start in, and see a SB XXXIX painting, ""Stand United"" on a wall, the visitors locker room door, etc.  

As we get out to the field, it's all dirt, but what do I care, I'm on the field!!  I have to say, it looks smaller than I expected, but, whatever.  I take pics of the Pride of the Jaguars, pools, video boards, etc...  I take it all in.

After 10-15 minutes, we decide to head back out. As we are walking up the ramp, we hear a noise, look up, and the door is closing! We both look at each other, like ""oh f---"".  I grab her hand and start running for the door.  I had forgotten she was wearing flip flops, so I had to slow down a bit.  We were both laughing the whole time, but I kept thinking the scene in movies where someone is running to get out and has to slide under a closing door... 🤣.  

We make it out with no real issue, and as we stop to catch our breath, we look back and the door starts going back up... 🤔  We figure it was someone's way to tell us our time was up...

PS - was hoping to post a few more pics, but can only post more 1 at a time.  If you care to see more, I can do another post",22.0,jaguars,t3_umy8ic,False,0.0,:JAX:,2022-05-10T20:32:55Z,jaguars,0.0204979606911041

He got roasted for so many plays where he's basically cleaning up someone else's mess, or getting targeted on pick plays, or being literally the only guy in the middle of the field on blitz calls that don't get home and not being able to cover a thousand square yards by himself, or just being the last line of defense because our safeties are on the wrong side of the field.

I often wonder what Myles could have been if we didn't change his position every year.  He started out playing one of Gus Bradley's fake positions, moved to early-down SAM/third-down MIKE, then moved to full-time MIKE, then moved to WILL, then moved to ILB in a 3-4.  It's hard to demand consistency from someone when there's no consistency around him.  Hopefully he finds it on his next team.

In the NFL? Because NFL coaches have talked about this several times before because this scenario always comes up. They talk about how it's not easily doable-- especially in a single offseason. Can they do it with lots of practice and repetition? Ya, sure. It's not common for a reason.

I totally agree with your last point about Little though. Don't move an already good OT inside to guard just because you have a hole at guard. It's better to have good depth/competition at tackle.
