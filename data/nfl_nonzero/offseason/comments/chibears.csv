4376,12380,12380,Antitypical,"My argument is that he might have it or might not, and that history suggests he's more likely to have it if we surround him with talent, because support and success are linked. If that's the most arrogant argument you've ever seen here, I think you probably either missed the point or don't understand the things that go into player development.

**Edit:** [Kyler and Kliff have deep college ties, to the point where they're stylistically linked](https://www.si.com/nfl/cardinals/news/arizona-cardinals-kyler-murray-kliff-kingsbury-partnership)

Just because Rosen and Murray were both on the cards does not mean they were on the same team. The 2018 Cardinals had Wilks as HC and Fitz+JJ Nelson as WR. Rosen was only on the roster for 2018. The 2019 Cardinals had Kingsbury as HC but the 2020 Cards also had Hopkins + Fitz + Kirk at WR, which is elite. I'm comparing Year 2 here because it's the most important developmental year for QBs. Rosen had no year 2, while Kyler had a familiar coach and elite weapons. Fields is somewhere in between those situations, so clearly worse off than Kyler was.

As for record: most of the QBs I listed had more than one thing on the list of important factors I listed (team success/culture, stable coaching, weapons). You can argue Fields got the team success element in year 1 since we went to the playoffs before drafting him, but it's also fair to say he has 0/3 in year 2, which I reiterate is the most important developmental year for a QB

**Overall, the point is simple. On balance, successful QBs were supported, unsuccessful ones were not, and we have not supported Fields as well as most of the recent young successful QBs have been supported.

**b)** did not learn one fucking thing from our time with Jay Cutler

**c)** also have not paid any attention to recent developmental situations:

* Mahomes: went to 12-4 playoff Chiefs with a great offensive mind, time to sit, and elite weapons

* Deshaun Watson: went to 11-5 playoff Texans who had one of the top 3 receivers in the NFL, plus Will Fuller

* Josh Allen: went to the 9-7 playoff Bills with a great OC

* Lamar Jackson: went to the 10-6 playoff Ravens with a great OC

* Justin Herbert: The chargers made the playoffs at 11-5 two years prior, and had Keenan Allen

* Kyler Murray: Cards had elite talent (Hopkins + Kirk + Fitzgerald) by year 2, plus Kyler's college coach who knew how to scheme for him

* Joe Burrow: the Bengals were a dumpster fire the year prior to drafting him, but they surrounded him with Mixon, Higgins, and Boyd in year 1 and upgraded a great group to an elite one by adding Chase in year 2

*Meanwhile,* better prospects who have gone to worse teams (Trubisky, Darnold, Mayfield, Rosen, Tua) have struggled, and ultimately busted. 

These days you can't just let your blue chip QB talent sit on a terrible roster losing games. Developing a QB means throwing the kitchen sink at him. And we aren't doing that.

>The Bears have been called out for recklessly abandoning Fields by just about everyone, so naturally a contrarian argument has been formulated by fans/stans. It goes like this: the Bears have needs everywhere, second-round picks Jaquan Brisker and Kyler Gordon had first-round grades, any receiver the Bears selected in the second round would be a reach, and nothing matters because this is just a rebuilding year.
>
>To address those points:
>
>* **The Bears have needs everywhere.** True. Either developing or getting an accurate evaluation of their potential franchise quarterback is a more pressing need than bolstering the secondary a smidge.
> 
>* **Second-round picks Brisker and Gordon had first-round grades.** So did receivers George Pickens and Skyy Moore, who were still on the board when the Bears selected Gordon. ""First-round grade"" is a canard and a colloquial term; team evaluators and media analysts alike broke this and every other draft class into about 15 top-tier prospects and a second tier of perhaps 30 or 40 players which included Gordon, Brisker, Pickens, Moore, Jon Metchie, and others. Technically, about 50 players per year can be described as having ""first-round grades"" for the purposes of a self-serving argument. Had the Bears selected David Ojabo or Nakobe Dean instead of a receiver, they could at least justify the pick as a player who had gotten top-10 or top-15 notice and was therefore too good to pass up. The Bears chose a pair of defensive backs because they prioritized their bad secondary over their league-worst receiver corps. Period.
> 
>* **Any receiver the Bears selected in the second round would be a reach.** Not Pickens, Moore, or Metchie. Also, nothing was stopping them from selecting a receiver on Day 3. Shakir, Melton, Romeo Doubs, or Calvin Austin could easily win a roster spot from someone like Sharpe or Pettis.
> 
>* **Nothing matters because this is just a rebuilding year.** Rebuilding years are not gap years after high school for smoking weed on the basement couch. Real rebuilding must be tactical and aggressive. Look at what the Giants are doing: eating bad contracts on one front, adding top draft talent on the second, hedging their bets with Daniel Jones (without throwing their chips out the window) on the third. Poles and Eberflus weren't given two first-round picks to work with, but they were given Fields and a less-than-catastrophic cap situation. What have they done so far? Turned Khalil Mack into a rookie safety, slapped some Band-Aids on the offensive line, and purpose-built the weakest offense in the NFL. Good thing they drafted a punter!

I also get very frustrated when people try to argue we had no resoources. We started the offseason with the [11th most cap space](https://twitter.com/spotrac/status/1474379645105721348), then we [spent the 3rd least](https://overthecap.com/free-agency-spending/), and now we have the [6th most remaining](https://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space/), and the only move we *attempted* to make was to overpay a mid-tier DT. Meanwhile, NOR was $78M in the hole and GB was $50M in the hole, and they both brought back nearly every impact starter (except Davante). Hell, the Saints even signed Honey Badger. Nobody is saying we should've signed Kirk for $21M, but especially with creative use of signing bonuses, incentives, backloading, and void years, we could have easily signed good WR talent, and we chose not to, and then we chose not to draft any either. Folks in the Bears sub keep saying ""we'll do that next year"", without acknowledging that Year 2 is vital for QBs, and if we ruin Justin this year, who cares about all our cap and picks next year. 

Then to top it off, people argue that if Fields is the guy, he's incapable of being ruined (in essence, arguing that this year of development doesn't matter). In doing so, folks in our sub regularly:

* demonstrate that they have never played a team sport at a varsity HS or collegiate level when they say stupid shit like that ""if he has it, he'll show it"".

4411,12419,12419,Antitypical,"I agree that this article starts off *super* weak. But it builds to a real point, which I'll paste here:

>The Bears have been called out for recklessly abandoning Fields by just about everyone, so naturally a contrarian argument has been formulated by fans/stans. It goes like this: the Bears have needs everywhere, second-round picks Jaquan Brisker and Kyler Gordon had first-round grades, any receiver the Bears selected in the second round would be a reach, and nothing matters because this is just a rebuilding year.
>
>To address those points:
>
>* **The Bears have needs everywhere.** True. Either developing or getting an accurate evaluation of their potential franchise quarterback is a more pressing need than bolstering the secondary a smidge.
> 
>* **Second-round picks Brisker and Gordon had first-round grades.** So did receivers George Pickens and Skyy Moore, who were still on the board when the Bears selected Gordon. ""First-round grade"" is a canard and a colloquial term; team evaluators and media analysts alike broke this and every other draft class into about 15 top-tier prospects and a second tier of perhaps 30 or 40 players which included Gordon, Brisker, Pickens, Moore, Jon Metchie, and others. Technically, about 50 players per year can be described as having ""first-round grades"" for the purposes of a self-serving argument. Had the Bears selected David Ojabo or Nakobe Dean instead of a receiver, they could at least justify the pick as a player who had gotten top-10 or top-15 notice and was therefore too good to pass up. The Bears chose a pair of defensive backs because they prioritized their bad secondary over their league-worst receiver corps. Period.
> 
>* **Any receiver the Bears selected in the second round would be a reach.** Not Pickens, Moore, or Metchie. Also, nothing was stopping them from selecting a receiver on Day 3. Shakir, Melton, Romeo Doubs, or Calvin Austin could easily win a roster spot from someone like Sharpe or Pettis.
> 
>* **Nothing matters because this is just a rebuilding year.** Rebuilding years are not gap years after high school for smoking weed on the basement couch. Real rebuilding must be tactical and aggressive. Look at what the Giants are doing: eating bad contracts on one front, adding top draft talent on the second, hedging their bets with Daniel Jones (without throwing their chips out the window) on the third. Poles and Eberflus weren't given two first-round picks to work with, but they were given Fields and a less-than-catastrophic cap situation. What have they done so far? Turned Khalil Mack into a rookie safety, slapped some Band-Aids on the offensive line, and purpose-built the weakest offense in the NFL. Good thing they drafted a punter!

I also get very frustrated when people try to argue we had no resoources. We started the offseason with the [11th most cap space](https://twitter.com/spotrac/status/1474379645105721348), then we [spent the 3rd least](https://overthecap.com/free-agency-spending/), and now we have the [6th most remaining](https://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space/), and the only move we *attempted* to make was to sign a DT. Meanwhile, NOR was $78M in the hole and GB was $50M in the hole, and they both brought back nearly every impact starter (except Davante). Hell, the Saints even signed Honey Badger. Nobody is saying we should've signed Kirk for $21M, but especially with creative use of signing bonuses, incentives, backloading, and void years, we could have easily signed good WR talent, and we chose not to, and then we chose not to draft any either. Folks in this sub keep saying ""we'll do that next year"", without acknowledging that Year 2 is vital for QBs, and if we ruin Justin this year, who cares about all our cap and picks next year. 

Then to top it off, people argue that if Fields is the guy, he's incapable of being ruined (in essence, arguing that this year of development doesn't matter). In doing so, folks in this sub regularly:

* Josh Allen: went to the 10-6 playoff Bills with a great OC

* Lamar Jackson: went to the 10-6 playoff Ravens with a great OC

* Justin Herbert: The chargers made the playoffs at 11-5 two years prior, and had Keenan Allen

* Kyler Murray: Cards had elite talent (Hopkins + Kirk + Fitzgerald) by year 2, plus Kyler's college coach who knew how to scheme for him

* Joe Burrow: the Bengals were a dumpster fire the year prior to drafting him, but they surrounded him with Mixon, Higgins, and Boyd in year 1 and upgraded a great group to an elite one by adding Chase in year 2

It's one thing to get the right starters, but for the backups you need people who are hard workers, love the game, and have chemistry with each other because that's what makes a good special teams unit. You hear coaches talk about it all the time, especially wrt late round draft picks: ""Are they willing to give it their all just to play special teams?"" There are several FO guys who talk about how sometimes you might genuinely pick the worse pure RB/CB/S for that 4th or 5th spot on the depth chart because they're a better, more passionate, more disciplined special teams player.

So when you have a special teams roster that's as bad as Green Bay's was for as many consecutive years as it's been that way, it's partially bad coaching-- that's absolutely an aspect-- but it has a lot to do with many repeated errors selecting which backups make the final cuts as well.

a) very clearly have not played a team sport at a high level (varsity high school, college, pro) and don't realize that environment (surrounding talent, winning culture, good coaching) is the most important determinant of player development and success

b) did not learn one fucking thing from our time with Jay Cutler

c) also have not paid any attention to recent developmental situations:

* Mahomes: went to 12-4 playoff Chiefs with a great offensive mind, time to sit, and elite weapons

* Deshaun Watson: went to 11-5 playoff Texans who had one of the top 3 receivers in the NFL, plus Will Fuller

* Josh Allen: went to the 10-6 playoff Bills with a great OC

* Lamar Jackson: went to the 10-6 playoff Ravens with a great OC

* Justin Herbert: The chargers made the playoffs at 11-5 two years prior, and had Keenan Allen

* Kyler Murray: Cards had elite talent (Hopkins + Kirk + Fitzgerald) by year 2, plus Kyler's college coach who knew how to scheme for him

* Joe Burrow: the Bengals were a dumpster fire the year prior to drafting him, but they surrounded him with Mixon, Higgins, and Boyd in year 1 and upgraded a great group to an elite one by adding Chase in year 2

*Meanwhile,* better prospects who have gone to worse teams (Trubisky, Darnold, Mayfield, Rosen, Tua) have struggled, and ultimately busted.

""Eddie Jackson said he's had rookie safety Jaqaun Brisker over to his home this offseason to watch film/answer questions. It's something he offered up to his teammate early on, and Brisker took him up on it immediately. Jackson said the players who did the same for him as a rookie were the likes of Kyle Fuller, Danny Trevathan and Akiem Hicks and when he became a veteran, he decided to pay it forward.

Just when did he feel the need to take on that leadership role?

Olin Kreutz was fired for assaulting a co-worker and pretty well known and well respected reporter Adam Hoge. He then went on to brag about it. He was on the show and was always dishing out but was super sensitive whenever he was criticized especially if it was regarding Sam Mustipher who he was training

Additionally, while the original situation of the Bears offering him minimum wage to be/help the team was pretty divisive among the fan base, he lost a lot of goodwill for just not being a bigger man but constantly bringing it up whenever he could. He looked extremely whiney

Teams really overrate draft picks the closer they get, even though like most draft players will not live up to the pick.

Of course this assumes he repeats the same level of play as last season and I do not think their is a more statistically volatile player.

So two notes from our conversation with @rvfc10 that I don't think were out there. 

1.	Fields was “pissed” about the game plan in Cleveland, his first start. 

2.	Cole Kmet joined Darnell Mooney in Georgia for a few of the workouts with Fields. Veal raved about Mooney.*


I'll add a third. 

The primary objectives of what he said were 15 or 16 private workouts over the offseason were increasing the speed of his drop, increasing the speed of his delivery, and ball security. 

Veal said these were things Fields relayed to him the coaches wanted.",153.0,chibears,t3_tu2173,False,0.0,Moon Me Mooney,2022-04-01T16:29:46Z,chibears,0.000953086419753

They’re going younger sexier. Two different scenarios for both players. 

I’m not even arguing with you like he’s nailing everything so far this off-season. We don’t have enough help.

Hester illustrates this perfectly, because he was a generational talent that in theory should have been an insanely good weapon on offense. Him starting his career as a CB doesn't change that fact nor does it change the fact that Velus has the exact same shortcomings despite starting as a WR and spending more time in college than most players and coming into the league at age 25.

I don't think many people in here were realistically expecting that. I do think, however, that there was an expectation that Poles would do more than sign a couple of lower end depth receivers.

As it stands now, the Bears are relying on a bunch of WR4's and 5's to somehow take an almost insurmountable step forward. I want to drink the Kool-Aid, but we have a first year defensive HC and a first year OC. Nothing outside of blind optimism suggests any of the signings are going to suddenly become reliable safety nets, let alone difference makers.

Fields has a very high ceiling, but it's not fair to expect him to elevate depth pieces in his second year when he still has a lot to work on himself.

I would say these QBs are comfortably ahead to start the season [13]:  Mahomes, Allen, Rodgers, Brady, Herbert, Burrow, Prescott, Lamar Jackson, Stafford, Russell Wilson, Kyler Murray, Deshaun Watson, Derek Carr.

Tua and Jalen Hurts [2] are wild cards that have can have a lot of variance in their performance, but I would guess they end up as middle tier to back of the upper tier with the weapons they have going into this season.

Then you get into the vets who are probably mid-tier starters [4]: Matt Ryan, Kirk Cousins, Ryan Tannehill, healthy Jimmy G.  It depends on what you want from your QB if you have these guys as a starter because their ceiling isn't great in my opinion, but they're probably not going to be a disaster either, so you have have to be a pretty strong starter to be ahead of them.

Guys who are vets but probably below average/lower-tier starters [8]:  Baker Mayfield, Jameis Winston, Daniel Jones, Wentz, Goff, Sam Darnold, Trubisky, Drew Lock.

I'm not sure if I find it egregious exactly to where someone should be fired (and Brad Biggs said Poles was making wide-spread staffing changes to the scouting department before this firing was announced, so I'm not sure if the firing is a result of his comment or going to happen anyways), but I definitely think it was a mistake to where the scout should've been corrected.  I get what he was trying to say, but being ""poor, hungry, and desperate"" would've been an extremely difficult thing for Brisker to go through, and labeling someone with those words is very insulting at least.  Imagine if you were in a job interview and they wanted to dig into how rough your childhood was, and the worse off you were, the more the interviewer thought that was a positive for their sake.  ""Did your family have any money when you were growing up?  No?  Perfect, we like poor people.  Was there a struggle to have enough food on the table?  Even better, hungry people are hard workers out of necessity.  Are you desperate to make it out of your circumstances growing up?  Wonderful, desperate people will work hard for us.""  Obviously, I'm taking some liberties with that example, but you get the point that it feels pretty gross and uncomfortable to talk down to someone or about someone like that.

Also, just to shed some info on Brisker, this is his draft profile from The Athletic:  

> Jaquan Brisker, who is one of eight children, was born in Pittsburgh and later moved to Monroeville. He attended Gateway High, where he was a three-year letterman as a safety and wide receiver. As a senior, Brisker earned team MVP and First Team All-Section honors for the second consecutive year. He set a school record with 42 catches for 781 yards and 11 touchdowns in 2016, adding five punt return touchdowns. He was held out of several games in high school, including a playoff loss his senior year, due to declining grades and missed classes. Brisker also lettered two seasons in basketball, earning First Team All-Section honors as a senior.

> A three-star cornerback recruit out of high school, Brisker received interest from several Power 5 programs in the 2017 recruiting class, but he admittedly didn’t focus enough on academics, and the major offers never arrived. Instead of accepting an offer to grayshirt at Toledo, he decided to enroll at Lackawanna Community College to get his grades back on track. A two-year junior college starter, Brisker led the team with 64 tackles as a sophomore and was named an All-American. A four-star juco recruit, he was the No. 1 juco safety recruit and the No. 12 player overall. Brisker committed to Penn State (his dream program) over offers from Alabama, Pitt and others. His older brother (Tale’) was shot and killed in Prairie View, Texas when Brisker was a high school sophomore (February 2015), which was a major reason for Jaquan’s focus issues in high school. He participated in “Senior Day” in 2020 and received an invitation to the 2021 Senior Bowl, but took advantage of the NCAA extra year of eligibility and returned for a fifth season in 2021. Brisker graduated with his degree in communications (December 2021).

I almost get emotional reading that.  It's awesome how far he's come already.  There's just a better way of labeling all of that as driven, motivated, resilient, whatever, as opposed to ""poor, hungry, and desperate.""",19.0,chibears,t3_ug8ool,False,0.0,Kyle Long,2022-05-01T18:57:06Z,chibears,0.0047820836450047

This is true.


>Mack on defense helps more then a late 2nd rounder.


Still a dumb argument.


>18,14,13, and 7qb hits in a half a season is pretty consistent to me. Pressures is 40, 40, 30. Hence why he went to the pro bowl each year. Was graded highly each year. Was respected by his peers each year.

>The only year he hasn't been great, was last year when he got injured and missed half the season. And he was still pretty good in that half season.


45 pressures, 30 pressures, on pace for 20 pressures. Mack is still great, but it is 100% dependent on health. The older he gets the more likely this is a reoccurring issue.


>There is a reason the only people who think Mack isn't going to continue to be a beast next year, is bears fans trying to cope with the horrific return we got and trying to justify it by going oh yeah well i like my gm making decisions out of fear of further injury.


He is a beast.


>His lowest value is right now. Coming off an injury with no tape showing he's back to khalil mack. In order to say his highest value is now. You're yet again arguing out of fear.


That assumes a bounce back to a fully healthy season at the same production level. But if that doesn't happen, hes a year older, a year less of contractual control, proven further injury concerns. Why risk it? 


Our team is better with khalik mack. Our team isnt winning this year and probably not next year. So why not get picks that help us in the future? Im so confused how that concept is going right over your head.

Bears fans go yeah well he was injured last year so he's never going to be good so a 2nd rounder for an elite rusher is good and uhhh it's good we're eating more in dead cap in 2022 then if we kept him because you know it would be illegal to move him at any other point before 2023 and having only 100 mil in cap in 2023 was really holding us back. We needed to be at 120 mil so we can sign more bad lineman like lucas patrick!


Mack is a great player, never said he was going to be bad. The bears dont need him right now, why keep him? And the odds of him being as productive, along with injury concerns, by the time this team is ready to compete, are not great. So get capital that will help you win in the future.


>It was a bad trade. When 30 other franchises go, Damn we could have gotten mack for a 2nd why didn't we do that? 1 franchise goes, i can't believe we did that for a 2nd. And one franchise goes yeah well he totally is going to be injured so any thing is a good deal. Take a hint.

I agree. But the argument isnt just him being effective, but also, ""how does he help us win a superbowl"". By the time our roster is there, I doubt mack will be making the type of impact that justifies his salary.


>His sack totals went down since 2018 but his pressures and pressure rate stayed relatively the same.



[Not really tho](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MackKh00.htm). Look at his advanced stats for pressures, qb hits, knockdowns.


And i'm a big mack fan, I have no ill feelings towards his time here at all, he's a beast. Injuries just hampered his play. But I do agree, even through injuries he was good because hes a HOF caliber player.


>And it absolutely is a decision that's being made out of fear. Your entire argument is built around the fear of him not returning from his injury. You're making the assumption that mack is done and the bears getting anything is a good deal.


I'm not saying he's done, I'm saying he doesn't fit the window, and he will likely be less effective by the time we need him, and injury situations tend to not get better with age, that's just a fact. He's played through injuries every year and it has made him less dominate. You have to do the math and decide if it's time to cut your losses, and get what you can.


>When we just saw what a half year rental from an elite edge rusher the season coming back from injury went for. And it was a lot more than a 2nd rounder.


It was a second and a third. Mack got two seconds and a sixth


>His dead cap is higher than his cap hit. We had absolutely no reason to do this deal now. We had until the next league year, then you needed him off the cap if we're going to add youth to the team around Fields. Which is why i've never brought up issue with getting rid of Mack. We should trade quinn too. And if anyone is dumb enough to take Eddie jackson, ship him off too. No one but Fields, Mooney, Roquan, and Jaylon are off limits.


His value is highest right now. Next offseason it goes down , and why risk him getting hurt and having zero trade value if your plan is mid season trade. I


>Just because it's a good decision to move on from mack doesn't mean it's a good decision to do it at any cost. A 2nd round pick is not more valuable then having an elite edge rusher who can reduce the pressure on fields to score 30+ and help create pressure that leads to turnovers, which leads to confidence building scoring drives.


It's two 2nd round picks, and I totally disagree with the premise that this is going to affect fields in any way, that's ridiculous.

And it's not decision being made out of fear. If you look what your window is, the cap hit, his health - and in turn production, his age - and in turn his production, the fact that his trade value will only continue to diminish (unless of course he stays healthy and dominates, but that's far from a given), I think his trade is more than justifiable, even if the return isn't as much as you hoped.

The sellers purchased this house as a foreclosure at the beginning of 2021, along with the fines that the previous owner had. They totally gutted and rehabbed the place and built a second floor.

The current sellers had to go to court to clear all the fines/liens on the property. However, the court only schedules these hearings once a month and the sellers were out of town the first time. 

The second hearing, they showed up but the Judge told them the hearings are now only Zoom, so they had to wait a few weeks again. At the next hearing, the Judge informed them that since it was essentially a ""new-build"" the City of Chicago needs to come out and send their own inspectors to review the plumbing/electrical/HVAC. And the City of Chicago is typically slow as fuck. 

After these were finally approved (with no errors, all perfect), the city was like ""oh wait a minute, one side of the house needs Hardie Board because that side of the house is on the neighbors property line"" ... uhhhhh ok. The sellers knew this in the middle of June (probably earlier) but didn't do it. So they quickly added it and painted it to match the rest of the siding. 

Meanwhile, our rate lock kept getting extended from the beginning of May until now, at the crisp rate of $500/week (at the sellers expense). The rate lock expires for good tomorrow so we just made it.

* This section was written by /u/HopLegion who did a much better job than I could have.

&nbsp;

* 1 | 49ers | Sun 9/11 12:00 PM Chicago starts the season playing a team that made it to last year’s NFC Championship game. SF beat Chicago the year prior with Fields starting, though it was a closer game then the end score shows with Fields highlight run nearly tying the game with under 10 minutes left.  A lot of unknowns with Lance likely getting his first full start as undisputed QB1, but SF is clearly better talent wise nearly across the board.  This will be the first game we will get to see Fields starting against another 2021 QB draft choice in Trey Lance.  Overall, Fields outplays Lance in the game giving the Bears hope, but  the score remains a similar result to last year with SF able to secure the win.  CHI 26 - SF 31 (0-1)

* 2 | @ Packers | Sun 9/18 | 7:20 PM  An away primetime game against the Packers in Week 2, what could possibly go wrong.  If recent history is any indication, this will likely be an early lowpoint for Chicago.  Everyone is well aware of Rodgers history with the Bears and Bears fans should already be preparing themselves to read or hear the sound clip of Rodgers saying “I own you” 100+ times that week.  Until Chicago can show he doesn’t, it’s an accurate statement.   Losing Davante Adams won’t be enough to move the needle in the Bears favor.  For whatever reason in most games the Bears are able to stick in it through the first half, but the Packers won’t be worried as long as Rodgers is at QB.  When the final whistle sounds Green Bay wins by 10+.     GB 35 - CHI 23 (0-2)

* 3 | Texans | Sun 9/25 | 12:00pm  This is the week we learn if the Bears are truly a team destined for a top 3 pick, as many in the media projects, or if they will remain in the below average category they generally float in.  Fields gets his second game in the first 3 weeks against a QB drafted in 2021 in Davis Mills.  Bears fans also get to see former Head Coach Lovie Smith return as a head coach of another NFL team which most never thought would happen after his time in Tampa Bay and the collegiate level.  For the game, Fields continues to take a step playing better than another 2021 QB as the offense begins to click for the first time under new OC Luke Getsy.  The young defense is able to use Lovie’s principles against him forcing multiple turnovers and the Bears pull out their first win of the year at home.  CHI 31 - HOU 27 (1-2)    

* 4 | @ Giants | Sun 10/2 | 12:00 pm The only team the Bears blew out last season was the New York Giants, beating them soundly 29-3.  A lot went Chicago's way that game as famed former Chicago Bears QB Mike Glennon was starting for the Giants and completed a total of 4 passes for 24 yards and 2 INT.  This year the Giants should be improved with Jones back at QB and a new HC many Bears fans hoped would be coaching Chicago in Brian Daboll.  Overall, it ends up being a 50/50 game with Fields getting in his first game winning drive of the year to set up a last second Field Goal to put Chicago ahead.     NYG 26 - CHI 29 (2-2)

* 5 | @ Vikings | Sun 10/09 | 12:00 pm The Bears went 0-2 last year against the Vikings which was surprising as Nagy had actually gone 5-1 versus them his first 3 seasons as HC.  The biggest change for Minnesota during the off season is the change in Head Coach which will lead them to finding a more consistent offensive identity in 2022.  Overall, for this game the elite skill players and better QB play for Minnesota make the difference and lead to a Bears loss in Minnesota.  MIN 28 - CHI 17 (2-3)  

* 6 | Commanders | Thu 10/13 | 7:15 pm Nothing like Thursday Night Football excitement with the Washington Commanders versus the Chicago Bears to really get the NFL week going.  Coming off short rest this is going to be a sloppy game for both sides leading to neither team getting consistent offensive production.  Fields continued growth under Getsy and a defense that is able to generate turnovers ends up being decisive as the Bears win a sloppy low scoring game most fans shut off by halftime.  CHI 17 - WAS 16  (3-3)   

* 7 | @ Patriots | Mon 10/24 | 7:15pm  The third game of the season that will pit Justin Fields versus a QB drafted in the 2021 draft in Mac Jones and the third primetime Bears game in 7 weeks (got to love the Chicago market ratings boost early in the season).  Bears will be coming off a mini-bye after playing 11 days ago on Thursday Night, but unfortunately this causes them to come out of the gate slow.  A conservative offensive game plan by Belichek with the continued development by Mac Jones will lead to a Patriots victory at home in Prime Time.  NE 24 - CHI 17  (3-4) 

* 8 | @ Cowboys | Sun 10/30 | 12:00pm Every year the Bears come down with a surprise win and this is the game it ends up happening.  Fields will be running for his life all game (and likely season) as Parsons is used creatively to get into the backfield, but overall this will be his statement game as Fields makes play after play to put the Bears ahead ending with a last second touchdown pass to 3rd year tight end Cole Kmet to seal the victory. CHI 34 - DAL 31  (4-4)  

* 9 | Dolphins | Sun 11/6 | 12:00pm  Another team with an offensive HC many Chicago fans wanted to see in McDaniels.  Tua vs Fields will be the big story leading into the week, but the overall difference will be in the talent Miami has at wide receiver as the combo of Waddle and Tyreek show out against Chicago’s secondary.  Fields struggles as he tries to do too much and Miami ends up with the victory.  MIA 28 - CHI 20  (4-5)  

* 10 | Lions | Sun 11/13 | 12:00pm  This will be a tough game for the Bears as many have come to expect the Lions to be a victory almost every time.  Nagy was 7-1 against the Lions over the past 4 seasons, but a lot of those games have come down to the wire with luck going Chicago’s way in the final few minutes.  Overall, the Lions play a tough game with Swift catching a game tying touchdown pass (this time) in the final minute to take it to overtime where the Bears win with a long Darnell Mooney TD catch.  CHI 27 - DET 21 (5-5)  

* 11 | @ Falcons | Sun 11/20 | 12:00pm  Chicago vs Chicago South as the Bears face a Falcons team with 2 former Bears GMs on the staff, 5 players who were on the Bears in 2021, 4 players who played for the Bears while Pace was GM, and 5+ coaches on the coaching staff who coached recently in Chicago. This week versus the Falcons, the Bears show the difference of what a bad team is versus what a below average team is as they blow out Atlanta for their first big victory of the season winning by 10+ points.   ATL 13 - CHI 28 (6-5) 

* 12 | @ Jets | Sun 11/27 | 12:00pm We get the final 2021 QB showdown as Fields faces Wilson marking the 4th QB he will have faced from the 2021 draft.  The New York Jets are a fascinating team this year with a lot of talent on paper and high draft capital on offense.  In another year or two, I think they will have built a consistent team on offense, but for 2022 it could be a lot of ups and downs.  In a close game, the defense is able to create turnovers from a young offensive core for the Jets leading to a Bears victory and marking the high point of their season.  ATL 17 - CHI 24 (7-5) 

* 13 | Packers | Sun 12/04 12:00 PM CST In what ends up being the most hyped game of the season for Chicago who has a surprising winning record ⅔ through the season, Aaron Rodgers once again reminds Bears of the difference a HOF QB makes.  Rodgers plays a near perfect game as he decimates the Bears momentum heading into the bye week.  Fields takes a big step back trying to do too much and plays his worst game of the year.  The Bears lose big at home leaving a lot of questions heading into the bye week.  CHI 13 - GB 31 (7-6)   

* 14 | Bye (Finally)

* 15 | Eagles | Mon 12/18 | 12:00 pm Coming off the bye Chicago gets off to a slow start.  Similar to previous games, the talent on offense begins to show as AJ Brown and Devonta Smith make the difference.  The Bears are shown again teams need multiple high level players on offense to take the next step.  Fields and the offense bounce back, but are outmatched against a more talented Eagles team.  CHI 24 - PHI 30 (7-7)  

* 16 |  Bills | Sat 12/24 | 12:00pm Just the Christmas Eve present every Bears fan wants, playing one of the best teams in the NFL while the team is “In The Hunt” for the playoffs.  The best thing the Bears could hope for is the Bills are 15-0 and are resting some players, but unfortunately the Bills show what the Bears hope to be in 2 years soundly beating them at all 3 levels and lowering their playoff hopes.  CHI 17 - BUF 31 (7-8)  

* 17 | @ Lions | Sun 1/01 12:00 pm  After a tough Christmas Eve loss where they were outclassed, the Bears are ready to face a Lions team they barely beat over a month back.  Unfortunately this will be another lesson showing multiple playmakers are needed on offense and the Bears just do not have the personnel on their team as it stands.  In another tight game the combo of Jameson Williams who is hitting his stride in his rookie season by this point showing he should’ve been the first WR drafted and Amon St. Brown put the Lions over the Bears in the final minute, crushing any hopes the Bears had.  DET 27 - CHI 20 (7-9)  

* 18 | Vikings | TBD  As usual, the Bears visit Minnesota to finish out the season. However, at 7-9, they're firmly on the outside of the playoff picture, hoping only to play spoiler to the Vikings' wildcard hopes. This game will give Bears fans some future hope heading into the offseason as they put together a complete game on both sides of the ball with young players on offense and defense buying into Eberflus HITS principle.  Kirk Cousins gets a chance to win it at the end, but comes up just short.   CHI 27 - MIN 23 (8-9)

Final record: 8-9, 3rd NFC North",8.0,nfl,t3_vsq3jw,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears :Lions: Lions,2022-07-06T08:31:26Z,chibears,-0.0104162015561811
27684,146625,146625,PlatypusOfDeath,"###Culture and Scheme

&nbsp;

Eberflus is known for his culture. He instils in his players a need for tenacity, hustling until the whistle. Instead of micromanaging his coordinators, or taking control of the defence, it is expected that he will work as a true manager, while letting the people he hired, do their jobs. Both Poles and Eberflus have [talked](https://gg.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/t7am93/per_ras_created_by_mathbomb_the_chiefs_interior/) about the need for versatile and athletic players, causing the Relative Athletic Score to become a popular reference in /r/chibears. The new coaching staff are big proponents of HITS workouts. High intensity, relentless versatile athletes will be the norm in Chicago.

&nbsp;

Offensive Scheme: Explosive plays have been mentioned when discussing the new identify of Chicago's offense. With their hiring of OL Coach Chris Morgan, it is likley that the Bears run scheme will be [outside-zone](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=outside+zone+scheme) or [wide-zone.](https://www.ganggreennation.com/2021/10/6/22706331/wide-zone-inside-zone-and-power-gap-schemes) Furthermore, Getsy's offense is [expected](https://theathletic.com/3101662/2022/01/31/what-makes-bears-qb-justin-fields-and-offensive-coordinator-luke-getsy-a-good-fit/) to feature a lot of RPOs and will aim to take advantage of Fields speed and skill as a runner while getting recievers downfield in a west-coast type passing game.

&nbsp;

Defensive Scheme: The Bears are switching back to a 4-3 defense. This is the third time Eberflus has been apart of a team transitioning from 3-4 to 4-3. He is quoted as saying that the scheme will fit around the players and their skills. The defense will be attacking the ball in mass, hustling each and every play.",33.0,nfl,t3_vsq3jw,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears :Lions: Lions,2022-07-06T08:31:13Z,chibears,0.0001580159333227
27685,146626,146626,PlatypusOfDeath,"###Training Camp Battles

&nbsp;.

* **CBs** - Thomas Graham Jr was PFFs [76th best prospect](https://gg.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/n2t4gf/oregon_cb_thomas_graham_jr_was_the_76thranked/) prior to the 2021 draft. Last season, he was waived and re-signed before playing 4 games and a total of 102 snaps. He also opted out of the 2020 season. Jaylon Jonhson has been practising with the second team and seems to be being encouraged to step it up. Kyler Gordon is a second-round rookie. They're likely to be the starters, though it seems everyone has a shot.

* **LS** - UDFA Rookie Antonio Ortiz is most likely a camp body but this sub loves its long snappers so we'll see if 34-year-old Patrick Scales can keep going.

* **LT, RG, RT** - Who will end up where? Lucas Patrick at Center and Cody Whitehair at Left Gaurd are the only positions anyone is willing to bet on. Tevin Jenkins has also been playing with the second team while Borom and Braxton Jones had some moments of fame in camp.",3.0,nfl,t3_vsq3jw,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears :Lions: Lions,2022-07-06T08:30:59Z,chibears,0.0520402891176115

**Drafting BPA** - ""Generally speaking, you do want to stick with best available. I think that's how you capture value the best on the board. And then if all things are even between four guys and one's in a position that you need and it's a premium position, then you will adjust to that. But you really should have the mindset of best available.""

&nbsp;

**Trading up or down** - ""To move up, it's got to be a special player that really checks all the boxes. We talk about 'Bears Fit,' the guys who represent exactly what we need, and if that matches a high level of performance, that's something that we would consider. In terms of moving back, then it becomes a numbers game, and I work with some of our analytics folks to come up with rules for that on draft day.

30970,173886,173886,Ssquad,"I’m happy with the picks. They fill a need. I remember last year dreading watching our DBs all game. 

So, with Gordon last season he surrounded only a 50% completion rate with a 47.3% passer rating according to PFF. On top of that, from 2019-2021 he never gave up a TD. The NFL is a whole different ballgame but that’s some quality coverage. If that can transcend well enough to the next level we’re good.

Now on to Brisker, fills another position of need and an area where we lacked playmaking. I believe Brisker can bring that. In three years at Penn State he’s had 143 tackles, 10 TFLs, 5 INTs, 14 PD & 1 FR. I’ve read he can play up top, inside and in the box. That adds tremendous value. 

Plus, everything I read says he’s a sure tackler that itself should thrill this fanbase considering how many comments people left in game-threads, posts, Twitter that Eddie can’t tackle or doesn’t have the willingness too.

Gordon and Brisker combined for 1,678 coverage snaps and gave up ONE TD. Again, the NFL is a different ball game, I hope for that kind of success but if that can translate to the NFL we have a solid young secondary. 

Also doesn’t help that our division has some and added some good WR. Can’t ask Jaylon to cover Jefferson, Thielen, Willams, St. Brown, Watson and I wouldn’t put that up to the DB room of last year again.

> Dear Mr. Foster,

> In your editorial Tuesday, February 8, you noted that Norm Van Brocklin admits his humorous way concerning the selecting of players in the seventeenth round of the draft.

> I think that I am as good a fan as the Atlanta Falcons have.  I do not think the draft is a place for childish humor.

> Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that Bart Starr, a name we are all familiar with, was a 17th round choice.  Danny Abramowicz was a 17th round pick for New Orleans and he has been the most consistent receiver in the NFL over the last several years.  Julian Fagan was a 17th pick and is one of the top punters in the league.  Needless to say, his average is far above that of the Falcon punters.  Don Nottingham was the last man drafted in the 1971 draft.  He was number 442 and he rushed for far more yardage than Joe Profit, Atlanta's first choice, who was the 7th man selected.

> I realize that Joe was hurt in the St. Louis game and the injury ended his season, but up until the time he was hurt, he had carried the ball 3 times for 10 yards.  If he was the best running back in college in 1970, why wasn't he in the backfield instead of returning kickoffs??  You didn't see John Brockington returning many kickoffs!!!

> I think that a team that gets only 10 yards out of their first draft choice, shouldn't make a joke out of their 17th choice.

> I suggest you print this letter, maybe Norm will read it and take it to heart.

> Thank you,

After unsurprisingly sucking in his short stay with the All-Stars, owner Ollie Kraehe decided to ship him off to Green Bay in exchange for desperately needed money, and Kraehe sold Curly Lambeau on Gray with the same exact pitch that Gray gave him.  When Gray sucked with the Packers as well, Lambeau confronted Kraehe who admitted the ""trade"" was entirely a prank and gave the money back.

As for Gray, he disappeared when the Packers were boarding the train.  Nobody knows where he went or who he is.",21.0,nfl,t3_un1kgn,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-05-11T00:29:33Z,chibears,-0.0080901105967078
35417,212589,212589,ZappaOMatic,"Fun fact: the Bears began this year with three straight scoreless ties before losing 2–0 to the Packers.  They were 4–1–6 entering the final month of the season.

As mentioned by another comment, there was no postseason at the time and the champs were crowned by win percentage, with the Bears and Spartans playing this as basically a tiebreaker.  However, the circumstances to set it up were just as hilariously chaotic.  The Wikipedia article linked discusses the situation, but here's a bigger picture ([I did a write-up on this for the sub back in 2018 if you want even more details](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8z548w/the_1932_packers_blew_their_lead_atop_the/)):

Wikipedia's section on the standings fiasco mentions that the Packers ""controlled their own destiny at the end of the 1932 season, but lost their last two games to the Spartans and the Bears.""  Both games, which were against opponents whom they beat earlier in the season, were pretty wild too.  Against Portsmouth, they lost 19–0 in a game where their opponent played the same exact 11 players for all 60 minutes without any substitutions; this was payback for what happened in their first game, where the Spartans accused the Packers of getting help from the refs (something something time is a flat circle), and for the previous year, where Green Bay abruptly canceled their season finale against Portsmouth in order to protect their spot atop the standings.  This loss dropped the Packers to .833 and behind the Spartans' .857, while the Bears won their game in New York to also reach .833.

The final game of the year was between the Bears and Packers.  Even if the Packers won, their .846 would not be enough to surpass the Spartans (who did not have any games scheduled), so Portsmouth was obviously rooting for them to pull it off.  The Bears proceeded to win 9–0 and improve to 6–1–6, giving them a .857 percentage and therefore tying them with the Spartans.  Portsmouth fans and media were unsurprisingly pissed at the Packers for blowing it, and [one local paper wrote the following](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mTNBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sagMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6715,4175710):

> Chicago, in defeating the Green Bay Packers, finished what the Spartans started last Sunday—proof that the Packers this season have been a greatly overrated ball club and away from the protection of their home influence are just a toothless, straw-armed gridiron scare-crow and not the man-eating, one-eyed ogre conjured by the fans.

> Pampered at home they could ""take it"" but on the road they couldn't stand the gaff. In two straight games the Packers crashed from first place to third and suffered the ignominy of seeing two teams they belittled stamp in their face.

> Whether the Spartans win the championship or not, they have been vindicated in their contention that the Packers are just another ball club and they had been true sportsmen last season and not ""welched"" on the last game of the season and played it in Portsmouth, as booked, they would not have been ""cheese"" champions but ""also rans"".",19.0,nfl,t3_uiz2gl,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-05-05T10:56:50Z,chibears,0.0532484094736113

35421,212608,212608,ZappaOMatic,"Probably because ""lol Jets"".

It wasn't that unusual for fullbacks to go in the first round as you showed, and many mock drafts had both Highsmith and Vick as first rounders (also worth mentioning that fullbacks were usually lumped in with halfbacks, with their roles flipping interchangeably too, for a generic running back position).  For example, [Michael Janofsky](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/26/sports/nfl-draft-87-how-the-first-round-might-go.html) of *The New York Times* projected Highsmith as going #4 overall to Green Bay as a ""tough inside runner for a team that couldn't run"", while Vick was mocked as #22 overall to San Francisco as he had ""good hands, and that's the kind of fullback Bill Walsh likes in his offense.""  [Joel S. Buchsbaum's mock](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/99625648/) had Highsmith to Pittsburgh at #10 (""Chuck Noll isn't in love with Frank Pollard as an all-around fullback and likes to take the best athlete available."") and Vick to Minnesota at #16 (""Vick is cut from the Roger Craig-Chuck Foreman mold.  The Vikings need a big, versatile back."").  Mel Kiper had Highsmith as [his 9th best prospect in the draft](https://i.imgur.com/Jh5SzoH.png).

Most of the negative reactions came because many expected the Jets to address other needs with their first rounder.  Janofsky and Buchsbaum projected Jeff Bregel to help the OL, while others thought they'd go defense like Cincinnati LB Alex Gordon (ironically, Gordon fell to them anyway in the second round).  Most of the defensive players New York wanted like John Bosa and Mike Junkin were already gone when they were on the clock, so Vick was viewed as the best player available.",1.0,nfl,t3_u26c7d,False,0.0,:Bears: Bears,2022-04-12T16:30:53Z,chibears,0.08580514508885

This is very common with a lot of lineman.

Tonyan tore his ACL in week 8 last year he likely at best wouldn’t return until maybe weeks 4-5. But general ACL history for football would say closer to 1 year from surgery date.

Defensive side, just depends on how well the rush defense is, secondary is fine. I do think Amos will regress.

It’s a top 10 unit on paper, just have to see where they land on the field.

41445,250878,250878,eyeguy21,"I would say:

12-5 AND above : chargers, broncos, buffalo, cinnci, LA. Are possible and likely.

Here comes the controversy: Vikings, Tampa, Greenbay, Chiefs. Will most definitely flirt or get to 11 wins.

However there is tons of unknowns in GB and TB about how the roster will actually perform. Yes they have HOF rodgers and TB12, but with OL changes, offensive weapons, and just years of sustained success. There is a chance for regression. Not saying they will be bad, but they are both teams that should regress, same as the Chiefs. If they don’t they don’t.

Yes I am a bears fan, but let’s be honest Packers lose WR1, don’t replace him. They have their top 2 OL injured. They also lost another center. That OL is being rated high preseason because they have historically been good. They very well could be good, but without Bahk and Jenkins that’s going to be tough. Their defense should be good, but again with their players playing so well, they likely will have a few older players regress. It’s natural, again If they don’t it’s a top 10 unit.

I would say if there is a regression by GB, the NFCN schedule could play into the Vikings getting 12 wins.

Every year, teams go all in on FA overpaying to ensure that their franchise QB gets the “optimal talent” around them and every time the vast majority of these contracts are not only insane overpays but very damaging to the team moving forward. 

Look at the last 3 years, especially at WR. 

**2019**. Tyrell Williams 4 yr $43mil. Golden Tate, 4y $37mil. Adam Humphries 4y, $36mil. 

**2020**. Randall Cobb with Houston, 2y, $27mil. Emmanuel Sanders with NOLA, 2y $24mil. Robbie Anderson, 2y $20mil. 

**2021**. Kenny Golliday, 4y $72mil. Corey Davis, 3y $37mil. Nelson Agholor, 2y $22mil.

45247,287690,287690,lulzjihad,"**2. Do not — under any circumstances — fall in love**


Teams are almost never just one player away. It’s natural to look at one weakness from the previous season and convince yourself that if you address it you’re headed to the Super Bowl. But it’s rarely that simple. Players get older or injured, or their play declines. Coaching staffs experience turnover. Locker room dynamics change. Rivals improve.


This period on the NFL calendar can be intoxicating for general managers, owners and coaches. It feels like there are so many different ways to improve the roster. But it’s important to have an honest assessment of the state of your franchise before jumping into free agency or making a big trade.


And discipline matters. “Walk-away” numbers can help remove emotion and can keep impulses in check. The idea is to come up with pre-defined parameters for how far you’re willing to go to land a player — either in free agency or via trade. If the price goes beyond your pre-determined mark, move on.


It sounds so simple, but these are high-pressure environments, and every year we see teams act irrationally, fall in love and decide they have to have a specific player.

“We’ll adjust and we’ll keep adding players,” Poles said. “It’s out of your control. It’s just part of the deal where you put your best foot forward and we did. We came strong.

“There’s always work to be done. ... We’ve been in conversations with other people that are still out there, too. There’s always work to be done, especially up front, so we’ll keep at it.”

What the Bears haven’t done yet is identify a replacement for James Daniels, who left for the Pittsburgh Steelers in free agency, and they have yet to specify a plan at offensive tackle. Poles indicated the team could look at second-year players Teven Jenkins and Larry Borom at the tackle positions. He was noncommittal about which side they would play but this was more than he offered the last time he spoke at the scouting combine.
Part of the hesitation is fair. Personnel staff and coaches want to see players on grass. They want to work with them. But it’s also an indication of the serious level of need in the trenches.

“They will compete, but at the same time, we’re always looking to add talent as well,” Poles said of Borom and Jenkins. “If we add another tackle, I want to see all of those guys compete.",2.0,chibears,t3_tqkpc3,False,0.0,Smokin' Jay,2022-03-28T17:14:15Z,chibears,0.007032065888502
45254,287698,287698,lulzjihad,"Few of the nuggets are here, in case it’s behind a paywall:

“I know Teven was right in college, Larry was left in college, so there’s a comfort level there, but Teven played some left last year coming off his whole medical situation, so we’re going to play with that and we’ll see what the best fit is.”

Some around the league said they expect the Bears to pursue a veteran left tackle. Pickings are slim but there are more options to consider than last August when the team scrambled to sign Jason Peters.

Eric Fisher is available after spending last season with the Indianapolis Colts. Fisher returned after suffering a torn Achilles tendon at the end of 2020 with the Kansas City Chiefs, so he was working through that at the start of the season and later was hampered by a pectoral injury.

If the Bears sign Fisher or another veteran, it would create a situation in which Jenkins and Borom compete for the right tackle job. Maybe one could be bumped into right guard, presumably the spot Bates was going to play if the team landed him.

But Poles said he “can’t force something,” meaning he can’t add a player at that left tackle spot if there’s not a fit.

“Larry played in the SEC at left, I think he’ll be fine,” Poles said. 

“Teven played last year at left, he has room to grow. So they’ve done it. Yeah, sure, I would love to have experience but sometimes it’s just the way it all plays out.”

The Bears have two draft picks in Round 2 and one in Round 3, and that can be a fruitful area to find solid interior linemen. 

They’re unlikely to land a future left tackle there. Plus, the depth chart at wide receiver needs more work and there are multiple needs in the secondary at cornerback and safety.

In other words, Halas Hall remains a work in progress but Poles believes steps have been made to better support Fields.

“It’s a difficult challenge,” he said. “But I think as a whole with the scheme, with coaching, with some of the additions we’ve had, I think it’s going to get better. I think he’s going to be put in a situation where he’s going to be comfortable, and I’ve said this all the way back to the very beginning, allowing him to do what he does best is going to allow him to grow from that point.

No, this is incorrect. There are tons of regulations that ensure this doesn't happen. Some states require monthly notices to both insureds and claimants giving them an update on the status of claims. 

The reality is that some claims are black and white, it's either covered or not. If it's covered, it's paid right away. If it's not, it's denied right away. If it's a gray area, outside of health insurance (which I will never work for) most companies are erring on the side of paying.

It's called a ""contract of adhesion"".

It essentially means if there is a question of coverage, the insurance company must pay.

>Insurance companies aren’t a bank, they’re betting they will pay less than they collect in aggregate. Their WACC works like any other company. They have a meaningful financial incentive to fight to ensure any gray area falls in their favor, even when against the spirit of the policy.

Also it’s not like Arlington is a hub like Chicago is. There is a single Metra line that goes there but people will still have to travel and walk to like the Ogilvie station or whatever. As opposed to the multiple multiple public transit options for soldier field (also their plan is to build out transportation there).

50298,314730,314730,patrick_e,"> if you followed everything Poles had been saying, this is more or less what his plan was from the get go.

This is why I have confidence in Poles. Well, to an extent. He still has plenty to prove, but he clearly has a plan. Pace seemed to just get enamored with talent and sell the farm to get it. That was his plan--just fall in love in the draft, release the vets ahead so the rookies get all the snaps, rinse, repeat. 

So far, Poles seems to have a clear plan, like all good teams do. 

- rebuild the OL (we've seen that happen in the draft and via cheap free agent signings) 
- emphasize special teams (drafted VJJ and Ebner, both great returners. Testing Bojack on the return team) to steal some close wins 
- find the easiest place to rebuild and start there. There's some good talent in the front 7, but our secondary was terrible last year. Two second round picks later, our secondary has a lot more talent. 

So, he's building up defense and special teams. What are the strengths on offense? Montgomery and Herbert, plus one hell of an athlete at QB. What are the weaknesses? WR and pass blocking. If you implement a conservative, clock-chewing offense with lots of runs and play-action deep passes (playing to Fields's strengths) and have good play on D/ST? You're at least competitive in most games. 

Now, he still has to hit on the picks and signings. There's a lot that can still go wrong. But there are so many out of town stupid national pundits who see the lack of a big WR or LT signing and say, ""Wow, what are the Bears doing?"" 

I think it couldn't be more clear what they're doing, and the thing is he's pretty much told us what he was going to do...and then he's done it. Give Fields a simple offense that plays to his strengths, build his confidence, get a few more W's than you're supposed to, and then next year you have more picks and more $$ to continue to fix holes (specifically in the passing game).",22.0,chibears,t3_wa99b8,False,0.0,69,2022-07-28T09:55:29Z,chibears,0.0315880735804903

50317,314755,314755,patrick_e,"1. Nothing in your citation says Halas was responsible for the ban on black players. It’s literally just, “Well he probably had something to do with it.” The team has reckoned with that time, and discussed it in a book on team history (that’s pretty open). Halas was reasonably progressive for his day, but that’s obviously still pretty regressive for today’s standards. Erasing his initials doesn’t erase his history. It just makes it less likely to be reckoned with. It’s clear his daughter and his grandkids don’t stand with that ban, and as the article is very clear about, it’s murky at best where Halas himself stood. 
What we do know is that the Bears signed the first black QB in NFL history. We also know that the Bears have a black GM, a black assistant GM, had a black head coach (tied with Dungy for first in the SB) for 9 years, had the first black GM (…in fairness he never had the title, but had the position/authority from ‘93-96). The bears donate hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to racial equality causes. Not race, but they currently have a female scout in the scouting dept, something that’s not common. They’re literally reckoning with their past in real time. Maybe we should respect when people grow and learn and change? 

2. The units are beautiful, I have no idea what you’re taking about. They’re consistently rated highly in uniform rankings. It’s such a classic design. It’s an homage to the history of the Bears and their importance in the history of the league. Which, since we’re not very good, is at least something. 

3. Chicago will always struggle vs LA, NYC, and maybe some warmer climates. But that has everything to do with location and nothing to do with team policies. If you think three initials on a sleeve is the difference between being a good franchise and a mediocre one…yikes. I’m not sure what works you’re living in. The Bears have gotten key free agents when they’ve wanted to. Hell, the Redskins did, and they’ve been an overtly racist organization for decades. 

When it comes to original families (NYG, Ari Cards, Steelers and Bears) the Halas/McCaskey clan is at worst middle of the pack and at best on the progressive end (especially as time went on, which means a lot—Halas was willing to learn  and change). And the team now is really on a forward trajectory that embraces both the flaws of its past and also the possibility to be better moving forward.

Of course it’s easier to mask 20% of your OL being bad than it is masking 60%. But “a stable veteran presence” doesn’t necessarily do that (the one caveat being a Center, since they call protections, a veteran C with the same physical ability [or even slightly less talented] will add more to the line than a less experienced C). 

I think we’re in agreement that the Bears, in a vacuum, would be better off in 2022 with Peters. Where I think we start to differ is saying that having Peters (or some commensurate entity) on the line is the best move in the long-term. I don’t think anyone, including the front office, knows that yet, which is why he hasn’t been signed when he’s (at least IMO) clearly indicated interest. 

There’s a lot of young talent on the OL and unless you’ve been at every mini camp and OTA, and the FO conversations in-between, the truth is none of us really know how these guys are performing and how to feel a lot them.

had just gotten married the previous May so besides our honeymoon, traveling to Chicago from southeast Missouri was our first big trip to plan as a married couple.

we had a little Kia spectra car and i was worried if there was snow we wouldn’t make it, so we instead caught an overnight train from St. Louis to Chicago. Not too bad, boarded around 1am I think, dozed off, woke up in Chicago.

We stayed downtown, walked to the game, didn’t wear warm enough shoes, and watched from the nosebleeds.

i remember that a blocked PAT by us earlier in the game kept us from losing when Favre/Rice scored on the final drive of regulation. Robbie kicked an OT FG that most the stadium thought went in. then Hillenmeyer forced an AP fumble. Cutty came to the line in what seemed to be a run formation, called a check at the line, and threw a bomb on the first play to 19, ballgame.

We got to see him thrown in over his head in 2017 because of the Glennon debacle, and we got to see him fight hard to get better and be alright in year two despite the turmoil of changing systems. 

But right after that the entire relationship seemed to go to hell, all the reporting now seems to put it on the coaching staff, and a terrible environment for developing anyone, but particularly a QB who was basically a one-year guy at a second tier school and who didn't have that history to draw from when things were lacking.

57644,358531,358531,work4work4work4work4,"> There are MUCH stronger unions in the US than the NFLPA.

There sure are. That's why I said one of the strongest though, not the strongest or anything like that. It also doesn't change the fact that they are still one of the strongest unions in the US. 

Police associations are also a completely different animal and aren't even seen as representative of American labor unions these days. Much of the discussion at the upper echelons of labor is whether or not they should be expelled for the damage they do to the larger movement, or kept ""in house"" as a way to attempt to change and moderate them over time to stop acting outside the interest of other workers and the general public. This kind of sentiment isn't new though. If you go back to the beginnings of the American labor movement in the 19th century, you had police associations violently responding to most organized actions by any other labor groups then too.

But I digress, to get back to your initial ""question"" I mean strength in that you can rank the NFLPA as the weakest of the 4 major sports unions, and it's still stronger than the strongest non-sports unions in the US like NEA, SEIU, AFSCME, IBT, and others because of the way the laws in the US are written.

In a way both police unions and the NFLPA both enjoy the same kind of advantage of operating under a different legal framework than other unions and from that creating a unique leverage other groups do not have.

RG(Tev) is initially blocking the lowest rusher on the right side towards the outside as the RT is not engaged on anyone. 

RT continues not to engage to anyone, RG and Rusher both recover from the initial punch and RG continues his attempts to block to the outside. 

RT sees rusher coming loose to the outside of the RG into the space created by the RT not engaging anyone too late and is unable to do more than barely get one hand on a hip as the rusher exploded into the backfield.

RG tries to recover as it looks the back is going to chip before leaking out, but the back instead avoids contact.

QB sees the unblocked delayed pressure coming from the top and rolls out to the other side. RG tries to adjust and push the rusher out of the back of the play to the other side now and mostly succeeds.

Just remember the NFLPA is really just the collective opinion of the players, and the players as the key people out there earning the money are always going to want as much as they can. Agents just increase that not only from taking a generally fair share, but adding another party who needs to demonstrate success to keep their own job.  

2. The tough part of using Shaq or Warner's contract is they signed it in the only year the cap has ever went down since the cap has existed, and now the team isn't wanting to set the market meaning they are likely baking in some portion of that 12%-ish less from last year into the LB market. Additionally, both things we know to be in the contract (deescalators and excessive backloading) aren't realy featured in either Warner or Leonard's contracts which make it even more difficult.

Add to that clusterfuck that the closest comparable off-ball LB who signed a contract this year is a below average Foyesade Oluokun. Dude still got 28M guaranteed and 15M/AAV which is apparently around what Roquan's ""best"" offer from our team de-escalated to. That should make it easy to prove the market is much higher than what the Bears are offering right?

57763,358758,358758,work4work4work4work4,"This right here. If we look at what would qualify as record breaking, he could basically be record breaking in multiple areas and it still be a bad contract too.

Anything over 20M signing bonus would be record breaking for the position, and 99M+ total value would also be record breaking for the position.

Y5 30M  
Y4 22.5M  
Y3 16.9M  
Y2 12.7M  
Y1 9.5M  

+21M Signing = 112.6M Total Value 

Guarantee the money from the first two seasons too, and the contract would add a 3rd record for most guaranteed at signing at the position as well.

This hypothetical contract could still be a terrible deal for Roquan despite setting three different records, and one by almost 12M. He would not only be making less money the next few years, but almost 60% of the value, or nearly 70M, could be jettisoned just by cutting him before Y3, and accelerating the couple of years of signing bonus left(13M-ish). Even easier and almost as bad before Y4 where the cap hit is even less, and the savings are still nearly half.

That kind of contract would be so disrespectful to me if I was repping myself knowing full well they wouldn't be pulling that shit with an agent who could discourage their other players from considering them in the future.

About like car lots pulling out the 4 square when I think a more experienced GM would have just given him a 3 year deal with a sizeable signing bonus to take advantage of our cap room and make Roquan happy because of the immediate pay and the ability to get another prime contract out of us or someone else if he's as good as everyone thinks he is.

Make it a shorter year deal to enable another major contract for the player, guarantee most of the money, front-load as much money as possible, provide some form of trade protection, provide some form of franchise tag protection, UTBE incentives like First Team Pro Bowl, Division Winner, Super Bowl, etc. 

I don't see Roquan or Poles straight lying about the content of the contracts either, and between Roquan and Poles statement on the contract it really sounds like the Bears FO and Poles are trying to have their cake and eat it too, and that 19M a year offer was heavily backloaded, and only hit that still lesser number with escalators. 

If you're asking for 20+M, and that's the offer you get, it's not a serious offer as Roquan said.

The Bears want to lock up Roquan right now while they have plenty of cap space, the market is distorted from the COVID cap, and before Roquan has a chance to increase his production in the new defense. All smart ideas in my opinion, but it doesn't exactly seem to be leading to smart decisions.

At the same time Bears FO want a ""win"" contract for their first big re-sign, think they hold all the cards, and want to limit the teams exposure incase Roquan doesn't adjust well to the 4-3. Poles is trying to do it on the back of a popular star player without an agent and the brand new GM just doesn't have the experience to know what will actually get the deal done.

People seem to forget that at age 25 Roquan despite being a younger player only has 5-6 years left in his prime window generally so a 5 year contract would likely be his last major contract and has to be treated as such. 

As much as it sounds like a threat to lots of the fanbase right now to just make him wait it out, Roquan would much rather sit out as much as possible to avoid injury, play well in games even if he could have played better with more practice reps, and then get franchised next year taking the 18-19M guaranteed which is more than he's being offered for his one year salary next year anyway. Then he not only ends up with more two year money over that time, but also gets to hit the UFA market at 27 with a fresh new 260M cap number by current projections, and fresh positional versatility from switching to a 4-3 and doing well.

If I'm Quan, that's a real easy bet on myself since the only real thing being offered in that current contract that he doesn't have right now is guaranteed money for this year, and getting some money he's sure to get later barring catastrophic injury right now.",1.0,chibears,t3_womuvz,False,0.0,None,2022-08-15T04:13:04Z,chibears,-0.0103961478501005

Even if we say Poles has an obligation to offer some awful ass contract to try and take advantage of a player(I'd prefer my fav team to be above that personally) according to Roquan it's been multiple bad offers along the same lines with the same issues, and that's what finally caused him to go public because it's been happening for months. 

Even if you say Poles had the obligation to try some shit at least once, eventually you're just ruining the relationship with the player for no benefit, and the opinion of players of your team's organization once it goes public.

On the flip side even if you convince someone to take a really bad contract who is self-representing, usually that contract ends up with the agents of all players playing hard ball with those teams from word go, referencing the way they took advantage of player X previously. Contracts like that are almost always active negatives when it comes to FA pricing which is not something we want considering our amount of cap space next year.

It's just impossible for the numbers to work out as fair if you've got an obvious void year 25-30M$ salary in the final year of a deal and still aren't hitting 20M AAV.

Don't take my word for it, break out your own calculator and do the math. To hit 20M AAV on a 5 year deal you would need at least a 100M worth of money in the contract. There is a rule in the NFL that a player's salary can't increase by more than 25% each year too, so you can work backwards from an end number.

That's all while still being a terrible contract that would basically just be a less than 15M/AAV for the first three years, and with a team fourth year out with less than 9M in dead cap. Even if they don't use the 4th year out, Roquan would only be making about 22M which is the fair market value for the best ILB this year, not years from now when the cap is predicted to be close to 300M.

As good as guys like Jefferson/Thielen are, when your best case scenario is the incredibly streaky Covid Cousins and there is a decent chance of Mannion starting any given week, it starts to limit the ability to leverage that clear WR advantage.

Same is true for the Lions and Goff. Amon-Ra had a similar season to Mooney, and good for him, but Goff had enough other players getting open and just missing them or otherwise playing poorly as QB that I don't expect Williams to impact things like people seem to expect. For a bit of perspective, the Lions only scored about two TDs more than the Bears last year despite having a top OL. Did the Lions defense improve too? No doubt, but so did ours, and we were already like 50+ points better on differential despite our own obvious struggles.

To me the biggest question mark is if Rodgers QB talent is enough to keep the Packers offense competitive without top talent at receiver. The Packers D and RBs have looked improved lately, but as any Bears fan can tell you if your offense can't get it done in the air it quickly makes running that much harder, and 
then the lack of maintaining drives starts fucking over even the best defenses. 

Realistically, I'm probably there with you around 7-8 wins on the back of having some of the easiest match ups in the league this year, but NFC North is still one of the weakest divisions and the obviously best team in the division got very clearly worse. 

If Fields can actually take the clear step forward in his development we all want to see, and we saw flashes of in the first pre-season game, it's entirely possible Fields/Mooney is the best WR/QB connection in the division just because of the mismatch between WR/QB talent on the rest of the teams.

Additionally, the way contracts are structured these days means generally only a few years actually hit the top numbers fair and square, and out years are built in.

Using DL's contract as an example, despite you thinking it's not a good contract, his 2025 season has a nearly 5M roster bonus and only a 4M cap hit, and his 2026 season has zero dead money or guaranteed money, just a 19.7M base salary. Oh, and they have a 2024 out year with only an 8M cap hit.

Two: Absolutely, and that's why a smart GM would just include escalators based upon DL's production. Produce like DL, and you'll be paid more than him. Don't, and you'll be paid less. That's kind of the whole point.

The problem with the offers made to Roquan are they are similar to some of the other deals being offered out there (backloaded with void years and such) but the AAV is still lower even with that and other negative things like de-escalators.

Basic contract negotiation isn't that hard, if you're going to use void years and such to inflate AAV you better end up with an actually good AAV number.

Our RB room is better considering it's basically the same, except Ebner can actually get on the field.

Or OL is already improved considering the real difference beyond the draft at this point is Reily Reiff, Schofield, and Patrick vs Daniels and Wilkinson, and I'd definitely take the first three over the second two.

Now quite a bit of that has to do with the position and the player and the offense too. You'll often see quite a few tight ends in the ""lowest drop percentage"" lists each year because TE get a lot of high percentage balls.

Just to throw some numbers from last year, Deebo/Mooney/Jamarr Chase all had around 90ish catchable balls last year, and dropped around 10.

In response to this, the Bears activated Roquan off from the PUP list so that they can start to fine him for missing practices and preseason games to force Roquan’s hand. 

For some added context, the Bears initially put Roquan on the PUP list so that he would not be fined for missing practices and games while they worked out a contract extension, as players on the list can’t be fined by their team. It was sort of a good faith move by the Bears, which Roquan then spat on by going to Rapoport.",4.0,chibears,t3_wlbf3s,False,0.0,An Actual Peanut,2022-08-10T22:02:07Z,chibears,0.152909375
