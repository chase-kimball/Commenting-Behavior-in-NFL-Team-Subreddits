All these red flags and he's coming off a season that started 1-7 and only turned around thanks to a very easy stretch of games. Then it fell apart in a need to win December game...for the second season in a row.

Going purely by these measurement's, Mackey's long speed is non-existent. His explosiveness is bad, and his size ain't good. So, bad athlete, but he profiles basically the same as Needham in these areas, with a slower 40 and worse size. But you know what really stands out about him?

His 3-cone time is absolutely *elite.*

And that's the same thing you see with Needham, he's a poor overall athlete, but his short area agility is pretty good. This guy blows his 3-cone out of the water.

> I'd rather have Devonta Smith and a 2022 1st than Jaylen Waddle.

Good chance you'd have neither receiver without trading back into 6. Jamar Chase was was taken at 5. Without Miami trading up, Philly would pick at 6, where they likely would take Smith again(or Waddle).

Miami would still be sitting at 12. Philadelphia needed to trade up from 12 to 10 in order to draft Smith originally. They needed to jump the Giants, who, after Smith was drafted one spot ahead of them, immediately traded down. It's likely New York takes whoever is left between Waddle and Smith at 11. This leaves Miami empty handed at 12.

They could try the same trade with Dallas that Philly made, but:

- Miami might not be operating with the same knowledge Philly was, and might not be aware of New York's intention to take a WR, and thus not deem the jump necessary. It's an unknown.

- How much of that trade happened because Jones found it amusing to watch the Eagles fuck the Giants over? Would he still make the trade if it didn't involve inter-division shenanigans?",1.0,nfl,t3_ttsabs,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-04-01T11:55:18Z,miamidolphins,-0.000626951507189

You probably should.

2016:

- Tunsil, Great pick.

- Howard, Great pick.

- Drake, Good pick.

- Caroo, Bad pick.

- Grant, Good pick(This is weighted for being a 6th rounder).

- Lucas/Doughty/Duarte, ""Bad"" picks but also 6th and 7th rounders so you pretty much expect them to not actually work out

This was as good a draft as you can realistically hope for. Give it a B+.

2017:

- Harris, Bad pick.

- McMillan, Meh pick.

- Tankersly, Bad pick.

- Asiata, Bad pick.

- Godchaux, Good pick.

- Taylor, ""Bad"" pick, but a 6th rounder so who cares.

- Ford, Legendary pick.

This is Grier's worst draft, and one of only two bad ones for him. Give it a big F.

2018:

- Minkah, Great pick(remember, were grading the drafting here, not the later drama).

- Gesicki, Good pick.

- Baker, Good pick.

- Smythe, Good pick.

- Ballage, Bad pick.

- Armstrong/Poling, ""Bad"" picks, but again, 6th/7th rounders, failure is the expectation.

- Sanders, Good pick.

Another strong draft class. If Minkah wasn't shipped off for the Flores drama, we'd be gushing about this class. Another B+.

2019:

- Wilkins, Good pick.

- Dieter, Meh pick right now, if he can turn into our starting center(he showed flashes last year), it becomes a good pick.

- Van Ginkle, Good pick.

- Prince/Cox, ""Bad"" picks, 6th/7th rounders again.

- Gaskin, Good pick(this is weighted for being a 7th rounder).

Very ""meh"" draft dragged down by the Rosen trade. C grade, C+ if Dieter becomes a starter.

2020*:

- Tua, I'm not starting any arguments by grading this one.

- Jackson, Bad pick.

- Igbinoghene, Bad pick.

- Hunt, Good pick.

- Davis, Good pick.

- Jones, Good pick.

- Kindley, Bad pick.

- Strowbridge, Bad pick.

- Weaver, Bad pick.

- Ferguson, Meh pick.

- Malcolm Perry, ""Bad"" pick, but 7th rounder.

This draft class is marred by AJ and Noah, but we did get three starters and a long snapper from it. Missing on 2(possibly 3) 1st rounders is not something you want to see though. This is a D+ right now, but can easily jump to a much higher grade if Tua becomes a franchise QB in McDaniel's offense.

To note, this class and the next one are astrericked because I don't like to grade a player/pick before they have three years in the league. After their third year I'm comfortable grading the pick, but not before that.

2021*:

- Waddle, Great pick.

- Phillips, Good pick.

- Holland, Great pick.

- Eichenberg, Bad pick.

- Hunter Long, Bad pick.

- Doaks/Coleman, ""Bad"" picks, but 7th rounders.

Knocked this one out of the park. If the top 3 build on their rookie campaigns and if even just one of the other four picks develops into a viable starter this is a home run draft class. A for now A+ if we manage to get an average starting OT or TE out of it.

Roberts signed a 1 year, $3.25m deal. Offset by ~$800k

$12.15m left.

Trent Sherfield signed a vet minimum $920k contract. There's a chance he isn't even in the top-51 contracts. Even if he is, his effective cap cost after the offset will be less than $100k.

$12.05m left.

Redwine's contract details are a mystery, but it's a one year deal for probably close to minimum. Let's be generous to your argument hear and say after the offset he costs us $1.05m to get our numbers clean.

$11m left.

Connor Williams is also a mystery, but his deal is 2 years $14m, so let's just take the APY of $7m, even though his 2022 his will likely be lower than that. Estimate an $800k offset again.

$4.8m left.

But again, I'm just guessing.

In all reality, Miami probably frees up more money than I proposed here with roster cuts of guys like Cethan Carter, Adam Butler, and Adam Shaheen, as well as being more creative than I was with Howard's contract(give him a fat new signing bonus instead of a fat salary and maybe add a void year or two to his contract) to lower his cap hit, but this is all just spitballing. And every one of those cuts need to be replaced by a new player, who may or may not end up being a downgrade.",6.0,miamidolphins,t3_td4xxs,False,0.0,:CW91:,2022-03-13T10:55:22Z,miamidolphins,-0.0337936
2562,10334,10334,AgelessJohnDenney,"**EDIT: I fucked up in a couple spots here, so I'm going to put slashes through the original numbers, replace them with correct ones, and put a note wherever the fuckup happened.**

So right now Miami has $48m in available cap.

Let's be a little conservative and say that the only relevant cuts that will happen to free up more space are Hurns and Davis.

That brings Miami's available space to ~~$54.2m~~ $52.7m(**EDIT:** I didn't account for the offset of bringing two minimum salaries into the top 51 to replace the two cuts, so lower this number, and every total after this, by like $1.5m). Now let's subtract Cidolfus's estimate of $7.5m to sign our PS and rookie pool from that. ~~$46.7m~~ $45.2m is left to play around with.

Collins is $10m right off the bat. Trading for him will take at least one rookie out of our pool and Collins' salary will be marginally offset by kicking someone out of the Top 51. I don't feel like doing the exact numbers, so let's just call it an even $2m offset. So $8m for Collins.

~~$38.7m~~ $37.2m left.

Armstead won't likely hit for $23m in year one of his deal, so let's be generous here and take $10m off it to make it an even $13m cap hit, then account for an ~$800k offset for $12.2m.

~~$26.5m~~ $25m left.

Now Jensen is a complete unknown for what his value is going to be. I'm just gonna use JC Tretter's contract with the Browns and call it a day($10.85m/yr). Tretter's year one cap hit was $8.875m, so lets take that decimal out for the offset and call it an even $8m.

So, after signing just 3 players, we're left with ~~$18.5m~~ $17m in cap space.

Now we also know that Howard wants a rework of his deal. Grier *could* get creative here to raise his pay but lower his cap hit, but let's say he doesn't and just straight up gives him a raise. We know being paid less than Byron rubbed him the wrong way and that he wants to be paid closer to the top of the market. So let's jump him over Byron and push him into the top 5, over Darius Slay, and say we pay him $17m. That's a ~~$3.5m~~ $4m pay bump(**EDIT** Just straight up wrote the wrong number).

So we're down to ~~$15m~~ $13m with 56 players on the roster. 

Grier likes to leave extra cap space going into the season for in-season moves and trades, so in all reality, he's not gonna let the cap drip too far under $10-15m, so if you want those 3 linemen, that's basically all we can do in FA. Just bringing back Mack Hollins and Elandon Roberts will basically bring you to $10m. So other than that you're bringing in rookies and scrubs. Hope you weren't looking for a halfway decent backup QB.

For the team, the risk comes if you need to move on from that player in the near future.

Say a 30 year old player has the current season and 2 more years left on his deal and is getting a salary of $26m this year, and none of his future salaries are guaranteed. To save some cap, the team might restructure his contract and convert $25m of his contract into a signing bonus, whilst adding 2 void years to the end of his contract. So that $25m gets spread out through 5 years and becomes $5m/yr. Now his cap hit is decreased by $20m($26m becomes $6m) this season and increased by $5m over the next 4(really $5m/yr over the next two and $10m in the third because of how void years work).

Now, this is fine if his level of play stays the same...but what happen if he suddenly drops off a cliff this year as older players do sometimes? Originally his salary for next year would be non-guaranteed and you could move on with no issue...but if you try to do that now, all of those future cap hits accelerate into the season you cut him and suddenly he has $20m in dead money that didn't exist before.

2579,10355,10355,AgelessJohnDenney,"This...isn't really accurate. You're right that Miami(and everyone else) rarely use traditional 4-3 or 3-4 ""base"" alignments anymore, but calling Ogbah a 3-4 DE or Landry a 3-4 OLB is still off. They're both just edge rushers. They will line up in whatever position puts them on the edge, whether you wanna call that an OLB in a 3 man front or a DE in a 4 man front.

For example, [here's](https://youtu.be/Uop-ohsXsrs) every sack from Ogbah in 2020. 

- Sack 1: DE in a 4 man front(9-tech), 2-point stance.

- Sack 2: DE in a 4 man front(7-tech), 3-point stance.

- Sack 3: DE in a 3 man front(7-tech), 3-point stance(how Baker lines up makes this more of a 4 man front, but there's technically only 3 down linemen, so...)

- Sack 4: Weird front. One IDL as the 4i tech, a standup linebacker as the other 4i tech, and then 2 edge defenders as 7 techs, Ogbah in a 3-point stance and Baker in a 2 point stance.

- Sack 5: DE in a 3 man front(5-tech), 3 point stance.

- Sack 6: One, two, three...8 man front, Ogbah's the 4-tech, 3-point stance

- Sack 7: Another all-out blitz, Ogbah's the 7-tech, 3-point stance

- Sack 8: Another all-out blitz, Ogbah's the 7-tech, 3-point stance.

- Sack 9: 4 man front(9-tech), 3 point stance.

- Sack 10: 3 man front(5-tech)

This is a pretty good distillation of what Ogbah does. He's, usually playing 7-tech in a 3-point stance. Traditionally, that's a 4-3 DE. Traditionally, a 3-4 DE would be playing 5, 4, or 4i tech in a three point stance, which Ogbah will occasionally move to. The traditional 3-4 OLB would be the 7 or 9-tech and usually in a 2-point stance, which you'll rarely see from Ogbah, but it'll happen occasionally.

Landry does essentially the same thing for the Titans, he lines up as either the 7 or 9-tech and rushes from both 2 and 3-point stances, no matter the front. He doesn't reduce to the 5-tech as much as Ogbah does, and he uses a 2-point stance more often, but their jobs are the same.",9.0,miamidolphins,t3_t9v8l9,False,0.0,:CW91:,2022-03-08T19:40:49Z,miamidolphins,-5.135115318766477e-05

6314,46213,46213,Cidolfus,"I mean, the scheme fits the rest of our roster's strengths. The scheme uses a lot of pre-snap motion and creative run schemes to make defenses second guess and also relies heavily on speed to create separation and maximize yards after the catch. Basically all of our offensive personnel excepting Gesicki aligns exactly with that.

Gesicki is the odd man out. When this was being discussed in the Dolphins subreddit back in January, there was a lot of people saying that you basically have to consider his value as a wide receiver because he's so bad at blocking. [The problem is, when you stack him up against other wide receivers, he's not that great.](https://www.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/rttgj7/mike_gesicki/hqwciua/)

I think Gesicki is talented and can definitely excel in the right system. A team that needs a dedicated, big-bodied receiving threat could make great use of Gesicki. I feel like he'd be a nightmare to play against if he had Aaron Rodgers throwing to him.

The reality for the Dolphins is that we have the opportunity to build a passing offense around Waddle and Hill who are both extremely fast, generate a ton of separation, and get chunk yards after the catch. Meanwhile, Gesicki is literally bottom three among high volume receivers in the NFL at generating separation, isn't particularly fast, and is also among the worst blocking tight ends in the league. Given the choice of what talent we're going to build our scheme around, Gesicki isn't that guy.",22.0,nfl,t3_wwignb,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-08-24T09:53:40Z,miamidolphins,0.0299145081855213
6315,46214,46214,Cidolfus,"That's how he's been used for the past several seasons. Over half of his snaps the past three seasons have been from the slot. The problem with that now?

- Half of Jaylen Waddle's 2021 snaps were from the slot.
- Throughout his career, Hill's gone from about 30% of his snaps being out of the slot to half of his snaps out of the slot over the past two years.
- Nearly half of Cedrick Wilson's 2020 snaps came out of the slot and more than three quarters of his 2021 snaps were out of the slot.

The reality is that we've got *plenty* of talent who are productive from the slot and only so many snaps to go around. As a tight end, Gesicki needs to bring something else to the table (blocking) to justify taking that position over the wide receiving talent we have in those roles.

Last year, Cedric Wilson had 77% of Gesicki's receiving yards and  three times as many touchdowns on 45 (42%) fewer snaps. I don't know why we'd displace Wilson (who's also cheaper) for Gesicki if Gesicki isn't going to block.

6324,46249,46249,Cidolfus,"That's fair, but I think it depends what you're trying to look at. There's a huge difference between the way deals are reported and the reality of what the player will actually earn, and Kelce's contract is a great example of that. It's reported as a four-year deal worth $57 million in new money, but the reality is that if he'd had a career-ending injury last year at the end of his original extension, he would have only ever realized $7 million of that $57 million.

> Right now, you're essentially just taking the highest two years of the contract and saying that's what they're getting paid, which doesn't make any sense.

That's not at all what I'm doing. I'm observing the break point in the contract at which it becomes a net gain in terms of cap space to cut the player rather than keep them (i.e. the team's ""out"") and calculating total cash earned before that point. It's not the ""highest two years""; in fact, in most cases, it's the lowest individual years in terms of cap charge because the deals are backloaded with unguaranteed money. Because I'm looking at cash flow, though, that includes the full signing bonus (if it exists), which is pushing many of the deals over the 50% mark in the first couple of years.

Kelce's lack of signing bonus is the major reason why his deal is so bad. They advertise the deal as a four-year $57 million extension with $22.75 million guaranteed, but $15.75 million of those guarantees are for money from the previous contract. It sounds like he got about 40% of the new money guaranteed, but in reality it's only the $7 million roster bonus for just more than 12%. The Chiefs have all the leverage to move on whenever they're ready (which, given Kelce's age, isn't great for him if he starts to fall off at all). Obviously he's still producing at a high level, so he's doing well enough.

If we're trying to determine value of a contract based on how much earnings security it provides, the latter years don't matter because they'd already earned it and the pre-extension year doesn't matter because it's fully-guaranteed for veterans the second they make the 53-man roster. That's what the post I was originally responding to was talking about, after all: that latter years are bloated, un-guaranteed base salary that skew APY upward and don't really matter. I was just pointing out that comparing gross guaranteed money in a four-year extension to guaranteed money in a two-year extension is a very different conversation and tried to provide a more level point-of-comparison.",1.0,nfl,t3_w87gxm,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-07-26T11:30:29Z,miamidolphins,-0.0281814788496768
6325,46250,46250,Cidolfus,"That's intentional. 2021 was the last year of Andrews's previous contract. The four-year contract extension added years 2022-2025. So while technically the signing bonus was paid out in 2021 (and a pro-rated portion hit the 2021 cap), I'm looking at this specifically from the perspective of new money earned in the new years of the contract.

So, by the end of the second new year of Andrews' extension, he will have earned nearly $37 million of his $56 million deal or 65.5% which is really, really good. That's another good metric to consider with these figures, and I'll amend the original post to include it.

6327,46252,46252,Cidolfus,"Even looking at the guarantees in a vacuum is misleading, though. Compare how much cash they're making before the team has an out to cut them. When you look at it from a cash flow per year of the new contract played before the team can cut them, it's a lot less favorable to the tight ends.

Player | Cash Earned Before Out | New Years | Cash/Year | % Earned Before Out

Kelce|$7,000,000|0|N/A?|12.2%

Anderson|$21,000,000*|1|$21,000,000|71.2%

Andrews|$36,663,055|2|$18,331,528|65.5%

*The figures for Anderson's contract on both Spotrac and OTC don't quite add up. I don't have the premium membership and can't verify, but they disagree on the signing bonus figure and other bonuses complicate things. This $21 million figure is calculated from the low-end estimates where he earns an $8,000,000 signing bonus, $200,000 in workout bonuses, $11,765,000 of restructured 2022 base salary, and the $1,035,000 remaining base salary. Spotrac reported a higher signing bonus, but that pushes his total extension value well over their reported $29.5 million, which both sites agree on.

Kelce was the strangest of the bunch because he signed his extension to add years 2022-2025 when he was still under contract for 2020 and 2021 from his previous extension. None of the base salaries in his new years were actually guaranteed, and only $7 million of the new money (the 2021 roster bonus which has been restructured) on the contract was ever guaranteed. The 49ers technically had an out this season when they could have outright cut Kelce and saved just over $1 million against the cap. His whole contract effectively existed to guarantee the base salaries of the final two years of his last extension and throw him a $7 million bone in the last year of his deal and then just tacked on four non-guaranteed years for good measure.

It looks to me like Anderson and Sutton are coming out ahead like Sharp suggested and Andrews (since you mentioned him) made out best of them all.",12.0,nfl,t3_w87gxm,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-07-26T00:49:11Z,miamidolphins,0.0762092910667557

The spending disparity between the two is stark: we dumped nearly six times the guaranteed cap commitment and a boatload of draft picks into receivers. That's without even considering the money we spent to retain *both* Mike Gesicki and Durham Smythe (Miami's second- and fifth-most targeted receivers in 2021). While we brought a lot of new faces into the backfield, only Chase Edmonds (14th) is in the top 30 highest-paid running backs (Mostert is next at 34th). While Ingold is the fourth-highest paid fullback in the league, that's hardly a point of distinction given how rare fullbacks are. Importantly, the Dolphins haven't committed to any of these backs beyond the 2022 season. There's only $600,000 of dead money on Edmonds's contract in 2023; Ingold's has only $750,000.

Teams ran an average of 1077 offensive plays last season. If we throw the ball at the same rate as the 49ers did last year, that would suggest 563 passing attempts. Only six teams finished with 563 or fewer passing attempts last year: New England, Indianapolis, San Francisco, New Orleans, Seattle, and Philadelphia. On average, teams passed on 57.9% of plays (624 attempts) last season. I'm just not sure how a team whose top three receivers combined for 411 receptions in 2021 drops off *that* much, and if we do we're spending way too much money for *someone*.",4.0,nfl,t3_w7skq6,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-07-25T15:50:50Z,miamidolphins,-0.0017107543530131

Technically not true.

6344,46323,46323,Cidolfus,"Theoretically, there's no limit to the amount of money that could be rolled over if a team is determined to do it over time. The 89% salary cap floor is calculated based on the official salary cap, not the team's salary cap (which includes cap and rollover). That means that when a team saves money against a cap and rolls it over into following years, that rolled over money *does not count towards what they need to spend on the floor*.

So, for example, the total salary cap from 2013 to 2016 (the first of two defined periods in the previous CBA) was $555.15 million and teams were required to spend a minimum of about $494.1 million. If a team had been really cheap and spend exactly that minimum, that means they could have rolled over a maximum of $61.05 million into 2017.

From the second period (2017 through 2020), the total cap was $730.6 million and the floor was about $650.2 over the same period. The extra $61.05 million they'd rolled over collectively from 2013 to 2016 doesn't matter. The team could keep rolling that over as well as the additional $80.4 million.

Theoretically, a team then could have $141.45 million in total rollover available from 2013 through 2020 and have been completely compliant with the salary cap floor for all those years while also having a team available salary cap in 2021 of $323.95 million (the highest actual team cap in 2021 with rollover was the New York Jets with just shy of $206 million).

$15 million APY would put Ogbah at 16th among current contracts. Carl Lawson and Trey Hendrickson got $15 million per year just last year. Hendrickson exploded this year, but he'd been a rotational guy at best in NO for three seasons before playing big in a contract year. Carl Lawson had 10 sacks his rookie season, but he was also a rotational guy for most of his career and had a lot of pressures in his contract year.

Ogbah is coming off of back-to-back double-digit sack and 60+ pressure seasons and a 27-pressure, 6-sack season in only 10 games the year before. Neither Hendrickson nor Lawson had a stretch like that before signing their big deals. I'd be stunned if signed as cheaply as you suggest.

T.J. Watt is making $28 million, and he's one of three edge rushers making $25 million or more per year and two of those three have at least half of their contracts fully guaranteed. Von Miller is making $19 million right now. At 33, he's got age working against him, but given the way that the market has gone, is $20 million so inconceivable? Gregory has his own history issues, and Clowney's historically failed to put up gaudy sack numbers that elevate contracts, but I'd expect all of them to sign for at least $17 million APY on a long-term deal unless they're taking pay cuts to compete somewhere.

19578,160118,160118,Roctopuss,"Let's explain this in elementary terms. OK, boys and girls. 1+1=2. Yellow and blue make green, boys and girls. And when a talented quarterback doesn't do what people anticipated, then there are reasons. But in today's modern culture, people's video game and fantasy football fandom think the word ""reasons"" means ""excuses."" But they are not the same. Are we following boys and girls?  
  
Now, boys and girls, let's begin with the basics. Have we heard anyone besides media and fans say this is a make-or-break year for Tua besides the media? Of course, you haven't. That is that clouded judgment that fandom has blinded boys and girls with. Nobody has heard anyone in the Dolphins organization say that. It's all speculative, boys and girls.  
  
Now boys and girls, for why his play hasn't been good enough is that there are reasons. They are called reasons, not excuses boys and girls. The average football fan doesn't watch every second of every game played for a single team. Most fans will catch highlights of games. Now boys and girls, for those fans catching YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook highlights of Tua, we live in an easily manipulated by media generation. And when two or three bad plays are constantly showed in multiple videos on multiple platforms, manipulation of the mind plays into thinking that those 2 or 3 bad plays must be why Tua hasn't been good enough. So that is the type of QB he is. But boys and girls, what the media doesn't show you, those that despise Tua, the trolls from the Jets, the Bills, and the trolls that have infiltrated the Dolphins fanbase, is that you have just seen videos from only 16.3% of bad throws Tua made in 2021. That is a real stat. They have intentionally refused to show you the other 83.7% of good throws he made that shows exactly how good he is.  
  
Now, boys and girls, there are the trolls that say if Tua can't throw in anything but clean pockets he's not good...as they are referring to Tua being the best QB in clean pockets. Well, boys and girls, Tua had the worst pocket time in the NFL averaging only 2.1 seconds behind the worst o-line in the NFL, and he still was the 7th most accurate quarterback in the NFL. And boys and girls, for those ""well it's because he only threw 5-yard passes"" crowd, no boys and girls, even screen passes break down on collapsed pockets. You see, the trolling part comes from the education about football from a pamphlet instructing people how to play a John Madden video game. And that is where the extant of football knowledge comes from for those saying that Tua must have clean pockets to be good, boys and girls. See, context is everything boys and girls.  
  
Now, boys and girls, do we honestly believe that Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert played for a coach that allowed Deshaun Watson rumors to continue all year without stopping it because that coach never wanted them in the first place? Do we really believe Herbert and Burrow were recovering from a major hip injury? No, Burrow's injury wasn't the same, boys and girls. Now do we think that Tua had receivers and running backs like Austin Ekeler, Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, Joe Mixon, Ja'Marr Chase, and Tee Higgins? Do you think Burrow led the league in getting sacked because he had a bad o-line like Tua? But, the real answer is, Tua had the worst o-line in the NFL and was the least sacked QB, boys and girls.  
  
Did Burrow and Herbert's offensive coaches draw up playbooks that was only designed to throw to one receiver and didn't have plays designed to throw downfield?  
  
Now what has Tua showed us in the last two years that he can't be the guy, boys and girls?  
  
What did we learn here, children? Wait, why am I addressing adults like children, again? Oh, I remember. It's because when it comes to Tua, it appears that most of the knowledge about the game of football is from the mind of an elementary school child, because they haven't gotten past what fake football is and what reality footballl is.

However, that is exactly why I prefer to invest (early-ish and) often in OL in the hopes of avoiding the OL letdown or at least being able to mitigate the damage should it happen.

OL are just more of a long-term investment since a significant part of the position relies on chemistry within the unit which certainly incentivizes getting them in sooner than later to start the clock on that.

Above was in general terms however I also think it fits our specific team situation (along with the NFL landscape in general). You can almost always find a RB either on the street (Duke Johnson/Phillip Lindsay last season alone) or for cheap and just plug & play from the jump with success. Now, we have Edmunds and Mostert already locked in plus a few options that were on the team last year still available.

Just my 2 cents, but I don't think teams would even hold it against Baker if he had to do something like that to force himself out of that toxic situation. It would be understandable for him to want out given the way things have played out and now with them posturing to have him serve as one 2 backups going into the final year of his contract. 

I'm not even 100% sure they would even play Baker over Jacoby at this point. Imagine Baker balls out and the fans are chanting his name while you are on the hook for $230m to Watson. Sure that scenario would increase Baker's perceived value, but that's not even the main obstacle here which is the Browns have 0 leverage.

AFC Seeds

1.Buffalo (13-4). Finishing 6-0 in the AFC East makes all the difference when so many contenders have tough division slates.

2. Baltimore (11-6). Decimated by injury in 2021, fairly healthy in 2022‚Äîincluding at quarterback. Important in Joe Burrow‚Äôs division.

3. LA Chargers (11-6). Accomplishment of the year: Chargers going 4-2 in the toughest division since the 2002 realignment into eight divisions.

4. Tennessee (10-7). Slight nod over the Colts, by virtue of the Titans averaging 35 a game against Indy in their last three meetings, all wins.

5. Kansas City (11-6). It‚Äôs almost pick-‚Äòem with the Chargers, because I think the passing game will be fine post-Tyreek.

6. Cincinnati (10-7). The first-place schedule brings Cincinnati down to earth a bit, but the Bengals will be a threat still.

7. Miami (9-8)*. TuAnon, rejoice. It‚Äôs not just Tyreek Hill who‚Äôll make over this offense. It‚Äôs Chase Edmonds rushing for 1,200 yards.

*Tiebreaker: Miami over Indianapolis (9-8) and Las Vegas (9-8).

Tua hasn't made the playoffs despite having two win and in situations in his first two seasons.

You try not to get ahead of yourself because you want to put them out there with their teammates when they're ready. So every day we're evaluating Trey. And Bobby Turner does not let him slip an inch if he's wrong on a track or whatever. He's getting coached up and if he's doing well, we try to give him more opportunities and continue that momentum.‚Äù

>‚ÄúReally like his vision, he's a big dude that has good cutting ability, rare cutting ability for a guy that size and I really like him as a human being,"" McDaniel added. ""The way he approaches professional football as a professional, he's working on his craft day in, day out. And his goal is the same as ours. We want the final product to be as good as it can be and the only way you do that is if you're always hungry for him to get better and better and coach him up and see how good he can get.‚Äù

33704,249159,249159,goodbiforever,"# 2021 Draft Selections (expanded) 

**Jaylen Waddle, WR, Alabama** 

Like many fans, the selection of Jaylen Waddle initially surprised me; I was almost certain that Miami would opt for Heisman winner DeVonte Smith, Waddle's teammate and one of Tua's former top targets. Or, if not Smith, then the Dolphins would instead select Oregon tackle Penei Sewell, considered the best lineman in the draft and a fool-proof choice for an offensive line as weak as Miami's. Fortunately, any skepticism I had about Waddle has since disappeared on the tails of Waddle's record-breaking season. He's proven his ability to open up a formerly anemic offense and shown remarkable chemistry with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Waddle now holds the all-time rookie reception record with 104 and ended the season with seven total touchdowns, 1,015 receiving yards, and one of the best TD celebrations in the league.

**Jaelan Phillips, DE, Miami** 

Another somewhat surprising, but ultimately rewarding selection. Just like Waddle, Phillips produced a record-breaking rookie season, now possessing the Dolphins' rookie sack record and finishing only behind Micah Parsons in rookie sack numbers on the year with 8.5. Even when he did not make it to the quarterback, he was an immensely disruptive player against opposing offenses. Any concerns about his injury history or his brief retirement from football while still in college have been put to rest. 

**Jevon Holland, S, Oregen**

On the heels of longtime safety Bobby McCain's departure from the team, Jevon Holland could not have come at a better time, nor could he have made a bigger entrance. Holland ended the season with an 84.7 grade from PFF, recording three sacks, two interceptions, and one forced fumble. At just 22-years-old, Holland has the makings of a longtime anchor of the defense and a true franchise player. 

**Liam Eichenberg, T, Notre Dame** 

Liam Eichenberg had a rough start to the season. There's no sugarcoating it. But there is a silver-lining; his performance in the latter half of the season improved every game. He gave up just one pressure against the Jets in  a Week 15 matchup and showed flashes at both tackle and guard. Unfortunately for Eichenberg, the constant shuffling to different positions on the line did his development no favors, but hopefully a new coaching scheme and more experience in the offensive staff will make the most of his talent. I still think he has starter or very high-end backup potential. 

**Hunter Long, TE, Boston College** 

Looking back with the gift of hindsight, this pick feels bizarre. Chris Grier's (or Flores's?) thought process on selecting Long is still unclear. Was he looking for another big player to block in the passing game? Insurance for the possible departure of starting TE Mike Gesicki? A camp body with high upside? Considering the fact that Long was a healthy scratch for most of the season, and Mike Gesicki has just received the franchise tag, virtually none of these questions have been answered. The recent re-signing of TE Durham Smythe makes Long's future even more confusing. Surprisingly, Long appeared in seven games this season, though he only recorded one reception for eight yards. 

**Larnel Coleman, T, UMass Amherst** 

A huge project tackle with high upside, Coleman has great size but lacks polish. He was placed on IR in August and never saw the field. Whether he will become a starter or even a reliable backup remains to be seen, but new coach Mike McDaniel has background as an O-Line coach and loves big bodies on the line, so Coleman may see much more action in 2022. 

**Gerrid Doaks, RB, Cincinnati** 

Doaks, who enjoyed an impressive career at the University of Cincinnati, has spent most of the year on the practice squad and has yet to see the field in the regular season. The Dolphins recently signed him to a futures contract, however, signaling their belief that he can be a solid contributor to the offense in the future.",10.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:56:02Z,miamidolphins,-0.0024402346469532
33705,249160,249160,goodbiforever,"# Notable Free Agent Acquisitions (expanded)

**Will Fuller V - WR - Houston Texans** 

Look away, Dolphins fans. Remember how excited we were? Finally, some real weapons for Tua. Oh, how wrong we were in. Looking back, I guess we were all fools to think that an incredibly injury-prone receiver could walk into our incredibly injury-prone receivers room and not become incredibly injured, incredibly quickly. But come on---two games? Four receptions? 26 yards? For ten million dollars. Fuller also disappeared from the team for long stretches of the season, and because Brian Flores is Brian Flores, he gave only cryptic non-answers about Fuller's absence whenever he was asked about it. Suffice it to say that I'd be shocked if Miami signed him to another deal. The Dolphins have made some truly egregious free agency mistakes in my time, but this one will go down as one of the worst. 

**Jacoby Brissett - QB - Indianapolis Colts** 

Another signing we couldn't have been more wrong about. I can't speak for every Dolphins fan, but my impression of the Brissett signing was positive; I thought that he was a high-level backup, but not good enough to spark another year of quarterback controversy. Colts fans also lauded him as a high-character addition to the locker room and a smart player. And then he started some games while Tua was on IR with broken ribs. And then he lost every single one of them. If I never see Jacoby throw another pass into the dirt five yards from his receiver's feet, it'll be too soon. Also, judging by the fit he threw on the sidelines of the Ravens game after being benched for an injured Tua, I'm not even sure he's as much of a team player as advertised. 

**Duke Johnson - RB - UFA** 

Duke was a last resort signing after the entire Dolphins RB room went on the COVID list, and for once, this worked out great for everyone. Johnson became the Dolphins first 100-yard rusher all season and was good for three TDs in his limited apperances. A true hometown hero, Duke grew up just a few miles from Hard Rock Stadium and played there in college with the Miami Hurricanes. He posted a second 100-yard game against the Patriots in the season finale and will likely have more suitors as teams continue to fill out their rosters over the coming weeks.

 **Jason McCourty - CB - New England Patriots** 

Former Patriot? Defensive back? Yeah, this signing had Brian Flores written all over it. McCourty played only a few games before being placed on IR in October. His one-year deal now up, expect him to go back to New England or maybe end up on a contender later in the year. With the development of young players like Nik Needham, Jevon Holland, and Brandon Jones, it feels like the Dolphins' need for a player like McCourty has somewhat diminished.",8.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:52:19Z,miamidolphins,0.0263010429953827
33706,249161,249161,goodbiforever,"# Notable Free Agency Departures (expanded)

**Ryan Fitzpatrick - QB - Washington Football Team** 

Goodbye, sweet prince. Dolphins fans will forever cherish him for the Fitzmagic and forgive him for the Fitztragic. Noted Harvard graduate and NFL journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick delivered real excitement and charisma to the QB position, something that Miami has been lacking since, I don't know, Chad Pennington? Fitz and his gunslinger attitude ignited a Stone Age offense and gave us some of the greatest highlights ever, particularly the Braille Mary. I would have loved to keep him as a backup for the rest of his illustrious career, but Fitz had aspirations of starting, and the Dolphins have what they hope will be their franchise quarterback in young  Tua Tagovailoa. Despite the good times, Fitzpatrick unfortunately played a role in the exhausting quarterback circus of 2020, stirring media controversy when he knew full well that Miami had signed him as a stop-gap QB while Tua developed. Fitzpatrick would move on to Washington, where he suffered a (water-slide related?) hip injury and has not played since. In with a bang, gone with a whisper. 

**Kyle Van Noy - ILB - New England Patriots** 

Another controversial departure. Despite having been signed to a four-year contract, Kyle Van Noy was released by the Dolphins after just one season and he was not happy about it. It seemed like a strange grudge back then, but now, in light of reports that Flores is far from a daisy to work for, perhaps Van Noy was truly the wronged party in this bizarre roster move. In any case, Kyle quickly returned home to New England. 

**Bobby McCain - S - Washington Football Team** 

McCain was one of the last dominoes to fall in the complete overhaul of the Dolphins roster since the Gase days. He was a pillar of the defense and highly graded, but with the drafting of his young, talented replacement Jevon Holland, this move made sense. Nonetheless, we'll remember him as one of the few consistent players of the 2010s Dolphins. McCain followed QB Ryan Fitzpatrick to Washington after his release. 

**Matt Haack - P - Buffalo Bills** 

The Dolphins let special teams god Haack walk in free agency. While he was a good but not elite punter, we'll always appreciate him for being a trick play king. Anyone remember the Mountaineer Shot?",7.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:50:17Z,miamidolphins,0.0021180607941694

**Tua Tagovailoa**: Tua moved into 9th place on the team's all-time yards list (4467) and is one mediocre year (2647 yards) from moving all the way to 5th place, passing Chad Henne (7114). When it comes to completion percentage, Tua is the man, ranking 2nd for Dolphins QBs with more than 20 starts behind only Chad Pennington (67.6%). Being behind Chad Pennington is not a bad thing, as he has always been considered one of the most accurate passers in league history. Not to mention being a staggering 6.8% better than Dan ‚Äòthe man‚Äô Marino. For being 9th in yards and 8th in completions, Tua does fall behind a little, being 10th in TDs. But no need to worry, Tua gets it done on the ground much better, have 6 TD‚Äôs in his 2 years on the ground vs career numbers of 11 for Jay Fielder, 9 for David Woodley, 9 for Dan Marino, 6 for Ryan Fitzpatrick, 6 for Ryan Tannehill, 2 for Chad Henne and 2 for Matt Moore.

**Jaylen Waddle**: Most receptions by a rookie ever with 104. Posted a 1000 yard season, becoming the first Miami rookie to ever do that (though Duper didn‚Äôt play his rookie year at all, he did post 1000 yards in his 2nd year). Waddle also gave us the most first downs this year with 59.

**DeVante Parker**: Moved into 8th overall receptions and 6th overall yards. Parker is now in a three-way tie for 8th overall receiving TDs with Anthony Fasano and Kenny Stills.    '

**Jason Sanders**: In four short years he has made it to 8th all-time scorer in Dolphins history, 10 points behind Nat Moore for 7th, and is at the exact same 6.8 PPG as the Dolphins all-time leader Olindo Mare. He is now in a three-way tie (Olindo Mare / Pete Stoyanovich) for the most 50+ FG‚Äôs made (14).

**Mike Gesicki**: His 73 receptions were the most for a Miami TE since Randy McMichael posted 73 receptions in 2004. No statistical proof, but probably the worst hurdles of the year as well as the most one-handed grabs (in the league) this year.",14.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:48:20Z,miamidolphins,-0.0453866665347312

 The Dolphins were again a running by committee team. Six different players ran for over 100 yards for the year, with Myles Gaskin leading the charge with 612 yards. Duke Johnson got his hands into the mix late and ended up with 330 yards for the year, with two 100-yard games. The Dolphins active roster had just three total 100-yard rushing games by active players (the third by Salvon Ahmed). There were also only two 100-yard receiving games: one by Waddle and the other by Gesicki. 

Defensively, Emmanuel Ogbah crushed it this year with 9.0 sacks, 24 QB hits, 9 TFL, and 12 PD. Jaelan Phillips was another force, starting only five games but posting 8.5 sacks, 16 QB hits and 9 TFL. The Dolphins secondary was again disrupting everyone they could with Xavien Howard (5 INT, 16 PD), Jevon Holland (2 INT, 10 PD), Nik Needham (2 INT, 5 PD) and Byron Jones (10 PD). The Dolphins defense had no true stand out tackler, besides Christian Wilkins nabbing 89 tackles from the DT position. Otherwise it was very much a team effort in tackling all around with Jerome Baker leading the charge with 92 total (62 solo) tackles. 

As for Blitzing, the Dolphins were one of those teams that blitzed uniquely and from a lot of angles. LBs Andrew Van Ginkel (115 times), Jerome Baker (91 times) and Jaelan Phillips (69 times) came at the QB a lot. The defensive backs posted pretty impressive blitz numbers too, with Brandon Jones (69 times), Jevon Holland (51 times), Eric Rowe (24 times) and Nik Needham (20 times).",16.0,nfl,t3_tn7ll2,False,0.0,:Dolphins: Dolphins,2022-03-24T17:46:14Z,miamidolphins,0.0577378953065131

37575,273932,273932,lythy2016,"Apologies for the block of text, but this is the article:

An intriguing outside-the-box option has emerged as the Dolphins mull what to do with their starting center job: Well-regarded left guard Connor Williams, the free agent addition from the Dallas Cowboys, has been splitting his time between guard and center during the team‚Äôs offseason program and is now viewed as an option to play center if the team chooses to go in that direction, according to multiple sources. Williams took snaps at center in preseason for the Cowboys the past two years, and the Cowboys liked how it went. ‚ÄúI thought Connor had his best day [July 25]‚Äù at center, coach Mike McCartney said at the time. Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, offensive coordinator Frank Smith and offensive line coach Matt Applebaum are experimenting with offensive linemen at different positions, and decisions might not be made until training camp or after multiple preseason games. The Dolphins don‚Äôt have a single veteran player on their roster who began their NFL career as a center, but they have multiple players who have experience at the position and can handle the job capably. Michael Deiter was a 15-game starter at guard as a rookie, played only 23 snaps in his second season and moved permanently to center last summer. He won the starting center job in training camp, beating out Matt Skura, and started the first three games before a foot injury sidelined him for eight games. He came back and started the final six games. Pro Football Focus rated Dieter 28th of 39 qualifying centers, including 28th as a run blocker. In pass protection, Deiter allowed one sack and 10 pressures in nine games, which was decent. The Dolphins think enough of Deiter that they didn‚Äôt make center a priority in the offseason. If the Dolphins don‚Äôt have Deiter or Williams as their starting center, they have enough cap space ($20 million) to address the position via free agency or a trade if they choose. But there‚Äôs only one above-average center left in free agency ‚Äî former Cleveland starter J.C. Tretter, whom PFF ranked sixth among 39 centers last season. The Dolphins did not aggressively pursue him before the draft, according to a source. But he can‚Äôt be ruled out, either. Find more sports news, plus coverage from Sports Illustrated. READ MORE Besides Deiter, the only other center on the roster is Arkansas‚Äô Ty Clary, who signed with the Dolphins after going undrafted last weekend. Aside from issues with penalties (17 of them last season) that led to a temporary benching last November, Williams was otherwise very good at left guard for the Cowboys last season, allowing only 13 quarterback pressures, fourth fewest among NFL players who pass blocked at least 300 snaps and fewest for players who pass blocked at least 600 snaps. Pro Football Focus rated Williams 11th among 83 guards as a run-blocker. Williams played left tackle at the University of Texas and has the skill set to play any position on the line. He signed a two-year, $14 million deal with the Dolphins in March. If the Dolphins start Deiter or a player who‚Äôs not yet on the team at center, the rest of the line likely would include Terron Armstead at left tackle, Williams at left guard, Robert Hunt at right guard and likely Austin Jackson or Liam Eichenberg at right tackle. As reported weeks ago, the Dolphins believe Jackson ‚Äî a former starter at left tackle and left guard ‚Äî and can be a productive right tackle. He has been working at right tackle in the offseason program. If the Dolphins move Williams to center, then the line could feature Armstead at left tackle, Hunt at right guard, Eichenberg or perhaps Solomon Kindley at left guard and Jackson or Eichenberg at right tackle. The Dolphins have the option of moving Hunt from right guard to right tackle, but the team likes how he played at right guard last season and he seems more likely than not to stay at that spot. Robert Jones has a good chance to stick as a multiposition backup and could push for playing time; he started the 2021 season finale at right tackle. Jones has been working at center on his own in case the team needs him at that position. There‚Äôs also an outside chance that undrafted Arizona State left tackle Kellen Diesch ‚Äî who was given $140,000 guaranteed ‚Äî could compete for immediate playing time if he‚Äôs outstanding in the months ahead. Greg Little, Larnel Coleman, Adam Pankey, Kion Smith and undrafted rookies Blaise Andreis (Minnesota) and Clark are the other offensive linemen under contract.",23.0,miamidolphins,t3_uhocno,False,0.0,:DM13:,2022-05-03T15:46:12Z,miamidolphins,-0.0144276706872427
