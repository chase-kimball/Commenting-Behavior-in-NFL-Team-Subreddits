And no matter what we say, I believe that if the Saints wanted Marcus Williams bad enough, he'd still be on the team.

I expected a team to swoop in and offer $16M-18M a season. It does not appear that it happened as I can't imagine Marcus's agent would have let him take an offer that much lower. The agent certainly could have shopped the offer. I think it's very possible the offer may have been shopped to the Saints, then they passed and went to Plan B.

Before free agency, if I was asked to choose between Williams at $14M or Maye at $9.5M, I'd choose Williams all day every day. Knowing that Williams didn't reset the market and the Saints still couldn't bring him back is frustrating. For that reason among others, I am down on Maye.

That's why many teams try to sign an extension.

You're right that no one knows for sure. I don't know if anyone will know for sure, but the point of the market is for players to make as much money as they can. That's why the union fights against the franchise and transition tag. I'm assuming it was business as usual: New team made the higher offer (be it guaranteed money or total contract value).

The top of the market for safeties was Jamal Adams getting $17M/season. Marcus got nowhere near that. If he had signed for $17M/season, I'd be fine with the Saints walking. 

The Saints thinking $14M a season is too much for Williams, but happily forking over $9.5M for Maybe is impossible 5o understand. Okay, they didn't want to spend the extra $4.5M/season. Who will they spend it on? Is it for a WR? If so, I'll live with Maye. Is it to increase their offer to Armstead? I could be happy with that. I don't think they're doing that. I think they undervalued Williams and are now relying on Maye who comes with an injury and possible suspension.

My advice? Put some happy brain chemicals into your system. A *huge* reason as to why I was depressed was because I was constantly smoking and drinking. When it all comes down to it, depression is the result of your brain lacking a balance of healthy chemicals. Serotonin, dopamine - the good stuff. Your body produces these chemicals naturally, but when you start to drink and/or smoke, it stops producing said chemicals because you’re receiving them artificially and in massive amounts - so why should your body continue to do the work when it’s getting it for free? The thing is, now your body is out of wack. The *hardest* part is when you finally decide to do yourself a favor and put it all down. It’ll get worse before it gets better, but it *will* get better.

No one outside of ours and Wyoming's fanbases and people who pay attention to sexual assault stories knows who the fuck Granderson is, so he hides on the roster for the majority of casuals. And having said that, I wish he was producing at a journeyman level for a different team. 

So, simple answer, I don't want Granderson or Winston or Watson on this team. I tolerate Granderson better because he's easier to ignore most of the time. And I would tolerate Watson better, because he's a fantastic quarterback and immediately makes this team a Super Bowl contender. Winston I *HATE* because he's average at best and impossible to ignore.

RB - unremarkable but Washington looked the best of the committee. Abraham looked fine and quite effective until the fumble. Jones looked similar to last year. Ozigbo has a really aggressive cut which made a few players miss. 

QB - the Red Rocket looked like an NFL QB, offense was in rhythm, he made his passes, changed a play at the line and had a really solid drive. Book - gosh I don’t really know where to start, I’m afraid that he is never going to develop into a QB that can win us games - he looked nervous throughout, obvs the fumbles and INT stand out but I am more concern out our Redzone offense with him. No confidence of us scoring.

WR - I thought Olave looked smooth but wasn’t on for long, TreQuan was disappointing, Merritt showed some nice flashes as did Baker. 

TE - the Troutman looked solid and actually good, no drops. Vannett looked decent too. Juwan looked ok - he was the target for the first INT which came off his hands. 

Defensive Line - I was very disappointed to be honest. No pressure at all on their QB, I saw us register a sack but I don’t remember it. I was watching Turner closely and can’t say he won many of his battles. 

OLine - Penning gave up at least one sack and had a lot of developing to do in the pass rush. In third Q we fell to pieces here - Book had no chance on some plays. 

 On DBs, all I would really say is that CeeDee, Roby and Adebo stood out. Maye has a presence for sure. Vincent Gray gave up a huge play which effectively got them into scoring range at the end and again the TD.",2.0,saints,t3_wmlf9z,False,0.0,None,2022-08-14T08:05:14Z,saints,0.0411451183886428

RB - Tony Jones and Abraham Smith, can we see them stake a claim for RB3 (Tony looked awesome last year in preseason but flattered to deceive in the regular season)

Penning - I really want to see him in action annoying opposing pass rushers and ideally dominate them. I don’t hate him getting some flags to get them out of his system either.

WR - I doubt we see much at all of MT or Jarvis, hopefully some flashes from Olave. On video he looks as smooth as a babies elbow so can’t wait to see with my own eyes. Similarly Merritt and TreQuan have apparently been good in camp so really interested to see them. 

QB - the Red Rocket and Book, looking forward to see them both to be honest - I’m hearing that in Camp Dalton is slinging it which will be cool and Book with a functioning line will be nice. 

TE - The Troutman again looking good in Camp but I need to see him produce consistently or his time is up for me. Can Taysom really be a TE1? I love the guy and want to believe it. 

Turner - I am really hoping for 5+ sacks this season from him, dude has freakish genetics and looks ridiculously fast so hoping to see him in the backfield often. 

DBs - are we as strong as 2009 here? I am struggling to find justification right now to go against that. I don’t expect to see Marshon but Taylor, Roby and hopefully Adebo see some action. Evans has an extremely high ceiling but can he stay healthy.

9538,96189,96189,Mchead22,"Wow. So many bad takes in one post.
1. There QB situation was good coming into the season, their starter went 5-2 with a 14-3 TD/INT ratio. That situation got worse because of injuries throughout the season that led to starting 4 different QBs. If those injuries happen to teams with MVP caliber QBs like Packers, Bucs, Chiefs are we talking about them having one of the worst QB situation in the league?
2. Michael Thomas had 440 yards in 2 years because he played a total of about 5 games. Again, its injuries. This has nothing to do with the cap, which is what this whole thread is about.
3. Those pockets of dead money are not that huge, and they’re pushed back to future years where the cap is gonna rise. It really puts no strain on the situation.
4. If a team has a good core that it wants to keep, they’re going to get older because they’re humans. But that doesnt mean that they arent still drafting and getting younger where they can. They still use their draft picks and continue to draft well. They got a number 2 corner in the third this year, and likely a starting LB in the second. In the first they drafted a DE that could take over for Cam Jordan soon. They’re doing what every good team does; keep good players and bring in more good players.
5. Everyone has these.

I really don’t understand why people think the roster is so horrible. They set a record for number of starters this year due to a huge amount of injuries, including 4 different starting QBs and they STILL almost made the playoffs. Sure they need to fix some things on offense, but every team has areas to address. This narrative that their cap strategy is hindering their ability to stay competitive is lazy and misinformed.

So Saints win that trade right off the bat.  Now in regards to #19 for the OT.  That's always trickier as you are betting future capital on the current year, typically to fill a hole.  For judging the trade at the moment, I typically will agree to follow one of two rules with people to save on too much arguing.  The first is the lowest pick of the current round or the pick at the same position in the following round.  There is a definite benefit to the team that gets to draft in the current draft over waiting draft a player in a future draft, it might not always show dividends in the first year, but they'll likely see a higher return sooner due to developing a player they know for sure that is there that they like over hoping for it in the future.

So #19 is 875 and giving the highest value for the trade IMO '23 1st is 590 and '24 2nd is 270 for 860, so the Saints come out ahead there too.  Obviously, something could happen next year and the Saints do poorly and the picks will have a valuation higher than what they gave up, but that's part of the game.  The Saints might end up paying a premium for their guy, but it was made knowing that they are getting their guy and not hoping for them to be there the next year, not to mention the challenges of going into the season with a position not addressed.

There's no cartoon bird prancing about on the box cover, there's no commercial with Barney and Fred getting in fist fights over a bowl of Grape Nuts, you get a box full of cereal and that's it. It's not even a big box filled with air and prizes, it's just a pound of wheat and barley with a picture on the front.

What I have here is living proof that Grape Nuts is truly life changing. A four pound box of Grape Nuts, in all it's glory. Any other box of cereal this size would weigh half as much, which makes them half as good. There's something to be said about a cereal with the same density as sand.

Just holding the box gives you a sense of power like holding a baseball bat or a meat cleaver. There is some serious loft to this cereal. I could kill a man if I had to with this and I'm not even joking.

Another thing I like about Grape Nuts is that it sinks right to the bottom of the bowl. There's nothing glamorous about it, no lame snaps or crackles, no different colors, no marshmallows, just a pile of food sitting at the bottom of a bowl of milk.
Eating the food is an adventure within itself. Bite too soft and you aren't gonna break a one. Bite too hard and you might chip a tooth. It really is a wild man's cereal.

I'm not even going to talk about the taste of Grape Nuts, because there isn't any. If there wasn't milk you would swear that you were eating gravel, the only different being that gravel might soften up a bit.

The very best part of Grape Nuts is after the whole eating experience. If you've ever accidentally swallowed a rock you know what it's like to eat a bowl of Grape Nuts.

1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to pitch and then don't pitch, you have to still pitch. You cannot not pitch. Does that make any sense?

1c-b(2). You gotta be, throwing motion of the ball, and then, until you just throw it.

That’s most QBs though, and why realistically, 20 teams in the NFL don’t have a shot at a SB, because they don’t have one of the few guys who can carry a team through the playoffs. 

My unpopular opinion is that we were beyond spoiled for 16 years with Brees and Payton. The fan base latched onto Teddy as a successor because he didn’t lose us games, then latches onto Jameis for the same reason. Realistically, we may go through a few more QBs before we find the next guy. Most QBs can win with the defense we had the last 3 years, as has been proven with Teddy, Taysom, and Jameis, so I’d like to see us bring in someone this year (Jameis is fine) and lean on the strength of the team, but look to next draft, or even this draft if there’s a project player we like, for the future.

17034,160623,160623,TomorrowMayRain065,"Lately we have played 3 roles with out safeties. Marcus Williams as a deep FS, Malcolm Jenkins as a SS, and CJGJ as a slot corner (thought listed as a safety). The FS covers deep zones, the SS in the box and on players like TEs, and the slot self explanatory along with some SS type things. All of these guys move around and are versatile but those are the basic archetypes. PJ Williams can do all of these a little.

Unfortunately, at this point there's no one we can forseeably obtain who can replace the true center-fielding range of Marcus Williams. This means we will probably shift our roles a little bit and have two hybrid safeties moreso than a true FS and more of a SS, if I had to guess (we already did this a good bit because we play a good bit of quarters). That role requires less speed which is what is missing without Marcus, it more relies on a little man ability and lots of awareness, which fits our guys all well. Still, for FS, Marcus Maye is the best option we have, and PJ has had work at FS for us, too. That leaves the SS spot. Right now that's probably whichever of Maye/PJ isn't at free and Sorensen as the next in line. However, we could move CJGJ there, where he has been good in limited snaps, and play PJ/Roby/2nd round pick Taylor in the slot.

I think the current vision is PJ at free and Maye at strong because of Dennis Allen's comments, though I think it's a little puzzling because Maye is definitely the rangiest guy we have now, though he is a big hitter which is valuable at strong. Maye is also injury prone and probably facing a suspension for DUI.

Mathieu, like you point out, is a SS. For the Chiefs, he was almost exactly what Malcolm Jenkins was for us. He is no longer fit to play deep in coverage like when he was younger but brings a lot of juice. If we brought him in, we could pretty cleanly roll with Maye/PJ in place of Marcus Williams, Mathieu in place of Jenkins, and keep CJGJ in the slot.",17.0,saints,t3_uffwtn,False,0.0,Shield,2022-04-30T13:40:33Z,saints,0.0276763946022953

That said.. this is how free agency works

Landry is a very competent player and the LSU connection + vet presence would be nice but there's no WR left out there we can sign that will move the needle for us.

17117,160817,160817,TomorrowMayRain065,"Thought process:

(Assuming Jameis re-signing or securing a similar non-splash, but stable, short-term QB option)

Daxton Hill -- Deep FS replacement for Marcus Williams; has the range there that the FA choices don't. Safety and slot position versatility. (Update: we literally just signed Marcus Maye instead, oops lol)

Christian Watson -- The WR2 investment everyone is clamoring for. Deep threat and another RAS monster lol.

JoJo Domann -- Having gotten an extra pick when I would've been okay with Hill at 18 straight up (though, I understand this is the sort of move you can game on a mock draft sim that would be less likely to happen irl), just swinging on a really fascinating prospect. Safety? who has played LB and slot. Could maybe fill in to Jenkins' or Kwon's roles later on.

Max Mitchell -- Whether or not Armstead is back, a solid prospect to develop at right tackle. I think Hurst can start for now if Armstead leaves, but we will need to start to replenish the ranks both for depth and long-term.

Kyle Phillips -- Another WR dart, more of a slot guy.

Jelani Woods -- Athlete at TE. Hopefully one of he and Trautman can eventually grow into the starting role and the other, Juwan Johnson, and Vannett round out a decent group.

Pierre Strong -- Speed at RB and reinforcements for Kamara's likely suspension. I like Tony Football but don't really like the looks of him and Ingram alone there, especially as more of a defense/running game team.

Chigoziem Okonkwo -- Interesting FB/H-back type. Could give additional help/another dart throw at TE while at the very least upgrading... Adam Prentice? and letting Taysom stay very flexible.

Thomas Booker -- Needed DI depth. If you haven't noticed, a lot of these later round picks are informed by Brett Kollman's latest video.

Jaylen Watson -- Depth/dart throw at outside CB.",1.0,saints,t3_tf8267,False,0.0,Shield,2022-03-15T22:30:37Z,saints,1.5181518639335492e-06

17608,165474,165474,VanDenIzzle,"I love these Carson Wentz threads.

He is an amazing QB as far as athletic ability is concerned. He can do it all. He can scramble, make multiple reads, make the deep pass, accurate short throws. He has all of the physical ability to not only succeed, but be a top 10 guy.

The issue is his leadership which with every passing year is getting pulled more and more into question. He doesn't take accountability. Last year when he was making dumb mistakes, he would go to his post game interview and blame it on anyone else. Ended up losing the locker room because of it. You can see because not a single Colt came out and was shocked to see him get traded for pennies. That's why we keep getting ""leaks from the colts"" on how much happier they are just being rid of him.


He also gets startled. Kind of like how Sam Darnold saw ghosts, he gets rocked a few times and starts making boneheaded decisions. Bail out of pocket early, scramble into a defender, throw it away but into the chest of a defender. He gets in his head and loses control. 


Everytime I say this I get down voted, but he will start the year off as an MVP darkhorse. Throw like 7 TDs to 1 or 0 int through the first 2 or 3 games and look amazing. But all it will take is 1 game where he loses a step and gets sacked hard. He will blame it on his O-line which they will no longer wish to put their bodies through harm to protect him.

Week 10 at Pittsburgh Steelers WIN - The Steeler's are not good

Week 11 vs Los Angeles Rams WIN - Fuck them

Michael Thomas

Lattimore

Marcus Williams

Erik McCoy 

Chauncey Gardner Johnson

Terron Armstead

Andrus Peat

Paulson Adebo, etc

Marcus Davenport (BTW packers drafted Jaire Alexander and Darnell Savage with our two picks, fuck me)

Adam Troutman, still time but inconsistent TE

Zack Baun headed towards bust LB

The only huge hit we’ve had whole trading up is Alvin Kamara in round 3. Otherwise we’re terrible at value on trades

I think Olave will be great, but to justify that value he has to be elite and that’s too much pressure. Davenport at our original pick would be a decent return, but not for two first round picks
