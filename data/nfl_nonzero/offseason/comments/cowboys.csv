Travis Jones would be amazing in our defense and would help shore up our run defense. Our defense needs someone like him who takes up two blockers due to his size and athletic ability.

Nakobe Dean would allow Parsons to rush more and not be a liability in the pass game. He also acts as another chess piece for Quinn and can be used in a variety of different ways.

As for Pickens, I love everything about his tape and football ability. I normally would criticize the Jones for taking too many risks in the 2nd round, but I think he's too good of talent to ignore. Plus, unless I'm mistaken, I don't think he necessarily has any glaring off the field issues. He seems like a passionate player who takes it a bit far on the field at times. Maybe I'm forgetting something when it comes to his character off the field though.

Arnold Ebiketie is one of my favorite prospects in this draft. He has an amazing first step , 34 inch arms, fluid hips, and the production to back it up. Would love to have him to replace Gregory.

3355,30128,30128,ChunkeyMunkee_,"I wanted Jermaine Johnson, but I still like this pick. Tyler Smith will not be a good tackle in the NFL , simple as that. However, he could be a GREAT guard which is what I'm assuming the FO+coaches are thinking.  He's arguably the strongest tackle in this draft, very explosive, and mauler in the run game.

His biggest weakness is his pass protection ability. He doesn't have the quickest feet nor the greatest hips for pass protecting on the edge. Putting him at guard should fix a lot of his pass protection issues though. He struggles with faster/quicker edge rushers cause of his footwork and foot speed (which led to his holding penalties). At guard he'd be facing heavier interior lineman which works out since he's incredibly strong.

I wouldn't have picked him this high, but I honestly think he's a late 1st or high 2nd round pick. Would've been better to trade down IMO, but he's been linked to the Titans for months now.

Gregory will be a loss but I think Armstrong will be able to replace a good portion of his production.

Everybody we've resigned have good contracts and don't negatively impact our cap space going forward.

If we can fix the O-Line in the draft and a good receiver in the 2nd or 3rd (like we did Gallup), I think our team looks bright going into next season. Especially with our cap space next year, the cap going up, and Sean Payton being available.

However, if we go into next off-season and don't hire Payton or sign any big FAs, I don't know what the plan for this off-season was.

I understand that we value money very little and value draft picks even more than anything, but there are a lot of players we could get who show amazing promise. 

* Brandon Aiyuk - With Deebo continuing to be the focal point of that offense alongside kittle, maybe an heir of a tight end, and a heavy run game by committee, Aiyuk may want a place to prove himself better for a contract.

* KJ Hamler - Not a super big game, but him and Tim Patrick absolutely showed up under DREW LOCK when Jeudy and Sutton were out. Imagine what they could do with Dak. Since Sutton and Patrick are under contract, and if Jeudy breaks out like he's ""supposed to"" he's gonna want a contract too. Denver can't afford 4 and they have plenty of weapons on that offense. He's a great deep field threat burner with great hands and they still have Hinton whose their 4th.

* Scotty Miller - Another guy we won't have to pay huge for but has promise. Behind vets Evans, Godwin, Gage, and now Julio, Scotty was actually a decent slot guy in a pinch when needed. I can't imagine he will get much play as 5th or worse under the depth chart. 

* Terrance Marshall JR - The Panthers need to do well this season, and if that's going to happen it's going to be with a combination of CMC, DJ Moore, and maybe Robby Anderson. This is less likely since it's the end of a regime if they fail, but if they are confident or won't use Marshall, then they could trade him for a pick to help reason why the staff will continue to improve the team and they are trending in the right direction.

* Jalen Raegor - First round, division rival, speedster, burner. Can't blame him for not wanting to be in Philly, and he's gonna want a contract too. He's in the same contract year as JJ, Jeudy, and Ceedee if he wants that big early extension. He won't have to be behind AJ Brown, Devonte Smith, and their other failed receivers who eagles probably lost any draft capital on, but this is a guy who they could cut anyways, he seems unmotivated, but if there's anyone who can reignite the second chance, maybe it's us.",3.0,cowboys,t3_wdydj2,False,0.0,None,2022-08-02T03:21:08Z,cowboys,-0.0424447539700015

Dak compensates his lack of a cannon with technique, and we saw in the first half of the season he was easily in tier 1, it's just about the consistency. 

His ceiling is still very high. Like Derek Carr, I believe they are only JUST scratching their true potentials. 

If you see how Dak performs in 2 and 4 minute offenses that aren't drawn up, just fast paced throw the ball to the open man and make plays, I sincerely think Dak is top 5. It's just way too risky to rely on last minute clinchiness. 

Still need work in how the offense roles, I believe he can command it as a general and a manager great, but man the schemes and set ups are just bad.

Trade - Baltimore has OL, DL, Edge, safety, and corner as positions of need this year. Edge is deep in this draft and the best safeties are gone, this may be a move they would take.

R2 (46) - Walker III is the best back in the draft in my opinion. I think everyone here is aware of our RB room situation. I think he's definitely worth 2 2nd-rounders and a 4th and I also think Jerry would say so too. Maybe I place too much emphasis but it screams position of need at the moment. I'm sure if we got him we could trade Pollard for a great value but that's a different discussion. I love him as a changeup but he's not a power back like this team is built for.

R2 (56) - McBride is the best TE prospect in the draft. I'd be surprised if he was still available this late. If he isn't I'd try to get Nik Bonitto DE or move down for 2 3rd-rounders.

R3 (88) - Anderson does not have much experience at LB but I'd bet a 3rd-rounder that a guy who was a quarterback previously could develop into an excellent play-caller on the defense. This move would free up Parsons to roam and replace LVE. probably my favorite pick. It's very likely he will be available here as well.

Trade - Bengals need depth in a lot of places and they won't find it with one guy in the mid-late rounds. We move up, they move down.

R4 (137) - Cross is a ball hawk and very intelligent. I think we sign Kearse and let Cross watch and learn. What an excellent player to sit behind.

R6 (201) - Stout. Yes, I know it's a kicker. You will only find projects in the later rounds \*except\* for special teams and we have had nothing but inconsistency at kicker since Dan Bailey left.

My dad and his wife have (my parents got divorced) gone multiple times over the past few years however. 

Some cool things about having a box/suite that I can share:

1) we do get underground parking which is super convenient when parking in general. (Not like player parking, but when we leave the building, we drive past the opposing teams busses).

2) we can go onto the field before warm ups and after the game, which is always cool, and we can see some players who come out before warm ups that do their own pre-warm up things

3) I can literally yell at the cowboys lineman, as they practice in our corner of the end zone that we‚Äôre on.

4) depending on if their are cheerleaders not performing that day, you can meet them (but you cannot touch them as greasy old fucks have gotten too handsy in the past).

Another interesting story I can share. When j was much younger, me and my brother and dad actually went to the old cowboys stadium when it was closed (I realize now he was probably there to choose which box he wanted), so it was quite literally me and my brother in an entirely empty stadium, and it was one of the most surreal experiences possible.

Volume stats mean everything when consistency is at play. Don't fall into that trope when you are citing his 2016 metrics as a success - you can't have it both ways. If he had a single year of that caliber you could say that, but Zeke has NEVER had less than 1200 yards from scrimmage in a season. The only difference from year to year is total touches. Zeke had 10 less touches per game last year compared to his early seasons. Even outside of the modern era he is 12th ALL-TIME by that same metric.

>Analytically, he certainly doesn‚Äôt warrant any of the praise you‚Äôre heaping on him. He‚Äôs consistently toward the bottom of the league in success rates, expected points added, all that. But at least he touches the ball a lot right?

Among RBs last year with at least 200 carries Zeke was 8th out of 20 candidates in EPA. His success rate is at 52% which is pretty damn good. All while also being the best RB in pass protection, but that's probably because of volume too, right?

>And yep, he‚Äôs clearly durable. That‚Äôs why he shouldn‚Äôt have been on the field most of last season. Which (I‚Äôm not putting on him) hurt the team because he was not 100%.

His injury hurt our team, sure, but not nearly as much as his absence would have. Zeke is likely the only reason Dak was able to play through the entire season (except for the Vikings game). Had Pollard been asked to fill his seat:

1. Dak would have been a sitting duck in the backfield - Our OL was a sieve in the back half of the season and Pollard sucks in blitz pickup.
2. Pollard would not have been able to handle the load - Never had a single game in college or pros with 20+ touches. He got injured last year on a 12 touch game, and then missed two games because of it ...
3. The fans clamoring for Zeke to relinquish his role would be 10X more vocal  citing him missing time as ""evidence"" of being washed.",0.0,cowboys,t3_w3ul8w,False,0.0,Ezekiel Elliott,2022-07-22T11:09:05Z,cowboys,-0.0127990769336099

""Isn't that good anymore"" despite being the only RB in the league that has been able to stay on the field year to year, average over 4 YPC in unfavorable run situations, and protect his QB. Did you know that in the modern era, Zeke has the 4th most yards from scrimmage through six seasons? 

Does he still have the same speed as 2016? No, but there isn't a single player in the NFL that is as fast as they were when they were a rookie - not one. Regardless, the team literally asked him to change his style and he did. He changed his game to be able to endure the demands of an NFL season for years to come, and has done so well taking care of his body that he has literally only missed on game in six years due to injury. 

Durability is a skill too; Henry missed eight games just last year, McCaffery has missed over 20 over the last two, Kamara's a lock to miss at least three games per year, and yet all of those guys are considered better by your average fan.

19593,160345,160345,RingingMallard,"I've got this, u/FoxBeach

Zeke vs Pollard - Zeke is a top tier back by way of all of these listed factors. Not production - *ALL* of the factors that make a great running back

  
1. Production - Measure of ability, scheme, and opportunity. So Pollard may have better efficiency metrics on the surface, but context is important here. He saw those rushes on outside runs where there is more space before contact. Zeke was rushed between the tackles and was often contacted in the backfield on those same runs - hence the porous OL (specifically up the middle with Williams and Biadasz). I want to call this a wash, but Ill give the point to Pollard.

  
2. Availability - Zeke has only missed a single game due to injury in his entire six year career. There isn't a single RB in the NFL playing today that can say that besides Zeke. Pollard has missed that many in half the time and 25% of the workload. Point Zeke.

3. Durability - Pollard has missed more games in just this last year than Zeke has missed in his entire six year career. Factor that in with the consistency in which Zeke is making contact and it's easy to see that Zeke is the more durable back.  With Zeke's ability to still be productive even when hampered by nagging bumps and bruises, which are a part of the game for all positions, in all phases of the game and the answer is clear. Point Zeke

  
4. Reliability - This is a measure of consistency with the ball. Zeke does have a significant number of fumbles compared to Pollard; however, that does not factor in opportunities, nor do their respective rushing efficiencies factor in the consistency at which they get that average (IE Standard deviations). Has Zeke fumbled 22 times? Yes, but it has been over the course of almost 2000 touches compared to Pollard's 3 fumbles on almost 400 touches (Zeke's 1.1% fumble rate vs Pollard's .7%). Now lets talk about standard deviations. They are a variance measurement based on a relative carry's relationship to a mean. So a player that consistently gets the same yardage would have a smaller deviation than a boom or bust player would have. Smaller Std. Dev = more consistent/reliable. Based on both of these factors, I lean towards a point for Zeke.

  
5. Speed - I think we can both agree that Pollard is faster, but with his plantar fascia injury last year we have yet to see him hit that top speed again that made this true. That said still a point for Pollard.

  
6. Vision - This one is hard to measure based on scheme and opportunity. To me being able consistently get yards in the trenches is more impressive than getting a higher YPC on outside runs where speed gets you in open space. Being able to navigate 10 bodies and get consistent yardage is a better reflection of good vision than the latter. Slight Edge to Zeke.

  
7. Contact Balance - This one isn't close. Pollard is fast and shifty but often gets tackled by the first defender that makes contact. Zeke often pushes piles for extra yards after contact and by the time he goes down there are 2-3 defenders assisting on the tackle. To still be able to control 2 to 3 bodies through contact is clearly a point for Zeke.

  
8. Strength - This is no contest. In a short yardage situation we are betting on Zeke 100% of the time. Point Zeke

So out of 8 factors that determine what makes a great running back the score is 6-2 in favor of Zeke, and not once did I even mention pass protection, which most of our fanbase does not seem to value as a skill even though it is a valuable one.",3.0,cowboys,t3_utd3b4,False,0.0,Ezekiel Elliott,2022-05-20T06:36:22Z,cowboys,0.0189665736351908

19609,160364,160364,RingingMallard,"First off, ""stacked boxes"" is a pre-snap metric and does not account for any post snap movement from the defense. Defensive schemes constantly rely on misdirection to confuse the opposing QB and get them to audible into less favorable situations. That's defense 101.

Second, you are equating production to value (that's fine if that's all you care about), but that only supports the fact that you really care about fantasy stats. The game of football is more nuanced than yards and TDs. It's a game of chess where everyone is subject to extreme physical stress, relies on 10 others to consistently do their jobs, and fall into a little bit of luck.

&#x200B;

>Henry before injury was probably going to get 2k again. He‚Äôs leagues better than Zeke, it‚Äôs not even a debate.

Henry was getting 30 touches per game which is also the reason he broke his foot. Even still a healthy Henry had the same yards per carry as Zeke who was playing on one knee for 13 games. Now Henry, after missing most of the season last year, is rehabbing a broken foot as the biggest back in football and you think he's leagues better? Come on.

If Zeke was getting 30 touches per game, do you know where he would have finished? 2300 yards from scrimmage and 24TDs. In previous seasons, when Zeke was getting similar volume, all anyone said was, ""of course he is leading the league, he's getting the most touches"" but now that it's someone else, not only does that make them ""better"" but it's being used against Zeke as ""evidence"" to why they think he is worse. If that's not a form of bias, I don't know what is.

Najee, Mixon, Kamara, McCaffery, and Taylor were all averaging 20 touches per game consistently. In the 2021 season, when Zeke got 20 touches (weeks 3-7, injured week 4), do you know what he was averaging? 5.1 per carry, 6 yards per catch, and 5.26 yards per touch overall. Hell the only ones of those you listed that played in every game were Harris and Taylor, yet you are trying to tell me that because they got the ball more, they are better Running backs? That goes back to the double standard being shoved onto Zeke right now.

We haven't even discussed Zeke's ability to pass block either. That plus his durability are probably what gives him the greatest versatility among all the backs you listed. Can you nitpick and find a single thing or two that one of them does better than Zeke? Probably, but there is not a single other back in the league that can do *everything* you can ask of a running back at an elite/high level, and do it every single game to boot. Not one. Versatility has value, durability has value, and reliability has value. That's why Zeke's contract isn't just about production - it's about everything he brings to the table and the fact that no one else can do that.

I said all that to say this - If all you want are fantasy stats and flashy plays, that's cool, just admit that you are only looking for that when you say ""better running back,"" and that you aren't actually evaluating players based on all of their abilities but rather the ones that show up on the stat sheet. You aren't alone either, most football fans these days fall into this trap.

19620,160378,160378,RingingMallard,"Lots to get through here, so I'll go one by one:

Zeke is a top ten back by way of all of these listed factors. Not production - ALL THE FACTORS

1. Production is a measure of ability, scheme, and opportunity. So Pollard may have better efficiency metrics on the surface but he saw those rushes on outside runs where there is more space before contact. Zeke was rushed between the tackles and was often contacted in the backfield on those same runs - hence the porous OL (specifically up the middle with Williams and Biadasz). I want to call this a wash but Ill give the point to Pollard.
2. Availability - At no point did I say that Zeke is oft injured. Zeke has only missed a single game due to injury in his entire six year career. There isn't a single RB in the NFL playing today that can say that besides Zeke. Pollard has missed that many in half the time and 25% of the workload. Point Zeke.
3. Reliability - This one is tricky because I understand your point but you aren't factoring in opportunity or standard deviations. Has Zeke fumbled that many times? Yes but it has been over the course of almost 2000 touches compared to Pollards almost 400 (Zeke's 1.1% fumble rate vs Pollard's .7%) Now lets talk about standard deviations. They are a variance measurement based on a relative carrys relationship to the mean. So a player that consistently gets the same yardage would have a smaller deviation than a boom or bust player would have. Smaller Std. Dev = more consistent/reliable. Based on both of these factors, I lean towards a point for Zeke.
4. Speed - I agree that Pollard was faster, but with his plantar fascia injury last year we have yet to see him hit that top speed again that made this true. That said still a point for Pollard
5. Vision - This one is hard to measure based on scheme and opportunity but at no point is contact balance lumped in here (nice try though?). To me being able consistently get yards in the trenches is more impressive than getting a higher YPC on outside runs where speed gets you in open space. Being able to navigate 10 bodies and get consistent yardage is a better reflection of good vision. Slight Edge to Zeke.
6. Contact Balance - This one isn't close. Pollard is fast and shifty but often gets tackled by the first defender that makes contact. Zeke often pushes piles for extra yards after contact and by the time he goes down there are 2-3 defenders assisting on the tackle. Point Zeke.
7. Strength - We both agree that this is Zeke.

So in total that leaves this comparison at 5-2 Zeke. I'm not suggesting that he is the same player he was in 2016 with the explosive plays, but to expect him to be that same player after 6 years is unreasonable in it of itself. I would be happy to continue this conversation if we can keep it civil. Thanks for your opinion in advance.

You are solely looking at production which is the only category that can be influenced by the other players and coaches around them, but that is a short sighted approach from my perspective.  I try not to fall into that trap, but that is my personal opinion. 

Zeke's production may not be where it once was but his touches are down significantly from then as well.

Here's some more when you're done pouting: 

2017 Zeke averaged 4.1 per carry but lead the league in yards per game... That wasn't bad at the time, but it is now?

Derrick Henry averaged 4.2 YPC this year as well. Does that mean that Pollard is better than him too?

How many games has Pollard missed due to injury in his two years? The answer is double the amount that Zeke has in his entire 6 year career. Effectively Pollard's missed game rate from injury is 4X what Zeke's is (Double the # in a half of the time = 4X - Its way worse if you look at missed time per touch)

Do you understand the roles that our RBs play and the scheme that Moore utilizes for them? Zeke gets all his carries in the trenches. Pollard sees the outside zones in open space. They are not the same. Is Pollard faster? Yes, but that in no way makes him a better RB.  Not as fast is not equal to not as good. There are many other factors to consider.

You want to complain about a big contract? Look at Cooper. Broken down per touch he got paid $300,000 every time he caught a ball last season. Do you know what that same stat was for Zeke? $24,000.

>Is Zeke completely washed? No but there‚Äôs no way on earth you can possibly say he‚Äôs as good as he was 2016-2018

Did you just ignore the 10 less touches per game thing? Zeke would need 7.95 yards per touch to get the same number of yards as 2016 with his touches in 2021. Not a single RB has ever done that, not one.

I still think Zeke is a great RB, is worth the money, and I am not alone.

None of the information in this ""breakdown"" accounts for the decrease in Zeke's touches per game or our rapidly degrading OL. I posted a chart a few weeks ago that compared several stats year by year like yards per carry, yards per touch, and most notably touches per game. Zeke is getting about 10 less touches per game compared to his earlier seasons, our OL is a shell of what it once was, but somehow everyone wants the same level of production as 2016. Its just unreasonable, and the numbers support that.

You know what he would have to be averaging per touch to get that 2000 yard mark on 10 less touches per game? FUCKING 7.95 yards per touch. Anyone know the last RB to do that on 200+ touches? NOT A SINGLE ONE, EVER. The highest yard per attempt figure in the history of the NFL is Mike Vick at 8.4 in 2006.

**TRADE**: Cowboys send picks 24 and 167 to the Chiefs for picks 29, 94 and 103. Chiefs select the best WR available, Olave.

**TRADE #2**: Cowboys send picks 56, 129 and a 2023 3rd to the Texans for picks 37, a 2023 7th and a 2024 7th (PFF trade logic idk man.)

1.29: Kenyon Green. I wanted Zion Johnson here but he went two picks earlier to the Bucs. Luckily, we stayed ahead of the Bengals to take him for ourselves. Probably the best iOL in the draft and we get him at 29 while getting two extra 3rd round picks. 

2.37 Nik Bonitto. Hes a first round talent that no one seems to realize is gonna be available in round 1 for everyone. I believe he had the highest pass rush win rate among all edge rushers in college last year. Big name to trade up for to put next to D-Law and Micah Parsons.

3.88 Marcus Jones. He‚Äôs a bit small for the CB position at just 5‚Äô8, but his ball skills are amazing. He‚Äôs also by far the best return man in the draft, so now we have a punt returner available to us and a KR if Pollard goes down.

3.94 Romeo Doubs. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I don‚Äôt know much about Doubs. He was ranked as the best WR available and I took him. Very good value anyways, considering we still have another pick from the Chiefs trade.

3.103 Cade Otton. Yes I know Jelani Woods is a monster, but Otton is very good. He is a very solid receiving TE and can block better than probably any TE we‚Äôve started in a game in the last couple years. Very solid value.

**No 4th round picks**

5.155 Cordale Flott. Just a case of BPA, there‚Äôs never an issue with having a good CB room so we go with the best player there and get another solid CB, making an insurance policy if we were to get rid of AB and Lewis after this season.

5.176 Nephi Sewell. He‚Äôs a very solid linebacker out of Utah and I had just noticed I hadn‚Äôt taken a single LB up to this point. He can definitely be a solid player for us if used.

5.178 Noah Elliss. He‚Äôs our Bohanna in this draft, just a big dude who‚Äôs gonna stuff the run. Nothing wrong with deepening the DT room again, as it seems we won‚Äôt be getting Urban back.

6.193 Dai'Jean Dixon. Another great value pick at WR. He‚Äôs a very underrated player in this draft and he‚Äôs gonna go very late. We get a steal here.

>>When he recovered, Jackson ran home, picked up a .22 caliber rifle and was determined to kill the teen-ager who had just brought him to his knees. He found the youngster and began to aim the gun, ready to shoot to kill. But at the last second, Jackson thought about what prison would be like and hit a tree instead of the teen-ager.

Then my friend goes, ""Try CBS"" and the waiter changed it to CBS. And that was the Dallas game 

And we saw Cooper Rush, and that was the last time we even looked at the TV, except for the Broncos getting a touchdown to make it 7-0. We laughed. Because we were 12 during the last Super Bowl win, and failure has become comedy.

Tony Romo was a very good QB, who became elite a bit too late in his career, after injuries had already taken their toll. Additionally, he had the misfortune of operating throughout all but maybe two of his seasons with average-or-worse offensive lines. If he had the o-line that Dak has been afforded, we would probably be singing a different tune. Would he have a ring? I don't know. Brees only got one, Peyton - my pick for GOAT QB - just got 2. The list of greats who didn't get a ring is longer than the list of not-that-greats who did get one, so if that's your (royal you) measuring stick then it's not even really worth debating, since the disagreement is on a foundational level.

But the one thing Romo has always been really good with is his fortitude, both mental and physical. So I don't think a mistake he made in his ""rookie"" year is going to haunt him in games 10 years down the line.

""This is of literally no importance."" This is such a dumb-sounding take, you realize it looks like you're saying they're pointing for no reason, right? Like they just do that for fun and all QB's ""point"" the same way. I'm guessing what you are meaning to say here is that all QB's direct their OL pre-snap, and this is true. The author of the article is claiming *Dak is especially good at this*, meaning while the OL is executing the action effectively, Dak is directing them and calling attention to defensive positioning prior to that happening, and therefore has some credit to the OL play. To suggest all QB's are exactly equal in this is wrong, and you're being deliberately obtuse to chalk it up to some meaningless ""pointing.""

As far as WRs go, I purposely ignored it because I figured everybody understood that regardless of which QB you're referring to, they require some level of offensive talent to achieve success. When a QB that people like or consider good like has a down season, they can chalk it up to not having receivers or OL help. When Joe Burrow or Stafford or whoever have Ja'marr Chase and Cooper Kupp, they get praise and nobody says ""oh they're just being carried by their WR group,"" yet here you are, making that claim for Dak because you want to create a narrative, despite Amari Cooper being a good but not top 5 WR that just got traded for a 5th round pick.

Dak, Stafford, Burrow, whoever, all need some level of OL help and WR to succeed.

It‚Äôs odd how little credit Dak receives for the work he does before the snap. It‚Äôs not like this is a recent development; he‚Äôs been vigilant in that phase of the game since his rookie season. He‚Äôs just a lot better at it now, which tends to happen as a quarterback gains experience.

I would argue that our losses were always the plan.  Coopers contract literally had an out built in for this year so that depending on what happened with Gallup's contract, they could choose.  I would rather have cooper this year than not, but he probably wasn't living up to his contract.  

Lael clearly was planned to let go.  They though Steele was better last year and cheaper and less of a headache.

I dislike losing Gregory, but I think we currently have more talent at RE than we did last year with him.

Beyond that, our holes are on the OL, and to be honest after using our 1st round draft pick on an OL, there aren't high level starters out there just available for the taking, or I think we would've.

Would it be cool to have gotten Bobby Wagoner or Von Miller?  Sure... but I personally don't think we need them.

Sometimes you need to see how your draft picks pan out.  Which is another difference between us an other teams.  The Ravens are consistently the best drafting team in the long term, and we're consistently #2.  I don't see the Ravens out there constantly signing big name free agents every year.

Now, by all accounts Dak 100% healthy (knock on wood) and is already like the 5th-7th highest paid QB with more guys to be signed in the nxt yr.

Not 'RIGHT NOW' per se, but Tank Lawrence broke his foot in mid Sept.  This year he's healthy and making less money per year.

Last year we drafted a perceived trouble maker in the first round who right now appears to be a real team glue guy who came in 2nd in DPOY votes as a Rookie.

Last year, Travon Diggs was coming off of a decent rookie year but we didn't know what we had, or that he would have the best CB season any Cowboy has had since Deion.


Add in Dan Quinn, Jayron Kearse and Malik Hooker, last year question marks who this year are huge contributors.  We know more who Schultz is.

We also know that allowing Pollard to just be Zeke's breather isn't in the plans this year.

When Micah blitzes on a run play, unless he stops it dead on the blitz, it's wide open.  When Micah blitzes on a pass play, if he doesn't hurry/sack the qb, a they leak a RB out with no one near him.

LVE is just ok at best, and people expecting the world out of Jabril Cox are setting themselves up for disappointment.  He has potential, but he's essentially a rookie this year... also, his biggest strength was in coverage.  So 50% of the time, we're left with no LBs to play the run.

If you watch some of the games late in the year, specifically the 49ers game, they exposed our LB play.

Jevon Kearse essentially plays LB in a lot of passing downs, but he likely covers a TE leaving whoever our other LB is to cover a RB.  If its anyone but Parsons, it's a 1st down.

The problem with the Jones and the GM position is that some fane may very well be better suited for the job because they are not also the owners. The 2 jobs conflict and is the reason I think that contracts are given out to players who may not deserve it. Jerry and Stephen have to preserve the relevance and the financial ties to that so having extremely likeable and marketable players like Dak and Zeke signed long term keeps the money rolling in whether they win big or not. 

With that said, I do appreciate the sentiment and I have changed the way I watch the Cowboys (and all sports really). There is no reason to get that upset over a game and most likely at this point, we will not see a Super Bowl in the near future so just sit back and enjoy and who knows, maybe a miracle on ice moment happens at some point.
