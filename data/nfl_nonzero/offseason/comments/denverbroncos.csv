I think it's just too easy to narrow everything down to the idea that if someone had to die, it should have been the person responsible. After that, some are willing to extend that idea way too far past the sense of logic. 

The truth is, I've had people I care about on both sides of this equation. When someone you love kills an innocent person out of recklessness, it's extremely hard to come to terms with. If you've never heard the Ted Talk from Sue Klebold (mother of a Columbine shooter), it's definitely worth a listen. Of course, she's talking about the intentional murder versus negligence, but a lot of the same points apply. Just the feeling that you shouldn't be allowed to grieve for the guilty party is a bizarre thing on its own.

I've also had a very close family member killed by someone texting while driving. In fact, it was a classmate of mine. A classmate I had to entirely remove from social media after all the ""terrible driver"" jokes he started making months later. I don't think I've ever actually wished death on him... but I'd have loved to strangle the shit out of him on more than a few occasions.

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

>*‚ÄúNo free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.‚Äù*

‚Äì Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Constitution, Draft 1, 1776

>*‚ÄúWhat country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.‚Äù*

‚Äì Thomas Jefferson, letter to James Madison, December 20, 1787

‚Äì Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Cartwright, 5 June 1824

>*‚ÄúBefore a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.‚Äù*

- Fant: This stings. He's a bit rough around the edges but he's an extremely reliable receiver when the play breaks down.
- Drew Lock: Probably the biggest question mark. He wasn't particularly good with us, but a lot of people in our fanbase attributed his low production to bad scheme and were calling for him to be the starter.

I could see an extension that starts in ‚Äò24 as one of the highest paid QBs and to appease him in the meantime he gets his signing bonus whenever he actually signs (could be as early as the 16th). The signing bonus would be paid upfront, but prorated through the extension.

26420,159753,159753,ignitethis2112,"It‚Äôs so funny to see all these people weigh in on this trade. Not only did I watch every Broncos game but I also had Fant on my fantasy team and watched him become one of the biggest busts out of all my of my players that season. 

Noah has brief flashes of what he could be but they are too few are far between if you ask me. In my opinion most of the time he‚Äôs horribly out of sync with what the rest of the offense is doing, mostly because the guy can‚Äôt block to save his life. In addition to this whenever he does get the ball he more acts like a paper airplane, dropping to the ground after the slightest contact. Because of his inability to play the TE position at a high level every single play he more times that not he seems to never be in the right place at the right time. If what people say about Pete Carroll‚Äôs preference for blocking TE‚Äôs is true, this is a total whiff if you ask me and I hope for Seahawks fans that either Pete changes or they get a new coach who could work with Fant to bring out the best in him

A quick note on the other players involved/the picks traded:

I used to believe in Drew, and from the beginning I really wanted the best for him. That was until I started noticing that it was not just the team/coaching staff putting him in tough positions but also his inability to rise to any occasion when he was put in a tight spot. Most of the time when met with this adversity he‚Äôd dig deep into his ‚Äúgunslinger‚Äù mentality often costing us a possession in his attempts to throw a frozen rope or hospital throw into an incredibly tight spot. People will probably scrutinize my comment and bring up how Fangio was against him and never put him in a spot to succeed which is partly true. But in my opinion with the little time he did play he did himself no favors and like Fant his flashes of what a great player he could be were too far and few between to even get someone with a grand vision like Paton to have faith in him. 

The Broncos made out like bandits in this trade, that being said I‚Äôm really bummed we are losing Shelby Harris. Not only is he an amazing player but the energy and passion he brought to the locker room was one of the few things keeping us fans energized about the team seeing someone like him trying his hardest to succeed. On top of that fans loved his pride and passion for his family, and the community. Seattle got a real one with him. 

When it comes to the trades, George Paton proves yet again why he‚Äôs in the place he is today. We still have picks in this draft and an ability to bring in some quality talent at positions we need. On top of that it‚Äôs looking more and more like Von Miller may be willing to take a team friendly deal to not only return to his original team, but also chase yet another Super Bowl ring alongside the likes of one of the best QB‚Äôs to play the game in recent times.

By not drafting QB last year, he kicked the can down the road. Maybe he didn't like those QBs, fine.

I grew increasingly frustrated that *no* changes were made all season.  Vic wasn't fired, Teddy wasn't benched, McMahon wasn't fired.  Also, articles like the below made it sound like there was a decent chance that Paton would run it back with Fangio.  Everything combined led to me, quite unfairly, characterizing Paton as another run of the mill, crony-istic good ole boy, who even if he did fire Fangio, would just replace him with someone like Mike Zimmer or Dan Quinn.  

Ultimately, nothing would change and we would enter another wasted year led by a defensive minded HC thinking it's still 1990's football, with mediocre QB play creating a bridge to nowhere.  How glad I am to have been wrong.
