656,7997,7997,Ajkrouse,"Aside from the whole ‚ÄúFire Dan Snyder‚Äù agreement, a new stadium should have:

- The ability to watch the game from anywhere along the concourse. Great sight lines to the field is key. Stadiums like Citizens Bank Park, Cowboys Stadium, Raiders Stadium, have all got great sight lines of the field from almost everywhere.

- Great local food and craft beer. Stadiums that focus on local cuisine and giving local restaurants a chance are awesome. They give a stadium personality and more food options than just the typical stadium food. Citi Field, Barclays Center, NRG Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium, etc.

- Incentive to tailgate. Stadiums with a great tailgate scene allow fans to go into the game happy. The tailgate is about camaraderie with friends and strangers and allow for a diverse set of people to come together for one common thing. Incentives could include lower parking fees for season ticket holders (free parking for season ticket holders of more than 10 years) and perhaps a points system that could be used for merchandise and other stadium experiences.

- Easy access to public transportation options. Metro and bus access is a must. Bonus if there‚Äôs boat access like Nats Park.

- Aesthetically pleasing architecture. I know this is one that isn‚Äôt talked about enough but you know a good looking stadium when you see one and it‚Äôs always because of the architecture. Camden Yards is an obvious example. The new stadium should feel like it is The National Stadium of America. Tie into the things that make the DMV great.

- The stadium needs to be privately funded. Snyder has plenty of money to pay for everything himself. Study after study has shown that stadiums are terrible public investments. The taxpayers financing them rarely want to pay for them. So why are state and local governments willing to subsidize them?

Decades of just losing is different from decades of losing, inappropriate workplace behavior, stadium falling apart, and ownership continuously fucking over the fans. Snyder grew up a fan of the franchise so most people would think, ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôll hire the best football staff and personnel so that the team has a great chance of winning since that‚Äôs what good leaders do.‚Äù Dan Snyder has been a drain on this franchise for 23 years! He took a storied franchise in a top 10 media market that was known for sellouts and as a tough place for away teams to play and made them into a franchise with the worst attendance, stadium, field, and fan experience in the country! 

I‚Äôm 37 so most of my childhood memories are pre-Snyder. I smile thinking back on the tailgates and watching games with my family and friends. Now I‚Äôm just indifferent to the team and, quite honestly, the NFL. 

Seeing the slow and painful downward spiral of this organization feels like watching the downward spiral of someone with a drug addiction. At first you say ‚Äúoh that was a small mistake. No big deal.‚Äù Then, as the years go by and the small mistakes start to add up to much bigger challenges, you grow more and more concerned about their wellbeing. You try to stop them but they just keep lying to you as if everything is under control. Eventually you start to lose control and lose your sense of caring for that person. You still love them but know that you can only lead a horse to water but can‚Äôt make them drink. 

At this point I‚Äôm married, have twins on the way, and no longer live in the DMV. Will I raise my kids to be Commanders fans? Probably not.

Also, the major reason Marshall didn't want a team in Dallas is because the Redskins were still seen by a lot of people as being the 'southern' team, as there wasn't anyone else below the mason-dixon line, and he didn't want the competition.

There was never any 'vote' to integrate the league, each team made its own decision and the Rams and other teams had already broken the precedent long before the Cowboys.

They are not comparable to the Bengals run or the current state of the Washington Football Team.

Now, as to whether Burrow is a generational quarterback, the jury would obviously still be out after just two years, but he also had one of the greatest years of any quarterback in college history, and its indisputable that he was playing at that kind of level on their playoff run.

5998,65790,65790,Garp74,"Hiya! Thanks for the reply and the insight into Tony Khan.

As for Baalke, I had no intention of coming in here and shitting on your team. I just wanted a (hopefully fun) conversation about ownership. I should have kept my Baalke opinion to myself. My apologies. 

As evidence, I assert his draft record over his career is very poor. If you think he's drafting a lot better now, I'm glad for you. But the vast majority of his picks never went on to have success on any team\[1\], and his record in the 3rd-7th rounds is remarkably bad. After he ran out Jim Harbaugh, and had full control in SF, the team turned to shit and he sported a 7-25 record.  In Ben Standig's annual agent survey, Baalke received 2 votes as the least trustworthy GM in the entire NFL\[2\]. Baalke's signing of Christian Kirk was one of the catalysts for this summer's WR market reset; in my opinion he grossly overpaid for a marginal WR. That's an opinion, of course, and we have to see how it plays out.

6004,65799,65799,Garp74,"So I have a contrary take on our schedule. My take starts with the fact that 50% of the previous year's playoff teams don't make it to the playoffs again. There's a lot of parity in the NFL still. So the basic premise is fan bases underestimate teams that improve and possibly make the playoffs, and overestimate teams that formerly made the playoffs but are regressing.

For this year, my prediction is the KC Chiefs don't make it (due mostly to a porous defense). In the same vein, I'm not relying on either Jacksonville or Detroit to be league doormats this year. (That continues to be both NYC teams this year, imho.) I think we are very likely to start the year 0-2 or 1-1 (win against Jags, but loss against the Lions who I think will have a better record than us this year).

To be clear, I hope I'm wrong. I hope we go 5-1 against our first six opponents (beat the Jaguars, beat the Lions, beat the Titans, beat the Bears, and split the games against PHL and DAL).  But I'm not holding my breath.

Question: You mention the run game. You guys add Brian Robinson. What does he bring to an offense that has two good backs already but maybe didn‚Äôt have a steady between-the-tackles element?

Answer: (First), Antonio, he‚Äôs gotten so much better. The more carries he‚Äôs gotten as a between-the-tackles runner ‚Äî you can‚Äôt run for 1,000 yards in NFL and not be that type of player. Just adding quality players to our roster. If Brian is who we think he is and continues to develop, it just takes a load off of Antonio. He‚Äôs not the only guy carrying the ball in those (scenarios). We got a guy that‚Äôs had a lot of reps in college.

Antonio, coming out of college, had 33 carries. (Robinson), that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs done. He adds a little bit of a physical element, but Antonio is a physical runner, too. He‚Äôs 230 pounds. People tend to forget that at times. And when he gets behind his pads, he‚Äôs a force, and he‚Äôs hard to tackle.

We're an expansion team and nothing that happened in Cleveland helped us with our first winning season, which took longer than OTHER expansion teams to get. We were duds for YEARS before we had a winning season.

Jags had success because Brunell was a stud, Coughlin could coach.  Ravens finally found success after years of drafting well with a front office that was in place prior to the move to Baltimore.
‚Äã
> Baltimore Ravens own their own successes despite whatever happened in Cleveland years prior. I know it's been tough since '92, but the Ravens as a franchise are successful because of what they've done for themselves.

16698,132923,132923,Professor_Nincompoop,"Overall I like what we accomplished in the draft. 

Dotson - fits our system well.  He is a refined, versatile, speedy receiver with crazy good hands and the ability to separate.  His game is very similar to Olave except he is a little smaller but has better body control.  He should be able to swap between the Z and Y positions with Curtis Samuel giving Turner yet another weapon that he can shift around pre snap in order to take advantage of defenses.

Mathis - a solid DT.  I can see why Washington had him high on their board.  He was probably third best NT behind Davis and Jones on most boards but he is more versatile than Jones and could see snaps as a 3 tech as well.   The guy was a team captain, showed consistent effort and technique and should prove to be an improvement over Payne when it comes to 2 gap responsibilities and keeping guards off of LBs.  Rivera has reportedly said that he thinks Mathis is the type of DT that can be a special sauce for this Defense and help make the LBs and Safetys better as a result. 

Robinson - I think he will lead this team in carries at seasons end.  He might not have flashy ankle breaking moves or homerun speed but he does everything well.  He is a solid, skilled RB with excellent vision, physical toughness and the ability to contribute as a blocker right away which further frees things up for Turner with pre snap adjustments.  People might have been scratching their head at this pick but Gibson fumbles way to often, has injury issues and was one of the worst starters in the league in Rushing yards over expected which weighs the impact of the offensive line.  If Robinson can improve in those areas our entire team will benefit.

Butler - I knew next to nothing about him pre-draft but Rivera and a few others certainly seem high on him.  He is clearly a plus athlete who played well coming out of a complex defensive scheme which bodes well for him transitioning to the next level.  The staff seems to think he can play all three safety positions and his ability on special teams is a plus.  

Howell - I never really saw it with this guy but as a fifth round pick it is worth a shot developing him

Turner - My expectations are very tempered with him.  He is basically a big body contested catch guy.  He doesn‚Äôt offer much as a blocker and played almost exclusively from the slot which limits him a bit but he should be able to take on a Ricky Seals-Jones type of role on the depth chart.  

Paul - he is a big ball of clay.  Tulsa does a great job recruiting top notch athletes but a shit job of coaching them up and properly developing them.  Hopefully Matsko can work some magic on him, if not he will likely end up on the practice squad.

Holmes - Another good athlete who needs to be coached up.  The team took some very safe (high floor) players with their first 4 picks and took two high upside/low floor guys in the seventh.  Our need for CB depth helps his chances of making the team.",1.0,commanders,t3_ujr4fm,False,0.0,:BurgundyW:,2022-05-06T18:23:48Z,commanders,0.0202063643066829

Kam Curl, Percy Butler, Jamin Davis, Cole Holcomb and Khaleke Hudson can all fit that role situationally and are already on the roster. 

Fuller can play nickel as well but doesn‚Äôt have the same abilities as the guys above when it comes to playing against the run.

>Well Collins is gone, and I expect the Buffalo nickel to be relegated to a sub package and most of our defensive snaps be played in a 4-2-5 nickel using a slot CB or 3rd S.

The Buffalo Nickel package is a 4-2-5 look.

There are also returner only options such as Velus Jones (Tennessee) who was an all SEC returner with 4.3 speed who could probably be had in the 6th round and less explosive options like Britain Covey (Utah) and Jequez Ezzard (Sam Houston) who can probably be had as priority free agents.  

People talking about our first round pick being used on a WR that can also fill the returner role are misguided.

Cut Landon. Restructure Ioannidis. Extend Payne, Flowers and Terry (if he's open to it). Convert most of Wentz's 2022 cap hit to signing bonus as per Bill's article from earlier.


My rough calculation of that puts us around $25-27 million in cap space.


Sign Wagner and Quandree Diggs. I'm tired of using high draft picks on defensive players. You have a defense littered with young, drafted players. Fill the remaining holes with known commodities and let's go.


Draft WR's at 11 and 47. Get Garrett Wilson and David Bell. Pair them with McLaurin, Gibson, Samuel, Thomas and McKissic (re-sign him).


Then you go out this season and tell Carson Wentz: ""Go for it. Chuck the ball all over the place and let these dudes go get it. There's no one behind you right now. We'll live with some picks, but don't be indecisive: just take the governor that Indy put on you off and throw the deep ball we all know you have in your arsenal.""


Maybe (probably?) this plan bombs. Wentz sucks. He gets hurt. Whatever. You go 5-12, you cut Wentz, you fire the whole staff and you use the 4th pick in the draft to finally get your franchise QB from a much better QB pool.


Maybe (doubtfully?) this plan works. Wentz unlocks some magic with the best receiving corps he's ever played with. The defense comes together like we thought it would last year thanks to some veteran leadership. And against an easy schedule, this team wins 10 or 11 games and beats someone at home in the first round of the playoffs.


Just give me something other than the half in/half out approach that leads to us counting on David Mayo and Dyami Brown and ultimately lands us at 8 or 9 wins.


I don't want there to be any confusion next offseason. Either this thing works and you are rolling with Wentz and a souped up offense of fast young dudes. Or it fails and you push the full reset button.

18158,146732,146732,Salty_Orchid,"Disagree. Each situation is unique and different. Should he be given a good set of conditions to succeed? Yes. But simply sitting on the bench for one or two years is not guarantee of that. The last thing we want is a Jordan Love situation when you've held back from seeing him in real NFL action and then when you finally do and realize he can't play in the league, you don't have a plan B. 

Right now this team is Wentz and as long as he is succeeding then we have no need to see Howell. This I agree with. HOWEVER, any chance that we can get him on the field in a good live action situation , we should take advantage of it. We have ZERO need to see Heinicke. We know what he can do and he is not the future of this this team. Any game in which the team has no chance of winning and there is a little time remaining, or if we have clinched the playoffs and have nothing to play for, or if we are officially out of the playoffs, should be time spend on seeing what we have in Howell. 

Heinicke is still the official #2 and can play if the season is still on the line and Wentz is hurt or is absolutely dreadful. All other situations should be for putting Howell in real NFL action.

Projected is just that....best guess. And those projections can be high for stupid reasons such as combine performance or playing at a certain school. My red flags are up on Olive and Wilson for two reasons. One, they both played on the same team. Meaning college defenses really couldn't commit to shutting down one or the other. They are catching from the best college QB in the country. And they played for Ohio State meaning they almost always had the best 11 players on the field.

\------------

""Yet deep ball accuracy isn‚Äôt good. Don‚Äôt have it in front of me but he had a worse deep ball accuracy stat than Heinike.""

Are you really starting your argument on how Heinicke is better than Wentz? Kind of nullifies any other points you have to make as no one us argues which is the better QB and that no matter what we have upgraded.

Keep in mind the stats below was Wentz playing on a predominantly run first team.

Total passing yards past the line of scrimmage thrown before completion: Wentz -1913 Heinicke - 1655

[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing\_advanced.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing_advanced.htm)

Completed deep passes +40 yards Wentz - 9 Heinicke - 6

Completed passes +20 yards Wentz - 42 Heinicke - 40

[https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/category/passing/2021/post/all/passingyards/desc](https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/category/passing/2021/post/all/passingyards/desc)

\---------

Regarding mobility helping the offensive line: ""We had that in Heinike""

Sacks and yards loss:  Wentz - 32 (227 yards)  Heinicke - 38 (278 yards)

Mobility means more than just rushng yards...its moving in the pocket and avoiding sacks. 

\--------

""On paper it looks good. But the problem is he has really good games and really bad games. Turnovers are low - sure. How about a pedestrian 62.4 completion percentage.""

You know who had really good games and really bad games this year: Mahommes, Rodgers, Burrow, Murray, Prescott. It's the NFL...what's your point. And the top completion percentage this year was 69% and this is a stat heavily altered by if a QB is a downfield thrower or collects lots of dink and dunk passes.

\------

""Otherwise if he proves to be what he most likely is, then it‚Äôs a complete waste. It‚Äôs not often a QB gets traded this much turns out to be good. Particularly when he was dumped after one year bu the coach that wanted him.""

It's also rare that a QB gets dumped not so much based on what he did on the field but bad leadership and choices. On the field stuff can't be fixed...bad decision making (assuming its nothing illegal) can be fixed.

Also, its not a waste for the franchise. If we did nothing but drafted a rookie QB, this would lock Rivera in to two more years. If Wentz bombs,we can go forward with an immediate clean sweep and reset. 

\-------

In regards to having Heinicke as a great back up ""This proves what exactly?""

This means if at any point Wentz gets hurt or nicked up, we are not pressured to keep him in. This is vital for a player with an injury or concussion history.

\-------

In regards to being a QB who is more consistent at avoiding 3 and outs. ""That‚Äôs not Wentz though""

I did a deep dive look at the number of 3 and out drives, interceptions, and fumbles by both teams for the first 10 games. You can consider these plays which demoralize a defense.   Wentz averaged 3.0.  Heinicke averaged 3.4.  

So wrong again as Wentz is an improvement in this area

You just made my point. If RG3 was another second or third round pick to be in camp along side Cousins, it would have been clear despite the need running gimmick of RG3's, Cousins was the more consistant passing QB and would have likely got the start for game 1. But because RG3 was a top round pick, we had to go all in on him. 

""You should be able to see how good a QB is at basic drills just from watching them in the pre-draft lmao that is so dumb""

You mean during the underwear olympics? Yea that's a joke. So many guys look good in college and in the combine only to completely flatline at the pro level. The only way you know for sure is by getting them into camp. There is a reason there are more first round QB misses than hits. It's all a crapshoot no matter how good they look pre-draft.

""Different players develop at different rates.""

Yes but there is a difference between developing a guy who can do the basics like completing 5 and 10 yard passes, moving in the pocket, and simply studying the playbook, vs those who can't even do these things. You can develop what already is trash. And you can't really tell what is and isn't trash no matter how good they looked in college. Therefore, the best thing you can do is bring multiple guys in. 

It's the reason why companies interview hundreds of people instead of simply giving the job to the first 5 qualified applicants.

18375,147018,147018,Salty_Orchid,"Nope not at all. Its done with other positions all the time. The first week of camp you have everyone go through basic drills. The top 3 from that move on to more advanced reps. The top 1 gets the main practice with the ones and the most promising #2 get the remaining reps. You can have that sorted out in the first month of training camp. Use preseason to firmly establish your main guy.

Now let's say we draft only one guy and put all our hopes on him...let's say his name is Haskins or something. You see week 1 he isn't the guy but you have to keep prepping him because he was a round 1 draft pick. You see in training camp he isn't the guy but you have to convince yourself he is developing. You see in preseason he isn't the guy but every rookie needs time. You see after the 1st season he isn't the guy but he its a rookie year so its okay. Cycle repeats next year. Now time to change offensive coordinators. Cycle repeats. Now you change head coaches. New system put into place. Now its 2026. No doubt this guy is not going to be good. But now 4 or 5 years later you have to start the whole process again. Its super inefficient.

Point: You can give a bad QB all the reps in the world. If you are starting with trash, you will end with trash. You have to find gold first. It can always be refined.

Look at how much time would have been spent doing it the other way.

""2- Nobody that advocates for a ceiling prospect believes that they'll all work out as picks. The idea is that if they actually fulfill their potential, you'll have a player that elevates everyone and gives you a chance to win every game.""

Totally agree. Take ceiling projects...but not in the first round. A second round QB who doesn't look like he will work out you can move off him. A 1st rounder will bring your franchise down for the next 3-5 years because no one wants to look incompetent and will try to justify the pick.

So you don't really know what invalid mean I'm guessing. Okay I'll do the hard part for you.

Let's start with Sam Darnold. From usatoday in 2017: ""One of the top prospects eligible for the 2018 NFL draft, USC quarterback Sam Darnold is working to re-tool his unorthodox throwing motion.""

How'd that work out. Next, from BleacherReport concerning Tim Tebow in 2013: ""But before another NFL team is willing to take a shot at him, and eventually give him a chance to become a starting quarterback again, he will have to improve his throwing mechanics.""

Not sure but don't think he ever got past that little obstacle.  Next. How about DeShone Kizer (who?). From Insidethepylon: ""Even with this flaw to his release, Kizer is still a very impressive collegiate quarterback with some traits NFL scouts will be drooling over when he decides to enter the draft. If he adds some refinement to his mechanics, they‚Äôll be drooling even more.""

How about 2019 draft pick Tyree Jackson (who)? From FanNation:  ""His footwork was a bit choppy and his throwing motion appears to need some refinement....Some scouts view Jackson to have the greatest ceiling of any quarterback in this year‚Äôs class but because he is so raw, he is the ultimate risk/reward project.""

Boy that sounds so familiar. Next. Also from FanNation concerning Will Grier: ""he could stand to improve his release and mechanics.""  Is he still in the league. 

Okay my smooth brane is hurting to much, so I'll just rap it up. Invalid mean the argument can't stand. In fact just a casual Google of QBs drafted with known mechanical throwing issues will show you that the LARGE majority of them can not be fixed. Which is why it is dumb to draft these QBs in the first rounds. They are projects....fliers.

And as we've seen over and over and over and over again, relying primarily on scrambling ability will hit a wall the moment you face a good defensive team. Plus over time, leg injuries chip away at that scrambling ability and the only thing you are left is whatever passing skills that QB has.

He played better as his rookie season went along, racking up four sacks, five tackles for loss and eight quarterback knockdowns over his final six games. It was fair to expect him to make a stratospheric leap last season.
Instead, it was a lost year. Young had 1.5 sacks and just four quarterback knockdowns across nine games before¬†tearing his right ACL. Advanced metrics were a little more optimistic, as Young's 18.9%¬†pass rush win rate¬†would have ranked as one of the 20 best among edge rushers if he had played enough to qualify, but he was supposed to have an star-turning season. He did not.
I'm optimistic for 2022. We have a meaningful sample of Young playing at an extremely high level, both at Ohio State and during his rookie campaign. We have a recent example of a Defensive Rookie of the Year returning from a torn ACL in his sophomore campaign to produce a big third season, as¬†Nick Bosa¬†did for the 49ers a year ago. We also have at least some reason to believe Young might be unlocked by better coaching, given that the Commanders just¬†fired defensive line coach Sam Mills¬†during the opening days of training camp.

Redskins in reference to Native Americans can definitely be said in a racist way to disparage and group a people by a physical characteristic. But it can also be used to unite a group and be a stand in for representation. 

Basically what we have here is a point of perspective. Most NAs didn't consider the term racist, but some did, I think you can see that with Latinx and other terms. But to a non NA describing someone by their skin color tends to be racist.  So if you judge how others feel from your perspective only, a term like Redskin can absolutely come off as disrespectful and bigoted. But if you judge the term by how someone else sees it, you can make a different judgment. 

A funny example I have is when I was living in Malawi referring to someone by their skin color wasn't racist at all. And part of our conversation would be to ask for the ""black price"" (local price) for a good rather than being ripped off as a tourist. The way I spoke if translated to English and put in the US would have been racist for sure, but judging my words from thr Malawian perspective it wasn't.

Gemmel and Williams said Howell's teammates often poke fun at him, as Williams said Howell orders spicy chicken during the team's weekly outing to Longhorn Steakhouse. According to Gemmel, Howell brings his own chicken fingers to team dinners.‚Äú  

On Sundays, after we get a win we have Victory Dinner,"" Gemmel said. ""We‚Äôre sitting around eating lobster and having steak, and Sam comes in and he has his chicken tenders coming around because that‚Äôs the only thing he eats.

(\*McLaurin a 3rd rounder; DK Metcalf, A.J. Brown, Deebo Samuel all picked in the second.)

Now then...

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516038253291446272?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] Both sides have some leverage in these talks. Franchise tag for the team. For the player, skipping OTA, etc.

Pushing for a trade is the ultimate leverage for the player, but nothing like that is mentioned in this report.

One interpretation is the exact opposite.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516038663045632013?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] Schefter tweets that McLaurin is showing for this initial part of the program, ""as a team leader.‚Äù Why bother showing for gym reps and X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs basics if you want out?

Don‚Äôt dismiss that quote either. It‚Äôs insight into how his side sees these negotiations.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516039009402818565?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] That worldview likely goes like this: All of these receivers are dynamic pass catchers. Terry McLaurin is more. McLaurin is on the team posters as a face of the franchise and probably the one-seed if forced to pick a single player.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516039877850288132?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] 17 is also a tone-setter, the guy coaches tell other players to emulate on and off the field. That‚Äôs different from even more established receivers like Tyreek Hill. There‚Äôs currency there. His agent will make these points.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516040318080196617?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] As for the money, the WR market exploded this offseason. It also helped define the eventual price point for these 2019 receivers. We‚Äôre not debating some massive spread on the AAV. It's in the $20-25M range AAV in terms of real figures. Good times.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516041746614001664?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] Hill reset the market with a deal that at its core is $25M AAV for 3 years. D.J. Moore AAV is $20.6M. These 2019 receivers are in between, and probably closer to the $23-24M range is my guess. Perhaps debate over years, structure, total GTD, but several new guideposts exist.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516042257929019396?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] Assuming Rivera maintains the stance of declining any trade offer for 17, only issue I see from the team side is budgetary restrictions from ownership. I asked Rivera about the lack of FA moves at the owners‚Äô meetings and he said they‚Äôre just being mindful of the salary cap. OK.

\[[Standig](https://twitter.com/BenStandig/status/1516042489068670976?s=20&t=wNl3VTtYw-9OPvAPM6tvTA)\] The team already created cap space this offseason. More coming when Landon Collins‚Äô contract comes off the books post-June 1. Any new deal for McLaurin kicks in next year, but financial planning starts now. Also, have to sign more players, and Daron Payne is up for an extension.

And Philly all comes down to Hurts. I give it a 30% chance he is actually a good qb and they are set at the position and 70% chance he stinks. He played well against bad teams.
