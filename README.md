# Commenting Behavior in NFL Team Subreddits
This is a repository for a quick, silly project of mine that started with an open-ended assignment for a graduate course in computational social science at Northwestern University. I was interested in how fans of specific NFL teams comment in their own Reddit communities compared to how they comment in the communities of fans of other teams. I was also interested in analyzing commenting behavior across an NFL season, tying traffic sentiment and distribution to team performance and league-wide events. Because this was a minor side-project only partially for an elective that was mainly focused on data collection, nothing in this repository should be mistaken for rigorous statistical analysis or representative of my professional aptitude. Most of this was written on coffee breaks at an astronomy conference, and I would do it differently if I had the time. I did, however, have a lot of fun, and I hope you enjoy it. Key plots are summarized below, and a more detailed write-up can be found here.
